# Reddit Research with Dr. Andy (Howard University)
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing one year of Reddit posts and comments to uncover time-based trends related to user activity. The goal is to understand patterns in user behavior over timeâ€”when they post, when engagement peaks, and how activity fluctuates throughout the day, week, and year.
The insights gained from this analysis will help provide a deeper understanding of user activity on Reddit and how timing affects engagement.
Analysis Goals

## The analysis will focus on identifying several time-based user activity patterns:
1. ### Peak Posting Hours
   Objective: Identify the hours of the day when users are most active on Reddit.
   Insight: Understanding peak hours for posting will help pinpoint the times when content is most likely to be seen and engaged with.
2. ### Day of the Week Activity
   Objective: Determine which days of the week see the highest and lowest activity (in terms of posts and comments).
   Insight: This can help identify if users are more active on weekdays or weekends, and if specific days show a pattern of higher engagement.
3. ### Monthly/Seasonal Trends
   Objective: Identify patterns across different months or seasons of the year. Are certain months or seasons more active than others?
   Insight: This can reveal seasonal spikes in activity or engagement, possibly correlated with holidays, events, or real-world trends.
4. ### Posting Frequency Over Time
   Objective: Track how the volume of posts changes throughout the year. Do users post more frequently over time, or is there a decline?
   Insight: This can help detect long-term trends, such as growing or declining subreddit activity, or increased posting in response to major events.
5. ### Response Time Analysis
   Objective: Measure the average time it takes for users to respond to posts (through comments or upvotes).
   Insight: Understanding response times will help determine the speed of engagement and whether it varies based on the time of day or week.

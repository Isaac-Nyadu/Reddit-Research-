20,v2jxcu,correctiontaper,"I don't know what i should do and if i should just disappear from this earth. I have a lot of reasons to 

This year started off great, like it was amazing. In class, i sat next to people i wanted to talk to and i knew that feeling was reciprocated. i was rly happy with my friends and everything felt fine. i made new friends in my class and they seemed to genuinely like me. but my seat was switched and i sit right in front of the teacher. 

so heres a list of events that led to me feeling lonely 25/8

1. No one I really knew sat near me and everyone who sat around me seemed to dislike me and never really talked to me.
2. Everyone else that i was kinda close with sat miles away from me in the classroom, they all made new friends. i can't blame them, i understand that they're really smart, funny, interesting and fun to hang out with, all of which i try to be but fail miserably at. maybe they never felt i was a friend after all, but those friends i made at the start of the year did instinctively hang out with me. so i ended up with absolutely no friends
3. I realised i don't have a friend group and i probably have differing interests from everyone. i am into startups and pop music but everyone else seems to focus on tests and other stuff that i rly suck at. one of my ""friends"" plays basketball every day but my hand-eye coordination is shit and i think he even chased me out of the basketball court once. so i don't have any group to feel comfortable with and hang out with. and everyone else has one friend group one way or another. heck, at the start of the year, someone made a group chat made up of everyone who sat at the bottom-left corner of the classroom, which is where i sit, but they didnt add me in cos reasons. when someone else added me in, they responded with ""bruh why"". and someone sitting in the centre of the classroom got added. this week has been horrendous to open instagram because everyone's hanging out in their friend group this week. and im this loser who spent all his time alone watching gaming videos in his bedroom
4. every one of the ""friends"" i made have already moved on to people smarter, funnier, more interesting and more fun to hang out with. in school, i just try to find someone to go for lunch with and im feeling rly desperate at this point. 

what should i do. i apparently can't make any new friends, no one likes me and i feel like killing myself every single day",2022-06-01 15:43:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654097136,1,/r/lonely/comments/v2jxcu/asking_for_advice/,,0,2,asking for advice

33,v2lwxk,AmIreal27,"Due to family drama before I was born I never had the chance to bond with my external family so growing up it was just me, my brother, my mum, uncle and grandma. As we got older my grandma died, my uncle became estranged and my brother developed mental issues and no longer associates with us. My mum has since moved over an hour away.

Growing up I always had a close group of friends so I never felt that alone until they all partnered up and are now leading they're own life's. 

I thought I got lucky when I found a partner and out of desperation i got married. My husband is estranged from everyone in his family and is a lone wolf who barely spends any time with me so I've found myself here at 31f spending most of my days alone. I've even tried to start my own family but have failed to get pregnant with over two years of trying.

Now I really regret my life. I always told myself that I would compensate for having a small family by marrying into a big one and I've done the total opposite. I told myself I would have at least four children and I've failed to have even one. I can't even get a dog because I'm renting and my landlord would never allow. I can't even make friends new because I'm introverted and people don't seem to gravitate towards me. 

It hurts knowing that I have so much family out there but I feel like an orphan. I'm so jealous of people with good families who get together and do things like parties and BBQs.

87,v2u8zp,Aradearn,"My family consists of divorced parents. Mother, brother, and two sisters on one side, and my father on the other. I am the youngest in my family. On my mom's side, ever since I was four or five, everyone would always play video games rather than do stuff or interact with me. I have grown up being isolated at home. My father would play with me, but going between houses every other week from when I was in 4th grade was a pain. I was constantly living two different lives. One life, where I'm at my mom's house, isolated from my family that is always playing video games, I eat the bare minimum to stay alive (frozen dinners and sandwiches that consist of cream cheese and cinnamon). My mom also lives in a quiet neighborhood where people don't really play outside. The other is where I am with my dad, who works to give me a proper breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and he would play with me. I also played with our neighbor who is the same age as me. Growing up like this was a pain. It is like reading two different books simultaneously while trying not to mix any of the details between them. Living alone like this made me introverted and isolated. At my mom's house, I would play on the Xbox. It was hard to keep friends I could always play with because I was swapping houses every week. Also, the only friend I had, had abandoned me in seventh grade saying that he never wanted to be with me or hang out with me ever again. I helped this guy in fourth or fifth grade by becoming his friend and helping him get along with others, but this is his way of saying thanks. This is when I became isolated from everyone outside my house and when I became more anxious and started to have social withdrawal. My dad moved houses around this time because of rent, so I lost my neighbor that I would always play with. From these events, I became even quieter as a person. I was initially quiet because my mom and siblings never cared about me. The most famous line the younger of my two sisters, who is two years older than me, said to me is for me to ""go die in a hole."" She probably said that to me around one hundred times. My brother, four years older than me, would always bully me at the house. This happened to me from when I was in first grade (a year after my parent's divorce) and lasted until, you guessed it, I was in seventh grade. My brother was a  junior in high school doing this. I thought seven was supposed to be a lucky number, but I guess it's only lucky for everyone but me. Oh, and by bullying me, I mean; my brother would chase me around the house, pin me to the ground to where I can't move, and take sharp objects like knives or scissors and put the blade up against my chest, my neck, or my face. Still, nobody cared about me, not my mom, nor my sisters. I've never told anyone about this until now. If the people closest to me never cared about me or what happened to me, I've always thought, who would? If you have read this far, thank you. There is so much more I could keep writing about, but I would turn this into a biography about my life if it hasn't already started to sound like one.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, I've thought of multiple ways to end my life because of how I was treated, but I never do. I even have a list of some ideas I've had. I guess the reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I don't want to leave my parents with sorrow or distress, and it isn't that I necessarily want to die. I just don't want to keep living the life I have. I want to have a happy normal life where I have normal people or friends who I can talk with or hang out with. People who enjoy me for who I am and won't abandon me once I help them with their life.

Every girl I've ever got close to has either become distant or started lying to me all the time and it's taken away the tiny amount of confidence I ever had about myself. All of this has probably not been helped by the toxic friendships that have gone alongside these. 

I'm too anxious to join any dating apps because I have literally nothing going for me, I'm not attractive, not interesting, lack all confidence and I can barely even keep friends let alone someone closer than that. I always think that I'm just not good enough in any way. Nobody has even given me a chance for some reason or another and its only made my anxiety and depression worse. There's no point trying to love someone else if you can't even care about yourself and don't look after yourself. I just don't know what to do and it just makes me feel low all the time.

I will do a summary about my old post's. I was feeling a bit lonely and all that shit you know, and some weeks ago while i was doing gymnasium with my classmates a girl talk to me and we conected a bit like she knew that i was feeling a bit bad and things so we talk, then that day ended and i kept thinking about talking to her again like saying, Hey what you said it was pretty refreshing, now i know that someone knows that i exist and all that things. But when we were suppose to talk we didn't like everyone started to talk to her and i couldn't and i felt pretty stupid, so the next day i was like ok i'll talk to her today, i'm going to say this so i don't have to write everthing we didn't talk i felt bad and had to threw up so i said to her that i would like to talk the next day that was this monday, just to make everything sorter we didn't talk i felt stupid again you can imagen how things went. And today i was going to talk to her like i had 100000 times to say hey do you want to talk but i didn't and like just thinking of not talking to her i feel remorse but today we were waiting with some of my classmates and her and i felt lonely like everyone was happy talking to her and obviously i was alone so i wanted to like go away and i was thinking that someone would notice that i mist but no one did except one of my classmates, so i was like ok this is not for me.

The only thing that i want to do is talk to her, whenever i don't do it i feel remorse and everytime that i will do it i don't so i start feeling like i'm stupid, i feel like no one cares about me again and i like the girl but she talk's to one of my ""friends/classmates"" and i think that she like's him so i don't want to go talk to her and say hey i like you and she replays with i like someone else. My problem is the only thing that i want (at least) is a frind so be his friend. So to just go to the point i feel lonely, i feel like i don't have friends, the only person that cared about me for like 5 minutos now it's just waiting for me to do the first step but i can't so i just want to cry or just vanish from the world, the thing is that if i don't talk to her in my brain i think that she thinks that i don't care about her and its you not like that it's the opossite of that i don't know what to do know some times when i imagen talking to her i'm like hey can i just hug you like at this point the only thing that i want is a hug.",2022-06-02 01:41:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648319060,1,/r/lonely/comments/v2xivd/this_daysweeks_i_been_feeling_like_a/,,0,0,This days/weeks i been feeling like a rollercoaster of emotions

130,v307cz,Pinecone_Potential,"Something weighing on my mind


I seemed to have somehow pushed all my friends away throughout my life. The ones I didn't push away, I simply outgrew. With some, I have made the decision to separate or end friendships with after weighing the pros and cons heavily for a long while. One thing that seems to be similar in all of these situations is that I've been described by nearly all my previous closest, nearest and dearest friends as being selfish, self-centered, having a God-complex, etc... this has caused me to isolate myself from others. I don't intend to be selfish or come off that way at all. I always try to give my whole self to my friends and be as supportive and accepting as I possibly can. I guess I fail at that.


Now, I notice myself asking people frequently to make plans, get together, hang out, etc... with or without kids. I crave friendship and connectedness, but I'm also wary and don't want to unintentionally hurt anyone or drag anyone down.


These plans I ask to make usually don't get planned, and if they do, they rarely end up happening. I'm beginning to realize maybe I'm not someone that people want to spend their time with. I would love to have someone to message or call when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Someone who also feels they can do the same with me when life comes at them full force. I want more than a mom friend who only wants to get together if a playdate is in the books. Sometimes I just want to talk about life with someone who isn't my husband or family. I'd love to drive around with a friend and share stories and woes about life with one another.¬†


I've always had a hard time making friends, and an even harder time keeping them. I'm truly envious of the people I know who have had lifelong friendships. All of the friend I have been closest with in my life are completely absent from my life. I don't have any friends. I have mom *friends* that sometimes I can get to meet up for a playdate, but it feels like that's the cap for it. No one wants to spend their time with me, its more about getting our kids together.


I am lonely. I want a friend. I want someone to ask me to hang out for a change. I want someone to attempt to make plans with me. I'm always the one asking others if they want to get together. Even when they say yes, it never ends up happening. It's like I have put them between a rock and a hard place so they say yes with the plan of not ever making a plan.¬†


I wish someone wanted to spend time with me.

I wish someone wanted to be my friend.

I wish someone would be more specific about how I'm selfish and why I'm not a good friend or why people don't want to be around me. I really don't get it and I feel like I give my whole self and am always the listening ear in friendships. I rarely even talk about my own life with the friends I have had in the past because they always have so much going on and I'm the one who listens and gives advice and support when it's needed.


I actively try to make new friends, make plans with people I already am acquainted with, invite people to events and other things happening. All of my attempts seem to fall short.¬†


I need a dating app for friends.¬†

They say men should grow a pair or man up but my emotions grow so much that they pop the bottle before I can smash them down to add more. I live with my grandmother and one of my cousins and  my mom sometimes. My mom sleeps on my floor on a blow up mattress in my room when she's over here and my cousin has his own room and my grandmother has her room. I hate myself I hate how I am and how I look. I hate that women look at me and laugh or run or make fun of me because of how fat I am. I am near 300 pounds and I went to the amusement park maybe the third day after it opened and went to go on some rides and I only could get on one of the ones I wanted to ride. It was embarrassing like I need to lose some weight but I'm also in a horrible living situation. I nedd to eat healthier I need to get my license and a vehicle I need to get my own place. But I'm also afraid that if I do all that I'll go mad and basically move back in with my grandmother. But I also need to lose weight and get a job but I can't do that because I don't have a reliable transportation and I live on a busy street with no sidewalk. People I've told this before say I'm making excuses but I have a valid reason would you want an employee walking to work and smell all his sweat or even get a call that he got hit by a vehicle that was going 35 to 45mph on this road and that he got killed because he was in the road. Like some of the people I talk to are like I used to walk to work and yada yada and I asked them did you walk on a busy street with no sidewalk and almost get hit by a semi or a truck or a car.

There's this lake near my house and i was thinking of driving into it. i know it's stupid. and i understand that people have a lot worse going on than me. but i feel like i'm too weak for this world like the death of my friend is really killing me....

174,v35gz3,Rskkkjj,"
Hey, so um I keep rejecting this guy I met online. We talked for over a year I think. Idk. We literally met on a discord server not kidding yall, we are both the same age just 6months differences. 
üëâüëâüëâIf you don‚Äôt want to read all, this, go to the last paragraph üëàüëàüëà

We started off as Minecraft friends, then we elevated the only texting about Minecraft to flirting online. All this stuff lead to lewd stuff and all. I didn‚Äôt actually minded it, I was fine with it. I think I got used to the attention he gave me when we did the stuff. I really like attention and stuff and he gave it to me the first 2-3 months but then idk we got both busy and stuff. 

If I had to describe myself in 5 words I‚Äôd say: overthinking, jealous, needy, egoistic and selfish. I know I‚Äôm not showing myself at my best..I always liked attention, only child, all attention to me, often got complimented etc. My parents made sure to keep me humble and stuff but I‚Äôm my head I‚Äôm like over the standard. 

You need to understand that all the time we talked to each other I kept talking about his real life and who could be his lover and stuff. It‚Äôs like erm looking if he actually liked me and he most often said, *my name* I only like you. Do you understand that? This stayed in my head, but the thing I didn‚Äôt understand that his word were just some online shit everyone say. We randomly texted each other but busy with school we answered maybe 2-3 times per months. Then we started talking again, but he was mostly talking then flirt then straight to lewd stuff. I still enjoyed it because he gave me attention but like idk how to say. 

After a little moment he started joking about getting a ticket to come see me to do lewd stuff as a joke I said yes, but I kinda didn‚Äôt thought much about a joke but more of a real relationship thing. I was asking if he was only going to come for the lewd stuff and  proceeded to tell me he wanted to Take me out on date, cuddle and watch tv show, do couple stuff. Then he kept going with his own life and family problem, I left him alone since he seemed to want to be alone and stuff, I still checked on him time to time. Then he came back, and lewd stuff started again. 

The thing is that I keep starting conversation if it wasn‚Äôt for lewd stuff, I always text first. I do everything first unless he wants something from me. I get attention only when he wants something from me and I feel like I got used to it. So to get his attention I talk about the thing and all. I feel used but at the same time it‚Äôs my fault for letting him stay in my life. Recently we added each other‚Äôs snap and all(we first talked on discord yah know). And like I know it‚Äôs bad but I used to check his localization to see if he would answer me and stuff. I understand people can be busy I‚Äôm not used to be a second choice. I get attached to fast it‚Äôs bad. Also there are another one that give me all the attention I want, I make sure to tell them I‚Äôm not interested in love since the lewd guy is still in my life. But it clearly show how if he wanted he would. The other text me every morning check up on me, we don‚Äôt even do lewd stuff just talk about life deep stuff and all. 

I recently deleted this guy I talked to from my snap because I was being overly obsess with him, I checked his localisation to see if he was active and if he would answer me. I really only want his attention but he doesn‚Äôt give it to me and I become mad over some5ing I should talk to him about. I push him away I don‚Äôt say everything in my mind, I don‚Äôt tell him my feelings. But he never ask for them. it‚Äôs only when he wants stuffs from me that he give me attention. I realized it‚Äôs bad so I deleted him, but he told me he don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm being like that. I just sound jealous and crazy.

180,v369u8,ScumRunner,"Just looking to see if anyone here has this issue.

So, for as far as I can remember I've never loved anyone, including my family. This sounds terrible, but to be clear, I absolutely wish the best for everyone in my life, try to support and spend time with them as best as I can and have lots of great platonic relationships. No issues sympathizing. (bit of guilt as I sometime have to fake some love/empathy more than I'd like)

This is becoming a problem as I'm pretty much unable to form any romantic/intimate relationships and becoming increasingly lonely. Stuck mostly with online dating. It's okay; I do have some fun, but largely end up feeling hopeless. Generally, my emotional detachment is eventually felt and things just end amicably. (aside from all the ghosting pre-date, which sucks) I'm only sometimes willing to up-play any emotional attachment a tiny bit and hope I feel something. Never do, and usually just take too long to escalate and let her become disinterested. That's not to say I'm a low-energy flirtless robot.

Most my previous relationships were essentially friends with benefits, which I think I could be happy with. However, two girls have fallen in love with me, and still feel bad that I was unable to return it. It's now been &gt;4 years since I've been with anyone at all.

My best guess is that I have some flavor of anxious attachment. When I was young I definitely felt more than average social anxiety.

I've gone to a couple therapists and was primarily treated for depression. It was definitely intertwined with lack of intimacy, but had other external reasons at the time (went back to engineering school, while working full time and part time in the Guard) I'm not currently depressed (getting there), nor on any medications.

Just going to list some stuff I've seen suggested to people in somewhat similar situations.

Don't believe I'm on the autism spectrum. Definitely sexually attracted to women with a normal sex drive; so not asexual. Pretty healthy overall. Don't think I'm any type of sociopath. Relatively successful in the rest of my life.

I donno, this just sucks and wanted to vent I guess. Was mostly trying to be descriptive with this, but I should be clear, I can't imagine that I'll ever have a meaningful romantic relationship and really don't want to be stuck alone forever.",2022-06-02 11:01:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1374383553,3,/r/lonely/comments/v369u8/35m_have_never_loved_anyone_at_all_makes_intimate/,,0,7,"(35M) Have never loved anyone at all, makes intimate relationships impossible."

Nobody even gives a flying fuck about me and even if I try to talk or initiate something they may talk for a minute and quickly go elsewhere again putting me back in the dark.

 Isn't love and affection and someone who can love u unconditionally something that every human being deserves. Isn't some amount of dignity and care from others without being isolated and secluded and being treated like a degenerate something that every human needs ro survive. Then why does everyone call me entitled when I yearn for these things. If you are telling me I don't deserve these bare essentials aren't you also telling me I don't deserve to live? So do u think I should just dissapear.

 I've always wanted to take that path down incel highway but I know I'm better than that. Everyone even in that group is just called entitled little pussies when most of the people in there are just lonely teenagers who have never felt love in their lives.

198,v39tad,FadedOnline,"I'm off work this weekend but I have mixed feelings. On the one hand of course time off work is needed, especially with how busy my work is right now, it's important to recuperate. But on the other hand when you have no one to spend it with, it also makes you feel blue. The weather is warmer, people are out more, including a lot of happy couples and although part of me is happy for them, another part of me feels resentful. Anyone else ever felt lonely since the day they were born? Sure you have friends and family but it's still (for me at least) always felt isolating. You'd think by this point I'd be used to it but some days it really hits you harder than others. I've had brief relationships throughout my life but never anything past one year. Literally a decade later and I still feel the same; lost and disconnected. Sometimes I can't help but think maybe it'll always be this way. I'm in my 30s now and sometimes I feel like I've missed the boat and the good days are truly over. People tell me I am attractive but I know my issue is I can be awkward at times (especially talking to really attractive people) which puts people off. I know it's a skill talking to people and I know I have to put in the effort to make this change, but holy F lately I've had zero motivation to learn anything new. I do consider myself lucky and fortunate. I have a job, food to eat and a roof over my head. I am grateful because I know how much harder some people have it. But some days I just can't help but feel so down in the dumps because it feels like as time goes on, more and more people slip away from your circle while making new connections just seems harder and harder. I've had a couple of random negative encounters with strangers on the street these past few months which had added to my paranoia and feelings of being undesirable. I am skeptical of therapy but I figure I should at least try it before dismissing it. Everyone has issues but not everyone bothers to deal with them. Anyway, this is just another venting post. Despite all this BS, a small part of me is still hopeful. Not just with being in a meaningful relationship but connecting with others more. They say your vibe attracts your tribe, so I'm hoping my vibes will resonate eventually. I know a lot of us here in this thread are dealing with similar issues. I don't have any real solution but I guess what I'll say is, keep that little bit of hope alive. You're not alone in feeling alone. And to anyone who read this, I wish you all the best and success in the world.

I can't make a connection with anyone, i just feel so fucking miserable all the time, i feel like i live on a different plane of existence, and i'm not saying this as a ""i'm much cooler than you lul"" way, i'm saying it as in everyone talks a different language and laughs at different jokes while i'm just staring at everyone.

It's practically impossible, there was one single exception, but that was the exception that proved the rule because i don't have that friend anymore, and i wonder if i'm burnt out from that or i just can't make friends, i've never had any friends other than that one.

I can't even do that thing where people get made fun of for, you know the ""donate to a person on twitch to feel like you have a connection""? Yeah that doesn't work either, i can't find someone i can actually connect with on a personal level.

Oh right, i found out a while ago that i'm actually schizophrenic, and i'm not able to properly control my emotions and thoughts for some reason, it's not ""cool"" or ""quirky"" it's horrible and it sucks ass and sucks all the life out of me, i'm super depressed and shit sucks.

Now let's just get some arguments out of the way

""You don't need food. All you need is yourself.""

This is what the argument sounds like when you switch loneliness for hunger.

""You have schizophrenia? I have super Extra ADHD and bipolar multi made up disorder!""

Don't one up someone with a mental illness, that's not a fucking competition and it's not ""cool"" to have something.

I hate mental illness and i hate that i'm mentally ill, it has ruined so many things in my life and i'm suffering, it's not a fucking wave of trends to ride on.

How the fuck did we move from ""toughen up there's no such thing as mental illness"" to ""what flavor is your mental illness today?"" I'd love to be treated nicely/with care because i'm not the same as everyone around me but being treated well is different from being enabled.

I was going to take some leave to see family I haven‚Äôt seen in a few years but my performance at work led me down the path of not going. Now I‚Äôm considering just entirely dedicating my life to working. Nothing outside, just work. I‚Äôve given tinder and bumble a good long run. Had one or two actual matches but nothing that lasted. All of the guys I know tell me ‚Äúyou could pull so easily dude‚Äù and all of the normal try to pick my spirits up thing. But I know it‚Äôs not the truth. I‚Äôm short, I‚Äôm skinny (almost anorexic if anything), stopped working out, don‚Äôt have the money to do the things I want. Any time I have off I spend lulling or running away from my emotions.

338,v3spot,throw11away818,"i‚Äôm nearly at the end of high school with no clear goal of what i‚Äôm doing and what i‚Äôm going to do. my entire high school life was absolute garbage. my parents made me switch schools about three times, and within that time, i became extremely socially anxious and lonely. when i came back to high school three years late, it was almost crippling. i was alone, i couldn‚Äôt talk to anybody, it was to the point that i was afraid of talking even in a classroom setting. i tried making friends, i tried talking to people, but i just looked like a moron. those who would talk to me, it was like they talked to me out of pity.

at first, i never cared. i was alone for the past 3 years anyway. but as i settled into an actual high school setting, i became increasingly jealous of the friend groups, the fun they had, how people could talk to eachother and laugh. 

fast forward to the now, i spend my entire day alone. i sit alone, eat alone, and go home alone. i live with my family, who have basically stopped caring about my academics, or anything i do, as i‚Äôm no longer the well achiever that they hoped me to become. my grades are average

i feel tired, super tired all the time. i look forward to sleeping. i sleep as much as i can, even with that, i feel tired all the time. i sometimes take 2-3 energy drinks a day, i still feel tired. i always feel tired. my frail body always has some sort of pain in it somewhere. i don‚Äôt have any eating problems, i think. when something negative happens, something that would have made me cry three years ago happens, i don‚Äôt even cry anymore. i just feel empty, i just don‚Äôt care. even though i love sleeping, i stay up until 1 am binging some show or something. i just don‚Äôt care about anything anymore. and when i finally go to sleep, i just think about having someone to talk to. 

i don‚Äôt know what i want to do. i have no ambitions, goals, or dreams. i used to, not anymore.

343,v3tdzn,EntertainmentNo5547," I‚Äôve never had a real relationship with anyone. Not even friendship. The person who I would buddy up with would always end up talking shit about me behind my back. Then everybody else would bully me because I‚Äôm smaller and skinnier than the average person my age and sex. I told my family about these issues and I was told I need to stop manipulating people. Here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt think I am, and if I am then how the hell do I stop? Currently I‚Äôm out of state working for my aunt and uncle, I need to go back to Tennessee to do court but I‚Äôm scared i‚Äôll get arrested because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good manipulator‚Äù -mom 2022 (even though I did NOTHING ILLEGAL!!!!!)
I‚Äôm also scared to talk to anyone because I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. Every friend group  I‚Äôve been in I‚Äôve either been the minority of it or they were just talking shit about me behind my back as I said. Since I‚Äôm out of state working at The Hey Farm in Alabama I‚Äôve made pretty good friends with my co worker but she‚Äôs like 31 so it‚Äôs kinda weird. I‚Äôm also friends with the owner of a record store back in Tennessee but he‚Äôs 26. What do I do!!!!! I‚Äôm not really allowed to talk to anyone over the phone unless it‚Äôs family.

Anyway what do I do??? I also have a need for physical touch because I never had that as a little kid and I never had a father figure so every man I get to know or am related to I just want them to be a father figure to me. I have nobody to talk to other than my co worker Kristen but if I talk to her about my struggle with all the jobs and issues I have I‚Äôll be seen as lazy and I get paid for these jobs! How do I fix touch starvation on my own. My weighted blanket got left in Mississippi so I can‚Äôt use that. How do I not feel physically and mentally alone? I could always quit all three jobs and get a job at Ike‚Äôs Beach Service which my uncle owns so I will definitely get a job there. Also, I‚Äôm too young to even have a job but I worked on the beach last year with my uncle and got paid. The Hey Farm is more fun to work at though. This is why you don‚Äôt give kids jobs.

383,v3zh1s,Substantial_Cash7686,"My boyfriend and I have dated for 3 years now. Like any couple, we‚Äôve had our fights and put pieces of our minds out there. 

Our fights seem to be over the same thing with me concluding in the end that I ask for too much and how unsatisfied I am with him. Its come to a point that I tell him I feel like I am just telling him to be a different person completely. 

I have this philosophy that if you aren‚Äôt already naturally into something, you shouldn‚Äôt force it. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like a lot of things to the point that I tell him that our lives don‚Äôt compliment each other. 

Some examples like I wake before 6am everyday because I‚Äôm have insomnia. Waking up early and doing productive things around the house while he sleeps in bed. Kinda annoys me because as soon as he wakes up, he wants to do things with me like work out when I already worked out, or smoke some greens when he‚Äôs done nothing productive. 

I really do feel like his mom sometimes because, ironically, he can‚Äôt do anything alone. It has been 3 years since he dropped out of school, and he doesn‚Äôt have a natural ambition to want to finish school for himself. It has came to a point that his whole family has to ask him to finish his degree. It took multiple fights till I got him to start rolling his mind in the right direction of finishing school; not only for his family, but for himself and for the sake of our relationship. 

I had to put my life in hold as I wait for him to take action. He doesn‚Äôt take action until someone nags at him to do so. It makes me feel like a fucking parent! I don‚Äôt want to feel that way. 

Because I feel like my damn boyfriend‚Äôs mom, it really does make me feel alone‚Ä¶ 

Im basically the girl who‚Äôs only friend is her boyfriend and I fucking hate that with a burning passion. 

What‚Äôs even more ironic is how we live lowkey in the middle of nowhere. The closest store is 20 minutes away, so there is nothing to really walk to. The only way out is freeway, and I have been trying to be better at driving alone, which is also hard.

405,v436yj,Top-Effective3617,"Hey.
I'm not feeling so lonely, lately. I'm introverted, and an Infp. A psychologist of mine refers to me a a 'super feeler'. I was raised rough and find myself to be a middle aged man with issues around intimacy, abandonment, connection etc. I spent years yearning for love or a partner. In all that time, I was looking outwards for solace, instead of inwards for self-awareness. Buddhism helped me see that.
I'm still solitary, with a very small circle, and am still not romantically involved, but it's less urgent.
I meditate a lot. I meditate on acceptance, empathy, and on self esteem. This hasn't brought solace for my yearnings; it's helped me see how my yearnings were taking up too much bandwidth to actually deal with the empty inside.
I've been in relationships and felt alone; I've been on top of mountain passes, by myself, and felt connected to everything.
Even though there are times when I will still feel isolated and lonely, I realize that lonely is a state of mind and not a state of being. Often when I feel the most lonely, I know for me that it's connected to depression which i can manage. Neoplasticity is a thing; if we change our outlook, we can change our brains. Changing one's thinking is hard, but the pay off in well-being is worth it.

422,v45e0b,TechnicalFig6725," Trigger warning:drugs,alcohol
At the start of the year, a close friend of mine invited me to hang out with her friends.
Later on we all got into a big friend group. It was fun at first but became horrible as it went on.
As i said in the title, we went to alot of parties but i was the only one not drinking,vaping or smoking cigarettes and drugs (which btw i got made fun of alot), as the parties went on i became a babysitter and couldnt have fun anymore since i had to babysit my drunk friends.
2 friends of this group cut me off for pretty stupid reasons.
I never cared about those people but at that time i liked to suffer but be with friends all the time rather than being alone.
Until i got into a huge fight with the girl who kept me the part of the friendgroup (because ive lost contact with the other 2)
She snitched and told my school therapist about my mental health problems with another school friend who knew about that. The girl decided to lie to me and everyone saying she didnt snitch on me. (Even tho later on her friend adimtted she did).before that she liked to try to manipulate (never worked) and make me seem the worst all the time.
Long story short, we lost contact and she ruined my name.none of people in my friendgroup talks to me even when before that happend they always used to talk to me and be happy when they see me.
The only ones i got left after are my mutual friends with her, which ofc because of her i cant go to any hangouts since they know we cant be around each other.
And even when the teacher asked her where was i , she replied with ""we are not friends so i wouldnt know"". That made everyone gossip and ask why, which ofc she replied with talking about my mental health problems.
I know she wasnt a good friend, and the friend group wasnt a good enviorment. But even my best friend of 3 years left me without saying anything.when a little before that she used to call and text she misses me because we dont talk alot. Now i cant even get her to see my messages.
I never thought id be in this point of my life again, especially not for the 3rd time in 8 years.
I dont do anything but scroll on social media and play video games now. (And workout) 
Nothing seems to get my situation off my mind.

Why can all my friends have a ""one person in particular"" they can talk about but I can't? Why can't I be seen as a special and valuable person to talk to instead of someone that's only being talked to in order to fill an empty void?

I don't want to be a second choice anymore. I want to be seen.

I was fat, my family was overprotective of me and I was bullied at school, both of which generated my anxiety. I did not understand the reasons why they overprotected me, and my child's mind only saw it as being pushed away for no reason. which is why I just decided to stay away from everyone at school too, my neighbors always asked me if I was going to go out and play, and I always refused because of my fears. I was alone, and this did not affect me so much in my childhood, but as I grew up I felt lonely and sad, I saw how other people my age had friends and a partner there was a time when I decided to be different, I didn't want to be alone anymore and pretended to be someone else, I thought I had made a few friends, but in the end I realized that they didn't care about me, they weren't looking for me and I isolated myself again They clearly never tried to contact me again. It was very hard for me, I made up my mind that if even pretending to be someone else I couldn't make friends, then my destiny was to be alone forever. I isolated myself again and later, at age 15, my anxiety became stronger, I couldn't exchange a word with anyone because I began to tremble and feel more nervous than ever, I pretended to be angry all the time so that no one approached me and so on. prevent them from making fun of me at all costs, when deep down what I wanted most was someone to talk to. I lived my whole life thinking about what they will say, when I turned 18, I started taking therapy, and everything started to improve, I started exercising and at the same time I met the girl who is my girlfriend today, my life took an unexpected turn, I didn't imagine having a partner in the near future, anyway, now I'm happy, but I still have traits of my social anxiety, my girlfriend has friends and I worry more that she's going to leave me or change for someone with mental stability and emotional, even though all the time she reminds me that she loves me.I find it hard to believe it sometimes because I start thinking about the worst and I feel insufficient for her...
I had to drop out of school for a while, the last time I went to school I still had my anxiety, in a few months I'll go to university and I don't know how I'm going to face it this time, I'm afraid of being alone again and not be able to make friends. I find it hard to understand the intentions of others and sometimes I don't know what is right or wrong to say or do and I am afraid that they will think that I am weird again and exclude me, but I am learning to socialize, precisely because I don't want to be alone, but sometimes I'm afraid that I'm going to screw everything up again.
I want to be positive, but I still suffer from my past, I have not been able to overcome it and it makes me feel like I am going to be alone again.
but even so I have faith that this time it will be better, and I will have a few friends at least.

I dont have a job, I study my degree online and live in a small city so I dont have many opportunities to meet new people.
 
Is just so heartbreaking, to have no one to share feelings or experiences with. I just wanna go in a walk with a friend in a warm summer night and talk about everything and nothing and laugh too loud when the street is silent. 
Dont get me wrong, I love my own company, I am not the type of person that is scared of doing things on their own. I go to the cinema, to concerts in other cities, to the library I dont care, if I want to do something I will, alone or not.

   We were at the place for 4 hours and the whole time I just walked alone watching everyone having fun and laughing with their friends and all I could do was cry all I could see was me the person who I used to be. That used to be me laughing with my friends but everyone‚Äôs fucking gone it hurt when my friends left but when my cousins left it hurt so bad my heart felt like it just dropped. We said we should move in together we were so fucking close I was so close with everyone and now it‚Äôs just me. We would do everything together my best friends were like my sisters and so were my cousins but their all gone. They‚Äôve replaced me it hurts so bad, it hurts knowing it‚Äôs all gone ill never get that shit back. And even if I do I won‚Äôt be happy. It‚Äôs been like that for 3 years now and it just keep on getting worse my social anxiety ruined my life and on top of that sadness which destroyed it. I can‚Äôt tell you the last time I‚Äôve felt genuinely happy. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. My heart literally aches it feels so heavy my heart rate is always high  it feels like my body‚Äôs constantly in a panic every step I take feel‚Äôs heavy sometimes I can‚Äôt bring myself to make it out of bed or clean my room. Nothing helps. I thought maybe I was sad because I was lonely but no someone sat down to have a convo with me and all I wanted to do was cry this deep sadness stronger than my regular sadness hit my body in waves. Tried talking to people online it didn‚Äôt help I just cried the whole time behind the screen. Is this not what I wanted what the fuck is  wrong with me. I got compared to someone that I said I would never want to be I would always say that I would never be them when I was younger and my mother said I‚Äôm like them. She‚Äôs disappointed in me she said she wish she could sell me, I saw the text I saw it all and each time it crushes my heart I also use to be very close with my mom and look at that even her I even disappointed her. That hurt the most seeing the things she said hurt. I‚Äôm so fucking tired I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I can‚Äôt. 
  last year I wanted to end things but my anxiety stopped me and I knew that all I would do is mess up her life even more I knew how much that would hurt her and I couldn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs always been like this. I‚Äôve felt this before.I remember holding a knife to my stomach at the age of 7 crying wanting it all to be over. Looking at the pills on the table  the razor blades just imagining it all being over. People say it gets better, that‚Äôs the biggest lie I‚Äôve heard someone tell me, because it only gets worse for me.

458,v4agfv,KrombopulosTunt,"I'm like past the point of no return now. You know when cats are about to die and they like either leave entirely and die alone or they pick a spot to die in? I have this sinking feeling that I'm there.

I just have nothing to lose anymore. I found out my girlfriend of two years was cheating on me last November and it's been one hell of a healing process but I got there! I did so well and got over her and was ready for something new, only something new never came along.

I've tried tirelessly to make friends as I have none, I've tried tirelessly to fit in at work. My manager told me that I'd been difficult to talk to in my last one to one so all that effort has clearly had no effect. I feel detached from a job that I had such a raw passion for. My probation review is coming up and I'm scared I won't pass it because I've been difficult, I've basically got a month to learn how to not be a terrible person at work, when I'm already exhausted from the lack of success in making friends, finding someone to give my endless capacity for love to. All for nothing. 

In the past 6 months I have tried so many times to try and create a life out of nothing. I've failed. I've sunken so much of myself into this, to heal, to grow, to experience and to learn, just like everyone has told me to. And yet, nothing. I'm sick of this song and dance, this constant self improvement this constant effort within me, this drive to improve because I've been doing it for so long now and I'm all out of juice. Pretty soon I'll have lost all motivation and that'll be the end of me.

Honestly? I welcome it. I can't do this anymore. I've tried so hard to be myself. I finally got a tattoo, I've learned other forms of self expression. I've steeped into a style and owned it. Yet again, nothing. I don't belong anywhere, this 6 months has proven it.

I keep seeing them cuddle up together and hearing them.laughing and giggling and its making me die inside. When me and my ex first met up, we were originally going to go traveling in my stepdads RV together. It ended up falling through so we just stayed at a hotel together but it was simple magical. We keep saying we were going to go across the US together and just explore in general. We split up last November and i haven't heard from them in a month and i can't stand the loneliness. They were my first proper love and my first kiss and everything. The best feeling ever was when i woke up after our first night together and seeing her cuddling me, i had dreamed about that moment for just over 3 years and having it finally happen was beyond perfect. I haven't been kissed, cuddled or even hugged in close to 7 months and it's killing me.

All i want is to go over to the US and hold them or just hear her voice. Her voice is so fucking beautiful and i hate not hearing it. I hate not waking up to her cuddling me, i hate not being able to hear her giggle or just be in her presence. Life is so fucking shit without her i can't do it

The beach I'm at rn is where we both had our first kiss together and its usually the only place that makes me feel anything. I can also see the city lights (check out the song by MIW) where i first picked up at the airport and where we first hugged irl. 

Hearing the waves hit the walls here along with the rough idling of my bike and the window making a flag wave, it's beautiful.

I have always been a bit of a lonely person. I don't always know how to interact with others or develop healthy friendships.

My friend is planning a Bachelorette party. I though it would be just her and I. She just asked me to give her a list of all of my other friends. I literally have no one else. No coworkers, classmates, or old friends that I can think of. I haven't responded go her because I don't want to be embarrassed when I say, it's just us.

I really don't know how things got like this. I had a medium sized friend group in high-school, but college, and then work came around and I never made any new friends. Instead I just slowly lost the ones I had one by one.

I tried joining fitness classes and art classes to meet people, but I just find myself constantly alone.

so i've always struggled with making friends, but throughout my education i have generally had at least a couple of friends at any one time, a few close.  after leaving school, however, i've ended up with essentially nobody around me (through a mixture of petty drama, moving counties twice and nose diving a couple of times into depression). the problem is: i have acquaintances, that i could probably hang out with if i wanted to, but i feel like i have higher standards than this so i won't.  i don't know if i see friendship as more important than other people, but it FEELS like i want friends who i deeply care about and deeply care about me, who share my core values, whereas most people are happy just buddying up with anybody.  i want something more from my friendships than what i would get with the people i vaguely know and could meet up with if i wanted, so i don't meet up with anyone at all. 

this makes me feel weird, because i don't know if i'm just seeing this all wrong and i should be happy with who i'm given in terms of community.  but i have tried, and i'm not.  i crave closer companionship, i crave camping together alone in the woods without it being awkward, i crave creating art together, platonic physical affection and crying on each other's shoulders.  but i've never quite found it.  and i don't think i'll ever be okay settling for less.

i'd like to know if anyone else feels like this!

598,v4p330,Jurez1313,"I woke up two hours early this morning. In a bit, I'm going to get dressed, go downstairs, pretend everything is ok and eat breakfast with my mom while watching gentleman jack. But in the past 2 hours, all I've been trying to do is distract myself from how lonely and miserable, isolated and hopeless I feel.   

In trying to distract myself, naturally I got a little frisky. My go to is audio roleplays, and I stumbled across one that piqued my interest. It starts with the speaker in a bath, inviting the listener to join them. Then, encourages the listener to breathe deeply, and repeat some affirmations. This is where I started to get a little emotional, as repeating things like. ""I am proud of myself"" and ""I like what I see in the mirror."" is really hard when they couldn't be farther from the truth.  

However, then I was encouraged to picture my ten year old self. And sure enough, with my eyes closed, there he was. Chubby little guy with big brown eyes, dorky little spectacles, jean shorts and a nerdy shirt. And I recognized an emotion in his face: fear. Pain. I was told to hug him, and imagine what he most think of me.  

I am such a disappointment to my ten year old self. But at the same time, when I pictured him, and thought of myself hugging him, we both wept. My inner child wept out of fear, anxiety, loneliness, isolation and pain. And I, a thirty year old man, wept as I held a child, because I knew what pain he was in, and I felt powerless to help him feel better.  

I also know that three years later, when I'm thirteen, I will have experienced some of the most overwhelmingly intense bullying and exclusionary behaviour of my life.  

I don't know why I'm sharing this. I didn't even finish the audio. I wasn't frisky anymore. Just confused, and sad. I've spent the last twenty years of my life trying to ignore the pain, isolation, and hopelessness I've been experiencing since I was ten years old. Trying to wash it away with drugs, both prescription and illicit. Trying to put a Band-Aid over it by paying for the company of women, or spending hours and hours listening to audios of women pretending to care about me, so that for a little while, I can feel just a bit less lonely.  

But inevitably, the feelings return to the surface. Never quite leaving, but sometimes buried under a mound of distractions and coping mechanisms I've built over twenty years of suffering. But they are no longer enough to keep the overwhelming sadness at bay.  

I have MDD, PDD, GAD, ADHD, and BPD. Likely PTSD from a minor abuse incident at the hands of a peer when I was a child. I don't for the life of me know how I'm supposed to cope with all of that. How I'm supposed to live a normal life. How I'm supposed to be happy, when my brain is doing everything in its power to remind me that I'm not allowed to be. That there's barely anyone in my life that cares about me, and I will genuinely never meet another person who does, or will do.  

All I've ever wanted, since I was old enough to know it was even possible, was a romantic relationship. But coming to terms with the fact that this likely will never happen for me... Facing my inner ten year old who's frightened, alone, and already so hopeless... And knowing I've disappointed him by not giving him anything he so desperately craved, despite my best efforts... It's very, very hard to see how I will ever feel any better. How my life could ever improve in such a way that I will stop feeling even 50 percent of the strength of these negative emotions.  

Why, then, should I even continue to bare the weight of this load any longer?",2022-06-04 13:39:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,2,/r/lonely/comments/v4p330/feeling_so_alone_and_hopeless_i_sobbed_like_a_baby/,,0,0,"Feeling so alone, and hopeless, I sobbed like a baby."
599,v4pogm,kalyanred,"a year ago, my girlfriend broke up with me after a 10 years relationship. I have been on antidepressants since then, but still struggle with depression and most important loneliness. I have a few friends from high school and some old roommates (which are my friends) with which I chat online, but I never felt so disconnected with everybody. 

I used to be connected only with her. the day she left me, I didn't lose only my girlfriend, but my best friend also. 

now I am 29 years old and I feel that at this age is very hard to connect with someone or to find love again. because of antidepressants I also gained some weight and I feel like no one will ever like me, or feel attracted to me. 

I am trying to get used to being alone, trying to connect with myself at least, but that seems hard also. I have seen every video on how to overcome loneliness, or how to get over someone, but it doesn't help that much.

606,v4rpgs,littlefroggydreams,"Living in the Bible Belt has left me with practically zero friends...or maybe it's the fact that I'm an adult, and it's simply harder to make friends as an adult because everyone is preoccupied. More than likely, it's a combination of the two. 

If you haven't guessed, I'm a woman in my 20s living in the Bible Belt, and it sucks because the only two ways to make friends here seem to be through church and school. Well, I'm currently on a gap year, and I would be hard-pressed to go to any church considering I'm not religious. Even my therapist admitted that it's hard to make friends without one or the other when I told him I was lonely. I haven't met many people around here who seem to have the same issue as I do, mostly because they are either in church and/or school.

I guess the only ""way in"" I have left is work, but I'm not the type of person to get cozy with my coworkers. I don't feel comfortable doing so; it feels unprofessional at best, and at worst, I worry that I might place too much trust into the wrong person. Then what? I don't want to feel ostracized at work. It's difficult enough to be here without having my coworkers gossiping about me. Call me paranoid, but I just won't do it. Besides, it's not easy anyway. Everyone this age has lives, has things going on. People can hardly keep up with their personal lives let alone worry about introducing someone new into the mix.

I don't know. This isn't really a rant. This isn't really a sympathy grab. I don't know what this is. I guess I'm just looking for someone who can relate.

That made me feel horrible, and as a result I decided to isolate myself completely.

It wasnt an IRL relationship but an online one. Its all the same if you ask me, if you truly love someone whether its online or in person, if there is a connection then that‚Äôs that.

We started off as friends, then best friends and one way or another we were in a relationship. I was the happiest ive ever been, the most motivated person ever. But that all changed almost 2 weeks ago when she suddenly stopped talking to me and started saying she has no time anymore. 

How can you go from saying ‚Äúi am attached to you and youre in for a ride‚Äù or ‚Äúim so lucky to have you, im so lucky that we met‚Äù or ‚Äúi love you and i miss you wake up, i missed your voice‚Äù how can you go from that to blocking me (on whatsapp. We mainly used discord to text and call) and not saying anything to me?

What did i do wrong to her? I keep asking myself that, i keep going back to our chat, i read and i read but i find nothing. I go back to our phone calls but it was all sweet talking and talking about our future plans and our life‚Äôs together. What we wanted in life. 

 The past 2 weeks been hell on earth, ive been having heartaches, i tear up every hour or so, i cant watch our favorite show anymore because it reminds me of her (she used to sing along with the intro and it was the most adorable thing ever) whatever i do it reminds me of her, i see a funny tiktok i laugh and her laugh comes to mind. I see a human smile, i picture her smiling (her smile brightened my day everyday) her voice calmed me down, she being in my life kept me sane. I loved her unconditionally. When she needed help, i helped her without a second thought. I was the best version of my self when she was around. I felt i was the smartest when she was around (she was very intellectual and handy, i loved that) i miss her craziness, i miss her voice, i miss her brains, i miss her laughter and jokes. Most importantly i miss my friend, my best friend and my lover.

Every relationship ive had at this point, I was the one putting in the effort, I was the one texting first, asking if they were ok, making sure they were happy. Nobody did anything. At All. The only people who‚Äôve cared for me outside of my family were the people who were crushing on me, but to be honest. I was never used to that. Anybody outside of my family who cared about me, i did not know why they did. I wish i felt the same but i hate that i dont feel the same about them, i really wish i could feel the same.

697,v52mxx,catsarethebest56,"I‚Äôve just recently made a few online friends, so I‚Äôve been a lot less lonely than usual. I had spent a few years prior with no friends at all. This has been a nice change of pace. 


The issue I‚Äôve come across though, is that Im really insecure about my friendships. I‚Äôve had issues like this in the past. The put it simply I‚Äôm constantly worried that I‚Äôll lose all my friends. That I‚Äôll fall out of touch and lose contact with them. Luckily I talk to them almost daily, so I can distract myself from the anxiety. 


But of course, just my luck, Im going on a family vacation for about 3 weeks. I don‚Äôt have any way of contacting my friends, so now I‚Äôll be pretty alone for the whole trip. I‚Äôve been away for only a couple days, and I already feel really lonely. I feel so silly over this, it has been 2 days and I practically want to jump off a cliff. I‚Äôm not sure how well I will be able to manage over the next few weeks. I feel really guilty as well, some people have no friends at all. I feel like I should be more grateful than I act over this. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Im extremely grateful for my friends and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without them. I‚Äôm just really missing them I guess. 



All of this is also fueling my anxiety over my friendships. I‚Äôm so worried that when I come home I will have lost my friends. I doubt I will, but it‚Äôs hard to tell myself to just stop worrying.

708,v53rh7,what_a_geek_,"I do want to clarify, I‚Äôm not suicidal, just in a really rough spot in my life that I‚Äôm working to get through.

I am a 20 year old woman who‚Äôs really mentally and emotionally exhausted. I realize that I‚Äôve practically been alone my entire life. It didn‚Äôt really occur to me until I turned 20. I have a mom, a dad, and three older brothers. I‚Äôve had a pretty okay relationship with my parents growing up and spent quite a bit of time with them, but I‚Äôve never really felt close to them emotionally and I feel like I have to filter myself a lot around them and I never get to be 100% myself. I‚Äôm not close with my three older brothers and I never really was. They‚Äôre significantly older than me (4-11 years older than me) and they‚Äôve always had a special bond with each other because they‚Äôre ‚Äúboys‚Äù and ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù and they‚Äôve always excluded me out of that.

I didn‚Äôt really have friends outside of school. When I was in school I always had people to hang out with during school, but I didn‚Äôt hang out with them outside of school and I didn‚Äôt have any friends outside of school. I spent a lot of time by myself at home. I have to admit, I‚Äôm not entirely upset about all of this. All of this loneliness I was surrounded with helped me to develop a great sense of creativity and imagination. I‚Äôm still pretty imaginative to this day, I‚Äôm always lost in daydreams. Of course, it sucks when you‚Äôre 20 years old and you realize you‚Äôve spent most of it daydreaming.

Making friends has always been difficult for me. I‚Äôve always thought I was friends with people and then I‚Äôd find out they didn‚Äôt like me as much as I liked them. I became fairly depressed in high school. I had some friends in school, but none of them really reached out to me outside of high school except for a few. I was a part of many clubs at my school, but no friends. I cried the night I graduated from high school bc I realized I spent 14 years at that school district and had no friends from it.

I made some pretty good friends outside of high school and it was really cool. We were pretty close bc we were all at home bc of Covid-19 so we all texted and called a lot. Once things began to return to normal, they all stopped texting me except for 2 of them. But recently both of these people basically stabbed me in the back and now I‚Äôm completely friendless and have been over 4 months. I‚Äôm not close with my family even though I live with most of them so there‚Äôs that extra layer of loneliness and isolation. I‚Äôm currently in therapy, but that‚Äôs just one hour of my week and I‚Äôm alone most of the time. It just really fucking sucks some times.",2022-06-05 02:20:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653866951,5,/r/lonely/comments/v53rh7/im_20_years_old_and_not_okay/,,0,2,I‚Äôm 20 years old and not okay.

715,v540c8,[deleted],"34 year old female here! I truly believe I do not have a soul mate‚Ä¶ every time when I make a connection, they always  leave . 

For me, and maybe to you as well, the reader, it is hard for me to find a connection to others in this world. 

I am different, like most humans on this planet. I have done well to keep a balanced ‚Äî hmmm‚Äî- yin to my yang so to speak. Every bit of light in me, darkness matches it to full extent. I am extreme, loud, energetic, quiet, lazy and would rather sit in a bath tub and eat cookies over jumping out of an airplane . I am an Aries go getting conquerer with a happy go lucky attitude. Just do not rub my horns the wrong way, I have a hot headed temper to match. I am loving, kind, always willing to help, but I am also reserved, wary of new comers who likes to keep the peace, while smashing your face into the ground. 

I basically have a lot of emotions going on all at one time. All the time. 24/7, 365 days a year. I am one of those wretched people who TRIVE on 5-6 hours of sleep. No more . No less. 

I am a morning person who looooves to stay up late. I raise every. Single. God damming. Morning at 4am, (give or take) and watch the sunrise. Hell, I love staying awake for 24 to 48 hours to greet the sun and then turn around to star gaze at night. 
I have always been this way. I am either all go go go go ‚Äî or stopped dead. Grey areas are very small for me. It‚Äôs either yes or no - rarely a maybe. 
I give great advice, either life, love, friendship, death, different points of views, mediation between friends, problem solver, and able to rally the ‚Äútroops for war.‚Äù Unfortunately For some reason I cannot follow my own advice‚Ä¶., I lead amazingly. Leadership has always came naturally for me, I know to be a great leader sometimes you‚Äôve got to step back and let someone else in front. To always be encouraging, truthful, to be right there for whom ever. 

I will get on the ground and pull a stone weighing a ton with my crew, no questions asked. They are my equal and I am there. No one is above me nor below me. The weakest link is all of us. The strongest is each of us. 
You can never ask someone to do something, you wouldn‚Äôt do yourself.  Complements, compassion, and understanding go hand in hand. 

I am a force to be reckoned with. For sure. 

Do not harm. 
But take no shit. 

So throughout my 30+ years of this little old life, it has been hard to find connections such as friends and lovers.  Most people tend to tire of me or I of them. I do not like to be bored when around others, I prefer to be that way by myself in my much needed solitude. Do not disrupt the solitude. 

My longest relationship last almost 9 years. It was a good relationship for the majority of it‚Ä¶ but it did end in chaos‚Ä¶ we are still friends, but my love as in romantic love died long before our relationship did. Our lives suffered and got held back because we both believe we just needed to wait it out. The only thing that happened was destruction to our souls and happiness. 

He was and still is my dear friend. The one person I could count on until I couldn‚Äôt. 

Just like all my friendships. 

He‚Äôs moved on, new partner, new friends‚Ä¶ 

I have put myself out there, some inquire others shy aWay. 

I can be intimidating, even with a smile on my face.  

I am a lot. 
I am too much for people. 

I am just too much. And it‚Äôs led me to a very lonely life. Everyone always seems to leave me behind in the end. They move away, they distance themselves, burry themselves in work to the point they no longer have time‚Ä¶ 

I have never been married nor engaged. 
No one, even my almost 9 year relationship, has ever asked me. 

I‚Äôll never get to be a mother due to my biological Time clock is ticking away. 34 isn‚Äôt old, but it is not young either. No Middle Ages but we are definitely walking up to that door to give a huge knock on it.  

I cannot just lay with someone, one night stands have never been a favorite. I have always needed meaningful loving connection‚Ä¶ so random sex with strangers is not really a logical answer‚Ä¶ 

Depression eats me up most nights. My soul is lonely, my heart is scarred‚Ä¶ 

I just want someone to love me for me and I love them for them. I have all the passion and love in this world to give ‚Ä¶ one on wants it. Or they like the idea of me, they just cannot handle all this for very long .

I keep this smile and upbeat attitude slapped on my face but truthfully, I‚Äôm alone, and tired of being alone‚Ä¶ my depression deepens daily ‚Ä¶

750,v56yy6,berlinerboy20," 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. The loneliness is killing me. Has killed me. I live since 4 years in Berlin and I have zero people to meet. My biggest wish when I go to sleep is that I don‚Äôt wake up anymore or when I wake up my first thought is, not another day again‚Ä¶ I am actually a very nice, funny and lovable guy, but my life situation is not allowing me to be like this anymore. If you would see me and my look or how I act on my workplace, you would never believe I am that much down or that I don‚Äôt have anyone. I changed a lot in last years since i live in total isolation. Even my coworkers say this, I barely make fun and jokes anymore for which I was known the most and people liked me. Now I only go to work or to gym, because I have no more friends or anyone with which I could socialize (coworkers have all familys or different lifestyle). I am 35 btw. I am having a great job which I love and I earn good money, but beside of that, there is nothing positive in my life anymore. I have now money and freedom to do almost anything I would want (travel), but i can do less then the most broke person, because I have no-one to go with. Before corona I had a few people, but since 2 years I haven‚Äôt meet any person. The isolation has totally killed me inside. I was the biggest, most passionate music guy, now I don‚Äôt find even my favourite tracks from the past enjoyable. If somebody would tell me 2 years ago I would not enjoy some of my favourite tracks in the future I would have bet all the money I have with him that this can‚Äôt happen to me. It all feels so empty and hopeless, when you know there is no future for you. Now I don‚Äôt feel worthy anymore to meet other people, who had in those time much more from life than me. They went to another level in this time, had so much fun, normal stuff they did, sex then me. But I also don‚Äôt want to meet with other people who are in same situation. I had a few chances to meet with a few people from my country who live here in last time, but I canceled the meeting on last day a few times, because I didn‚Äôt feel I am on the same level as them, since they have a normal social life and went clubbing regularly (women).

I am living in such a great city, but I have no benefits from it, I haven‚Äôt explore and saw almost nothing from the city yet. There so much things I would like to do, from riding a bike with some friend, driving a gokart or travelling to Thailand or any other beautiful beach. All the things I would like to do, I can‚Äôt do because I don‚Äôt have people for it and I don‚Äôt wanna do it alone, because it makes me feel even more weird.

764,v586s9,Dont-Lick-the-Cat,"I‚Äôm not really looking for advice so much. Mostly just here for a long overdue venting sesh of never-ending situational/self over-analyzation.

Three years this month I left an abusive relationship of 20 years, which I am truly grateful for. üôåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩ

Being a Social Butterfly most of my adult life, the overall nature of that relationship left me a socially exhausted, borderline-alcoholic by the time it was all said and done.

Needless to say, the last 3 years spent sans socialization was well needed, but now I‚Äôm starting to think this self-seclusion has become far more alone time than what I really needed or what one would consider healthy. I‚Äôve become this unfamiliar kind of Hermit and have no clue how to go about releasing myself back into the World. 

Ten years ago, we moved 1000+ miles away from closest friends and family. I‚Äôm No Contact with the ex and all the socially toxic behavior he previously brought into my life. So, now it‚Äôs just me and the Crotch Goblins. üòà ‚ù§Ô∏è

I absolutely love it here and have no plans moving closer to ‚Äúhome‚Äù, and I‚Äôd easily guesstimate that AT LEAST 75-80% of those I‚Äôve met here over the last decade are also ‚Äútransplants‚Äù from other states. Socially speaking, the populous here is a little different than what I‚Äôve always been used to.

It seems as if everyone moved here to get away from their own life‚Äôs B.S. Now they are here living their lives,  trying to do as little ‚Äúpeopling‚Äù as possible‚Ä¶much like we initially tried to do.

Being an adult tying to make new friends is hard enough as it is, but it‚Äôs even harder when almost EVERYONE around you, from neighbors, to co-workers, and casual acquaintances have zero interest in developing new friendships of any kind. It‚Äôs safe to say that the general population here is cool for the most part, but they are anything BUT inviting. So, it goes without saying I have ZERO friends or trustworthy companions to hang out with.

I don‚Äôt necessarily feel lonely or depressed, but in the very back of my brain, thoughts of returning to some sort of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior has been nagging at me more and more. 
‚Ä¶and at 14 &amp; 18 years of age, I‚Äôm also starting to feel like the kiddeaux‚Äôs would like for me to stop being so obnoxiously erratic and find a way to mentally/emotionally work off some of this pent up ‚Äúenergy‚Äù.ü•¥ü´£üòπ

~Which leads me to the second installment of a long overdue venting episode.~

When thinking about THE VERY ONE adult thing I miss more than anything else‚Ä¶?

The first thing that ALWAYS comes to mind that I miss the most, is being able to go out and listen to live music. üé∂ ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôve taken the kids to a few really great shows this last year. Bands they‚Äôve heard in the background of their lives since birth. Always an amazingly-awesome experience for all of us, but it isn‚Äôt quite the same as sitting in some dive bar or small venue with a friend or SO, drinking a beer and enjoy listening to some great music. It‚Äôs always been one of my favorite things to do and miss going out very much. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

‚Ä¶but as a single female, going solo to a bar is‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶

ONE: Not very fun, relaxing, or enjoyable in any capacity, mostly due to the fact that any solo guy that notices you are alone will immediately try to buy you a drink and start an unwarranted conversation that I have zero interest in being a part of. No matter how clear I try to make it to them that I‚Äôm not interested in hanging out or chatting it up with them, they never want to take the hint and understand that I just want to hang out and listen to the music mostly unbothered. Despite my obvious disinterest, they still (typically) continue annoying the ever living F‚Äôk out of me until I‚Äôm short of becoming a straight up bitch towards them, but instead find I‚Äôm better off just going home. üòíüòî

‚Ä¶and 

TWO: It‚Äôs also just not very safe or smart for a single chick to be hanging out in a bar drinking solo in a large metro area, and I feel that OLD apps are not a conducive solution.

However, I remain hopeful because I know at some point something will eventually give as it always does. 
Sooo‚Ä¶for now, I just vent here to those willing share in my pain.ü´§üòπüò∂üò≠

765,v58ey2,Freak_Shay,"Im not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but about 2 months ago I moved from a city of 1.5 million people to a small town of under 11,000 people due to financial reasons and I've been having a hard time making friends. I have one friend here who I live with but he works 80+ hours a week so we don't hangout very often and when we do he's usually tired from work and just wants to stay home. I work from home so I don't get out much. 

I googled ""how to make friends in a small town"" but none of the suggestions on wikihow are possible for me. This town does not have much to offer. There are no organizations for me to volunteer at, no classes for adults i could take, no gym to join, not even a community center.

I have pretty intense social anxiety so I can't exactly strike up a conversation at the grocery store. My therapist suggested i try Bumble BFF but it said there were no people available in my area. At this point I am out of ideas. 

I've considered getting a dog just to get me out of the house. An off leash dog park is one of the few perks this town has. But I'm not sure if that's a good idea because I'm pretty bad at taking care of myself so how could I take care of another living creature, you know?

Does anyone have any other ideas? It's been really hard.",2022-06-05 07:35:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646975004,0,/r/lonely/comments/v58ey2/how_to_make_friends_in_a_small_town/,,0,6,How to make friends in a small town
766,v58ko9,alifelost98,"like, i get that once people have experienced it enough times its no longer a big deal to them, so they'll tell people in my shoes ""its not even that great bro!"" but... being someone whos never even cuddled, never had any real intimacy, it just hurts so much to be 23 and have no sign of ever getting to experience those things. sure, maybe if i did experience them i'd be underwhelmed and it wouldnt change much in my life... but its still just so frustrating to not know what they're like. it makes me feel like i have no value, as if every person talking about the success they've had romantically, sexually, and not even just that but also socially, are rubbing it in my face reminding me of how much less valuable i am than them. lets be honest, a guy's value is often attached to how attractive he is to the opposite sex. a guy whos had multiple partners, compared to a guy whos had no partners, sharing the same opinion, will get a different response. i feel like since i cant attract women like other guys can, im inherently worth less than them in every aspect of life, and that if i could attract just ONE woman in my life, my self-esteem would go up dramatically. and even if my life is still lackluster in certain ways, i could at least sit around thinking im not completely unlovable and i wouldnt compare myself to other guys as much, internally freaking out and going into analysis mode every time i see successful men.

anyways, off that tangent, its just the most frustrating thing to know you likely wont ever be able to experience something. and i dont mean something rare like winning 100 million dollars through the lottery, i mean something that the majority of people experience, and brag about, and flaunt. something you cant go anywhere without seeing and being reminded of. reminded that they're better than you and you're unloved, unfuckable scum (supposedly)

Currently in freshman year of college and had regrets be brought back up due to old email scrolling, wanted to get them off my chest.

If you can please don‚Äôt judge me. But if you do I get it. But know now, that college has really helped me to grow up and mature. I know I have made so much progress in this past year.

First regret, was emotionally and verbally abusive to my ex as a teenager. Honestly probably the only person I have honestly liked. Said person, was the only time I ever remember having genuine, death do us part, unconditional support and love from someone. And I fucked that up big time.

Second regret, enlisted in the marines corps straight out of hs graduation because I was depressed and hoping to have an honorable way to die. Hid that and horrible indigestion from my recruiter. Issues from my recruiter which would have dqued me if I was honest with him . Ended up breaking in bt so that didn‚Äôt end up happening. So I got discharged with an entry level. 


Third regret, not cutting ties with parts of my family sooner. As I have been in chats with my therapist about my upbringing as a kid. Realize a lot of my family members aren‚Äôt fit to raise or support children. Biggest of all was my mother and father who were abusive to me physically and mentally.

Fourth regret, not going to therapy as a pre-teen. Looking back I was a creep in middle and high school. Literally everyone expect my parents knew I needed therapy as a kid. And they didn‚Äôt even try to get me help.

I could have devolved healthily, had a decent self- image, nor made so many poor decisions. If the people that held the power over me as a kid used it reasonably like adults do as a parents",2022-06-05 08:51:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629721718,1,/r/lonely/comments/v59bo4/regrets/,,0,8,Regrets

803,v5e5xu,DCT1997,"Hello,

I am a 24 year old male. I've always had a hard time developing relationships with other people due to having bad Social Anxiety and lack of Social Skills. Despite my issues, I've managed to meet various people from school and work that I liked and got along with. However, I notice that ALL of my relationships NEVER go beyond their context.

When I would meet potential friends from school, we would never talk or hang out outside of school. It was never a, ""Hey! Would you like to come over my house this weekend? Hey we should hang out sometime. I'm having a party, would you like to come?"" We would never text or talk on the phone just to have conversation and keep in touch. In school we would get along just fine. We seemed to enjoy each other's company. However, after school, the weekends, and on Summer vacation I wouldn't hear from them. Whenever they would end up changing schools, I would never hear from them again.

It's been 7 years since I've been out of High School, and I don't keep in touch with anyone.

When I was in College, I would meet people from my classes in a given Semester that were cool, but then when the Semester would end and we no longer had classes together I wouldn't hear from them again. I would run into them on campus and we would acknowledge each other and that was about it.

I am still going through the same thing now that I am working. I've been at my job going on 3 years. I've met quite a few people here that I really liked enough to want to pursue a friendship with. We see each other at work and get along really well, but our relationship never extends beyond work. Those people no longer work there, and I haven't spoke to them since they left.

I notice this pattern with ALL of my relationships. My relationships never go beyond their context; they're always situational. I have a hard time keeping in touch with folks.

I get lonely.

I just wish I had people I can talk to and spend time with outside of work and school.

How can I break this habit?",2022-06-05 14:11:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1532298310,4,/r/lonely/comments/v5e5xu/all_of_my_friendships_are_situational/,,0,4,All of my friendships are situational.
804,v5efte,Demiurgeinapte,"I'm struggling with this question for a while now. why can't we be happy in our relationship/friendship. I feel like human can't just stick to simple things such as chosing someone genuinely for who they are and then working on it everyday and enjoying life.

I feel like we put a lot of strategies, we build some lies, we give up when there's an obstacle.

It's like it's cannot be simple when it can be. 

I've always been considered as ""attractive"", ""intelligent"" and so a lot of people tried to flirt etc.. But I've always been single for my whole life because I feel like it's not real. They are superficial, they want something and tomorrow they'll want an other thing.

And for once in my life I opened up to someone. It was real and prefect. He was so invested, expressing how much he was happy with me and how I was the first woman that he felt he always knew, and how I was so surprising. And then there's an obstacle : his job is taking him a lot of time because he had a sort of promotion and he has to move in an other town. I was so happy for him, and supported him, telling him how I was proud.

Suddenly the relationship, the bond we had is like non existent and I feel that he gave up. And to me it makes no sense. When you like/love someone you fight a little bit, when you have that sort of happiness that is hard to find you dont throw it away so easily. I can tell twice in my life men looked at me that way and acted in a way you know they are in love and can't control their feelings no more. But it doesn't matter, even this doesn't stop them from giving up.

It's the exact reason why I've been so closed to relationships, people aren't constant. And I don't understand it, like for real I don't. I feel like simple love doesn't exist. Nobody want to fight a little, they just tell themselves let's move on, let's try what's next.

In my third week I'm craving to return back to Texas despite not even being here for a month yet. I know other people have done it for longer periods of time, but this is my first time on my own. On top of that the internship I have causes me so much stress to the point where I cannot eat well due to the stress and dread going back to work after the weekend is over. I contact my family on a regular basis and my girlfriend to try and compensate for trying to get rid of this feeling, but I find that this solves the problem temporarily. I'm trying to exercise, take vitamins, eat well. I can really use some advice. I feel miserable at the moment to the point I don't want to get out of bed. Is there any advice you guys have for me? I really appreciate all the help I can get. I've never felt this lonely before.

824,v5io31,backupforsecretstuff,"I(22F) went out last night with a guy (27M) and had an amazing time. We went dancing and drinking and went back to his apartment after. I don't hookup often, but I've done it a few times before. Usually it's a drunk mess that ends with one of us leaving, but this guy? Man he did me a number... He was so caring and gentle and kind to me both emotionally and physically. He told me to stay over because it was so late, so I did. We barely slept, just spent the whole night together talking and existing. In the moment I felt so content and happy because the way we acted was so domestic and fulfilling

I've never been in a relationship, and my hook ups have always been clinical compared to this. So waking up in the morning in someone's arms broke something inside. I secretly hoped he wouldn't wake up so I could stay there forever. When I left we vaguely agreed to meet again, but I know the chances are slim. 

This guy gave me something I craved so deeply and now I am so aware of the fact that we will likely never meet again. I feel like a teenager waiting for a text. Every time my phone buzzes I hope it's him. And the thing is, I'm almost certain he won't text back

I don't know if it's because i'm lonely, or no man has ever been so kind, but I feel like this guy just destroyed me emotionally because for a few hours he gave me absolutely everything. 

I just want to see him again....

i cant stop crying from how intensely this jerk broke something in my mind

edit: since a lot of ppl mentioned i should text him, i already did. when i got home i shot him a text saying i had an incredible night and that i would love to see him sometime this week if he was down

small update (06/05 at like 8pm): we briefly texted. i asked if he had videos from the show we went to and he sent them my way apologizing for the poor quality. i replied trying to keep the conversation going... got nothing back. this was about 2-3 hours ago. i feel like this ship has sailed :/ i rlly wish there was something i could do without coming off desperate... i feel so stupid... he probably doesn't even care

morning update: how stupid/desperate would it be if i send another text ? or should i not?

final update unless he shows up: I went to the gym for the first time in a very long time. I did job applications and later am visiting apartments to rent. He taught me at least one thing: I'm not in college anymore. I'm gonna stick to focusing on improving my life right now, I'm not gonna go around hooking up. It's time for me to enter my hot girl era.

848,v5ko2f,_EVH_,"I can't find anyone. I mean literally, I just feel like being trapped in a deserted island with nothing else than my own company, and I'm growing to hate it more with each day. I no longer can stand myself. I just have no means to meet anybody. If one would ask, ""how do people get to know each other"", it might seen an almost stupid question for some, so easy and common it is for them. My world never saw that ease. Being badly short-sighted and unable to see people's faces only worsens it. But the fact is I feel totally unable to meet people. What's the deal? College? Work? Gym? Shows? Social networks?Literally anywhere? None of this exist in my life, and I don't feel like it can. Sometimes I just go for a walk dreaming of meeting someone, but I know that ain't going to happen. I wish I could give up hope and just accept my loneliness. I'm pushing 30 and never had anything with girls before. Not even flirting. I can't even notice if a girl gives me a glance due to my poor sight. If I had only that I'd feel all much better. Everything seems out of my reach, it's like the world just closes all its doors for me and won't let me have anything, especially when it comes to relationships. Sometimes I just feel like the loneliest person in the world and doomed to be alone. If I'm feeling it at this age, I can't even imagine what I will become in 30-40 years. I'll be the old man whose life is just sad and lonely unable even to take care of himself, depending on some rude caretakers who'd treat me like a burden and make it all worse. That is if I ever get to live that long. If life is going to only keep me down like this and unable to fight then it's not even worth living. I wish I was like those shallow Instagram people who have many ""friends"" and are always getting a date faster than they discard the last one, at least they're living something. I wish I was futile, so I would always be around other futile people but having a good time and would be too dumb to feel sad. Being ""wise"" or believing to be so, only brought me feelings of sadness, loneliess and despair. I can't even laugh nor cry no more. I just remain silent and numb while all my pain sinks in.

905,v5r8rj,Own_Midnight_3710,"Hi.  I am still in love with my ex boyfriend, R.  We dated from 2016-2019, lived together, traveled the world together.  He was soulmate material for me.  But, he got a job 2000 miles away, I couldn't join him at the time, and the relationship ended.

He still remained my friend and best cheerleader.  I even dated someone new, S, for about 1.5 years.  R and I are both in the healthcare field, and I got into PA school 6 hours from home.  It was and is a very lonely time.  My ""new"" relationship ended due to me moving away (ironic).   I had some very rough times in school, and he helped me continue by periodic phone calls.

By chance, R and I reconnected as we both happened to be in Chicago at the same time.  I hadn't seen him in so long.  I instantly felt how I used to.  We were intimate, and falling asleep with my head on his chest was like a dream.

I just visited him in his state for a week, and it was mostly wonderful.  However, half way through he got weird and basically said I am not interested in dating you, we should not have sex, etc etc.  But he was still holding my hand and kissing me.

Long story short, I had to go back to this town of 8,000 in the middle of fucking nowhere, with no friends or family, and I am only halfway done with school.  I don't even know what to do when I graduate.  R feels like home to me, and I truly feel the last time I felt true happiness and joy was when we lived together.  I never have met anyone even remotely like him.

I am just so sad, and wish I could go back to that time.  

TLDR: Still in love with ex years later, live in the middle of nowhere, have no friends or family around.

908,v5rlvf,AnnualKey7353,"I feel like coming to terms with indefinite and permanent loneliness is honestly a super positive thing. Like now that I just understand that there‚Äôs no one out there for me and there won‚Äôt be a sexual/romantic partner for me it sort of feels rather liberating. Instead of sitting there basking in my loneliness wishing that I had someone to hold or to love I can now just sit there and realize that this is how the rest of my life will be-and I‚Äôm okay with that. I‚Äôm okay with being on my own forever, and I might not have kids or a wife that I love, but I can still love what I do and my friends you know. But with this decision to come to terms with my own I definitely loneliness im realizing that I should no longer even think about trying for another partner - these actions only lead to further pain, hurt, and rejection and there is no reason to ever put myself out there again. No need for tinder, going out, or any of that type of stuff. Solace in my work and my friends is all I should ever consider, as I am unfit for any potential romantic partner. Sure, understanding that no one will touch me lovingly or erotically is a tough pill to swallow, but through past experiences and rejections, I now understand that this area of human emotions is just not for me. Love is something that not everyone can ever find - it‚Äôs why you see such a high divorce rate across the globe as people leave the ‚Äúconformity‚Äù age of the 60‚Äôs. Love is not for everyone - and it isn‚Äôt for me. Complete social-sexual rejection from society can have some detrimental consequences on social animals like us humans, but if we can learn to change our mentality and understand that there will never be a partner, one can learn to negate a lot of the mental stresses of loneliness. It‚Äôs sort of like losing a limb, the realization that you will never be able to move that arm is horrific and painful, but as one continues to live they can learn to appreciate their own uniqueness, even if they are technically less fit and competent of a person. This is why I choose a comfortable lifetime of loneliness. Sure, I will be left with staggering amounts of free time as others find their partners, but I can utilize this free time to do something else productive. Some might argue that dying alone on your deathbed is the one thing in life they hope to avoid, however I like to think of it as my inevitable end, and not a bad one at that. You went through life living for no one but yourself, and as you reach the end, people might not miss you, but you at least left a mark that will stain the earth until it is inevitably eroded away with the infinite passage of time.",2022-06-06 01:29:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643051793,7,/r/lonely/comments/v5rlvf/coming_to_terms_with_a_lifetime_of_loneliness/,,0,5,Coming to terms with a lifetime of loneliness

917,v5s3i4,xsyddhi,"The title basically sums it up. 

Has anyone else been so undeniably lonely the past few years that you now feel like you could survive without anyone by your side? I'm not talking about physical loneliness, more so with being surrounded by tons of people and still feeling alone. For the majority of my adolescence, I've come to realize that I've felt a certain drift between my personal life and those around me. No matter how much I shared, how much of ourselves both of us gave to each other -- something at the back of my mind always told me that no one understood me as much as I understood them (except 1 person and that is my best friend to date). It's a very weird and a very painfully isolating feeling to experience and I honestly would never wish it on anyone. A Disconnect with the world is awful. 

But as I grow older, I've come to realize, and maybe even find comfort in the fact that if I were to be ***this*** lonely and disconnected for the rest of my life, I wouldn't mind. Yes, I'm suffering, and yes it's incredibly hard to meet new people without feeling like I'm wasting my time, but I suppose it's still better than yearning for a companionship you'll never have and setting yourself up for failure. Life is very dull when you're alone, and that is the truth, but every time I meet new people and get disappointed, I come to realize why I stick to myself.

Part of this is my fault as I never was very extroverted, and during quarantine, I didn't really socialize with anyone in real life as I spent all of my free time playing video games. And recently between school    work and sports, it is a hard to find time to hangout with people. But it is not impossible by any measures. Even people I do my sport with I am not very close to them, as they will choose other people over me in a heartbeat. And people from school, will do the same. In fact they will openly talk about do stuff together(often on Friday/Saturday nights) in front of me, and never bother to ask if I would join.

Recently I have gone to a couple graduation party's, but it was either a quick stop and go, or I just kind of lingered in the back. And I really did try to get out of my shell and talk to people, but its really hard when they talk about things you cant relate about.

I as well have one close friend, but we are not at the point of talking about anything super deep. And plus they are moving to a town about three hours away in the fall, so that makes it a little hard sometimes.

Even with family it can be hard as I am not really super close with anyone, as a lot of the people my age don't live close to me, and the one person who is my age, just doesn't really talk with people or open up about anything. I as well do not have the best relationship with my parents, and it is getting better, but I would never be comfortable telling them about how I feel, and my relationships with other people my age.

All of my close friendships I had in elementary or middle school, all started to fade away as I went into high school, and the pandemic did not help at all.

And I know other people have it worse, but It still doesn't ease the pain, I have been feeling like this ever since the U.S. has gone on shutdown since March of 2020.

It is so painful to feel so alone especially on a day that is meant to be so happy and so great. On a night when I feel like I should and want to be out partying with my friends, is spent alone in my room wanting to do anything but sit in my room and do nothing.  


Edit: And I just saw on a friends story that almost all of them that said they cant hangout are all together at another friends house. :(",2022-06-06 02:45:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610506154,3,/r/lonely/comments/v5sybo/i_feel_so_lonely_and_despite_what_i_tell_myself/,,0,0,"I feel so lonely, and despite what I tell myself, it hurts on the inside."

Luckily my mental health ain't fucked up yet.

Since there's a bigass time difference between the US (where I live at) and Armenia (my home country and where 95 percent of my friends are at), I'm finna need to talk to em at night-time, which is kinda OK but still ain't really it.

977,v5y5e2,fuckthisshitimout83,"I‚Äôm a highly visual thinker, so when the term ‚Äòdead to me‚Äô entered my mind when I was young it conjured a very specific image influenced on the word ‚Äòdead‚Äô because I didn‚Äôt know what the phrase meant.

981,v5yh3o,springtimestrawberry,"1. Religious upbringing and trauma.
Many of my family and friends would swoon at my use of profanity in the title. You see folks, I grew up conservative Mennonite. What is that, you ask? It's sorta like Amish-lite. A subset of Christianity that is extremely rooted in tradition and rules.  No television, homemade dresses and headcoverings for women, limited choices for what music you're allowed to listen to, books, movies, etc. Super strict gender roles, spanking of children.... All of this is basically the tip of the iceberg.
For much of my life I was trying to make it work. Having been brainwashed that I basically had to be a good Mennonite to be a good person, I would squash myself into the box of who I was supposed to be in order to please everyone else. It wasn't until last summer that I decided that I needed to get out of the situation. 

2. Family issues
 Telling my family about this decison was hard because my family was already going through a whole bunch of crap. My mom is in such a weird place mentally. She has a whole bunch of narcissistic tendencies and the polarization around covid really did a number on her. Of course it affects my siblings, and it especially affects my dad. My dad has sometimes in the past even used me as a confidant as he's having a hard time and doesn't really have very many friends to talk to. But it feels really toxic.
 
3. Depression and anxiety
Like many in this new and beautiful generation, I have stumbled across the wonders of depression and anxiety. My first bouts of depression started a few years ago, after I had three grandparents die in the span of two weeks. And it's stuck to me since. School didn't help either.

4. Failure
  Not only did I start college late (because most Mennonites don't even go to college) but I'm an absolute failure and couldn't hack it. Part of it was because my college was sort of Mennonite and as I came to the conclusion that I no longer was Mennonite, it felt like a super bad fit. But also my anxiety and depression took over and I was unable to do school and this past semester I ended up having to take medical leave. So then, I had to leave the city that I had finally gotten to and go back to rot in the small town in the absolute middle of nowhere where my parents live. So now I'm 24 and don't even nearly have a degree. Stupid failure.
  
5. Fomo
Meanwhile, it feels like my only friends that didn't get married at 20 are always off having great adventures. I've never been off the continent and they've all been to the wild reaches of unknown places and territories and I'm stuck. 

6.  I'm broke
I can't afford to go travel and have fun times. I can't afford to buy the things I like. I can't afford to be independent from my parents. Which is pathetic.

7. Lack of friends
I'm an extrovert and I gain an energy and hope from being around others. But others don't want to be around me so often it feels like. And my family growing up, I was often given the message that I was too annoying or that I dominated conversations too much.  And maybe that's why I have had trouble with friendships my entire life. People have been friends with me and then just decided they weren't friends anymore, sometimes my friendships have died because we couldn't keep up long distance, sometimes my friends are just too busy to give me the time of day. But either way I end up spending most of my time alone.

8. Loneliness
 Not only do I struggle with friendships, but I struggle even harder with romantic relationships. Part of this also has to do with my Mennonite background. Mennonite boys don't like opinionated chubby chicks... That's just the long and short of it. And since people get married at 19, the fact that I had never ever gotten asked out by 23 has always felt like it was a reflection on my self-worth. 
 Since spending some time in the city while at college, I found out that I'm not horribly unattractive to some people. However, even though those people don't really want to give me any love or spend time with me. They really just want to fuck me. Which honestly doesn't help with the loneliness. 

9. Lack of hope
 It's really hard for me to feel hopeful. I can't imagine life where I'm happy. Or sometimes I can imagine that happy life but I can't imagine any way for me to get there so I feel stuck. I feel really tempted to just give myself up to alcoholism or drug abuse or sex addiction (I feel a pull for all of those things, and I'm pretty sure I have a pretty addictive personality) 
 
10. Me
 Isn't it clear? I'm pathetic. I'm clearly not worth people's time and energy. I'm not worthy of  love. I'm too stupid for school. I'm not worthy of prospering or of having things that make me happy. 
 Obviously, I know those things are untrue. But they feel so true deep in my core. And it's so hard to counteract those when everything around me screams to me that I'm worthless.",2022-06-06 08:59:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654497934,2,/r/lonely/comments/v5yh3o/10_reasons_why_lifes_a_bitch_right_now/,,0,0,10 reasons why life's a bitch right now

But beyond that time 31 years ago nothing not a single touch romantily I am not ugly not  overweight nor shy just have a 100% failure rate for 31 years running.  I honestly gave up at several points. But this pirsistant pain that I still  dont quite understand eats away me.  Its litterly a lonely ache/ pain it's physical not mental but is mentally triggered. Its something a kin to being suddenly scared like something jumping out at you or if you're afraid of highs being hung ove a building.  The physical feeling in the mid chest  but totally without the fear part. That mixed with and acheing draining feeling like a black hole is in the middle of my chest.  

It used to only spike around couples.  Then seeing couples in movies and tv shows then hearing about couples in stories.  Then porn became unwatchable for me . I learned to live with it as a basic level but the spikes and triggers are nothing but crippling I only made it through 3 friends wedding because I got drunk as hell but even with that I was in so much pain I wanted to end myself. 
I eventually found certain nootropics hardcore ones basically legal drugs that aren't currently regulated.  That help slightly very slightly they stop me from getting extreme with my efforts to end the pain but I need it gone it's a fate worse than death to be so so lonely then saying ok I'll just be single then to have this pain.  Its crippling.

1011,v66v04,MoldyEcosphere,"Started out in kindergarten. I was always left out. Somehow I managed to be a toxic friend through pressuring people. 

Elementary school was tough for me. No one liked me, I was mostly alone. Always this cramp in my stomache. Can anyone relate? 

Then middle and highschool. Started out really nice at first but then I had to repeat a year and then I was left out again. The old ""friends"" made fun of me. I was almost bullied. 

Then I went to a university and was left out in my first course of study. Had terrible stomache cramps.  Switched my course of study and then I found some people but then they quickly didnt want to have anything to do with me. I found people online that always stopped after a few months. 

I had a girlfriend for 6 months. She was fat (not that I cared) and I treated her really well but she insulted me and eventually betrayed me once someone better arrived. Damn that hurt so badly. I cried for months because I really loved her. 

Once I was over her after 1.5 years I somehow found someone else. And wow she was beautiful! I noticed quickly though that I was just a train station she hopped in and would leave at the next stop. And wow did she break up with me in a horrible way. Its been 1.5 years and it still aches horribly when I think about it. She treated me very nicely though (most of the times). 

Now I've moved away. I was always ok being alone but this new chapter in a new home in a new city.. leaving all my memories behind of the city that I had the most social interaction. It hurts really bad. And not even my family wants to be with me for more than an hour.

I‚Äôm 27 since last month and seeing young people here, at very young ages giving up that easily hurts me deeply. We‚Äôre all struggling because our lives didn‚Äôt treat us better. At my early 20s i struggled with mental issues and eventually got diagnosed one day. I‚Äôve been using a lot of heavy meds that make you numb in every way. I use only one low dose med now for one year, but i feel like i‚Äôm relapsing...

I was always a lonely, shy kid. I never had lots of friends. I couldn‚Äôt fit the stereotypes the society had. I found happiness in my own solitude. Even in uni, people would look at me weirdly and ask ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you talk? why are you so silent?‚Äù which would cause me to get anxiety attacks. I‚Äôd feel so bad i‚Äôd go to home early. Then i started not showing up in the classes, idek how i graduated. And i graduated uni with zero friends. I didn‚Äôt attend the graduation ceremony bc there was no point standing there looking at those strangers being happy together while inside i was rotting.

I have no irl friends for years. At this point idek when the last time i had one. It didn‚Äôt bug me for years bc i had my games but then i started playing online games too and saw people playing together. It started to make me feel desperate for connections. Last 3 years i tried friendship subs, i tried long distance with guys, i‚Äôve met a lot of people that sometimes i recognize their usernames. I feel pathetic. Whatever i do is never enough, i‚Äôm easily replaced, i mean nothing to anyone that everybody leaves me. For awhile i didn‚Äôt self reflect and blamed people and would be sometimes cruel back at them too. But then i got mature, even if i was already mature at young ages, i showed empathy, compassion i was patient and tried my best to be there for the people i thought were close to me, without wanting anything back. It cost me a lot. I started overthinking, being obsessed, and paranoid because deep down i knew i was being too much. I cared too much, i loved too much, i overflew my flowers. People made me resent myself for my feelings, for how i am while i accepted them as how they were. It wasn‚Äôt fair to me. 

I still tried, i tried many times. Posting i‚Äôm looking for friends, messaging to people who post. Everything died out at the end. People called me names, belittled me, ghosted me out of nowhere, i got cheated on and my ex blamed his depression WHILE i was battling with it. God, what a fool i was. Why? Why do i put too much faith and trust in people still? After all those shitty things happened to me? And what hurts more that, even though you open up to those guys about what you went through and try to be vulnerable, telling them if their intentions are ill they should leave me alone, they still do the same hurtful shit. Then i‚Äôm back to square one. Hating everyone and myself. Going back to depression hole, isolating myself for months.

I experienced nothing. I never dated irl, i never held hands, no first kiss, no intimacy and now i don‚Äôt consider those past long distance ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù real ones, because i regret all of them. I want to feel loved, cared, not just wanted. I want someone to put effort into things same as i would. Why am i not getting anything back from my loved ones? All i want should be bare minimum right?

Then the next two months when I made plans to fix every shortcoming of mine. And to some extent I did succeed. I became fitter, bolder, open minded and flexible over the next two years.

Then as the pandemic gradually ended I went out into the world ready to conquer. Only to fall into the same patterns of facing social rejection. I am more social now yet more lonely than ever.

1074,v6g1b7,doc-meme-original,"It‚Äôs a funny thing when you realise this. The attention we try so desperately to obtain is all for nothing. Question - the people you surround yourself with, wether it be work, romantic/sexual interests or friends, (if you have any) do you think any of the people in those categories even think about you? I don‚Äôt mean, do they care? No, I mean do they even take notice of you? Sure they might at first but once they dive deeper into you and your personality‚Ä¶..done. They had enough already. 

Can you blame them though? I mean really can you? Do you think you‚Äôre interesting, do you think you‚Äôre mature, do you think you‚Äôre attractive, do you think you‚Äôve got your shit together???

I already know the answers for all of you reading this.

You don‚Äôt. 

That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre trapped in this cycle. Just like me. 

It‚Äôs because like me, you answered no to some if not all of those questions posed, and that‚Äôs all it takes for you to realise how much of an insignificant speck you are on this planet. That‚Äôs all it takes for you to know that unless you get lucky soon and the right person or people come along, and you can move forward with your life, you may as well die right now. 

We‚Äôre social creatures and all we do day after day night after night is spend our time in solitude.

But why? 

I‚Äôve asked myself this question countless times and I‚Äôm still yet to come to a tangible answer, but here‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve gotten for now:

We‚Äôre just wired up wrong.

Maybe since our teens, childhood or god forbid birth itself. Whatever it is, we‚Äôre all here now, having ourselves a fun old time aren‚Äôt we? 

Debating to ourselves about the various ways in which our ‚Äúlives‚Äù if you can call them that, will end. I don‚Äôt look forward to it, but I definitely don‚Äôt fear it like I should. But what can you expect? 

Living a life having nothing to lose and nothing to gain doesn‚Äôt exactly put me in a position of self acceptance and shining positivity. You‚Äôre deluded if you think any of this gets better soon I assure you. But what do I know? Don‚Äôt listen to me. I‚Äôm losing it. 

Listen to yourself, try to think straight, try to pull yourself out of this and get your shit together. If you‚Äôre not yet at my pathetic life checkpoint you still have time. Don‚Äôt fester in your misery like so many of us, you‚Äôll never get out. That‚Äôs all there is to it.

1118,v6lp3c,zoro_in_black,"25M. Hey guys. I know this post won‚Äôt be for everyone and that‚Äôs okay. Really, this post is for a select few that have chosen the same path. 

_____________________________________

Random people on the street were asked what success means to them in one word and I‚Äôm sure you could guess what those answers were. Answers like: Happiness, rich, healthy, love, etc. But, ask me and I won‚Äôt give an answer you‚Äôd expect. My answer? Success means everything‚Ä¶

Years ago I had a taste of the ‚Äúgood life‚Äù and have been chasing that high ever since. I realized I wanted more out of my life. I wanted to experience the greater things in life because why not? Why can‚Äôt I? Problem is I was arrogant and naive. Life kicked my teeth in, pushed me to the ground and humbled me. 

Now, I stayed on the ground for 5 years. And in those 5 years, instead of getting up, I sulked. I ate my feelings. I blamed outside forces. I didn‚Äôt take accountability. I was a big fat loser. 

I was now farther away from my dreams and optimal health than I started, and I started horribly! But, I believe God doesn‚Äôt place dreams in your heart &amp; soul for nothing. I was at an extremely toxic dead end job, had shitty acquaintances, overweight, thousands in debt, insecure and struggling in my relationship because of my insecurities. 

But one day, I had enough. I was pissed. I was pissed at myself. How could I have let myself get like this? How could I have allowed myself to become complacent? 

I looked in the mirror and chose to see the things about myself that I didn‚Äôt want to accept. I chose to be self aware and chose the responsibility of my situation and what I would have to do in order to get to where I want to be. Who I want to be. I chose the path of personal excellence, but it comes with a heavy price. And not everyone will pay it. 

I was 50 lbs. overweight. None of my clothes fit anymore and the only outfits I could generate were usually comprised of hoodies and sweatpants. I was insecure in my appearance. Thus, I was insecure in my relationship, my professional life, and my mental state. Me being overweight bled into all parts of my life. 

I had to start somewhere, but where? Most of the people in my life were already gone because they didn‚Äôt add any value to my life. They only took and didn‚Äôt reciprocate. I knew I needed to find new friends but there was a more pressing matter. Something I knew deep down I had to do before I could make new friends and that was be selfish. 

Yup; be selfish. I am a very loving and caring person with a lot of empathy and because of that I have always put other people‚Äôs needs before mine. I love helping others, but I realized that if I truly wanted to help them then I had to start by helping myself. If I wasn‚Äôt in a position to be able to help I would only hold others back. So, I began working on myself. I became selfish. 

Since then I have gotten all the losers out of my life, moved out of my parents house, am 7 months into my fitness journey and have lost 33 lbs. so far, reading a book per week, and working towards creating a business plan so that I may one day be able to not only become financially free, but use my finances to help others in ways that I cannot do it right now. 

This path I have chosen is very hard and lonely, but I know it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôm happy to day that I have done a complete 180¬∞ and am getting my life together. The only part of my life that is left is finding like minded individuals to grow with. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a guy or girl. Together, with the power of grit, mental fortitude, optimism, and hope, we too can become the best versions of ourselves. That means giving everything we have to get to where we want. It will take everything.  Winning is everything.  

My chats/PMs are always open for those on the same path feeling lonely. You aren‚Äôt alone.",2022-06-07 03:45:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647661707,2,/r/lonely/comments/v6lp3c/ive_been_working_on_chasing_my_dreams_as_an/,,0,0,"I‚Äôve been working on chasing my dreams as an entrepreneur and personal excellence, but I‚Äôve lost 99% of the people in my life because of it."
1119,v6lpj0,brokenc4,"I had a relationship for a short time that ended a little while ago. I was lonely before but now I felt what it was like to really be wanted every day I'm having a hard time going back to being on my own again. I feel isolated and alone especially in crowds. I'm always just there. No one notices when I leave. I try to be happy every day but when I do or get something I'm proud of I'm met with criticism and disinterest. 

I just want someone to be happy to see me. I need a hug from someone who actually wants to hug me, not because I asked for it. I feel like people like me but I'm just too different to really have a close connection to anyone. It was worth having a relationship for a while but now the loneliness is worse after I felt what it was like to be needed and had that taken away.

I feel like I don't deserve to be sad, because I have so much. I live comfortably, I have goals, I have my dream car, and I have (a few) friends. But I would give it all to just have someone who really wants me. Every time I bring up my problems I'm made fun of because I have my car and such. I also have really bad social anxiety which makes it really hard to reach out or talk to anyone. It also makes me scared that I'll never be able to make new friends or relationships because of my anxiety. 

I just wish someone wanted to be close to me. Even though people like me, I know none of them are really interested in me or how/what I'm doing. I don't even know if I could hug someone if I got the chance. I just have a hard time believing people really want to be close to me.

Getting up in the morning is impossible for me, and I don‚Äôt even have any reason to do it, seeing as my only source of happiness gives me nothing but melancholic apathy and burning pain. The only friends I had tried reaching out a few times, just checking up on me or possibly being worried (there‚Äôs no way that someone can fully care about me), and I would never reply. I would never reply to texts from my parents, friends, strangers, just absolutely nobody no matter what they said.

Can anyone recommend me some hobbies or skills that would allow me to do so. I am not really good at anything I have always been a jack of all trades. Would love to just have a friend to talk also.

1158,v6p9qa,lostone7423,"I've never been good at relationships. I had a few close friends that drifted away over the years; every romantic relationship I had, I fucked it up in one way or another. When my second marriage collapsed 15 years ago, I moved back to my hometown to help my brother take care of our disabled mother. He became my best friend again, and our shared struggle really brought us together in a way we hadn't been close since we were kids. When my mom died two years ago, we managed to get through it, because we had each other. That's all we had, but it was okay.

My brother died two weeks ago. We'd done everything right avoiding COVID, but an unrelated blood clot killed him. My best friend is gone, my only real friend is gone, and I don't know if I'm going to make it now.

I have relatives; aunts and uncles and cousins, most of whom I haven't seen in a decade and live far away. I have a few old friends left on Facebook, but we've drifted apart to the point where we'd barely comment on each other's memes at this point. I'm middle-aged and I'm by myself. I don't even know how to begin to connect to other people again. And the thought of being completely alone for my remaining years terrifies me. The only bright side is it probably won't be long, I've got a host of health problems myself to deal with. And a huge financial mess hanging over my head that could well leave me homeless before all is said and done.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm just utterly lost right now. A month ago things were looking up; I was picking up new work, I was writing the beginnings of a new story, we were looking forward to so much. But it's all gone now.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I just wish I'd been a better person to everyone I drove away.

For the first time in my life I'm really afraid of the future.

(I just want to make it clear I'm not considering self-harm. I don't know that I ever would, I've never been the type.

I do have one friend who is my best friend but she is my friend from highschool and we don't get to see each other much. And in the program I am in everybody pretty much knows each other. For example in breaks between classes everybody goes out to the patio together but I don't. I do know those people but I am not that close with them and have terrible anxiety.

1169,v6qlao,TheElvenAngelCatboy,"Turned 25 in January. Idk, man. After graduating high school 7 years ago, I don't know if I've ever been as happy. Was a ""gifted kid"", was going to get my computer science degree, but suddenly I developed depression. Had to drop out after two years. Worked random jobs until 2020. Got put on medical marijuana but it's been a lot of trouble for me recently, but I just can't kick it, it actually made me feel happy...went to rehab already. That didn't work. Went back after a few months. Plus it ruined my relationship with my little brother, he's 18 now and I know he'll be alright, way better off without me, and better off than me. 

Went back to college last year, took 4 classes at once, ended up going semi-crazy again, was suicidal in the hospital. Decided to only take one class last semester, passed with a freaking C, I know it's awful. Tried taking two classes for the summer...the only one I could find that was part of my major was Geography of Drugs. Asking to take a second course a week into the semester. 

Also got a job...but I keep avoiding it. Idk why, it's not bad. It's a cooking position, make basic fried foods, prepare some things, learn how to make sushi eventually. But I keep avoiding work, not replying to my boss until a couple days after, etc. 


I have to get up at 7 am just to catch a ride to make it to a gas station near a bus stop, or walk to the nearest one about a mile away. Haven't driven since 2020, can't use my ebike I begged for as a holiday present cause it's too far a bike ride on major roads to the campus town and I can't even afford a freaking apartment because I'm stuck with credit card debt and ambulance bills and tuition. I'm stuck in my Dad's basement, barely leave the house. Sleep most of the time, eat, play Go (and still suck at it), vape weed, and ""personal time"", if you catch me. 

I live on disability and food stamps. Barely made it through last month, went a few days with $1.44 in my bank account. Got my check for this month, immediately paid bills and then bought weed with it, plus an Uber there and back. I have a little over $100 left for the month and it's not even a third over. I don't know why I don't want to just go to work like everyone else and be happy earning the meaningless paper we ascribe value to. 

I did the math, even working only 3 days a week will give me enough money to take a weeklong vacation at the end of July, go to another state, play Go, learn, meet new people. Why can't I just do that? Why can't I just be happy?

The last 3 weeks have been the best 3 weeks of my life. I work casually in this massive fruit company (it‚Äôs seasonal work). I struggle to talk to anyone because of social anxiety especially girls.

I met this one girl once and we hit it off, I‚Äôm not sure what it is, but her vibe is insane. We talked on the job the whole day. I didn‚Äôt see her at work for another week but then she came another day and again we talked the whole day. I got her messenger, we struck up a conversation on alcohol. She said to me ‚Äúyou sound really fun to get drunk with, we should get drunk together‚Äù. I hesitated cause I‚Äôm anxious all the time but I agreed.

That night, we got crossed (drunk and high together) and it was amazing. I rang my mate who drove us just around the town while we blasted music, opened down the window and shouted the lyrics at pedestrians. The next day, we hung out again then a couple days later. We‚Äôve been high and got drunk numerous times over the past 3 weeks.

However, after the last time we hang, I felt she hasn‚Äôt felt like talking. Usually our texts go back and forth easily but now she is giving one word responses or leaving me on read. I asked her, when we gonna hang again, she left me on read. This always happens, it must be my fault. Maybe I message too much

Could I have offended her last time I was drunk? Is she sick of me? Am I boring? I‚Äôm lying in bed depressed rn and wanna cry. The last 3 weeks have been the highlight of my life, I want to continue but what‚Äôs wrong with me

And I wanted to let you guys here know, that if you are lonely, and you just want someone to listen to you about what's going through your head and in your life without saying so much, I can be there. 
I know how is to be lonely and maybe, if you want, I can also reply once in a while. I can be your diary.

but that clicking doesnt happen, you know the one where you feel comfortable with someone, and feel like you can talk to them about anything? where you both are on the same wavelength

when the ice breaks, and you become close! then the magic happens where you feel less lonely in this world...but that never happens anymore. how can i get close to people and be comfortable with them? the getting to know them process gives me so much anxiety and uncomfortable feelings, i ask them questions and try to get to know their interests but it still feels like on page one, then they disappear.

I don‚Äôt have real life friends because i just don‚Äôt share the same interests or vibe as the people that were potentials.

I am back home from spending months with her and I hate it. I realised that I can‚Äôt rely on my own energy to enjoy even 80% of my day alone. 

I‚Äôve given up on the idea of friends. My guidelines aren‚Äôt strict but maybe too specific, if I was going to have a friend, I would want someone whose musically diverse, loves video games, respects boundaries, isn‚Äôt afraid to share or cry.

1203,v6xbap,Technos_PotatoMinion,"I am a 15 year old going through maturity and all that puberty stuff including all the anxiety and I'm developing trust issues

I had this childhood friend that I've known ever since I was in kindergarten all the way up till now so that's a solid 12 to 13 years of growing up with each other and we're really close, but ever since we went to different highschools I've started doubting myself if I really know this friend of mine anymore since I can't even find a topic or activity that we both enjoy anymore, because I'm more of a conservative kind of guy and my friend is more outgoing and likes to hang around people so I'm starting to feel like I don't know this friend of mine anymore cuz I can't really connect to him or enjoy his company anymore and I don't know if it's me or him.

Recently I started getting super anxious because my friend usually leaves me on seen in the group chat whenever I try to chat with him, and the fact that he keeps showing me screenshots of him talking to other people 
e.g screenshots of jokes,him flirting and other stuff that doesn't help with me being anxious about our stale friendship

I barely even talk to him Mano a Mano and we usually only text these days if he even texts back  but everytime we do ever chat I feel like the topics never really change or have gotten deep like they used to, it just seemed like we have nothing in common anymore and I find this frustrating since whenever we go out for an outing with friends I'm always lagging behind the group since it's a group that only consists of people he knows but I dont, and this only makes it harder for me to talk to him since I always lag behind the group all by myself and it started to make me feel singled out, like that one extra friend in the back of every group that only got invited cuz someone knows me.

I don't really have any one I can share this with comfortably so I decided to post it to this group since I believe the people here would sympathize  

I'm sorry if the sentences just kept jumping from one thing to another and I appreciate the people who read through all my rants and I'm sorry if my grammar makes it hard for you to understand what I'm trying to say. :L",2022-06-07 14:34:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616774707,1,/r/lonely/comments/v6xbap/being_left_out/,,0,2,being left out

1226,v722o9,honey9745,"I (21F) started seeing this guy (22M) in October of 2020. We became very close even though he said he wasn't looking for anything serious. Obviously, I shouldn't have entertained this but too late for that now. He was actively seeing and sleeping with other women and I became obsessive over him.

We ended things in January 2021 but I couldn't get over him. I tried no contact for a bit but that ended with me drunkenly facetiming him begging for him back.

I saw him a few times at the start of 2021 and we tried to be friends but that obviously didn't work. We would sleep together whenever we saw each other. And my heart would break because I loved him and I knew he didn't love me back. 

I've seen him a handful of times since. Twice over that summer then nothing for 9 months. In those 9 months I would try to see him and just continually embarrass myself. I saw him for the first time again at the end of April.

I know we will never be together but I'm still heartbroken and I still love him. He doesn't know I feel this way, I've never told him.

I've tried everything to get over him and nothing works. And whenever I start seeing someone else I know I would leave them in a heartbeat for him.

I've been thinking about telling him how I truly feel so I can begin to get over it. 

Any advice at all?",2022-06-07 17:25:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644188684,7,/r/lonely/comments/v722o9/how_do_i_get_over_him/,,0,3,How Do I Get Over Him?

1232,v72ydp,HeatLightning,"I am lonely. Since you're browsing this sub I suppose you are too.

Somehow my old friends have faded away, and I've been struggling to make new ones.

They say that love is like a fart - if you force it, it's shit.

On one hand it also applies to friendships - you cannot force a connection if one doesn't happen naturally. But on the other hand, friendships also require effort and commitment.

So I decided to introduce myself to this community, and maybe some of you will feel they want to connect with me and see where it leads. So here are some facts about me off the top of my head:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 37 year old male from Europe.

Single, no kids.

From all the arts, music is definitely #1 for me. I like melodic punk rock from 90s/2000s, but also a lot of indie folk, singer-songwriter, ambient, ska and other mellow stuff. 

I value sincerity, kindness and respect.

I studied psychology and wanted to become a psychotherapist but never finished my masters.

I know what anxiety and depression are.

I used to be really into philosophy and spirituality, but in the end questioning the universe too much lead to paradoxes my mind couldn't handle, so I willfully turned away from those topics to spare myself the existential anxiety.

I've traveled most of European countries, US and India.

I will share memes.

I don't believe in any gods, but I believe in life after death.

Lately I've mostly been working in tourism.

I think I have a pretty good sense of humor since I do tend to make people laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

That's about it for now, I guess. If any of you decide to reach out to me, I'll be honored.",2022-06-07 17:58:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1355403986,12,/r/lonely/comments/v72ydp/this_is_me_do_you_think_we_could_be_friends/,,0,3,This is me. Do you think we could be friends?
1233,v731o4,cshwicky29,Sorry if I rant a little bit but I don‚Äôt understand how I should feel anymore and I need some outside advice on my situation. I‚Äôll go a little deep into my personal life so y‚Äôall can sympathize a little bit with me. Growing up I lived as poor as it gets my mom had cancer four times throughout my life I‚Äôm only 20 she also had a heart attack and a triple bypass surgery so she couldn‚Äôt really support me like a mother should have and I don‚Äôt Blame her for her health issues at all my mom is a very nurturing person. As I get older I understand all she sacrificed for me and my siblings. My dad got two women pregnant at once so I had a brother 6 months older than me that I was basically twins with we did everything and at 16 he died from a drug overdose. Which surprised me because we were inseparable and even though I know he smoked and drank I‚Äôve never seen him pop a pill which really surprised me and my family. After that it really affected my dad and a month ago due to lots of reasons my dad committed suicide. I also don‚Äôt blame him for it because I know why and understand why he killer himself but for me I‚Äôm my life I‚Äôve grown up so strong and dependent on myself that I do everything by myself and for myself.  To the point I got a full ride scholarship to college I make good money I have great things on track for me in my life but I‚Äôm lost and idk how to feel anymore. To be honest I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm typing this right now I just don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore and idk how to step forward. When my bestfriend/brother is gone and the strongest role model in my life committed suicide. The only person I have left is my other siblings and my mom but my mom is deathly Ill and I‚Äôm the oldest so I feel a lot of pressure on me but the thing is I‚Äôm only 20 and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I do so much for other people and myself that I‚Äôm so strong and people depend on me but now it seems as if I have no one to depend on and I‚Äôm not suicidal or even depressed. Generally I‚Äôm a very optimistic person but idk what to be optimistic about anything anymore when I feel this lost.,2022-06-07 18:01:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1533718214,1,/r/lonely/comments/v731o4/need_advice/,,0,0,Need advice
1234,v739sn,My-Universe,"I‚Äôll always be the 3rd wheel.

I have so many friends yet so few of them actually acknowledge my existence. I can think of only one or two that actually does. I feel like they aren‚Äôt real either for some reason. 

I often feel like I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs real, or maybe the opposite and I‚Äôm the only one who isn‚Äôt real. When I tag along I‚Äôm hardly noticed. When I speak up people ignore me. Sometimes they treat me like a kid. My parents are always nice to me because I‚Äôm their kid, they always try to sugarcoat stuff. They don‚Äôt know how to respond when I insist that I am ignored.

Most of my time is spent in my own head. Things are better in my head. In my head, everything is interesting, more complex, more meaningful. If I didn‚Äôt have such a vivid imagination, I‚Äôd die.

Trying to talk to people usually gets me ignored. When people do talk to me it makes me happy but when we stop talking I hate that it‚Äôs over or am relieved for some reason. I have about 10 or more friends yet I feel as if I‚Äôm one of the loneliest people ever. No one really replies to my posts on twitter, despite having a few followers on it. Only few respond to my reddit posts.

I think I‚Äôm destined to be forever lonely, constantly chasing some kind of positive attention but failing. My closest friends hardly appreciate the accomplishments I‚Äôm proud of. I won 2nd place in a writing contest, yet no one talked about it. Only one of my friends were willing to read my story. My closest friend didn‚Äôt even want to read it even though I‚Äôve read his. I feel hopeless. I hate saying it out loud but I really want attention, but I‚Äôm not willing to do anything scummy to get it, and that‚Äôs the hard part. I want people to know me for the right reasons, have people who look up to me, who are interested in what I‚Äôm interested in.

1245,v75hv5,Evildominion37,"I wouldn't say I dont feel any emotions, because at times I'll feel irritated, guilty, amused, embarrassed, I'll have anxiety and sometimes stress, but thats pretty much it. Even these can only last a few seconds before they fade, as I can laugh(exhale through my nose) at something that amuses me. I can feel tense when something irritates me, I feel embarrassed constantly and feel guilty over every minor inconvenience I cause someone. I apologise for everything and genuinely feel guilt. 

Over time, I noticed that I'll have anywhere from a week to a 3 month long period of what I call being neutral, and not overall feeling anything, and then another period of time about the same length of what I call being down. When I'm neutral, I dont overthink, I barely get stressed, and school doesn't really affect my mental health. And then out of nowhere, with zero cause, I'll have a period of time when I'm down. I'll get stressed over the little things, get major anxiety over school, overthink everything, and just not want to exist. I just want to be in bed, asleep, forever. I overthink and wonder, ""do I even have a future ahead of me"", ""I have zero useful skills, what could I even do with my life"" and stuff like that. I'll just want to give up on everything, and then everything is neutral again. No negative thoughts, but nothing positive either.

In my everyday life, I just feel neutral until something happens, and then I react by being excited, irritated or stressed. Nothing else. Not much means anything to me, which sounds vague, but family for example. I dont care about my family, simply because we share the same blood. I only care about my mother, sister, niece and nephews, but I feel indifferent towards everyone else. I sit on the fence about everything, not because I can't make up my mind, but because I dont care about it to contribute. For example, I have nothing against the lgbt community, but I'm not going to put effort into supporting them, neither will I do anything against them. Same with feminism, racism, politics, basic rights, etc. I have no thoughts on anything. 

Everyday I feel like I'm just trying to blend in and act like a human, feeling like an alien wherever I go, not feeling comfortable in my body and lacking any motivation to do anything. I don't like the physical act of talking doesn't matter who or what to, but I don't like it. I feel uncomfortable even telling my dog to sit, and I feel uncomfortable around others. I play playstation online with my mates and  usually force myself to smile to change how I talk. Nobody sees it, and it doesn't affect how I say it, but it does at the same time. I force myself to sound happier as to not ruin the mood or sound like I'm seeking attention. I constantly just feel like an Alien trying to fit in, and thats my best explanation.

At some point I just realised that I have literally no one to talk to, to ask out for a walk or to invite to a birthday.

I tried to convince myself that I don't need people in my life, I don't like them anyways, all those loud people with lots of friends are annoying and it's my choice not to talk to anybody. It also seemed like it worked and people really saw in me someone who doesn't want to talk or get any kind of attention.

Otherwise, it's not uncommon for me to spend an entire grade without making any friend at all
Like for example, 7th grade.
It's harder to find people who have the same interests as I do, it's hard to find someone who thinks as I do, 
It's hard to talk to people because it's hard to act like an actual normal human when doing interactions like, saying the correct things or doing the correct motions to not appear as boring and unenthusiastic, or over the top

1313,v7eveb,AdGold7910,"Hi, I just need to let this out. I am feeling kind of sad. I don't admit how lonely I feel cause it has gotten better, but it's really been hitting me lately. I struggle with daydreaming and laying in bed most of the day because I struggle with my energy or find I trail off and start talking out loud to myself. I try to reach out to others when I feel that way instead of talking to myself, but it's so hard. I feel like it just pushes people away. It seems like people ignore me, stop talking to me, or I am the one reaching out if I want anyone to talk to. I try not to be negative or talk about my emotions, but it's been challenging not to. I went through periods of years in my life where I didn't really have anyone to talk to and it feels like this has been building up for a long time. I feel so needy and like people just are put off by it. I have tried to not talk about certain things and not reach out as much and even before that I was dealing with voice problems that would make it hard to talk, so I would sent long texts instead especially since I'm a writer and would have a hard time not doing that. I also have tried to stop talking when I am by myself, but would experience throat tension and pain when I would try to stop the habit. I feel like I've been stuck in this cycle for a long time. I want to get out of it but I don't know how. I want to stop pushing people away, but I also want to break this habit and I don't know how when sometimes I just want someone to talk to, but everyone is busy and it feels like no one else needs anyone. I feel embarassed that I struggle with this because I always feel like the only one that ever reaches out. I try to cope with this by spending time with God and connecting to him because it reminds me when I feel like I have no one or I'm reaching out to people, he's the only one that can really give me what I need. But then I get in a habit of wanting to completely isolate from people. I also exercise when I'm really bored and have anxious energy and really like to sing to fill the silence now that my voice is better than it was and like learning new things and going on Youtube, but I end up laying in bed a lot of the day when I start doing that. It's like I have to have some way to fill the loneliness or I just feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know if I just want to vent, but I don't know how to get out of this cycle. Thanks to anyone for reading this or replying.

I still have no friends going on like 10 years. It literally has to be me at this point but I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I recently started speaking to people like saying hello and stuff to my co workers at work it‚Äôs building confidence. I go to college online. I honestly go to work and come home and then I‚Äôm home or with my mom the rest of the time. I need to start getting out more but I have no idea where to go to meet other 21 year old girl loners because most girls already have a group of girlfriends they hang out with. It makes me feel insane like wtf is actually wrong with me. I‚Äôm into like semi regular shit I collect snowglobes and love shopping and photography and crafting and going out and going to restaurants. 

I‚Äôm not like weird I‚Äôm shy as hell I‚Äôll kinda like play the background until I get the courage to say hello to someone or something but besides that I‚Äôm pretty normal. I grew up kinda spoiled I guess so I can def tell when there‚Äôs a disconnect with people when they realize that but it‚Äôs not an obnoxious thing. I just like what I want at that moment I know it sounds kinda bad but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôm not rude to servers or anything Ok for example if I have the money or whatever I‚Äôll say I wanna go to xyz and then I‚Äôm getting ready to go I don‚Äôt like waiting around for stuff like I want whatever it is right then. I‚Äôve tried bumble tinder etc and I just don‚Äôt connect. I want like someone to go do artsy shit with. I wanna get dressed up and have fun. I don‚Äôt wanna get high or Drunk or hook up. Ive been finding ways to maybe get better at my social skills and I know a few things I need to work on but will I literally be fucking alone forever?? 


I‚Äôve never successfully gone through a period of isolation I hate it it‚Äôs boring it‚Äôs miserable. I feel isolated every day and I figured maybe if I finally become ok with it it‚Äôll pass and my friends will come but it‚Äôs so hard and lonely and I just don‚Äôt like it.

1341,v7h20q,CubicEquationman,"I (13M) like math. I want to talk about math. I used to do math for fun. Nobody I know in my life gives a shit about math. If I bring it up, even my closest friends and family just want me to shut up. Like, ""I didn't understand that."" And then they just move on to some depressing topic about the news and shit. So I did what people told me to. I shut my mouth, stopped expressing my love for math. If nobody understands me, or enjoys the topic, why should I even bother talking? You know, this isn't just about math anymore. This is about literally any topic. Whenever I talk, I just feel like nobody cares or there's just a moment of silence where everybody just stares me down and moves on to a different topic. Unless I talk half-heartedly about a topic that the majority of people would enjoy, which is not even topics I'm even comfortable with most of the time.

So. After a while, it feels like you become what you talk about. I feel like I'm being morphed into a ""regular person."" I end up having all my passions and interests just thrown away. I used to love science. I wanted to be a paleontologist when I was 8. I dove deep into the subject. I read everything I could read about dinosaurs. I eventually ended that interest a few years later, but it was good because I still loved science. It just shifted over to chemistry, then physics, and then math. But this time, I feel like it's different. I feel like math is going to be the last one to go. Then I'll just be... I don't know. I'll just exist. I don't know how to relate to other people. It feels like a burden to like math. Everybody thinks I can just go and solve this random math problem. In all my past experience, I haven't been pressured to do something extremely well. I keep doubting my knowledge of math. I feel like I'm dumb in the one thing people think I'm smart at. I've hit a dead end in my learning of math. I don't know how I can learn anything past this point. I don't have anybody to motivate me to continue it.

i need to stop comparing myself and just focus on my own situation because its not helpful at all and obviously i have my own particular set of problems that not everyone can relate to but still, i cant help but feel like shit every time i read something to the effect of ""just lost my virginity and i feel AMAZING!"" knowing i probably wont ever know the feeling, i can only imagine it, but its just out of my grasp. its almost like i feel the person posting it is rubbing it in my face, trying to remind me how worthless i am compared to them, even if they're just trying to share their own success because they feel good about it. i wish i could delete envy and jealousy from myself and simply focus on my own situation, because other people discussing their success usually only demotivates me. i fucking wish i could get rid of my bitterness and either be at peace with my situation, or at least not make my situation worse by comparing myself to people who escaped the loneliness. that is all, just another useless venting post",2022-06-08 05:47:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605339567,6,/r/lonely/comments/v7i5h6/i_wish_i_could_delete_envy_from_my_list_of/,,0,1,i wish i could delete 'envy' from my list of emotions

1352,v7j3u5,keopispoons,"I graduated college and moved abroad at the start of the pandemic for work, and I love my job. It helps that I work full-time. But unfortunately I have literally 3 friends because it‚Äôs been so hard to get out and meet new people. 2 of my friends I met in college and knew before I moved here, the other is a guy I met on tinder that I ended up being good friends with. Because my 3 friends all have social lives and other friends from before I came, I spend a lot of time alone. 

I gained 20kg by the end of 2021 from bulimia and lost all my confidence. I don‚Äôt know how to dress for my new body, however temporary it will be. On top of that, I feel like I have a bad personality, and I don‚Äôt even have my looks to help make up for that anymore. 

I went to a club with one of my friends this past weekend and I panicked at the thought of talking with new people. I felt like my anxiety and lack of confidence brought down the mood because I kept looking to my friend for reassurance or help. When I did talk to new people, I ended up getting forcibly touched or kissed by men who I thought were just being nice. 

Friday is my birthday, and my goal was to not spend it alone, but it looks like I might because my friends are busy (through no fault of their own) and I don‚Äôt know how to go out on my own anymore. The pandemic destroyed my social skills, and I don‚Äôt know how to have a solo date with myself anymore or go out and meet new people.

1353,v7jab3,ChonkyHonkle,"Alr. So... I'm in middle school (the year ended on the 7th though) and I'm single. This might not really be a surprise. I've had my eye on this girl for a really long time. I was friends with her and everything and we were getting along, but then I discovered she had a girlfriend. At this point, I said something a little fucked up to her. This was near the beginning of the school year. Fast forward to a month ago. We are friends again and we are friendly. I only have one class with her so I don't really get to talk to her in person that much. I have been talking to her and trying to grow a strong friendship with her. She is single but had her eye on this one girl for a while. She has been a little flirty with me and vice versa. She has even sent me a picture that said ""I ‚ù§ U."" I have drawn her a portrait of her and also freehanded a picture of roses bc she said she liked flowers. In the picture, I wrote ""I love you ‚ù§ "" in the top middle and there were hearts in the background. She said she liked it a lot. She didn't really say anything about what I put. I might be going to the mall with her some time soon but I have make it a double thing with my friend and his gf bc she isn't allowed to be alone with boys. I might jave 4got to say this but the girl I'm talking about is Bi. So yeah. I'm trying to shoot my shot but it's kinda hard. My only 2 friends in a relationship are helping me a little. I don't only like her for her looks (she's really hot though ü•µ). I love her more than I have ever loved anyone. She understands me and has legitimately stopped me from killing myself. I really like her but I'm worried that we might just stay friends and never become more. I barely even get to talk to her. We text most days, but it'd hard. I need help. I'm just trying to end off 2022 without being alone üòî.  *sigh* I'm so alone.

I realise now that as I‚Äôm getting older (21f) and I don‚Äôt have to be around people, I‚Äôm just not around people and it‚Äôs so lonely. I have lost a lot of friends to this since we no longer have to hang, but I‚Äôve failed to gain any new friends, I only have one solid friend left. More than anything I miss having a relationship, perhaps it‚Äôs just a delusion but I feel like if I still had her in my life I‚Äôd feel so much more content. But that bridge is burnt. So I should find a new partner right? Well there are certainly no bidders cuz I am so ridiculously unappealing (and it‚Äôs fair: fat, ugly, awkward, no drive, no exciting hobbies, few friends). Sure I couldn‚Äôt fix it all but there are defo many ways I know I could do better, I know there are ways I can improve myself, I could lose weight, eat better, work out, go out, initiate convos, attend events, even just go outside, but it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a brick wall of insecurity and fear in front of me. Part of me is so unwilling to change despite the fact I know it would make my life better. Is this why I‚Äôm depressed? Or is it depression that‚Äôs making me unwilling to change? Or am I not depressed at all, just incredibly dramatic and in need of an excuse? Lots to ponder. 

All I know for sure is I hate my life right now, I spend most of my day living in a fantasy world in my head, it‚Äôs comforting when I don‚Äôt think about the reality of my life. I‚Äôm too embarrassed to admit any of this to people in my real life because I know how cringey sad it sounds. It‚Äôs taken me this long just to admit it to myself. Just sucks feeling trapped in an isolated prison I put myself in

She left because she said that she wasn‚Äôt getting enough attention and was not happy in the relationship. I was caught off guard because it came out of nowhere.

I'm getting married next year and I have no friends to even invite it's honestly embarrassing, I've told my partner how I've felt and he's been supportive and understanding. I just want someone to hang out with even better if it's another couple or play games online with and chat I'm a kind person but I just seem to always attract the sh*tty people. I met a girl just before Christmas everything was fine then the cracks started to appear pretty sure she was a narcissist and she ruined my confidence and used me, then I met another two girls one was just a gossip the other had alot of issues (she lied about a pregnancy to her partner for months) so I cut those out. I've tried playing on games to connect with people like plato but alot of it is just people don't talk or men being inappropriate with you. I've downloaded discord in hope to speak to people (I have anxiety but I'm trying) whilst I play my switch.
So I know this is a long shot but if anyone is in the same boat I'm open to make friends! I live in West London I like playing switch but open to playing other games too on mobile. I like baking, cooking, I swear way too much but totally down to earth, I like movie nights and girly stuff and dogs.

1434,v7xeza,IceLikesReddit,"I am sorry in advance for boring you with this venting. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about teenagers with no friends or just fake friends.

They are all acquaintances. They will use ANYTHING I say for a comeback against me. ANYTHING. There are so many thoughts I do not share to them because of this. This is why I‚Äôm so silent not only with them, but with everyone I know.
It is enough for a few to do this, and then for almost no one to stand up for me, to make me feel very lonely. It‚Äôs been like this for months/years, but I‚Äôve only come to realise now that this is not normal. I try to cut ties with the worst of these people, but whenever there‚Äôs a hangout with my other friends, they also get invited. I won‚Äôt be going out with them; it‚Äôd rather stay alone at home. I also don‚Äôt have any other groups to hang out with since most of them treat me like shit and pretend to have a crush on me. Basically, few people want me.
The fact that I have to write this post on Reddit makes me even lonelier, as I‚Äôd say this to a close friend. But I don‚Äôt have any close friends. The closest friendships I have are talking a couple of times a week, at school, and sharing some memes. Nothing deep.
I‚Äôll be changing schools and I do not know whether to be happy or frightened. Will it better as I meet a whole new set of people? Will be worse as I won‚Äôt be able to make any friends? Will it be just a worse version of this school? Probably the second or third.
School ended, and at least I do not have to see those people everyday for the rest of summer.
On top of this, I feel like I have no skill, but hopefully that will be ameliorated as I‚Äôll start a Youtube channel this summer since I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm good at video editing. I‚Äôll probably just give up after half a year out of lack of motivation and no gain in audience. Absolutely none of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù will care.
I‚Äôm stunned about how a Redditor thought my English was impressive when I hadn‚Äôt even told him it‚Äôs my second langauge.
At this point it doesn‚Äôt matter if one of them finds this post and realises it‚Äôs me, because they just do not care.

It makes me cry everytime I write one of these posts and everytime someone comments on one of them.

They all like pissing me off.
They all hate me.

I‚Äôm sorry. This is too long. I just feel less bad when I know a couple of people read my thoughts.
I‚Äôm lonely as fuck.

Maybe they think that there's nothing wrong in being alone but you should never find it lonely as you have your company always. Doesn't quite fit right with me. How can you be fine knowing that you are probably the only one who views and describes things a particular way? Maybe that's where I need to work.

1535,v89acf,xove-e,"Doesn't everyone sometimes just want to leave everything behind and start somewhere new in hope for a better life... That's what I hoped for when my family decided to move to our home country.

It was in that time period where covid was a really big thing and we figured out it was the best for us to move back to our home country. But the situation was still kinda weird with the place we lived at so we decided that i should go first while the others figure things out.
It was pretty quick I finished school and a few months after I traveled to my aunt where I'd stay. The first weeks were really good but things slowly started to turn. I don't wanna go in detail but basically our families had a lot of disagreements regarding my situation and the end result of all of that was me living in a near city by myself.

It was the first time that I would be living alone, so I was really excited and didn't think that things could end up bad. So first weeks exploring was some of the best time. Getting to know the life as an adult. But due to my age and other things I couldn't work so I just stayed there and waited for my birthday to come in a few months. In that time I was trying a lot of things like playing basketball or going to the gym there, but eventually it slowly turned into me isolating myself.
Big reason for that was probably the fact that I have problems with the language because I didn't grew up there. 
The few only human interaction I had was at the store to the cashier or occasionally playing video games with friends from my hometown.

But there it was when I first felt that loneliness. And this feeling increased every day until I was so depressed that I wouldn't even want to go to buy food or answer calls from my family. I was just waiting for my birthday so I could start working somewhere to have a chance to create something. Time passes and its just constant depression and loneliness. But what was killing me inside was that I couldn't tell anyone, because I hid everything from my friends and build this Fassade that im living my best life together with my family because I didn't want them to worry about my situation. So i began to distance myself from everyone and distracted myself with videogames or anime.
I'd be outside for maximum 20 minutes a day and had no energy at all. But I just have to keep waiting and then I can start that's what I've been telling myself all through out the time.

I was or still am living in a city where i can't speak the language that well, without any friends or any social circle depressed af coming home to no one.

But then the time has come my aunt found a place I could work at construction and tbh that's its not that bad. But it's just the fact that I come home from work to no one, sitting on my bed tired and hungry without any joy.

My fam still can't move here and I'm starting to loose my patience. If this goes on for longer i I don't thing I'll be able to hold it anymore and would just take my stuff and go somewhere else without anyone, because that's basically what it is right now...without anyone.

If somebody can relate or lives in a similar stage like this in your life, just know your not alone there's others who go thru similar things!

To my Dearest Someone,

I may not be perfect. I may have not remembered each moment excatly or what i did, or what i said. Or how things happened. But i always remeber how i felt.

Believing in you. Trusting you. Supporting you. Each and every meal I cooked. Each and every time you got sick and i took care of you. each and every conversation and story you have shared and I listened to. Sleeping with you. Being beside you. Looking in your eyes. Our skins touching. Our hands Holding. Our kiss. Our laughs. Our hopes. Our dreams. I felt everything.

I may not be rich and smart and good loking. I am poor, fat, dumb and stupid. But it always felt like love. Thats what i felt. Love. The kind of love that would last a lifetime. The grow old and die with you kind of love.

You saying it isnt. You saying it wasnt. You 
saying your rationalisations and misconceptions about it. You saying you dont know what love is, was the most painful thing i felt in all of my years of exsistence. Did you really not feel it?

Well i tried. I really really tried. I am still. But when you quit and decided that our world should end Especially when you began having feelings for someone else. Choosing and deciding to act, to find out your truth with that someone, i was left in a loop. In an endless state of preplexity. I still am.

For I am not a vision nor an enigma from some distant future residing in your subconcious/ some mysterious land scape. I am a real person in the present who really really loves you. Who cares for you and is willing to share his life with you till the end. To have and to hold, For richer and for poorer. In sickness and in health. Till death do us 
part. Thats how it was supposed to be. Thats how i thought it would be. But it wasnt.

I dont think I will ever understand and recover from this.

I was whole. I used to have this mental image of who i am and what things are, of who you are and of what our life is and will be. How we would survive, recover and build and do evrything. Now I am so damaged i dont know who i am anymore, what to believe in and what is left to fight for.

I want you to know these things. For this is our story. Whatever people say, this narrative happened. This may only last a single page on the current new chapters that your exciting new life is having, but i want you to know what it cost. What was lost. I wish you really do stand to gain for all the martyred dreams, efforts, beliefs, time and person due 
to this event.

1543,v8a0rb,Altruistic-Coat-1673,"Personally, 

After a lot of traumatic experiences, I couldn‚Äôt really function well and that made me have a lot of experiences that others couldn‚Äôt relate to. Which made me withdrawn from just everything you could say. 

Probably developed depression and went through extremely dark times where I really had an empty cup, and couldn‚Äôt maintain anything or felt like doing anything. 

I wouldn‚Äôt really blame myself though, sorta just a life happens type of thing. After being alone for so long, it kinda feels comfortable even though I know it‚Äôs unhealthy. 

I know I don‚Äôt have the best social skills since it‚Äôs something you need to do everyday and being alone doesn‚Äôt really improve it, but it also has to come from a genuine desire, can‚Äôt force relationships. So if you genuinely don‚Äôt want friends don‚Äôt force it. 

I think going through a lot of traumatic experiences make you want to stay in your safe comfort zone. And meeting new people and putting yourself out there is obviously a vulnerable and uncomfortable thing to do. So I‚Äôm slowly working myself up to do those things.

Internally, I know I want all those great things but realistically my pace is slower and tentative. I also am afraid to invest alot into relationships to not have them work out.",2022-06-09 06:00:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648779963,1,/r/lonely/comments/v8a0rb/why_do_you_think_youre_lonely_if_ur_comfortable/,,0,3,Why do you think you‚Äôre lonely?

1547,v8a7t6,bestieharem,"Kinda a vent. It‚Äôs hard for me to get to know people, much less become friends with them and it might be due to the discrepancy between how I look vs. how I act. I‚Äôve dealt with social anxiety disorder my entire life which has gotten increasingly severe over time. I feel like I‚Äôm not an interesting person and have always hated myself for various reasons, a big one being that I‚Äôm not funny or charismatic. Because of my lack of control in life (over the disorder), I tried to compensate by improving my appearance. I learned how to do makeup really well, lost weight and got skinny again, cared a ton about my outfits and making sure not a hair was out of place. If you saw me in passing, you‚Äôd probably think I have no problem making friends or getting along with people because of ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù. 

This worked against me though because people are generally intimidated or won‚Äôt approach me (and the fact I have RBF doesn‚Äôt help). I‚Äôve been told this many times. Students at my college with a similar ‚Äúlook‚Äù have tried to talk to me but get turned off immediately by my awkward responses. I don‚Äôt know how to act chill and can‚Äôt come up with smooth off-the-cuff responses like a lot of people around me. The kind of people I can make friends with and genuinely relate to don‚Äôt try to approach me and I get treated with suspicion when I try to talk to them and make a connection. It sucks because I‚Äôd totally go without makeup and never dress ‚Äúnice‚Äù if I didn‚Äôt have self-esteem issues and fear of judgment. If I gave up my image, I‚Äôd have literally nothing to hold up my self-esteem. Sure, I have a good GPA and a good resume. I have a family that praises my accomplishments and appreciates me as a person. But I always feel super inferior and isolated. I have only a couple friends so I‚Äôm never in the loop for what‚Äôs going on, and I feel like I‚Äôm developmentally behind after missing out on two decades of normal socialization.

This is all due to the damn disorder, I‚Äôve given up the idea of having kids in my head because I‚Äôd never want them to inherit my mental issues and go through their lives as painfully alone as I am. I‚Äôm an extrovert trapped in a brain that shuts down in front of new people and makes me feel like I‚Äôm drowning in public situations. I‚Äôve been scathingly self-critical since childhood and I feel like that bleeds into the way I carry myself to the point others can sense it. I don‚Äôt have female friends because I‚Äôm scared of being judged by other girls, and guys only try to get to know me because of my appearance. I‚Äôve had a few toxic relationships that further messed up my psyche, and I quickly lost my relationship with the only guy who‚Äôs everything I wanted because he saw how bitter and misanthropic I am inside. I would love to love people, but my whole life I‚Äôve been stepped on, rejected, bullied when I made wholehearted bids for connection. At some point this year, I came to the point where I no longer felt lonely turning on my phone to zero notifications. 

Recently I‚Äôve started an internship and also been on Omegle to practice my social skills. Onboarding with the other interns has been isolating‚Äî I see these strangers interacting and building rapport so easily. I spoke up frequently in the many meetings we had to attend, forcing myself out of my comfort zone and being super friendly and upbeat, but people treated me differently still. Somehow it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a social contract and I‚Äôm aware of its existence but can‚Äôt seem to figure out its rules. Today we were doing some crafts with the company‚Äôs wellness committee and I turned off my webcam in the middle and stopped working on my thing because I was depressed. The activities just felt meaningless to me. I acted upbeat and was very smiley with my parents but I went up to my room after work and have just been on my phone for hours since.

I‚Äôve started feeling lonely again. In the past week on Omegle, I met a few other college students I really got along with. I talked for at least an hour with each of them and I really connected with this one girl in school for art and journalism. She came into the call with this enthusiastic openness and I was able to match her energy. I‚Äôm generally really friendly on Omegle to everyone I meet and finally I found someone with the same vibe. We got so comfortable talking with each other, off the bat I felt this feeling I‚Äôd been missing for a long time. It was like talking to a close friend. I was so relaxed that I was cracking jokes constantly and making her laugh‚Äî the conversation was super organic and we even made a dating profile for her after I told her some of my crazy stories. With her and the other couple of students, I was able to speak without a shred of anxiety like I hadn‚Äôt done in such a long time.

I am grateful that I met these people. It reminded me of how it was with the two or three real friends I‚Äôve had over the course of my life. I haven‚Äôt had that feeling of genuine happiness and human connection in years. I got their contact info but I know we won‚Äôt be in touch. They each have their own lives and actual friends, and I was able to fake being like that for the duration of our calls. I wish desperately that I was able to meet people like them near me. If I‚Äôd come across them in real life though, we probably would never have spoken. Feeling these old feelings again has caused me to slip into a depression these past couple days. Now I‚Äôm constantly checking my phone for notifications like I haven‚Äôt done in months. 

I feel lonely again. I thought I‚Äôd gotten past it for good and accepted my lot. But I can‚Äôt find much meaning in life without being able to connect with other people. I‚Äôve lost my hobbies over time and now I don‚Äôt feel any joy or excitement towards life. There‚Äôs just apathy. I feel like I‚Äôm just dragging myself through every day. I started staying up late again even though I hate being sleep-deprived because that‚Äôs the only time I don‚Äôt have to confront reality. The feeling of being accepted was addictive. The rest of this summer is just going to be putting on a persona and faking enthusiasm in this internship when really I feel dread about my future working a 9-5 and the emptiness. I‚Äôd kill to have a purpose again. I wish God was real so at least I‚Äôd have someone to keep me company.",2022-06-09 06:12:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630995291,1,/r/lonely/comments/v8a7t6/i_look_puttogether_from_the_outside_but_i_feel/,,0,5,I look put-together from the outside but I feel like I have nothing?

1550,v8apl3,FuckTrapMetal,"I've done screwed up things before and lost friends for no reason. One of my close high school friends blocked me a few months ago and never said anything again. One of my other friends hate me too cuz I made an n word joke (we've known each other for a few years and I thought we were very close) and now he hates me too. Everyone that hates me all know each other and was basically one big friend group and I feel it was because of the shit I said to him. I was already known to make dark humor around people and said the n word from a vine that he we liked and I guess he hated it. Idk why this would ruin a bunch of friendships I have. I wish I said sorry about it back then but he just built it up for 2 yeats and decided in the middle of senior year to spit it out at me when ive shared how grateful i am to have him as a friend. They may think I'm a racist pos even tho I love everyone of any kinda and even make tons of jokes making fun of my own life and of the fact that I'm jewish. They all knew it and that pushed the last straw I guess. But even before then I was lonely and I loved this group because they seemed to want to actually call me and talk. I never got that from anyone and even had thoughts of harming myself in my school (I graduated so don't worry I would never do such a thing) and I guarantee nobody would care and walk over me. That's what I was basically to everyone. Even got made fun of for being a poser or being someone that wants attention which I never was. I knew this girl who I was talking about in the beginning since freshman year and we talked so damn much. I had some of the best conversations with her and now will never talk to her or any of them again. I just feel like a pos who thought was funny but realized that I was just a scumbag that had a shit humor preference. Now I've just got to a point where I said fuck it and I dont care about people at all. So I became more of a dick to people at the end of senior year and it felt kinda great. Something I wish I was more often and even got suspended because some people took me seriously about crap I've said (which I obviously wasn't, they were just intrusive thoughts). I'm kinda in a state now of whether I feel liek crap cuz none of my ""current"" friends who are people I've talked to for years before I made high school friends don't even talk to me and now I can't tell if I'm lonely or if I feel I've accomplished something knowing I can easily screw things up. I just can't tell anymore and like I said earlier, I just have dreams of causing harm to myself just to feel a sense of joy knowing that I won't be remembered from people that just didn't like me in general or that never trusted me once I say one bad thing. I'd forgive them if they said something to me even if I hated it but I never just blocked them. So I'm just in a state of maybe things will be better in college but am knowing that with my luck, nobody cares about what I say.

1620,v8lheq,yoohnified,"after going to a new school, i thought i would be able to meet better friends and maybe even be in a clique! however after 3 weeks of being in my current friend group, i couldnt help but notice the way they have been subtly treating me. we're in a group of 5, so naturally the ""least liked"" person in the group would get left out ‚Äî which is me. when we're walking together, the other 4 would get into pairs while im the odd one out walking at the front, middle, or back alone. there was even one time where i was the second person to get my food, hence i went back to our table to sit down. but despite being the second person to sit down, the 3 remaining ""friends"" did not want to sit across me and i was left in the middle with no one across me and with the 2 pairs on either side of me. it was a really shitty feeling because im pretty sure people who walk past our table could easily tell that i was the least liked person in the group. 

today i texted the group chat to state their availability because its the holidays now and we planned to hang out. they ignored my text and when i sent a follow up text jokingly asking why they ignored me, one of them (whom i thought i was the closest to) said, ""i thought it was (another friend's name)'s message so i immediately tapped the chat. but it turns out to be from (my name)"". i was genuinely shock and hurt. no words could explain or express how i felt when i read her message. i was truly speechless and i didnt reply.

1643,v8ozm5,spookymemecollector,"Hey guys, I don‚Äôt know where else to post this  and have even one person understand. I was in an incredibly abusive relationship with a girl for 3.5 years. I had never dated before that, so abuse is and was all I had known. That includes threats of leaving for someone else if I don‚Äôt provide X Y or Z. I‚Äôm talking constantly being told, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not gonna have sex, pay, drive me, whatever else, then I‚Äôm going to go find someone who will!‚Äù. As you can imagine this shattered my self confidence and drove me into a place where I was just sleeping with someone new every couple of days after we broke up because I was trying to get revenge or fill a void. I‚Äôm not sure which, but I lost myself in that trap of promiscuity for about 8 months before finally finding someone I deeply love. It‚Äôs been very uncomfortable for me in this new relationship because I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôve never known a healthy relationship that isn‚Äôt always with strings attached. My girlfriend makes me so happy and I love her so much, but those insecurities and fears are tearing me apart. I don‚Äôt want to continue sharing my fears with my partner because all it serves in my opinion is making her think I think she‚Äôs going to cheat on me or find someone else. She has assured me and made me feel secure non-stop whilst also standing by my adjustments to non-toxicity. She‚Äôs truly my best friend and I love her to a painful degree. However, I don‚Äôt think I can handle it anymore. The constant fear that she‚Äôs either found someone else, or if I ever and I mean EVER don‚Äôt provide everything she wants, that she‚Äôs going to go cheat on me with someone who will. I‚Äôm leaving for a vacation in a couple of days, and the anxiety is crushing me. I can‚Äôt eat, sleep, drink, or communicate well with anyone at the moment. I‚Äôve subconsciously accepted that it‚Äôs either I rip the bandaid off and break up with her now, or I go on this vacation and she finds someone better than me and decides to be with them behind my back or even to my face. I hate my ex for doing this to me and making me feel completely inadequate, but I feel lesser than any other man who could possibly exist. My girlfriend deserves better than me, and I guarantee she will find better than me while I‚Äôm gone. Logically, I know that‚Äôs not necessarily true, but with these insecure traumas screaming at me, I can‚Äôt shake the intrinsic fear and terror feeling that I‚Äôm having. I think I have to break up for my own sanity. I hate that I have been changed this much by my ex and that I‚Äôm potentially going to toss away something that makes both me and my girlfriend deeply in love and extremely happy because I don‚Äôt trust that there‚Äôs not someone better than me that she‚Äôll want.

It's getting worse and worse, I think it started about 2 years ago? It started like something small, it got bigger slowly but now I feel like it's really time to look for some help. I already thought of searching for help but wasn't sure so I looked for people online, on this subreddit or just online friends who I really trusted. And it helped, for a while. But we have passed that for a while now. I noticed today that I am standing on the edge and am about to fall into the deep. I was sitting at my desk like the days before, doing nothing because I was empty. Nothing on my mind, just empty. And I saw my empty glass where I had drank some soda out. And I just wanted to throw it, throw it against the wall just to see it brake. To see it shatter apart into pieces.

I held myself from actually doing it. 
I'm glad I still can.
Thats the reason why I never started drinking, I have been sober for my whole life... not that is hard when you are not so much older than the legal drinking age. But I decided to never drink, never. Yes never say never but I just said it. I never will. I have some other reasons but I'm just scared to get addicted to it, scared to throw myself into it. Scared to hurt others because of that.

I wanted to talk about my best friend about all this. Today is the first time I actually wanted to grasp for help. I knew I needed it for a while but today I actually wanted to look for it. But my exams start on Tuesday and we all are burried in our studies. I can't afford to tell him now. This is not stuff you can have a 15 min-talk about. I need to wait till after the exams to tell him. So I thought about telling my parents because atm that would be the best option but I have to study too and they will talk to me all day wich I get because they don't want their son to feel like this but it's really not the time.

My best friend is also drifting away from me, he is in another class and is really becoming another person. My second best friend has the same only he is still in the same class as me but I can't stand him anymore sometimes. I'm really starting to miss these friends that you can have an actual deep conversation with.

I‚Äôve tried to get her to do things with me but end up having to do them alone because she gets me all anxious and paranoid about it. It‚Äôs extremely lonely knowing she lives right down the street and doesn‚Äôt want to do everyday things with me like go to the grocery store or for walks.

We went out together last week after I called her out on it and she seemed so fucking miserable. She‚Äôs the only friend I have but doesn‚Äôt want to explore any of my interests and wants to support me only from the sidelines. Is that even friendship?!

i had a friend of mine die recently. he tried so hard around here to be cool by everybody. he always wanted to be well liked. at the expense of being used. I'm a bit guilty of our relationship as well as i too did abuse his kindness. however, what i didn't do was steal forfrom him like the other people did, openly, while he watched. and he'd laugh it off. it was wild the lengths he would go to to be that chill by everybody. all he needed was somebody that would listen to him talk. about his past. so he cried to everybody that used him his entire life story about how shitty it was. listen dude, we all don't live in a cheap motel w weekly rates cause we have our life together? ya know? he was a man that i watched panic. he was on the verge of getting kicked out. he had no plan. thinking on it, me and him didn't start hanging out heavy until he was at the very beginning stages of not paying his rent. he needed an ear to listen to i think, and truthfully, i tend to gravitate toward certain ppl sometimes i think bc I'm meant to know them on purpose. I've met a lot of cool ppl in my time that think of me fondly, still, even 20 years later with no solid contact. and I've noticed, some people just needed to get shit out at some point. i think he was tryna die being ODed on drugs. but he was a 45 year old guy who got drunk and mistreated the ppl that were solid by him and he was facing homelessness . i watched him p panic though. it was sad to watch, the small little deteriorating things that were progressing. and he cried to everybody how ppl that he had loved had always treated him like shit. and maybe they have, but you  tell everybody your entire life bit. they know you got low self esteem, and you put up with everything. he got zero respect by anybody around here. and the guy who was here for everybody died alone. it's so sad how he'll be remembered around here (even though everybody still fake crying about his death around here). he didn't have one solid person by him solid at the end of everything. it really messed w him. i watched him do drugs he normally wouldn't have, his eating got worse, his mindset got weird. and then he started shaking toward the end. it was sad to watch. i still got a solid few that financially taking hits for me while i wait for disability. at least 2 ppl that got me for my mental health. stg, my 2 best friends since high school (don't really steady talk) went to school for psychology. my one friend is a professor at Auburn University and my other friend works for mental health with cops in gwinett. most few ppl in my life can still think fondly of me is the point I'm making. that's sad he never really made solid connections w ppl and he tried the hardest. it's weird how he seemed to always get exploited. according to him even when he was younger apparently his dad screwed him over too(according to him). i did watch it around here from the residents though. the point I'm getting to tho is i think i was meant to meet him. for whatever reason his soul needed peace and i could do by that. i hate he died alone, but he did get to make peace. with his past.",2022-06-10 03:11:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/v8y3j3/i_didnt_know_where_to_post_this/,,0,0,I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO POST THIS

1768,v92ujv,clothesoverbros20,"Dear M, 

It‚Äôs been 5yrs and I still think about you all the time. No one not even L broke my heart the way you did, we were supposed to there for each other always but in the end our 10yrs of friendship couldn‚Äôt survive. I know that you may have a different perception of how our friendship ended. To me it was as if the 10yrs I had spent going above and beyond for you simply because I loved you meant absolutely nothing. You watched me Spend 7yrs of my life working my way through college to get my dream career and when I did you resented that I wasn‚Äôt available to you whenever you wanted to chat. You watched me spend yrs trying to get over L and when I finally did and was starting my family you resented that I had to put myself and my child first. I understand that I had always put you first even over my own family and my studies and jobs and the changes were hard. But you couldn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop to answer the phone in the middle of teaching a class and you resented that after working 50+hrs a week while pregnant that I was too tired on a Friday night to go out. I cried for hours after that last phone call we had but I learned a few things from our friendship ending. I learned that our friendship had always been focused on you, you kept me around because I was always there, I made you feel great about yourself, and I supported you and went above and beyond for you. I learned that I could never expect the type of loyalty I gave to people. You know my family was never much for sharing feelings and as much as I love him neither is my husband. I hate that you left me alone when I needed you the most when my life was just beginning. You left me alone When I was going through a pregnancy where I could have lost my son, you left me alone when I was going through postpartum depression and my kid being in n out of the hospital. You left me alone while I was learning to live with a new disability. You left me alone through the surgeries, hospital stays and constant specialist visits. I hate that you‚Äôve never met my child. I hate that you weren‚Äôt by my side when I got married. I hate that even after all the hurt I still want nothing but the best for you and get joy from knowing that you‚Äôve made your dreams come true. I hate that I miss you and need you. But most of all I hate that you probably don‚Äôt even care. You made me feel disposable like I am of no good to people unless I am doing things for them so I now avoid serious friendships. I don‚Äôt want to try to figure out if someone keeps me around because they genuinely enjoy my company or if they just like having someone who always helps them and makes them feel good about themselves.   I often think about reaching out to you but it makes me feel pathetic so I don‚Äôt. Besides I don‚Äôt think you care how I feel, you said so yourself during that last call. 

Sincerely

1793,v96ow5,Booty-XD,"Hello everyone,

First off, I hope you all are having a good day! secondly, don't mind my english please. I am tired becuz of my internship (law firm) so I am tired and busy all the time so my grammer is not 100% today. Lastly I am writing this on my break so replies/dms will be after 6/7 hours sorry about that.

Its my first time posting here so I'm kinda excited.

1/2 months ago I starting helping people in r/lonely, r/bpd and r/SuicideWatch with their problems/struggle trying to be their helping friend but at the end of the day those poeple need irl friends, someone who they can depend on. Most people want to do stuff with others, watch movie ect. but since I don't live near to them I can't help them in that aspect. I my self am not lonely, or have no personal struggle/ problem or suicidal thought. I am doing this to help other people.

I live in The Netherlands and most of the reddit users live in America so I'm deciding to try to help people in my country but the problem is. Idk how to look for them or even know who is suicidal or lonely. subreddits like these isn't country based or anthing and when I try to find dutch alternatives, I can't find any. 

question:

Do you guys know how I can find people with BPD/lonely/suicidal in my own country?

I am not going to ignore my friends from other countries nor do I want to neglect the responsibilities what comes with it.

I get that some people will be concerned that I can't handle someone with BPD as a friend or can't deal with the struggles from people who are suicidal but talking to those poeple for 2 months made me realise that I can make a huge and good impact in their life. 

I am going to post this also in subreddit BPD but I don't think I will to that in suicidewatch (reasons I rather don't want to discus so pls don't bring that up in the comments)

Chintu : Hmm so you need friends, or have shitty friends then you have come to the right place, order your new friend now and get 5 years of luck for free. Now my partner mintu will tell about the friend you are gonna get 

Mintu: well so the friend you are gonna get is 17 years old and it's name is Humai. Well he's funny ( maybe not )

He likes to learn languages, well he knows Hindi and Urdu but he wanna start reading novels and it's hard, like really compared to English. He will start off with some short stories and all. He started learning Norwegian, French and Farsi, a Lil bit off dutch too. ÿ™ŸÖ ÿØ€åŸàÿßŸÜ€í €Å€í ÿßŸàÿ± ⁄©⁄Ü⁄æ ŸÜ€Å€å⁄∫ €åÿßÿ±Ÿà( it's not farsi, it's urdu ) 

You can rant about anything, he can listen to it and give shitty advice 

Well he share lame memes tooo

He likes to talk about religions even though he knows lil about religions. Basically, he knows about abrahamic faiths more compared to other religions

He is preparing for the SAT and might prepare for APs like self study, if you have advice on college, majors and stuff help this poor guy. He's 17 and still has no idea what he wants to be 

He likes to do origami, Sketching he recently started doing both of them. So, he sucks a lot in it. I wanna have some more cool hobbies. Suggest some hobbies for me 

He might learn to cook as well, it's cool tbh, well he wants to move to usa. So, just wanted to be independent I guess but is not independent. Every thing is done by his mum from washing clothes to cooking

He reads novels, he tried reading Hindi and Urdu novels but heck it's hard, I think he might wanna improve it or start off reading something simple before moving on to something complex. He did read some English novels though. He has started a lil time ago. So, he didn't read many. He will be having holidays. So, he will be on a reading spree. You can suggest some 

He likes to listen songs and podcasts, his taste is real stupid, it goes from pop to classic in no time. He listend hindi-urdu, punjabi, farsi, hebrew songs a lot 

He likes to watch movies and series. So suggest some, rn i am watching 2 broke girls and American dad ( he even forgot the name)

1817,v9ajqa,ThrowawayJ10112,"I measure how much someone cares about me by one thing primarily - Do they ever / How often does this person reach out to me, unprompted? (Hit or miss for the times they talk to you to ask you for something). In my eyes, that is one of the best ways to determine whether someone cares about you or not, as they will, \*without prompting\* reach out because they were thinking about you and sought your company.

I see friends in Discord (PC messaging program) pop up online at the same time, and go offline at the same time. With some context, it doesn't take a genius to figure out who is talking to who at times. But a couple of friends I see do this too. People who I reach out to sometimes to talk to or invite to do things with. And I've no doubt they're talking to each other, but that's not what I'm driving at.

It's more like this; I will see them log in to talk to each other / other people, but not me. Which leads me to conclude, maybe rationally or irrationally so, that I do not matter enough to them for them to ever reach out to me to just say hi, or to talk. And when this pattern perpetuates, it only strengthens my perspective that these people have the capacity and willingness to reach out to other people (and each other), just not to me. Almost every day too, for the past however many weeks or months it has been by now.

And I sit here thinking, I can't make them to want to reach out to me - there is nothing I can do to change that. Even if they knew how much it bothered me that they never reach out to me, I don't think they would make the effort anyway.",2022-06-10 15:40:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1411756601,4,/r/lonely/comments/v9ajqa/its_nice_to_feel_wanted/,,0,1,It's nice to feel wanted.

I spend most of my time revising for my exams, watching YouTube and listening to music, mainly grunge, Radiohead, BMTH, Indie and alternative Rock, and sometimes some 90s and 80s hits, and when I don't have any exam or important thing to do I play video games while listening to music. I know it may sound pathetic or even weird to some, but I like it to a certain extent, the only main drawback is that I get bored after some time.

I had like 2 friends for the last 2 years, but we weren't that close, they mainly saw me as an acquaintance, and I only talked with them once every couple of weeks, so I distanced myself, stopped using social media and started sitting by myself in college.

At first it was hard but with time I've kind of found solace in solitude, the things that others said/did that used to upset me don't affect me anymore, seeing them having fun in their respective group of friends doesn't even make me jealous anymore. I just don't want to be near people 'cause they just seem so weird to me, and I know that for them I'm the one that looks weird, it's a matter of perspective I think, but anyway I'm just ok with it at this point.

I honestly think that in order to not be hurt, sometimes the best solution is to avoid what can hurt you, and in my case it was people.

Has anyone checked on you 

Or did they do it once 

Just to feel better about themselves 

How long since you had a meaningful conversation 

Was it when you were in school

Was it with your best friend 

Did someone die that you knew and loved 

If so I am sorry would have liked to meet them

No matter how many times you had sex 

The shows you watched and the movies you seen 

Whatever you have tried 

You will still be stuck feeling lonely 

How is my day 

Alright just feeling lonely

Why are you feeling lonely 

Cause the bad in my life has not changed yet 

Sorry to hear that

1836,v9eyme,BurnerTruthAcc1,"I'm 23 (I turn 24 next month) and it's been a year since the last time I met up with a friend, even then that was the first time in a while. I'd say I've been mostly if not entirely isolated for about 2 years 3 months.

When I was at school I had a bunch of friends but (to make a very long story short) as I aged I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I drew further and further into myself and would cut myself off from people who I didn't trust anymore.  Eventually I ended up with a small group of maybe 3 or 4 friends who I genuinely trusted, but it was now time to go to University and I moved as far away as I felt that I could cope with (ended up being a couple hundred miles away) I met new people and things did honestly improve then, but these new people made it harder and harder to justify putting time aside to interact with my old friends back home either online or when visiting.

Covid hit and I had to move back home, my friendships had dwindled back home, I now only had 1 friend locally and now this distance to my new friends increased the same thing that happened to my old friends was happening again. I was losing them too.

Me and my last friend were very vocal with our mental health situations, He'd been kicked out by his mom for being bisexual which lead to him struggling with depression and I'd had my experiences with anxiety. We'd often talk and it would help me feel better about myself. Over time though he became more and more distant with me. I was doing my best to be the best friend I could be, even when I was a student with no money I'd buy him expensive gifts for his birthday and Christmas to make him not feel alone. Eventually it got heated and we argued, I asked him if we'd met today would we still be friends? He refused to answer. He's never spoken to me since despite my best efforts.

Now, I'm alone. It's been a year since he stopped speaking to me, my friends from uni barely contact me anymore and all I'm doing is working part time at super market and then sitting in my room for the other 3 days a week.

I‚Äôm not part of the story myself. When no one else is in the room I sometimes end up talking to myself and play all the characters and whisper their dialogue. On bad days I do this all day to the point I forget to eat, study and move and it always makes me feel more tired of course. Most of the time I only do this in the morning during breakfast when I‚Äôm alone and at night in my bed before I finally fall asleep. Sometimes it‚Äôs so bad I don‚Äôt get out of my bed till past noon. 

The daydreaming gets in the way of my daily life. I rather write or think about a story in my head than contact my real life friends I see once every few months. They always text me back and I‚Äôve known them since high school.

I think it‚Äôs important to add I‚Äôve never been the best looking person. I am pale, have thin brown hair, big nose, wear glasses and they make my eyes look too big. Sometimes I‚Äôm told I am pretty without glasses. Even by my own parents but they never called me ugly either. I tried lenses once and couldn‚Äôt get them out, now I‚Äôm scared to try again

I‚Äôm usually too shy to talk to new people or guys I find attractive. I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend before. Guys never flirt with me. I‚Äôm constantly comparing myself to other girls looks. Keeping conversation with someone when we‚Äôre alone is draining as hell and I always end up saying boring things. I‚Äôm too tired to talk to them again the next day. 

I have no hobbies because I never have the energy to actually do them. My grades are okay. I watch anime/series. Read books. I sometimes cry because I wish I had relationships like those characters do or my friends who all but one have a boyfriend.

1892,v9l1l9,LostZabbit,"I'm lonely, but I'm not alone.

I'm not specifically looking for a relationship, I know that's against the rules of this thread, but I am still open to one.

I'm married and poly, so I can't post in forever alone dating (which is a shame because I am dating challenged), not to mention I'm also open to platonic relationships and I don't want to disqualify myself from that either.

Another difficulty that doesn't disqualify me anywhere specific but seems to be a hurdle across the board: I'm 37. I connect mostly with people younger than me and I know that's not something to be ashamed of as long as I'm not a creep about it, but it is a limiting factor no matter how harmless I actually am (I wouldn't have trusted/been interested in someone 15 years older than me when I was in my 20s either so I can't blame you).

I'm also weird. I have enough real world experience that I can hide it, but on the internet I just really don't like to. Here's a relevant example of a social weirdness: I like connections that happen fast. I get frustrated and bored with small talk and just finding myself wishing I could fast forward to where we both can open up, be ourselves, and share whatever.

So, sounds like I really like being open and myself right? Well, I do, but I also found out that I enjoy experimenting with my identity through role playing. Gender fluid roleplaying. Particularly with men. I do -not- mean catfishing, I mean consensual, all parties aware at all times, role playing. Pretend.  (Yeah, I know there's a forum for erotic roleplaying too, but it's not really built for the novice I am, and again, that's just one of the many kinds of connections I'm open to). 

I'm a complicated mess of frustrations and desire. 

But enough about me. What about you?

Are you weird? Are you tired of social conventions and want to try connecting to people differently? Have you been told you share TMI? Do you just need someone patient and understanding that won't run away no matter how crazy you are (UNLESS you're thinking of hurting yourself or others. If that's the case you, respectfully, do not need me, you need an  -actual- therapist)? Have you too been told you are clingy? Are you aware of your mental/emotional handicaps and still striving to better yourself? Are you looking to talk to someone to be yourself with? Are you looking for someone you can be someone else with?  Do you have -any- questions no matter how personal?

I wake up alone, everybody else still sleeps, i eat my breakfast and head towards my internship. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone today yet.

I‚Äôm traveling by train, it‚Äôs packed. People are standing everyone but there is still a seat free next to me, nobody wants to sit there. ‚ÄúAm i scary or do i just smell bad while i just showered and put parfum on?‚Äù

Afternoon:
Internship, talked to about 3 people about some boring topics from work. I don‚Äôt like it here.

Omw to home, the train is again fully packed. But somehow most of the people are in groups and everybody is smiling and having fun times. Meanwhile i am just wondering what i‚Äôm doing wrong that nobody wants to talk to me. Maybe it‚Äôs because of myself.


Evening:
Came home, family already ate dinner without me, but they have left some leftovers for me! Nobody btw asked to me how my day was, they never do tbh.

I went to the gym, standard daily practice. Here is where i can focus on myself and my goals. I like the gym.

In the evening and night i went to the clubs with my friends, i completely embarrassed myself because i tried to hook up with 3 girls and i failed in all of them. The reason behind this is because my friends made jokes about that i never get girls and i wanted to prove them wrong.

Now i‚Äôm back home from defeat, alone again. Siting on the couch, thinking about not being so lonely.

1929,v9olx4,dragoonsontx,"rant incoming, its 6 am, im drinking already, on 3,5 hours of sleep and got an exam in 4 hours, so my mind is everywhere rn.

yeah im young and yeah i heard it all from multiple people, that its still too early and that i haven't seen anything from my life, but from what ive seen from it i dont want to continue, im 19, going into my second year of college, failing most my classes, have no one, talk to no one, and see no one, i either study, work, read or play games, im just tired of it all ngl.

i had to break up with my gf 7 months ago after she cheated on me, but im still deeply in love with her, and still miss her to this day, and i think about her alot, she was the first person to ever care for me on that level, i fell head over heels for her, but she left me in a heart beat, to a guy she herself said, was nothing compared to me, im just sick of it all, i just want to go back in time.

and its difficult for me to make friends, as i have the social skills of a second grader, i stutter alot and i dont know what to say, and i have a resting bitch face that makes people avoid me like the plague add that im tall and well built, so whenever i walk people tend to get out my way, and whenever i try to talk to anyone new they just leave in a hurry saying ""sorry i got class"".

and i dont want to date anymore, cuz in my life i dated 4 girls, that cheated on me, all of them, 4, imagen, having 4 girls, that cheated on you, what am i supposed to do? who can i trust anymore? neither girls or guys.

i used to have a big group of friends, that i later found out wanted me to be around just for my money, i left them after i had a big fight with one of them, now here i am, alone, depressed with suicidal ideation, my therapist said he sees that im getting better, but i dont feel it tbh, i still feel as sad.

one of the exercises that my therapist told me to do, is writing, ngl it helped alot, and worsened it at the same time, cuz i kept writing about my ex who i still love, it makes me think of her alot, but recently ive been able to push the thoughts away, yesterday when i finished studying i went to sleep, and for the first time i was able to push the thoughts away, so i guess thats progress?

writing really helped, but one of the things that gave me peace, is writing my suicide note, i told everyone i know, what i feel and what i wanted to always say, its really calming knowing that if i do end up offing myself, everyone i knew will at least have a letter from me telling them how i feel about them.

&amp;#x200B;

i just, idk, i wanna be happy, but im so used to being depressed that i dont want to change it, i wanna date someone but i cant trust women anymore, i wanna make friends, but how can i trust people after what ive been through? it got to the point where i dont trust my own family, im just tired, cant i just reset my life and start over? i dont wanna do this anymore man :/",2022-06-11 03:20:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1552401688,2,/r/lonely/comments/v9olx4/m_19_ngl_its_too_soon_to_give_up_but_im_this_close/,,0,6,M 19 ngl its too soon to give up but im this close

my job is one of the few reasons i really get out of the house, and my purpose there is to basically be an NPC merchant and assist people who are actually out and living/enjoying their lives. i cant make any meaningful dialogue with people there considering the circumstances, with the exception of coworkers, and i havent had a coworker i've felt i could get along with at all in a long time, and even those people i never ended up seeing outside of work. so all day, im hearing that bell go off, seeing people come in enjoying themselves, and i have to essentially serve these people who are out having a good time while im stuck at work and mentally suffering, and im just losing my freakin mind.. its like torture. today was particularly bad, i felt like such shit the whole day (like mentally and physically, the feelings were so bad i felt nauseous, foggy, overheating etc on top of usual pain i deal with) and had to try my best to hide it, but its really hard... so then i come off as irritated and maybe even rude, which just worsens my situation further because people dont wanna be with a ""downer"". but its hard to force any type of positivity when it feels like there isnt much hope and you'll always be the ""weird loner"" in a sea of ""normal"" people. it really is a catch 22 because being alone can kill your drive, personality and identity which makes you less likable. all day i was stuck in a cycle of thoughts while also being stuck in that cage... i really hope tomorrow and the rest of the week is better cuz sheesh

1971,v9sggl,nullmage,"I, 24m, recently moved out on my own to a new city with a new job and I'm realizing how weird I must be socially. When I hear about all the relationships or life experiences my friends have had I can't help but feel weird for not relating at all. It might just be from bad situations in my past which I try not to think about anymore so there's gaps in how I precieve my history. But it feels extremely apparent to me internally when I hear about their stories with guys. Like how many are buying them things or going out, or how much other people flirt even when I know they have SOs. It seems like movie plots to me that I can hardly believe actually happen on some level, and I just can't help but feel like I'm barely alive and experiencing the world in comparison. All I've done is focus on academics and occasionally playing video games and now that I've graduated, with a job, and living on my own, I feel so empty and like I have the emotional development of a high schooler. When I hear about them taking drugs or having sex I know they're not lying but it's so far gone from my own life that internally I feel like it's all fake and acted in some way. I wish I knew how to live my life like my friend's.  Even when I go out alone to raves and dance parties I feel so inadequate, lame, and inexperienced.

The worst part is when I feel like I'm out of conversational topics with people. I never have drama or stories and I find it hard to talk about hobbies beyond ""I do them"".

1976,v9sq0b,Ok-Championship-4706,"it's been years and i still don't feel any better. i became really depressed when i was like 12 and im 16 now. just feeling of loneliness began and it still hasn't stopped. there are days when i feel that it's not true, that i actually have friends and i even had a boyfriend at some period of time, like the only period when i didn't feel so lonely and when i felt that i can talk to someone anytime i don't feel okay, which is very often to me.

but last like two months, i realised that i really don't have anyone. i went to some camp i was really excited to go and i was sure i would make many friends and finally stop my loneliness but i just felt really down for a few days and nearly didn't talk to anyone. now i see in our groupchat that i lost many amazing chances and that I'm totally left out. anywhere i go, it's like im not capable to make any friends. no one would like to talk to me when I'm just almost always ruining the mood.

i hate it that i haven't got along with my classmates. i was so excited for high school and now nothing is happening. and even my friendships are fading away, i had one good friend who i didn't really have feeling that i could talk to ab anything, but i just felt less lonely, i just had someone to hang out with and she wasn't a bad person. and now she left me. and my other friend, my best friend actually, just can't listen to me anymore. but she isn't trying at all, i feel like i haven't really vented to her until now and she doesn't even try to reply to texts, just in like 2-3 words. and the last time i talked to her she just said that there is not worth talking to me and i said yeah ig ur right and she just liked the message. i feel awful ruining our friendship because she was the only one i talked to ab many feelings of mine I've never told anyone else.

idk what to do anymore. my coping mecahnism is talking to someone because i just cant feel pressure in my mind anymore. idk will i be capable of happiness and even making some friends, and lovers. and yeah i go to psychiatrist, she is like one of the only persons that really listen to me, but still i dont have many people besides her, not any maybe.",2022-06-11 07:56:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610804116,1,/r/lonely/comments/v9sq0b/i_have_nobody_to_talk_to_anymore/,,0,1,I have nobody to talk to anymore

1978,v9svan,OG_Booty_Slayer,"Last night/this mornings, my family and I wanted to celebrate my sister's achievement on earning her Masters Degree. My father chose to celebrate at a club in the hood and me being (21M, AA) an awkward guy, it was sort of the last place I wanted to be at for now, but I thought nothing could go wrong.

So we had our food and drinks while listening tonloud ass music while watching the Golden State vs the Celtics in the NBA Finals (they're 2-2 btw) when suddenly my dad comes up and he says ""Ima pick up some girls for you and [my sister's other brother from her side of the family]."" In denial I ask ""What?"" amongst the loud music, only for him to repeat what I unfortunately heard. My heart sank deep and I started to feel extremely nervous.

My dad went on to search for women for us to talk to and I was internally panicking. I was thinking to myself ""Shit, I have no game and I've never talked to women in this setting or manner. I'm socially awkward, and I don't want to embarrass myself, especially when it feels like I put myself on a nice pedastal."" I (drunkenly) prayed to God that nothing would happen. My dad came back and said ""I'm working on it"" and I seized the opportunity and told him ""I'm a go with the flow type of guy"". For a bit my dad didn't  move around and I felt relived. That was until a few minutes later he found two women for me and my sister's other brother to speak with. My heart hit the floor and I wanted to die before they sat down.

When the moment of truth came I fucked up big time. I asked the most bland shit and was quiet after 2-4 sentences. I was fiddling with my glasses (which I took off because they were bent and bronekn-[ish]), kept moving my body, and over thinking the situation. I gave up immediately because her body language showed she didn't want to be near me (or at the very very least that's what my insecurities led me to think. Her whole body was turned outside the booth, away from me, while I tried to keep my cool and act like some quiet guy that didn't give a fuck about anyone when deep down I was losing my shit). I was just sitting there thinking to myself "" I want this night to be over"", ""God, kill me"", ""Say something intriguing, ,[me,] ANYTHING!"", but ultimately I failed. The girl I was supposed to talk to and her friend left. 

My sister's other brother talked to me because he saw I was spitting no game (and btw during our separate interactions, he was questioning my motives and shaking his head in disappointment. While he was doing that I started to feel anger at my biologicalb brother for not allowing me to stab or strangle myself in middle school), and I lied to him and said I was in a complicated long-distance relationship, and that I felt like I'd be cheating on her regardless while at the same time consider breaking up with ""her"".

What's worse is that it turned out we were being watched this whole time. Luckily my dad was being a host and didn't pay much attention, but my sister saw (or at least I assumed she was watching me. According to her brother, she was, but it seems like she was watching him more than me). When she spoke to me I lied to her and said ""it wasn't the right vibe"".

After the club closed for the night, we all headed home. It was me, my sister, my dad, and his gf/fiancee in the same car. At one point we started talking about my dad being a wingman, and my drunk ass started spelling ""Red Flag"" in thin air. My sister got curious and asked. I told her Im writing down red flag, and she kept on pushing for the context and I would deny. I felt some serious embarassment deep down, but I had a lie in place, I just didn't want to say it out loud. (The lie was: she's a baby mama and I feel like if I ever get in a relationship with them, I want to be capable of caring for their child a lot. And that's a true thing about me, except I never got to know if that was true about the woman my dad tried hooking me up with so I was basically setting up a lie.)

We got home and all I could think about was how much of an embarrassment I was. I felt so weak and pathetic. I felt like I disgraced myself and my family. I started thinkint about all the times my aunts on my mother side would make fun of me and say ""I got no game"". I started thinking about my younger attempts to talk with females and how that failed. I started thinking about the lack of balls I had. I was thinking about how sorry I was for failing  to develop proper social skills. I just wanted to kill myself or isolate myself. I just wanted to be normal and be capable or at least have the confidence or arrogance to be a normal social human being. I just wanted one of those wishes to come true. All I could hope for is that no one smells the bullshit I've laid. Seriously man, I want to find love by any means, but I don't want to live a lie to myself.... Now Im drunk as hell (did I mention after my L, I started drinking a lot more mildy despite having morning errands and work in less than 8 hours from now?)

TL;,DR: I went to a club and felt extremely embarrassed upon the fact that I am socially awkward, a liar, and can't talk to women...",2022-06-11 08:07:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621146333,1,/r/lonely/comments/v9svan/i_feel_like_an_incapable_human_being_that_cant/,,0,1,I feel like an incapable human being that can't find love like everyone else.

I've never considered myself a very social person for much of my life, and I'm not the type to immediately put my trust in new people, even if we've known each other for a while. However, this has caused me to feel bouts of loneliness as well and I recognize the importance of having people to talk to whenever, so I've tried to branch out and forge new relationships.

Even though I like talking to new people and I consider myself pretty personable, I also find that talking to several people is tiring, and I usually need a few days to myself if I talk to too many people in a short time. This manifests itself into several days without checking text messages or not wanting to go out. I know I don't like to be left in the dark when I'm talking to a friend, and it's caused me some level of guilt and stress from thoughts of me being a ""bad friend"". I want long-term friendships and people to trust, but I don't see a way for this to happen without casting a wide net to see if there's a valuable relationship.

A piece of plastic that receives more attention than I could ever deserve

Being held 

Engulfed

Swirled around in a hungry mouth 

Caressed by a passionate tongue..

I befriend this coworker for about a month. I think it started because I was new and we were the only ones there under 40. The other people are nice, but she was cool, funny and would come to me to talk about anything: her day, similar interests, etc.

I've always been pessimistic; lacking in confidence. I would confide in friends and usually things went better than expected: I got her a leaving gift and I thought she would hate it, but she loved it so much that I got invited to her leaving party on the spot and she bought me a snack for lunch.

On her last day, I asked if we could stay in touch. She suggested Facebook but didn't elaborate further. It was a little eyebrow raising, but I chalked it up to her having other things on the mind. Found her account, sent her a request and...nothing.

Now, there's a million reasons and I of course focus on the worst one. She has a lot on her mind and admitted to not being very active on it. Maybe there's still hope? But as every day and every hour ticks by, it feels less and less likely.

Just don't understand: I can only ever recall enjoying each other's company...What reason does she have to not like me? Did she just pretend to like me?

1997,v9ver6,olbliaypple,"Trigger Warning: Mentions of suicide, some sexual assault, depression, some vulgar language not a lot tho

Sorry if theres some typos, its a lot of stuff

I have lost pretty much everyone ive talked to in the last 2-3 years. See, those 2-3 years are very important to me, that was my peak happiness so far. During covid and all, especially 2020, I was living it up. Those may have been the worst years for a lot of people but those were the best for me. I made new friends and fell in love for the first time. I no longer talk to my first love (3 years). Now, my best friend of 3 years just cut me off this Tuesday. Maybe it's just my karma for having such a good year when I shouldn't have? 

Now i can say that it sure as hell hurt like a bitch to lose my first love but when i lost my best friend, it hurt worse. And what pisses me off the most is how she did it.

Ive always had some mental health issues that couldnt really be seen to the public eye in the beginning. I go to school, put on a smile, drink some caffeine to seem lively, but i get home and am a completely different person. Ive also always had the thought of suicide in the back of my head but it never really came to thought that often. Nothing was ever too severe to think something was wrong with me so ive always brushed it off as i was just tired. Recently,  that changed. About at the middle to end of last year i started not having motivation anymore. Which could be a normal thing but it has persisted every. single. day. The thought of suicide came up more often. I struggled with things like keeping up with school, stress of an athlete, feeling included with friends, and relationship stuff. That might sound like normal struggles but everyday is just a new problem and i cant take it anymore. The sport i play, im supposed to love, but cant. The school work is supposed to stress me, but not like this. My friends are supposed to not make me feel this way. You get what im saying?

Everything fell apart this March. I had already become comfortable with the suicidal thoughts and knew they would linger. I never told anyone about them because my parents arent big on mental health, wouldnt tell my teachers because theyd tell my parents, didnt tell my friends because i felt like they didnt care.

I would sometimes talk to my ""best friend"" about my struggles (not the suicide thing) because you know, ""you can talk to me whenever you need"" lmfao. But after a while she just started to ignore me. I did notice this. When I lost my first love, even though my best friend had been ignoring me, she was the only person i had to go to. I talked with her and she let me know that everything was going to be okay.

At this point, i became really sensitive to losing other people so i tried super hard to keep my friends close. I soon learned that everyone was going to move away by graduation. Im not mad at them, its not their choice to move. But i did express my sensitivity to them moving. I guess they just thought i was mad at them or something because after that, everyone started ignoring me in a more obvious way. This threw me into even more of a bad spot and i had decided i was done and it was time for me to go. Look, i wanted help. I made it obvious, i didnt talk some days, stopped showing up to school some weeks, didnt put effort into what i wore, crying when i just couldn't hold it in, posted a shit ton about how mental health is important and to look out for your strong friends because one day one of them might just kill themselves. I never wanted to make the first move and still dont because i dont want to have to ask. Someone like my closest friend should care to ask me if im alright. Not even my parents cared enough, all they did was get mad at me for being ""tired"" all the time.

I ended up writing ""the note"" and wedging a belt in the top of the door way. I stood on my chair and put my head through the loop. When i rolled my chair away, i fell instantly to the ground because the door isnt strong enough to hold the weight of a human. I cried and moved on. The next few days i didnt talk. At some point my teacher talked to us about his depression and a cried. I felt i couldnt tell my friends not even my best friend about what had just happened to me because it was like they didnt care, ignored my words. I thought about OD on pills but i didnt want to go through liver failure from acetaminophen.

When i was ready, i spoke again and picked up my own pieces. I told myself that if no one is going to help me, i will. I told myself that even though i cant find the will to do anything, im going to do it and im going to win. It took so much time and so much effort but it was worth it. I cleaned my room and my bathroom. I went back to playing basketball. I caught up with my school work and pulled my grades up. And just at the beginning of this week on Sunday, i found my passion for soccer again. Monday went by but when it came to Tuesday all my progress disappeared. I just can never win can i? Just as i got back up something has to knock me down again right? Just as i thought id never look back.

My 2 closest friends left the group chat without context.  When i asked what was wrong they both said they just wanted space. My best friend said she would tell me later and to ""not let it ruin my day."" It sure as hell ruined my day. In third period (band) i couldnt hold it in anymore and ended up crying in the guitar closet for the whole period. I couldnt go to lunch like that so i just stayed with my teacher and talked to him till the end. When school ended, my best friend messaged me and i obviously was pissed. She knows im sensitive but still went off to pull a stunt like that. I asked her why the fuck she put me in that position. Not knowing why they had left, worrying about if theyre alright, and leaving me to think about it for 7 hours, the least she could have done was talk to me about this in person. At that point i decided to tell her about the suicide thing when she told me about her thing. I told her ""i have something to say too"" and told her that i would tell her on call. But she didnt want to call because she didnt want her mom to hear what she was gonna say?! So then i just sent it after she asked.  I added my trigger warning then said ""I tried to kill myself."" i told her i was sorry for not telling her but i really never felt like i could. I told her the story and why im so sensitive now about losing people especially after i tried to unalive. I told her why i didnt tell her and she kinda just dismissed it. Then she questioned more on why i hadnt told her about this then she cut me off. She told my that there was a ""turning point"" where i just annoyed her. She said she felt like she couldnt really ""empatize"" with me anymore or even talk to me at this point. Which is funny because i just watched her empatize with a guy who SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEONE????

The next day i asked my other friend if she felt the same way like if she was cutting me off. She said yes and it took like 2 hours to get her reasoning out of her. When her reasoning came by, one of them specifically was how i ignored everyone after the ""moving away"" shpeel happened. At this point i just fucking give up. I didnt care to even tell her the real reason why i ignored everyone.

Im so tired. I can never fucking win. Just as i found happiness it was wrecked. Im so fucking done. Ive lost everyone. I dont feel safe at school, at home, no where. Here i am again, wanting to kill myself. Ive thought of ways to do it but im trying not to go through. Everything is so fucking empty.

2004,v9wlxw,12stringer96,"It keeps happening over and over and over again, and I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. Paul, Wendy, Violet, Kenny, Camille, Rohit, Ray, Lara, Emma, Kaylie, Evan. These are all people that ranged from showing initial friendship/interest to people I've loved and thought loved me back. The last 9 people were just in the past year. Nothing like this has ever happened before at this rate. Dylan isn't really talking to me much anymore now either, he's probably the next one in this neverending stream of people that are initially friendly and then leave me. It's made me crawl back into my introverted shell, it's increased my social anxiety, it's made me more desperate and depressed, it's decreased my trust in people and made me more cynical. Not to mention I get ghosted all the time. It's happened so much within the past 2-3 years at a rate that has absolutely never happened before. Sometimes I feel totally hopeless and am convinced I'm going to die alone.

I have no siblings and no relatives lived nearby when I was growing up. None of my friendships have ever lasted more than a few years at a time. I see people, some of them even more introverted than me, talk about friends they've had since childhood, or family they're really close to, and it really depresses me. I don't have any of that. 

I want to talk to a therapist about this, but I couldn't make the scheduled time and called the health center 3 different days to reschedule, left 3 different voicemails and they never responded to any. So even my therapist doesn't want to talk to me. I've tried to open up to the 2 people I thought were my closest friends, but they offer minimal to no sympathy, and they don't open up to me in return or anything.

2014,v9xpo5,ireallycantcope,"just a memory about card giving.

I never grew up with much company. my parents never really showed affection. they always fought, hit me, etc. just another authorative figure. I think for the most part my mom just hated me. she had a diary when she was pregnant and all that was in it were her regrets about being pregnant with me. she resented me and my existence, even admitted to using me as an outlet for her stress and anger. I have 2 older siblings but they were much older so, they didn't really talk to me.

I talked to myself. at school I never had real friends, just acquaintances. the type of people that I'd get along with really well and them acting like it never happened the next day. I didn't feel lonely though, I was comfortable with myself. I had a different personality and good social skills so I could talk to anybody and about anything. it's just that they won't remember me after.

the problem is, I remembered them. and as a kid, everybody meant so much to me. I was very aware of patterns of behaviour and that there were ""layers to a person that made them unique"" even as a child. I was too much of a sentimental kid. every time there were celebrations I'd make cards with drawings and personal letters unique to the individual. I'd make atleast 30 and do you know how much I got back? none. because I don't mean anything to them.

You know like-- they try to search for you in a crowded hallway and once they finally see you, their eyes just light up in joy kind of thing? Yeah I wish I had that sort of thing. 

Someone who goes to you first when they've got something to share, be it a stupid little thing they just did or something funny they saw at some point in their day.

Like 'oh that's so fucking funny i HAVE to tell azura about this.' 

kind of thing.

You know what I mean?

I just want to mean something to someone.

I want someone to think of me when they see something ever so meaningless, yet because it reminds them of me, it has the slightest bit of significance.

I'm always the one who does all of this and it's always such a bummer when i'm met with a lack of response or just pure disregard.

I mean yeah, telling you about how much I love stationary shops for some inexplicable odd reason may seem pointless and boring but humour me a little, won't you? I love hearing stuff like this you know? Someone going on and on about something they love over and over again, showing very clearly how deep their love for it is.

I'd be so happy if my significant other rambled on about something they loved, be it a game or a book or a movie they enjoyed, hell, I just want to hear all about it from them.

It's always a one-sided thing for me and it's just so--lonely.

Like hey, you, why do you care more about when i'm going to be comfortable enough to engage in suggestive texting with you than shit that's actually enjoyable?

Hell it took me a good amount of time to realise that i'm just on the asexual spectrum and people who just want my fucking body after i've given them my unconditional support and love are assholes. 

It's not like I spite people who have sexual desires, like yeah, good for you, I really don't care and it's your life but lord-- some people make it out to be like sexual intercourse is the only thing that matters in the end and I hate it. Like--no-- i'm still 3 years away from reaching 20 and that goes against my religion, yes i'm waiting for marriage, we've been over this, what's the deal? Can't accept that? Why the fuck did you ask me to be with you then? Lord have mercy. 

Do you feel my exhaustion here? 

All I want is something meaningful, to BE meaningful to someone. 

I don't want to be told that i'm cute or pretty or whatever the fuck kind of shit that I wouldn't even believe nor care about, I want someone to acknowledge my passion for writing, my love for reading stories with plots that are depressing as hell because I love how much angst hurts my heart, for stupid little stationary stores because I have an odd obsession with buying notebooks that are pretty and more. 

I want someone to read my writings and tell me i've got one hell of a funky mind because wow!!+@)¬£=¬£!¬£)¬£= 

I just want someone to CARE about who I am. 

To care about me as an individual. 


Every time people describe me, it's always 'the quiet one' 'the one who likes food' 'cute' 'yadayayayayay'

And if you're going to tell me it's my fault, fuck off! (pardon my language) 

I put my heart into talking and some people don't even bother to listen and continue to label me as some quiet person once I stop bothering. When I ask them about their interests in return all they give me is some half-assed reply like--thank you! I totally love the lack of energy that you're giving me! (That was sarcasm if you couldn't tell) 

I gave you a chance to listen, literally to just listen, and you fucked that up. 

I'm not asking for a luxury life with a rich guy who gifts me expensive shit and says a ton of romantic s e x y words (which, by the way, disgusts me a little) (no offense) 

Hell we could go to places like mcdonalds at three in the morning for the idiotic sake of it and talk all night about random shit and i'd be happy. (even mcdonalds is pretty pricy but hey even a nice stall by the street that sells some hella banger burgers would be nice too!) 

I don't need expensive gifts or diamond rings, hell, it doesn't even matter to me if someone's well off with money or not. If you're not in a stable financial state, it's okay! We could work together to earn money instead of entirely depending on one another, i'm not going to depend on someone completely to get what I want, hell no. I know damn well that if there's something I want to buy or get, I have to work for it. I wouldn't leave them, no, as long as they love me and as long as they're willing to get through the hardships we may face together, i'll stay by their side regardless of how much money they have in their pockets.  

I wouldn't mind if my significant other gave me a tiny paper origami as a gift or any sort of thing they made by themselves for days like my birthday. Hell, I might not even need a present to begin with because their presence would already be enough to make me happy. 

Meaningful, you know? 

It doesn't have to be grand or anything, I just want it to mean something. 

Seriously, what's the use of saying I love you to someone if you don't mean it, or if it doesn't mean anything to you? 

Its because of shit like this that made me feel lonely in my past relationships.

The way someone just wanted me because they thought I was cute and liked me when I was wholesome and all that, but when I got into things I liked and how I felt, that shit was completely disregarded. Before dating, they'd show interest and be all supportive but once they get you? Zero fucks about what you're saying. 

I don't mind someone lowering their guard and being a lot more laid back after dating me because they're comfortable and don't need to go overboard but,, what i'm upset about is when they just stop showing interest in you as a whole. 

Then next thing you know, they're starting to ask about the suggestive stuff and your feelings are long gone. 

You don't have to show me much, but gods, if you completely disregard everything I say when i'm expected to show you nothing but support in return, what's the use of it all?

I don't want shit like sex, hell, it's the most pointless thing to me and I could genuinely live an entire life without ever experiencing it, and I say this with zero hesitation and complete certainty. 

I just want someone that cares.

I just want to mean something to someone, to be the one they go to for random things, to be the one they call out of the blue just to ask how i'm doing or what coloured shirt they should pick or to be the one they call while they're cooking and bragging about how great of a cook they are before doing something idiotic. . 

I just want the lovely little moments that mean so very much.

I don't want to be told 'I love you' a thousand times nor do I want a thousand gifts that probably cost thousands and thousands too---

I want a thousand little moments that show what love is. 

Maybe i'm expecting too much from real life, maybe i'm just spouting nonsense at this point.

2022,v9yuyz,[deleted],"Hi everyone, I'm a 22M. Firstly, sorry for my bad English. Since I was a child, I have serious relationship problems. I usually spend my life alone, just have couple of friends for talk and go out sometimes. I also had a toxic relationship for couple of months with a classmate during high school that sharpen my problems. 

In December I joined, totally randomly, a Discord chat and met a 23M. Immediately, he started to chat with me, hours and hours per day. I was so confused and a bit scared because in my life I've never had such experiences; a person who wants to talk with me. After two weeks of continuing chatting, I started to know him better and he has revealed a person with tons of interest and life experiences in common with me. We were spending 4-5 hours per day to chat, It was like knowing your twins and I was really happy. At that time, he was the only person who said to me good words, who makes me feel important for someone. I started to feel for the first time in my life what is meaning being cared by another people. 

But suddenly, everything starts to change. 

He started to being worried about me having a gay crush on him, and slowly stops being so active with me like first months. We were continuing to chat couple of hours per day but I was feeling the change. I realized that I really fall in love with his soul... I've never had sexual fantasies with him, I just wanna have him next to me. He became the most important part of my life, I tried to saying this at him but in his answer I'm feeling like I'm just someone to spend some free time with, nothing more.

I hate this situation, I don't want lose him. I'm not ready... just thinking about this possibility makes me cry. But now my days and my happiness depends on him. When he'a searching me, when he wants to chat with me I'm feeling good. When this doesn't occurs, I started to feel useless again. 

All this situation is because I'm so egocentric and I cannot have an healthy relationship with someone. When someone shows me a bit of love... I always become so oppressive. I really hate myself. I just want to read again those kind and beautiful words...

From the past 1 year I feel unsafe in my own hometown I don't know why, all I know is that this place is somehow bringing up a strong trait of self harm inside of me. I don't wanna stay in this city, I wanna leave this place for sometime and move to another city which will help me in my studies, get me closer to the person I love and help me find peace too.
Earlier I thought I will get my parents to send me away without me telling them about the actual reason (my mental health). But unfortunately they refused. I've been having chest pain since then thinking about how will I even survive here. I've even made up my mind that if I'm forced to stay here in this city, my hometown; I'm gonna end my life. I really don't want to but the me living in this city within fake friends, hatred, bad/criminal atmosphere; I would gladly accept death than all of this. 
I've been crying over and over, feeling drowsy, want to bash my head into the wall, and can't stop making scenarios with her being with me and than crying again realising it's all just in my head.
I always looked for happiness amidst my depression, and when I first talked to her I knew she's the one. I had never fell in love before. But now I'm drowning faster by the nightmare that she'll never be mine.
I really need someone, someone to convince my parents somehow or tell me a way I can actually tell them about my so severe mental state and the only exit to it.

I remember crying sometimes and feeling the pain in my throat and tummy as I slept at night. She stopped me from exercising too. I haven‚Äôt dared to do it for a long time.

My mom never took me to the doctor after I was 8 to 18 except maybe twice, all the while funding my sister‚Äôs expensive therapy and endless hospital stays. She asked me to eat over the counter medicine from the pharmacy, but she only remembers to buy it half the time. I remember once she forgot to get it but came home with five broccolis for my sister lol.

I remember my mom telling me the whole world hates me since I was 7, and that my sister wrote in her diary I was the cause of her depression because my father bought toys for me and smiles at me (a 9 year old) and my sister wanted me to die. I felt like my mom wanted me to feel guilt.

I remember my mom not wanting me to go to university to save money but funding my sis expensive private O levels that costs way more. 

I remember my mom purposefully denying me of certain wants or needs at the store in front of my sis to compensate for my sis feeling my dad gives me more.

I remember that when my sister threw our cat out while I was at school, my mom vehemently prevented me from finding and bringing him home and lied to me about it. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to my sister after that, but my mom texted me on the same day to ask how long I was gonna stop talking to her bc it would hurt her feelings. 

When I told my mom I was recently suspected to have depression and anxiety and want to move out to be by myself, my mother asked then how was I going to give her money. My father asked what if that made my sister feel guilty.

I remember whenever my mother got frustrated at my sister‚Äôs antics, she would beat my brother and me. She has used poles, fists, belts, umbrellas, hangers etc. chased us with hockeysticks and a chopper. We are just punching bags.

I remember my mom berating me about wanting to buy a mac laptop with my OWN money, but my dad saw I wanted it and got it for me. Later I realised they got my sister an imac and DSLR. One/two years later my mom broke my laptop screen. I don‚Äôt know if she did it on purpose.

Every day, I obey my sister‚Äôs insane ocd rules. No taking water, cooking and stepping into the living room from 9am to 4pm. If i wanted to ever leave and enter my house, inform her first. 

I feel so lonely, I feel like I don‚Äôt have family who thinks of me as a person with needs. I feel this crushing sense of despair and I just want to not feel this alone. I‚Äôm finally moving out soon having landed my first job. I‚Äôm looking for a place now finally.

2077,va6jh4,nooneimportant2801,"So i will start of by saying i have the most perfect wife and child and i feel so lucky to have them.

Whenever i get close to someone as a friend they end up just dissappearing. My school friends all began losing touch after i told them about my first child (i was 18 when i was expecting) my uni friends just all went seperate ways after uni and shortly after i made the best group of friends ever and i honestly would have done anything for them. Over the years they have all ended up falling out with one another and going seperate ways but i always tried to keep in touch as best i could without picking sides. 

All this seemed okay because i always had T.J (my best friend) he was my best man and we always joked how we would live next door to each other and our kids would get married one day. He never had much luck with the ladies (very insecure) one day i met a girl on a game and she was cool and i told him to just talk to her and they hit it off and i was over the moon for him and then he just started talking to me less and less we was best friends for like 7 years and now weve spoke twice in the last 12 months.

I feel so alone because i just want a friend someone to game and talk anime with and hes gone. 

I feel guilty for wanting a friend when i already have the perfect wife who is obvs my best friend but we have different hobbies she watches some abime and plays games occassionally but i like the fact we have our own hobbies 

Every person ive tried to make friends with since T.j has either stopped bothering after a few weeks or told me so many lies and i have no idea why they would do that.

I'm tired of being alone when people are around me.

I don't feel connected to anyone.

Whenever I try to connect to anyone they either get tired of me or don't know what to do with me so they avoid me.

A lot of times when people spend time with me they do it out of pity if something bad happened with what they did or just life.

So I avoid them so I don't feel like a burden.

Everyone made their choices and chose what they want, it wasn't ever me.

As much as I appreciate the people who has shown me love, I still feel lonely, after everything I've been through no one ever fought for me to get a better life because they were scared of losing me.

They lost me.

The last time I was cuddled was by my mother after I woke up in the middle of the night when I wasn't even 5.

At times it brings me nostalgia, or feels like disappointment, either way she was never mine, she died because she chose something else besides me.

I want to love, but no one wants to share that love with me.

2098,va89zy,-Nubivagant-,"So little backstory first. I was school bullied for 12 years. It started in first grade and ended when I graduated from high school. I never had many friend and the few I had, broke the friendship off because of the bullying. Only one friend stayed. The bullying experience left me traumatized, really insecure and for years I struggled with social anxiety.

Last year I got accepted into university and had to move to different city, leaving my only friend behind. At first I was exited because I had the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. And at the beginning it was great. I met new people and I was hanging out with them. I was so certain that I had made friends.

But as time went on I started to question if I really had any friends at all. I would see their posts on social media where they had amazing time together and I hadn't been invited. When I went to the uni parties I was sometimes left outside of their circles. They had their inside jokes and funny memories together that I wasn't part of. No one never texts me but i'm sure they all are texting each other daily.

But it hasn't been like that every single time I've hanged out with these people. Sometimes I feel like I'm part of the group and that they really do see me as a friend. We talk and laugh and have fun time together. So I feel guilty and ashamed for feeling lonely and for thinking that they don't see me as a friend.

I also have a boyfriend who I met in uni and sometimes he is the only person I see in weeks. He is the only one that invites me to hang out. He is the sweetest guy and I love him a lot. He probably thinks that I have friends and that I'm close to them when the reality is really the opposite.  I feel ashamed about not having friends and that I never hang out with anyone so I try to hide it from him with excuses like ""they are out of town"" or ""they are busy with school"". Same thing with my family. I just lie to them and say that I got so many new friends and everything is going great. And I just can't tell them the truth because they so badly wanted me to make friends in uni and I just can't let them down.

And I let myself down too because the only thing I really wanted when I started uni was to make friends and to really have those close friendships with people and it just didn't happen. I feel awful about it. I failed the one thing I wanted. And I feel like I tried so hard and still failed.

And the worst part is that I don't know if it is even real. What if all these people actually view me as a friend and everything is good between us. That I am just making everything up in my traumatized brain. Because like I said earlier sometimes when I hang out with these people I feel like that they truly are my friends. What if I'm just imagining all the bad stuff. So I really shouldn't feel lonely  and I still do feel lonely and then I feel ashamed that I do.

But yeah I just wanted to vent I guess. I've been feeling kinda down lately and just wanted to let everything out. I also want to note that English is not my first language so I apologize for all mistakes. Also edit: my bf has been out of town for few weeks and I haven't seen or spoken to anyone in person during this time and that's why I have been feeling down and more lonely than usual.",2022-06-11 22:34:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579627827,5,/r/lonely/comments/va89zy/i_feel_ashamed_to_feel_lonely/,,0,2,I feel ashamed to feel lonely

They may not be directly involved but the help facilitate the actions non the less. Or her taking the opinion of people who don't even know anything about me and acting like it's okay to go against me even when my ex was around.

2151,vactzj,-Awesomesauce-15101,"So I wrote a poem expressing my loneliness. Cause I know someone needs to hear this.

Just A Feeling

I am in a house full of people 

But yet I still feel lonely 

Does anyone notice you 

See I scream and scream 

Oh you didn't see 

Well if you would have noticed me maybe you could have known 

If you look into my eyes 

Do you see life inside 

Cause I don't 

Still feel like I am only moving to survive 

Like living paycheck to paycheck

Just trying to survive 

Not like someone going to rescue me 

How are you mentioning Jesus dying right now 

What will that do 

I still feel pain inside 

I still feel numb inside 

Oh that was God showing his love 

But will that do if I still feel lonely 

Doesn't your Hod says he won't abandon you 

Does he still talk to you

Well yes but 

Do you still feel lonely 

Yeah I still do 

I feel like breaking someone's neck 

I feel like punching someone in the face 

Don't you have friends 

Well yeah 

Do they check on you 

Only when I see them in person 

Well they can't read your mind 

Yes that is true

But they would know I am lonely 

How will they know 

Do you think people can read your thoughts 

And your soul cause if so we all be in jail right now 

But I still feel lonely 

Just a feeling I get 

It will go away 

But I am lying to myself 

Who can you call then 

Who can you text then 

I got no one

No one of my family members causes they died 

Sorry you can talk to us 

You have a community 

Yeah but it's not the same 

I can't hug them 

I can't cry on their shoulder 

I get it, man 

Though I have people 

I am surrounded by people who don't care 

There are just not enough caring people

If I was a penguin feeling cold 

I would have a community to warm me up 

Always sticking together 

Yeah but still feel lonely 

Don't you get it 

That is just a feeling 

Isn't that rude to say 

No cause 

Though feeling lonely weighs you down 

Feeling lonely shows you something 

You see there is still someone there 

Someone to¬† cheer you up 

If no in-person you got God to talk to 

He understands how you feel 

Don't¬† you see 

I write what I feel 

God in spirit the holy spirit guide me 

Lonely is what he gave me 

He allowed this feeling to happen 

Cause he had you in mind 

Why would a loving God allow this 

Don't you see he is calling you

Someone to¬† cheer you up 

If no in-person you got God to talk to 

He understands how you feel 

Don't¬† you see 

I write what I feel 

God in spirit the holy spirit guide me 

Lonely is what he gave me 

He allowed this feeling to happen 

Cause he had you in mind 

Why would a loving God allow this 

Don't you see he is calling you

He is helping you see 

Jesus is the loneliest person in the world 

But that feeling didn't control 

The father guided him through that loneliness 

Even on the day when he could have run away 

But Jesus run past that loneliness 

He conquers that feeling 

Still feel lonely 

I know but you have to see the truth

2152,vacvha,weeman2525,"First and formost I'm a kind, compassionate, and considerate person. I like to be outdoors. I enjoy the sun and staying tan. I love being on the water. I like to drink and have fun. I have a two year old German Shepherd that is crazy, but awesome, and I'm good with dogs in general. I'm also good with kids. My niece and nephew and my little cousins love me. I'm a decent home cook and don't mind cooking. I don't mind getting my hands dirty and working hard. I've worked labor jobs since I was 22. I'm 31 now. So I've picked up DIY skills over the years and can take care of most maintenence issues around the house. I'm also pretty tech savvy and good with computers and technology in general. I'm a clean person. I clean my place and car once a week. I recently left my job to be home more for my elderly grandpa as he gets older he needs more and more of my attention and help with things. I live on his property in his guest house so I'm close by when he needs me. My little house isn't anything special, but it's clean and comfortable. I have a back patio that overlooks the river. Over the past couple of years I've slowly began to modernize it with new stuff. I'm pretty fortunate to be able to live here. It's beautiful water front property. I have a river in my backyard. I do everything around the house. All the yard work. I do most of the cleaning for my grandpa. I do his laundry. I cook him dinner every night. I run all his errands and take him to his doctor's appointments since he can't drive anymore. Honestly taking care of him is a lot of work and can be pretty stressful. He is in better shape than most 88 yr olds, but still, I have to help or do virtually everything for him.

I feel like that is just one big humble brag, but I'm in a mood, so fuck it. I'm awesome and would be an absolute catch for someone. I've got a pretty sweet set up, and all things considered what should be a damn good life. I just wish I had someone to share it with. I hate being so fucking lonely and depressed, and fucking angry too. I feel like I have so much to offer someone, but none if it matters because I'm 5'3"" and average looking. I try to stay positive and optimistic, and to be fair for the most part I've grown to be content with being alone.

2156,vadalo,[deleted],"Well I have come to a certain dilemma: is it better to harm others to benefit myself or harm myself to help others. 

A little bit of context: 

Recently I have been reflecting on my past friends and conversations when I came upon a common theme. The theme is that I usually like to reach out to others in order to be social. However, in the conversation I guess the best way to describe it is that I am either a chain or a leech. I tend to either feed off of others happiness and cause them to feel worse so I feel better or I tend to drag them down. 

My question about this I guess is that should I stop being selfish and reaching out to others?

I know I am by nature just going to waste their time or make their day worse, so should I just isolate myself so that no one has to suffer by interacting with me?",2022-06-12 03:27:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/vadalo/need_some_opinions_on_a_moral_dilemma_about_myself/,,0,4,Need some opinions on a moral dilemma about myself

But are we all so fortunate to experience something so important? Something way more than a need, it is a fundamental part of our human nature. We desperately try to cling on, we try to be seen and heard and validated every moment of our lives. But what if there is no one to see, hear, or feel what you are feeling? What if you are all alone? No, that would be a nightmare too few people would accept living in. After all, what is the point of life if your existence isn't even acknowledged? But the bitter pill to swallow is loneliness, the fact that we are not accepted for whatever reason, experiencing life unnoticed by the rest, only living for ourselves, never ceasing to be a source of misery to one's self. But of course, as time goes by, the hole within your heart starts growing larger, you can't keep hiding from it forever. You can try and temporarily fix it with all kinds of things, but the truth is once the hole is opened, there is nothing you can do to fix it. The only medication you need is to find a human connection. So you become a desperate man, searching for something that will make you whole again. And what is that thing specifically? That is another imperfect human being just like you, who you can share your life with. By sharing each other you merge into one entity, which is the most beautiful intimacy of all. The reason that got you to seek loneliness is the rejection of your true self by others. So you change to fit in a new narrative, to fit in with the same people who left you in the dirt before. But it doesn't matter, to you, all that matters is getting rid of the unbearable pain you were feeling before. Oh, all the things that loneliness makes us do, we try so desperately to get noticed by others, for our power, our intellect, our flawless talents, yet no one shows up to the party. If only you could, I only there was a way. But no, that is too good to be true, you are not accepted for reasons outside of your control, therefore it is fate that you will be this way until you die. The terrible blow to your fragile ego is when you learn that you are not desired, accepted, loved, or praised by others. Oh what a grave mistake my life must have been, for I am a failure in all regards if my existence doesn't mean a thing to other people living beside me. If I can't bring any value, joy, and happiness, then what good am I for? Nothing! I am but a lonely and empty shell of a human being. A soul who has been destroyed from the inside and who can no longer bear the pain that reality has given. My desires were unfulfilled, my dreams crumbled to pieces, and my future was reduced to ashes. There is nothing left for me to do, I will wander this earth lost and hopeless for eternity. The only thing that awaits is the inevitable demise of my constructed self.",2022-06-12 08:46:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608137082,3,/r/lonely/comments/vahsow/shared_loneliness/,,0,5,Shared loneliness

2194,vaiad5,ozweego25,"Last year I found out my gf cheated on me and shortly after I was the reason all my friends left me. My dad was trying to come back into my life, I crashed my car, and I was going through loneliness being bedridden in my house for a month and a half after getting ACL surgery. Instead of being a normal human and balancing these emotions I took my anger out on them over a gift they had bought me for my birthday by saying shitty things about it and saying I didn‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs one of the biggest regrets of my life because they didn‚Äôt deserve that and I really loved the gift. I can‚Äôt even put into words how important they were and how much they meant to me, but I guess they don‚Äôt see it that way. 
I always see them still hanging out and having a great time on social media and find myself looking back at old videos and pictures of us just messing around and having the time of our lives. Two of them still talk to me but it feels like it‚Äôs out of pity sometimes and that they just see me to smoke weed. I feel like I have to force us to meet up or it doesn‚Äôt happen, but I‚Äôm grateful they‚Äôre still around at least.

It‚Äôs about to be the one year mark of it all and I‚Äôm about to spend my birthday alone for the first time in forever it feels like. I think I‚Äôm at the lowest point of my life for real this time. I somehow always manage to ruin my best friendships and hate myself for it. I have bad social anxiety and suck at making new friends and often don‚Äôt like looking for new ones either. I know I have to be open to making new friends or finding a new hobby and all that, but I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish I could just redo my life from the start.

2205,vajoip,Tommy_Sub4,"I am a big dreamer, always dreaming how my days will became better every time that i got a new idea in how to face a new future, but every time that I think in giving the first step, i hesitate and I lost those opportunities. Writing here is a small step that i demanded myself to write to start changing.

Talking about these help me get to the point, without taking the initiative, maintaining relationships is hard, even making new friendships is a distant thought. And there is the problem, I ended in my comfort zone watching Netflix or reading, hoping for a new day to begin for me to change but months passed by and when i looked back, the word ""friends"" turned into empty words. 

Going back, I was always enthusiastic and outgoing, sports, studies, friendships, back then i found almost everything exciting, but maybe the excess of enthusiasm made those experiences short by that time, as nothing lasted more than 2 years. The cheerful me ended more reserved, trying to reign that enthusiasm by limiting the times i leaved my house. Later i don't know but i think i developed a fickle heart, I loathed the mistakes i made that make difficult for me to forget especially when they became jokes between friends, making me cautious in how i interact with people. Then honesty became an issue too where i lost trust in those friends, maybe most of you experienced when those friends hid things from you like when they go out or the obvious lies they tell you in the face just to avoid making the environment uncomfortable :(example, I tried to call you to invite you but you didn't answer) things like that). It became harder from that moment to make new friends, especially when you try hard by starting conversations and not receiving the expected results.

I don't know what changed but this mentality of cautiousness and trust issues even affected my professional life. I stopped studying, dropping out of the university and now unemployed, without friends to talk or someone to lean on. I tried to accept this loneliness but i just can't keep going. I am reaching a breaking point, especially every familiar birthdays where your family ask you what are you doing with your life and i don't know what to answer, i really hate to lie and it became harder to avoid those embarrassing questions.

The reason for the title is that i love dreaming, love the new ideas but when those dreams crashed down i got scared of continuing dreaming. I am currently 22, i made this post in HOPING to get some answers, in better words, get some help. What can i do with my life?, i don't like psychiatrics. 

To end this post, i would like to offer my help to those people who are like me and hate those group chats or are too shy to make an online post. I would like to hear your problems and maybe offer the same help that i wish i could receive by becoming your support.",2022-06-12 11:05:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639251678,6,/r/lonely/comments/vajoip/hope_is_a_beautiful_feeling_as_well_as_dangerous/,,0,0,Hope is a beautiful feeling as well as dangerous.

2208,vajw89,Cyanide_Revolver,"I moved to London two months ago and since coming here I've just run into problems. First my car broke down and I ended up needing to get a new one, then I was having to hunt for a new flat and when I did find one, realised I couldn't afford it. Now I'm lodging at a flat just outside London.

I haven't settled over here yet and I feel more and more unhappy the longer this goes on. Yesterday I broke down and cried down the phone to my girlfriend about missing home and not knowing what to do. I want this move to work out and I want to start a career in my field (not enough work going on back home in that department), but it's been so slow and agonising that it just feels like it's not worth it.

I've also got no friends out here either. I go to the LondonSocialClub meetups every once in a while when I have the time or money, but haven't been going regularly enough to make any friends or anything. I'll just spend my days in my room on my laptop, or else drive out to places like Brighton and take some pictures, but now I'm not even sure about doing that since fuel prices are getting more and more expensive (I've literally paid ¬£1.90 per litre of petrol). Yesterday my dad rang and when I said I drove down to Brighton he asked if I was lonely, and I lied and said no. Truthfully I did feel lonely and being in Brighton would've helped me clear my head, but I didn't want to admit that to him because it's both sad and would only make him worry.

I just feel so fed up and don't know how much longer I can stick this out. I'm simply unhappy and even as I type this out I can feel myself tearing up a bit. I wanna go home, but I don't wanna admit defeat or give up on this potential career move too soon.",2022-06-12 11:20:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1485481431,2,/r/lonely/comments/vajw89/lonely_out_in_london/,,0,2,Lonely out in London

2212,vakev2,TonysTomatoes,"I often see people online say ""Learn to love yourself before loving others"", it's hard for me to describe why this phrase rubs me the wrong way, perhaps it is because people who say this are unable to recognise that different people have different needs, and different preferences when it comes to what makes them feel happy, what makes them feel a life is worth living, what makes them feel fulfilled.

I know for me, I feel the most happy when I feel wanted by my peers, when I'm valued, and when I'm loved and cherished by those who I hold dear. But unfortunately, I haven't felt that way for years, I don't have any real friends, and on average, I would describe myself as abandoned, unwanted, and despised. I became miserable, bitter, and resentful, and I envy people who are inherently comfortable with themselves, with no need for approval from others. I am jealous of those who have friends they love, who loves them back.

I know I'm a naturally romantic and affectionate person, platonically speaking, I used to buy a lot of gifts for people I used to hold dear, I used to really want to spend time with them, I used to have a lot of affection to give, lot of smile and laughter, and a lot of optimism for people to treat me right. But with betrayal, heartache, and loneliness, I find myself withholding all the love I could give, unwilling to love someone else more than it is necessary.

Recently, I find myself feeling very lonely, I think about all the beautiful lovely strangers I met at work, their smile and kind words, I feel a touch of sadness knowing that I'll never be part of their lives, because I have so much to give, all the love, smile, laugh, hugs I could've gave, I am invisible and empty, why am I even here?

But I guess its more emotion led as apposed to feeling low because of lack of sunlight, grey skies, shorter days etc. Summer makes me more aware of how alone I am and how few plans I have. 

My social life is my work. All the people I know and chat to are from all the jobs I‚Äôve had. I work in places with big teams and thousands of visitors (hospitality) and what‚Äôs mad is that I‚Äôm incredibly sociable, people tell me daily that I‚Äôm hilarious and fun and cool and stylish and gorgeous‚Ä¶ and they all think my life must be full and satisfying‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm very open about my loneliness.  But that part seems to fall on deaf ears. 

Heck I didn‚Äôt even get any invites to any ironic Platinum Jubilee parties over the bank holiday weekend. I‚Äôm not a royalist but I was free like everyone else but had nowhere to go. 

I‚Äôve made plans to volunteer at music festivals this year and I‚Äôm actually excited about that :) Ordinarily music festival season pains me because I don‚Äôt have people to go with. I can‚Äôt rally up anyone I know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like herding cats when I‚Äôve tried. 

While everyone is getting giddy about all the fun in the sun they can now have‚Ä¶ it just reminds me of how lonely I am and how single I am. Chronically single. I could do things with friends / people I know but, at 38 years old I‚Äôm so bored of that. So I just pull my blinds down and stay inside. 

Last year I was sat in a park with some work friends (they‚Äôre wonderful) and just looking around I felt hyper aware of how young everyone was. And there I am schlepping around still, no real progress in my love life. I imagined what I‚Äôd rather be doing and that was just being with my person. Not necessarily alone with my person, but having a blended friend group, blended family or something. But I‚Äôm sat there in this park full of gen x and gen z, watching them sipping on tinnies (canned beers). I just wanted to cry. So I left and went back to my home and pulled the blinds down.  

I‚Äôve also noticed a pattern that I meet someone around April/May‚Ä¶ I get rejected / dumped / ghosted by June and that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs me even more devastated as summer rolls in.

I‚Äôll text them or talk to them in real life and have no idea what to say.

2242,vare01,TalkingAboutMyissues,"Hi, I'm posting here cause I feel kinda lonely right now and this is practically an essay.

When I was 4 my mum took me for ADHD diagnosis and it took 3 years and i was given a diagnosis of ADHD and torettes but the doctor took I'll and then retired, this was when the scottish NHS primarily used paper files (2012) and they couldn't contact my doctor to get the notes back so they never gave me a formal diagnosis but there was 3 doctors that tested me and all three said I had ADHD and torettes but this 1 doctor was the person with the notes. I'm 17 now and the ADHD is a problem as it's developed as I've aged and with exams and social life it feels horrible, I want to get mediated but it's a 4 year waiting list and a 3 year testing period so I can get a rediagnosis for something I already know I have. To make things worse the doctor told my primary school at the time so I went through primary school with support for ADHD but not in high school.

This leads me to now, due to covid I didn't get final exams last year for my N5 qualification but this year I did get exams for my higher qualification and when we did our first mid term exam my brain couldn't handle it and I basically collapsed mentally.

My exams ended a few weeks ago and I think I managed to do well somehow. 

However I spoke to my mum about wanting to get medication and rediagnosis as I'm struggling but my mum just diminished it saying that ""while my mind does 10 to a dozen it's not like you're struggling in school because your grades are fine and you're a functional member of society and you're not bouncing up and down the class like you did in primary school""

I still want to run about the class but I force myself not to and I do struggle in school but the subjects I do good in are the ones where I'm interested about everything and everyother grade that I need for university but I'm not interested in is just a fail.

However he worst part is socially, I've got a friend group of 13 people and only 1-3 of them are close but I'm starting to lose a grip on my ADHD and they just make things worse right now.

I've tried explaining ADHD and what it's like but they just don't care to listen about any of it.

They make jokes (at my expense) and talk me down about things I can't control (like my struggle to study) but again when I try telling them why its hard they either refuse to listen to why its difficult or they tell me that I'm just refusing their solutions (solutions like ""have you tried just doing the questions from previous years over and over).

They complain about my impulsiveness (both from ADHD and torettes) but if I get annoyed by someone else making random comments (deliberately to antagonise me and they do it all the time as a dig) they call me hypocritical. If I make impulsive decisions they say that I don't think things through and then call me an idiot 

When I struggle with the emotional dysregulation the call me soft or a snowflake or they say that I can make jokes but can't take them I say a single thing and then they make jokes about me for the next hour and I try to laugh it off cause I know they're jokes but when I can't take it anymore they just talk about me.
They then say I can't control my emotions and call me cold-hearted or say I've got a bad temper.

They make fun of my intelligence because I can't do good in classes I don't find interesting but they can do good in everything plus because they can study easily they say stuff like *""yea, you're so intelligent that you got that A for physics didn't you?""* ( I failed physics and math) they say similar things about maths.

There's a lot of other things but I don't want to type them all out.

My friends refuse to let me explain the ADHD but when I mention ADHD is why I do this thing the way I do they just say I'm using it as an excuse and that I just do it all the time but they won't let me tell them how that's the reason and then they say "" I don't care"" or ""Did I ask!"".

That actually happened an hour ago which js why I'm writing this.

My friends listed of some of the things I use ADHD/torettes as an excuse for but I left before they finished listing things cause I couldn't handle it:
 Not doing well in physics/math
 Saying/doing random things (making a weird noise etc.)
 Being okay with a joke 1 minute and then angry the next
 Not being confident/having high self esteem 
 Being anxious/overthinking


Am I overreacting, am I just making excuses and I know no one reading this will have the answer but I just need to vent.
 
I just feel so lonely like no one understands and worse no one even cares enough to attempt to understand, I wish I could talk to other people but I'm at a small school and everyone either thinks I'm weird or don't like me, anyone I could be friends with I am friends with.


What truly hurts about his though is I got really depressed a while ago and tried to fix things and managed to get myself into a routine (it took a month to actually start doing the things I wanted to) and when I had gotten his routine I *ATTEMPTED* to explain everything to my friends but they kept saying things like ""you're really going to do this, there's no point going to bed at 10PM"" or things like ""you're just going to stop having caffeine, you're saying you've got an addiction but by saying that doesn't that mean you're addicted to breathing or you're addicted to going to bed at 10"".   I was having so much caffeine I was shaking and having cold sweats, I'd be drink 3 coffees, 2 monster energy drinks, 2 pepsi's and 8 or more cups of tea.


I just feel so lonely and disliked, I can't get help because even though covid has past the hospitals still won't do anything non-critical so therapy or medication/rediagnosis is out of the question, I don't have any family to talk to and I don't have any friends I can talk to.

Sometimes I just want to curl up and cry myself to death, I can't talk to people cause I get to anxious and over think whatever I say, everyone thinks I'm weird and no one around me will even let me talk to them about my problems.

Thanks for reading this if you got down this far. I don't even know if this makes sense. I've got no clue what to do.

2259,vatr0m,mooneyes77,"So I've been through 7 levels of hell but somehow have come out of a very prolonged crisis. I went through it mostly alone so I think unconsciously I used the internet to remain ""connected"" to humans. It has become my default way of functioning though. I wake up and instantly turn on the computer and check FB and a few other sites, mostly from mindless habit. I hardly know anyone on FB in real life, just folks I used to know but I guess it gives me some superficial sense of connection. Now I'm out of crisis, but that habit remains, and with it the isolation/loneliness. I get that it is hard and takes time/effort to make new friends but it's near impossible if I spend most of my time here, staring at a screen. Hence the catch-22. 

Does anyone else relate?

For me I have experienced lots of trauma from people so there is an unconscious drive to avoid them, so this feels safer, but it's not truly satisfying. It's like a false positive. From a loneliness standpoint, at this point, it is almost self fulfilling. I know better than to think a computer could satisfy my human connection needs, but here I am, still. Habits are hard to break. Covid didn't help either.

One solution would be to get rid of my internet. Close one door, and others will open? Honestly I can't imagine that except when I was younger I got a long just fine without it. Even talked on the phone. Do people still do that? One thing. There is a public library only 10 minute walk from my house. I could still get my daily internet ""fix"" but at least I would have to leave the house, and there would be a reasonable time limit.

Even without the social component I used to be so active and productive, which felt more satisfying than sitting in front of a screen 4 plus hours a day. Honestly I haven't even read a book in ages. I used to read a lot. The more I think about it the more it seems like it could be better not having home internet. In the long run I would feel less lonely, and much more mindful.

Has anyone tried it? I'm thinking if I do it as say a 6 month experiment, it wouldn't seem so impossible.",2022-06-12 19:45:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1550955967,3,/r/lonely/comments/vatr0m/catch22/,,0,2,Catch-22

Lately I'm more tired mentally then usually and it feels like I either can't talk about how I feel with the people I know, or just that it would be an unnecessary burden on them cause they have their own issues. 

I'm 23 and still till now, even though I'm trying to focus finally on myself, instead I'm still helping my parents and two siblings. And this help is with things that they are fully capable of doing themselves it's only more comfortable for them when I do it for them. Like for example today my sister was supposed to come back from her weekend work and my parents were the once to suggest to her that they they would drive her back after what they were both drinking. She couldn't use her phone at work and so couldn't find another transport back so I had to go with them, sitting in the car next to my drunk father... Later when it was getting late and I'm getting frustrated because I need to get ready for work tomorrow my father doesn't understand the issue and my mother's only response is that that she also has work and has to get up even earlier then me. But that was not my choice to come to the city but theirs. 

Yesterday aftern cleaning half the house at 2 am I found my father sleeping on the floor after he has fallen because he was drinking earlier, I had to woke him up cause I was worried if he was alright. I barely slept the night because of it. And it the morning my mom was only concerned about the fact that according to her i didn't clean enough and should do more, even though I told her that I was tired because of what happened during the night.
Sometimes it feels like for them I'm everyone but a daughter...

I'm just tired by it all, for so many years taking care of everyone but myself. It all makes me more and more lonely cause I never even had much time to really connect with other people because I had to worry about my family and do what they wanted. I just wish I had someone that would support me with it all, someone that would just spend time with me away from it all, would hug me and make me feel good just for a little.

4am in NYC

This city smells,

like defeat,

if this is the land of prosperity,

why are there so many homeless in the streets?

After a show about saving the world,

on the rooftop of The Empire State Building,

I decided to take a walk alone,

with no one but my feelings,

I started on the Lower East Side,

Houston St to be specific,

then headed north on Broadway,

night walks to me are intrinsic,

I reached Times Square,

and realized that New York is a ghetto,

yes that might offend some people,

so what both hate and love are my petrol,

look,

soiled gum stain the sidewalks,

like soiled dreams stain the soul,

and I‚Äôd continue but I‚Äôm tired,

my hopes are young but my soul is old,

not all that glitters is gold,

especially not these sequin dresses,

I see a lot of people with a lot of money,

still they don‚Äôt seem to know what blessed is,

caught in a vicious cycle,

earn spend repeat again,

just enough to get through,

casual sex casual friends,

nothing too serious,

don‚Äôt want to make waves,

just want to float here,

no longer need chains to be slaves,

see the American Dream,

has become somewhat of a nightmare,

and I know I could beat these demons,

if only they‚Äôd just fight fair,

wish I could fly away,

but I already spent my flight fare,

so now I‚Äôm blacking out in the white spotlight,

look ma look that‚Äôs me right there,

spotted at 4am,

posted up at Times Square,

sipping‚Äô on some pomegranate,

coming up with more rhymes I‚Äôm a Rhymeaire,

have to find some way,

to make sense of this mess,

so I write away the entire day,

then sleep off whatever is left,

which in this case,

is just remnants,

of broken dreams and other things,

that we find when we exhale breath,

I inhale,

and smell the stench,

of rotting food,

feces and decaying flesh,

whole outside smell like,

piss poor morals and fermented fish,

New York is old news,

everything‚Äôs stale attitude‚Äôs the only thing fresh,

this city smells,

like defeat,

if this is the land of prosperity,

why are there so many homeless in the streets?

I said I can‚Äôt reciprocate his feelings. He tried to kiss me, said he wanted to stay over in my bed, then told me I misinterpreted everything and I should be willing to rebuff him constantly when we continue to hang out. Besides it was just a joke.

I asked how I can be clearer. The answer was that I‚Äôm not clear.

Last week, at 1 am, it was dark outside. My mom told me it was 11am. I had to get the Bible, look up Genesis Ch 1 vs 5. God called the light, day, and the darkness, night. Only then did she agree it was nighttime.

I told my friend I‚Äôm fucking paralyzed and can‚Äôt move and stare at the wall for hours imagining hitting my head. He said one day I‚Äôll laugh at experiencing this paralysis. By the way, if we lived in the same country, he‚Äôd date me.

Two weeks ago I called a mental health retreat and said I needed to stay where someone would take me seriously. They did, until the end of the week, when another guest kept touching my leg and hugging me. ‚ÄúI know him from way back when,‚Äù one of the staff members told me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how he is.‚Äù Another one said, when I asked for supervision, ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt responsible for what happens between guests.‚Äù

I messaged my dog park group chat ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to figure out my work, class, and study schedule. Can I have (friend a‚Äôs) work schedule so I can plan dog park time too?‚Äù Friend b answered and said she did not like this idea. Conversation escalated to Friend B telling me I‚Äôm privileged, my problems aren‚Äôt real, I don‚Äôt have depression, I never improve. 

I blocked them. Yesterday they both showed up in my driveway to scream at me until I apologized for starting the fight. I did not apologize because I did not start a fight. I asked for Friend A‚Äôs work schedule. Even though they determined I do not have depression and all my problems are fake, they still thought I was dead somehow. Why would I be dead if I don‚Äôt have depression? Why would I be dead if I don‚Äôt have problems?

Today my mom told me I haven‚Äôt tried hard enough to find ‚Äúmy people‚Äù.

2296,vawoxe,impressivepenguin9,"At the end of April, I had to undergo back surgery for the second time in three years. When I woke up, almost my entire right leg was numb. I was in the hospital for almost three weeks. At that point, I was only seeing friends for just a little bit as they helped me do things like laundry and groceries. 

I currently use a walker to get around. I'm usually either stuck at home or at physical therapy. Of course, I'm grateful for the support I've gotten and resources I was able to access. It's just been physically and mentally taxing. 

I have tried doing social things, only to feel like a burden because I walk slowly and require certain accommodations so I stay within my restrictions. Sitting on hard surfaces like benches really hurts and walking on uneven ground or grass is taxing. It kind of feels like my friends don't understand that it's hard for me to feel included when they walk ahead faster. And people walking on the sidewalk...they don't even make room for me. It's frustrating that I get tired more easily even though I want to continue being social. 

Now, I'm finding that my friends are frequently hanging out together without me and even going out of their way to tell me what they did. It feels shitty because they know I'm not able to get around (I don't drive). It just makes me question my friendships because I fear that they'll just leave me out of things because I need more assistance. I don't want to feel this way, but it hurts to not feel included.

I just needed somewhere to vent. Please be gentle. This is all new for me (the first surgery went better than this time around).

I always thought I had friends but it turns out...not really.  I had colleagues, old schoolmates, and distant family members.  It has been years since I really had a friend to rely on. Sad, but I think it's kind of normal in America. I wish I had known this beforehand and I might have been a little more serious about settling down and not being so picky or waiting for that perfect spouse. Especially, when I consider I'm no great catch.  I also might have given more thought to my health and finances and not to a frivolous pursuit of turning a hobby into a successful business.  Only follow your heart if it profits you.  All this realization is like waking from a good dream to find out life is something of a nightmare. Not the short and terrifying kind but the long and dreadful kind.  My only saving grace is my faith in Christ. All these years I never took too much thought about reading the Bible but now I do find peace when I read it and I do feel as if God does talk to us through His word.  Full disclosure: I hate to read the small print so I find it much easier listening to an audio Bible. This is not to preach but to share. Life is a gift but it also seems like a marathon and  I now truly understand the levity of life, death, loneliness, and faith.  I hope and pray life will get better for all of us with lonely hearts and I appreciate it if you would do the same for me. Take care, don't lose heart, and may God bless you.",2022-06-12 22:58:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652940130,6,/r/lonely/comments/vaxsy1/ever_so_lonely_but_not_without_hope/,,0,2,Ever so lonely but not without hope.

2313,vayjt2,MarieDifr,"I married someone who is aggressive and mean. He constantly likes to point out my flaws and make me feel little. Like i get it, im ugly and fat, or as he likes to tell me, ""you're not completely hopeless and could be attractive if you lost some weight, but will never look like you did at 18 when we met"". He's 10 years older than me as well.

People are quick to just tell me to leave, but I can't. I'm disabled, rely on him to take care of me, my parents are super poor and my dad is going through chemo currently, so I would only be a burden to them that they couldn't afford. I don't have any friends. I'm great at pushing people away because I can be quite the negative Nancy, because life fucking sucks. Also, I've had some mental health problems and been inpaitent 40+ times over the course of 8 years. I made some shitty mistakes last time I tried to leave him and ended up in a hole in someone's basement for 6 months, no joke. Being abducted has everything to do with my mental health problems and why I was so unconcerned about being fat for a while.  I've lost 80 lbs now the last 8 months, or so. 
We have a daughter who is soon to be 9 and if I leave, he will certainly get custody. My mental health record, including suicide attempts, make sure of that. When I was 14 I fell 60' off a cliff while put with ROTC, it messed me up pretty badly, buy I recovered for the most part. I graduated early and got a bachelor's in organic chemistry, commissioned into the Navy, got a dishonorable discharge(long story), but managed to get shot in the abdomen during my service. I survived and got better and then got my master's in Chemical Engineering. Then got pregnant with my daughter and was so sick with her that I spent 4 months in the hospital and she came at 7 months. She was in a bad way for a little while, but she's just a normal kid now. Truly the thing I am most thankful for. If I left and he got custody of her I could never forgive myself. I'm trying to hold out until she's 18 and I no longer have to worry about whose custody she'll end up in. I needed a shunt placed 2 years ago and have it placed 4 times total. If you're unsure what that is, it's a catheter that runs to the ventricles of my brain and has a tube coming out the back of my skull(still under my skin) that feeds down through my neck and drains all the spinal fluid that shouldn't be building up into my brain into my abdomen so my body can reabsorb it. I have hydrocephalus, for which I take medication that's main side effect is weight gain. Then on top of that I had a brain tumor removed last October, a stroke in April and an aneurysm in May, both of this year. It's been a rough year. Ha. 

Anyway, I've rambled on enough about my existence. All I really want is to feel loved and wanted by someone romantically. Maybe there's someone in the same kind of shitty situation, but I hope not, for their sake. In the off chance there is maybe someone will message me. I'm not holding my breath. I'm used to being alone. I've grown accustomed to a damp pillow every night as I wish that God, or whatever cosmic power, would just end my suffering. 

I live in Texas, if that's important to the picture at all. 

I'm not so depressed all the time. I like to paint and draw and craft in general. I love music, movies and reading. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc... 
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

I've had a few relationships, but they never worked out... the longest was 10 months. That was my first ever proper relationship, and that, was the beginning where it all fell apart...

So much, that I've been in a relationship and tried to have a relationship with a friend I had know for quite a while, but it was just a disaster... I couldn't feel more lonely after that.

I ended up posting a lot of my spirals on FB, I actually lost a job from one of my spirals because in a post I mentioned the company and in previous posts I talked about my attacks from my childhood, they said what I wrote over my attacks was ‚Äòdisturbing.‚Äô I stopped using a majority of social media because a lot of people were saying that I was just wanting attention or that I was crazy.

2363,vb2xu5,SpiralSour,"Hello r/lonely, this is really just an impromptu vent that I trust I won't be judged for because, well, this is r/lonely.

When I was ten years old, I was pulled out of school due to a girl falsely accusing me of threatening to rape her. I was subject to years of manipulation and emotional abuse/neglect at the hands of my mother and to a lesser extent, stepfather.

I developed janked as fuck, and still lack maturity in some places my similarly aged peers have already mastered, as well as having maturity in places they do not. 

I'm sixteen currently, and last year in June, after having effectively no friends or prolonged human interaction, I found my tribe. It was a homeschool recovery group for fellas such as myself that had been subject to intense isolation and suffered the repercussions that has on a human, especially when it occurs at a young age. I fell in love, a girl and a boy, at the same time.

They fell in love with each other and me. We had a truly beautiful relationship and I considered them my family for life. It was all virtual, but through video calls, and texting sessions that spanned several, several hours, it was every bit as magical as a first love should be.

It lasted roughly five months, but the cracks started forming after three. Due to a difference of moralistic opinions, my girlfriend ghosted me in early December, citing a loss of passion. Not that I ever heard her say that, the other boy in this relationship was told that by her, and while she felt bad, she didn't feel bad enough to respond to me.

Shortly after that, the boy, who had a complicated relationship with me, but who I dubbed ""my brother"", came to a somewhat mutual agreement with me that we were corroding each other. We were detrimental to each other's development and it was time for us to take a break, for how long was unclear, but our love had been so marvelous at it's peak, it would inevitably, one day, resume.

I almost immediately got closer with two others from the homeschool recovery group, I had talked with them before, but never at great length. It wasn't as instant as my love for the previous two, but it did eventually develop into a love of sorts. They were my best friends.

I was still reeling from losing my brother and the girl I wanted to marry, I trusted them and I confided in them, they were like a chair you sit on at the end of a long day. You don't expect the chair to break. The thought doesn't even cross your mind. The day was so exhausting, and took such a toll on you, surely it would be karmically cruel for this chair to fail you, to collapse and confirm what this hellacious day has been trying to teach you. 

The universe does not fucking like you.

An argument. I don't even know how it began. It started as a small disagreement, and over the course of an hour and a half of failed de-escalations, crescendoed into the anticlimactic implosion of the first of my two friendships.

The one remaining friend. I loved her, truly, and more than that, I trusted her. I asked her if me and her had any lingering issues that needed to be qualmed. She said no. She said we were fine.

A phone call. Late April, me and her hadn't been talking as often since me and our mutual friend disconnected. We talked for hours. About her being an aunt to my prospective son. I went to sleep with a best friend. I woke up without one.

A string of paragraphs describing how fed up she had become with me, how she appreciated all I've done for her, but that it was time to cut contact. A hypocritical display of heart-wrenching abandonment. She said we were fine.

I had since come to learn my brother had actually convinced her to stop talking to me, despite having a front row view to and condemning what our girlfriend did to me. 

A girlfriend, a brother, two best friends. I truly thought, consistently, in one way or another, from June 2021 - April 2022, that I would never be alone again. I was wrong. It feels so alien, having nobody to talk to about the things I struggle with, my anxieties, my fears, my success. I got so comfortable and entrenched in the joy of having company that I had forgotten how ill I am without it. 

There's not a soul in the world that I can truly say I love, and arguably, not one that loves me either.

I tried so hard to make it work, to ensure I wouldn't end up here again, to show my love for my tribe, but despite my very best efforts, I must admit, once again, **I am lonely.**",2022-06-13 03:35:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640572807,2,/r/lonely/comments/vb2xu5/i_thought_i_had_gotten_out/,,0,0,I thought I had gotten out

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm wired for high extroversion but I have no friends at all, it‚Äôs driving me insane. It‚Äôs been like this for the 12 years of my 17 year old self.

And the 5 years that I thought I had friends, I was met with manipulative people that only used me for their own benefits.

I hope college is better, but I don‚Äôt wanna put so much hope on it and then get let down once again. 

Who cares how a random person on the internet feels anyways, it‚Äôll all fade away tommorow. 

Life gets super lonely, when you‚Äôre wasting summer nights, coding and playing video games to fill the void of a lacking social life.

Just the other day I paid for $3 blackbear/mgk/Iann Dior tickets just for my mom to step in and blames Covid saying I could‚Äôve died from it. Even though she works with sick people everyday. The sad thing is that I still haven‚Äôt gotten my money back

So I go back to coding, and playing video games maybe add in some pleasure like jerking off and drinking and boom you have my ideal day.

Now will a social life make me happy? Probably a bit.

But all I want is people, geniune people who wouldn‚Äôt yk use me for what I have and leave me",2022-06-13 06:00:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608406346,5,/r/lonely/comments/vb5aqs/yo_if_you_need_me_im_only_a_textcall_away/,,0,1,Yo if you need me I‚Äôm only a text/call away!

I use to as well but that life is gone. I'm sure i know at what point it happened but I just disassociated myself with a lot of people and a lot of things I use to enjoy doing in life. I've replaced pretty much all my social activity with drinking. I try to find more positive activities to do that don't involve myself just exercising or reading because at the end of the day I'm still usually alone myself. I try to message a lot of friends to talk after I'm done leading a good day. Even people I've met more recently through work and a few events I was invited to but when it comes to making plans it seems nothing ever happens and more often than not dropped off conversations. So no matter how much positive I do and try to think to attract positive energy and people. I'm just sitting by myself at the end of the day for years on end and it's really starting to affect me. I use to love solitude and being down low. Only need the friends I can count on my hand and the relationship I get with a girl here and there and never felt lonely. I feel like I just isolated myself from society to hard for to long and I don't know how to incorporate myself back into society. So I'll just drink and smoke some weed, afraid to hit people up because I just think I'll be found as annoying or lame. I know I need to stick it up and send the text or call on my end more often and I might start getting better results but I'm to far into my shell at this point over this I don't think I can break out of it myself. I'm by no means completely depressed but I don't carry the confidence I use to and I think when I'm alone am I really that guy putting on a genuine smile when I step out into the world or am I putting on a fake smile pretending. I don't know and it's frightening. All I think I want in life right now is just to get back in the social circle and a significant other and I'll feel so much happier and not just filling the void with booze because it's going at a rate where I'm getting scared I'm doing irreversible damage. Long rant sorry I'm done. But if anyone made it to the end of this I would be amazed if anyone would be kind enough to shoot me a message to talk when it gets into night time mountain time because a simple conversing goes long ways for me when the few friends I do have so have them with me.

Do you think it's selfish to look for intellectuel, emotional and spiritual fulfillment in a friendship, or any other relationship?

I have some very close friends but I don't feel related to them, when we're talking or hanging out together, I don't feel stimulated or intrigued, and I feel really drained after it.

I've been on this search for what they call ""a soul family"" but I don't really know where to look.

2463,vbgv8m,CommandoPernod,"Hello All,

I feel like stuck in a difficult situation:

- I live alone and abroad. My situation is a little bit complicated. I was born in a certain country. I moved to another. Then ultimately was forced - my marriage turning fucked up and I was jobless (in the second country), to move where I'm now. Problem is that I did a lot of attemps to socialize...unsuccessfully.

- I work from home as an IT contractor...The job atmosphere turnt chaotic and messy, this is a limited contract and the consulting company I work for, you know, start to hassle me with ""Yes but..."". Ultimately, I will be forced to dismiss or I will be fired...Basically, I live and work from the same place. I feel...oppressed more and more.

- I had this weekend a bold Whatsapp argument with my ex - who is technically still my wife...I never see my kids. And she's behaving hysterical...Accusing of this and that, not aknowledging that being a father remotely oversea ain't exactly the easiest task.

- I had for long sleep issues...Now I try to quit mix of sleep medications. It's in very good way. But I feel tired.

- I go to the gym 3 hours a day...but it's mechanical, like some duty.

- Going out ? Yeah I go to see movies, go to the super maeket...But there is not so much to do. Boring.

- Tried to date...A lot of non-sense and failures. Found a divorced woman but I feel she craveq for sex in a manner that can never be humanly satisfied...And one night a week does not really fill emotional gap. And she lives in universe's asshole, 2 hours drive.

- All my situation feels hassling and more and more tiring. Financially, the edge is not so far.

Am I sick or anyone would find all this suffocating ?

.

Yes, I know it sucks not to have anyone irl wish you or to have fun with.. but I kinda actually also feel the opposite way sometimes. I miss being able to wish other people on their birthdays. I miss being able to celebrate the existence of people in my life. I miss being able to sometimes bring a smile on their faces, and to share their joyous moments with them. 

I know I can't ever have friends again, so I'll never have that opportunity to genuinely wish someone again irl. I know I'm awful and hurtful to others, and it's best that I avoid the good people of this world in real life. That's why just being able to write ""Happy Birthday mate!"" from behind a screen to the good people out here just puts my heart at a little bit of ease. Even if by a little bit, it makes me feel genuinely good and glad to have that opportunity despite being a total stranger. I try to never miss wishing the OP on any of the birthday posts that I do see on my feed, and I hope I don't miss any in the future as well.

So to all of you, thank you so much for sharing your special day with us. It means a lot, at least to me.

And to anyone who's birthday it is today, happy birthday! Please put on a smile and have a lovely day :)

2496,vbm69o,Forsaken_Relief_6308,"Hello!

My name is August! I'm an 18f living in the west coast, and I'm offering comfort through ASMR, sleep-aid, and late night voice calls for anyone who needs it.

To give some background: I'm a reserved student by day, and an empathetic listener by night. I enjoy connecting with people, and exercising my judgement to help guide those who need it. While I understand that I'm fairly young, I like to believe that I have gained enough wisdom to steer people in the right direction.

I want to mention that I'm a fairly busy person. I always have a next assignment to do, so I can only arrange calls during night hours. Because of the hectic order of my life, I am a bad texter. Don't expect a lot of responsiveness on my side (sorry!), I prefer voice-chatting all the way.

If you're going through some hard times - relationship, career, or mental issues - and need someone to vent to, I can be your person. Even if it's something as small as self esteem, I can listen to you and give you some comments that tell you you are doing well.

This can get a little vulnerable, but please make sure to stay within the no-nsfw zone. If you've made it this far, and you want to reach out, please ***PM me your name, age, and location.*** ***Also tell me about what you're going through,*** and we can work something out!

I'm currently doing work and sending these offers sporadically through out the day, so don't feel discourage if you don't get a quick response! Looking forward to talking soon!

Cheers,

August :)",2022-06-13 20:54:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626107515,8,/r/lonely/comments/vbm69o/18f_willing_to_help_those_who_need_it/,,2,10,18F willing to help those who need it.

Also, my last sentence might be too harsh, I too blame on others when the feeling of being lonely takes over. 
And I realised that exposing myself to the same mentality is not healthy for me, so I decided to leave.

I happened to be alone at my workplace for 2 days, and then we had a prolonged weekend due to a holiday, so now it's the 5th day on my own.

If it weren't for my cat I probably would not have spoken a single word in that time. 

I'm sure this doesn't sound too bad, it's only 5 days, but I swear to god I feel like I'm losing it. I still go out of the house, buy groceries, go to the gym or to work. I'm phisically around people, but I still feel so isolated. It's not like the cashier gives a fuck about my life. 

I have talked to friends through social media, but it was nothing deeper than sending memes. On top of that, texting feels more removed somehow. It's still ""talking"", but doesn't really feel like it, you know?

I don't mean to shit on my friends, they are amazing people and they have finals right now, last year of college, so I completely understand why it's been so quiet lately. It's just that it doesn't make it easier to handle.

In the last year my social life has drastically died down, mostly because I started working and didn't have much free time anymore, but I've usually never been this lonely for this long.

I really have to thank my cat though, he's the only reason I'm still hanging on. I love the furry fucker, he makes me feel loved when the rest of my life is looking really gray right now.

2654,vc5qtx,pretentioussweetpea,"Therapy and failing a subject gave me enough push to start working on myself during the day , but boy oh boy, does it get hard at night! 
There's not a single day that i don't cry myself to sleep everyday. I feel so lonely. I want to be seen , loved and most importantly, held.
Even if it's just a casual thing, i want someone to hold me and tell me they care.i want someone to show me kindness. 
Recently i visited a friend who i like romantically too, but he could not or did not saw me as a romantic interest anymore. I respected his space and his lack of interest. So , i didn't  make any attempts to connect with him deeply or made any moves. He respects my friendship and he deserves a friend who doesn't use him for her needs. 
While i was at his place, most of the time he was in his world and i was forced to be in mine and it was terrible. That's what I try to Espace by hanging out with people. But, alas! So, not feeling the same energy from someone i like always reminds me of how lonely i am. I cried myself to sleep at his place too. I got a separate room üòî. I guess he didn't feel the chemistry anymore or just wasn't interested.
God know how much i resisted the urge to hold his hand or touch his hair or express my love in some way. But ik , we're not compatible, he is his own person and my needs are not compatible with someone who likes to be on their own most of the time.so, it's for the best anyway. Idk. It would have felt good to be held by him though. Ik, I'm just screaming into the void here shouting That i want to be held but it's all i can do now. People on dating sites don't just want to hold you. People who want to hold you are not capable of doing that anymore.I wish I had someone to talk to everyday atleast. Like the words might hold me just enough for a while.ughhh it feels disgusted to be this needy and to want something this much , makes me powerless but i guess i just want to surrender to someones love.

It doesn't seem to matter anymore I've tried to find people they claim they want to talk but they ghost you in every turn when you try to start a conversation and I'm tired humans are cruel and I guess they always have been I have a few friends but I can't do anything on my own I just simply can't function like most people I can't work because of PTSD and psychosis if you try to say you can do anything you could put your mind to it you're full of s*** life don't work that way there are some things you can fix and others you can't I suffer from depression as well which gets worse every single day unlucky but my dog keeps me going helps me get up every morning.

I have tried to socialize with people but I can't be around large crowds I may not have money left over to do anything all of it goes to my rent and food as well as supplies I live at a f****** Marina and have been for 3 years in pain loneliness is dangerous to human mind you have no idea how much it hurts when you try to open up to someone you actually have a bit of a thing for thinking it's a connection only for them to tell you're nothing nothing but hopelessness takes over the mind I'm not the end of my road there is no path said before me anymore because no one even considers saving another person's life because they're too selfish and entitled and greedy.

Let's spend some long nights for a short time, then maybe more.
Discord VC mainly, chat for more info.

Things we should do.
I'd love to spend some hours at night listening and sharing music with each other (sad chill, pop, edm and some other stuff.)
I'd also to have some casual chatting, asking questions, venting, and over all opening up. Really introspective and I'm sure we have some great fun.

I like anime, league of legends, fortnite, valorant, and some other steam games once in awhile. Although I don't play these games or watch anime often sometimes.

And I skipped every other event (prom, senior class trip, etc.) anyways. So I stayed. Next time I‚Äôll be at school is graduation rehearsal and graduation, and hopefully those will be relatively painless.

That aside, I‚Äôm glad to be leaving this place. I leave here with no friends, no memories (good or bad), and no real sense of ever belonging. I‚Äôm going to a great college and this summer is shaping up to be productive (license+job, finally! I think I‚Äôll even start going to the gym). Whole life ahead of me, I think I can really start fresh as my own person. I might as well have slept through these four‚Äîno, thirteen‚Äîpast years.

And yet, I‚Äôm still somehow sad. Not for the reality of what it all was. The reality was simply bleak: I had no life. I was simply not equal with my peers in a way that (socially) mattered. All interactions were as through a convex mirror, usually laced with ‚Äúcharitable‚Äù/pity-filled undertones, or an understanding that I was only a stand-in until someone they actually cared about showed up to class. But mostly I was just by myself. So I‚Äôm not sad over leaving all that behind. So what then?

Well, *what could‚Äôve been*. I‚Äôm sad on screwing myself out of actually having friends, on not getting involved in extracurricular life, on not once even once casually hanging out with people, on missing every single fun event because I didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with‚ÄîI wish it all went so different. I‚Äôm nostalgic for a past that *might have existed*. And now it never will because high school is over. There is no chance to try again‚Äîthe door has closed with a resounding thud. A complete waste of time, and how much time do I really have left? How far behind am I from everyone else? How long will it take me to become well-adjusted? Will I ever be well-adjusted? I have new opportunities now but how do I know I won‚Äôt ruin them like I did high school? Have I ever *really* learned from my mistakes?

These are the questions I have. I can‚Äôt answer them. 

I‚Äôm glad as all Hell to leave this place behind but I‚Äôm sick to my stomach with regret and anticipation.

I didn't have to go through the laborious process of meeting someone new. That is so much work, especially when there is a chance that you can get rejected. 

I really fear rejection. I get intimidated by the idea of people not liking me. I am a perfectionist. I can't stand the idea of people having negative perceptions about myself or my work.

I am a straight asian male (17yrold) whos been constantly rejected.  And reasonably so.  Been called short and ugly, reasonably so.  Standing at a whopping 5 foot 4 inches and with a below average face of course I would be rejected.  But females are not everything in life.  I have goals and ambitions.  May they be small or big, it doesnt matter.  I know I have power to accomplish them.  Looking foward and backwards is fucking up my neck.  For the average person, they can balance both.  I cannot.  Judging from my most recent mental breakdowns, which can be seen by my most recent posts on r/teenagers,  this  is  an  issue.    Deleting  Reddit  will  help  me  cut  all  ties  to  the  negativity  (blackpill,  incel,  etc.)  as  well  as  focus  on  those  goals.   Plus,  I  have  heard  that  being  single  for  life  is  not  all  that  bad.    Plus,  Ive  heard  there  are  some  real  practical  benefits  to  dieing  alone.

2804,vcvdmw,Jurez1313,"Especially without being able to make any friends. I'm talking about IRL friends here. People I can hang out and do things with. Where I can stop playing video games by myself for more hours in a week than I spend at work. I just can't make them. I'm not interesting enough, or sociable enough, or likable enough, or attractive/successful/smart/funny/kind enough. Even if someone wants to be my friend, I always manage to fuck it up and push them away in one way or another. Or convince myself I'm better off without them, or more often, they're better off without me.  

And don't get me started on romance. I can't even make friends, and people think a girlfriend will be any different? Yeah, no, there's no way in hell I can convince a woman to date me. I can't even convince *myself* that I'm worth dating. 7 years on dating apps and counting, not a single match. That should be enough to convince even the most hardcore skeptic that I am uglier than shit and no one would ever want to date me.  

I lied to my psychiatrist. I still have active SI plans. And I'm really, seriously contemplating acting on them. I don't see any other way to stop the misery that is my life from continuing. Therapy doesn't work, meds don't work, exercise doesn't work, meditation doesn't work. Can't stick to an exercise regimen, can't stick to a diet, fucking suck at sticking to anything resembling actual work. Close to getting fired from work for slacking off on reddit. Can't graduate college because I'm an idiot who can't stop playing video games for 4 years so I have time to study for tests and finish my assignments.  

I'm just not cut out for life. I don't have the basic abilities that most human adults have. The ability to adapt, to overcome obstacles, to plan out how I'm going to achieve a goal, and then execute that plan. The ability to force myself to do things I don't want to do. To continue doing something even if I suck at it, or fail at it the first 1, 10, 10000 times. I just can't do it. I just can't do anything.

2907,vd9r6y,Mysterious-Day1034,"Hey all. Just want to let it all out here on exactly what im feeling right now and what i have been feeling for years. Sorry the post is a bit stretchy so I'll cut to the chase at the NOT BACKGROUND part. i tried to make my story kind of interesting and readable i think:/

A little background: I was very outgoing and happy in primary school. My mother even used to call me Mr. Social bc I constantly organised play dates and took part in all sports at my school. I think it was mostly bc of the boredom from being an only child at home:/. Just before my freshman year at high school, we moved out of the city to a more rural town where i spent my high school years. I guess i wasnt hard enough for the kids there. It was a HUGE culture shock. I struggled to make friends there as my classmates started giving me a nickname that i didnt like and that escalated in me distancing myself from them and sometimes getting into fights. 

I eventually fell into a friend group. We were that awkward gamer group of guys. I never really fit in well with them either but at least they were a group of guys to hang out with during break time.

As years gone by, i never developed proper social skills and became more and more isolated and socially anxious. I never had experience of going to prom or any experience with girls as my highschool was a boys school. I really wanted to find love and romanticized the idea of having a family of my own one day and just having a place to call home in a sentimental sense. This really motivated me to improve and get out of that town. 

I got into a top university with many different student from over the country and even some international students so i decided to be brave and take on this new life and conquer my anxiety.

RECENT BACKGROUND: So my freshman year in university went pretty decent considering the fact that i was an idiot when it comes to anything social. I made a group of nice friends during the welcoming week and also met a girl who loved at the girls side of my dorm, whom i ate breakfast with evey morning and kind of fell on love with at the time. 

I took some L's, which in retrospect was really just the start of what wouldve been a period of learning and character development. This girl got a boyfriend and i was really sad about that so that kind of mad eit hard for me to talk to her so i think that friendship would've kind of dissappeared but that is where i learned to really appreciate my guy friends i made there. I told my friend(who is the only one i still have) about her and he comforted me and it really felt good to have some brotherly support and that kind of ""comradery"" i suppose. 

In short, i really think i got out of my comfort zone well(even though i didnt realise how well i did at the time) and often even forced myself to try and talk to random people next to me in lectures despite continuous awkwardness and failure.

Then covid came and me, my cousin and one of my friends started playing warzone non stop for an entire year as we did our studies online. This just put me back in my comfort zone for 2 years(in second year i was back on campus but everything was empty and classes were still online) and i became even more socially awkward, spending an entire year by myself at home as i didnt have any more friends in my ""hometown"". 

NOT BACKGROUND: I am 3rd year in uni now and 20 uears old and i only have one friend on this whole campus and literally cant make anymore. He started hanging out with the frat type who i didnt really get along with much. He is basically the only person i ever talk to and all he talks about is his sex life and, if im lucky, we talk about sport or video games. My mind is so numb and demoralized by this point, that i dont have the energy to talk to anyone but i literally feel socially deprived. There was also this girl i met on a friends app. We both fell in love and talked daily. We talked for more than a year and a half but we kind of just started disconnecting, probably bc we ran out if things to say bc she never wanted to video call and we only texted.

Now im here with no late night texts, my friend is away for a few weeks and im done with exams and i feel like im going nowhere in life and that im going to regret all those high school years wasted and never developing any social skills to talk to new people. I walk around on campus and sit alone between people greeting and studying with their friends and i just feel so sad that i cant have that kind of life. I just want to feel love and affection and enjoy time with others. Instead i spend my days making up chores, going to the gym and lying on my bed watching netflix for hours just to distract myself from this void.

Its just super sad to me that i used to be this friendly and sensitive outgoing kid who turned out to become this numb, socially awkward loner. Today, i had my first ever suicide thoughts. Not super serious but i fantasized just hanging on a rope as the pain dissapears from me. 

Next comes adult life and my young years will always be behind me.

P.S. If there's any college students in the same situation as me, hmu lets be friends:/",2022-06-16 01:07:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614020442,6,/r/lonely/comments/vd9r6y/covid_ruined_my_college_years_and_now_i_am_super/,,0,1,Covid ruined my college years and now i am super lonely and slowly losing myself.

I am a 17M that is currently forced to watch my little brother while my mother works to provide for us. I have no father in my life to help take care of my sibling or other family members present. I do have friends, but the problem is I cannot find the time to actually leave my house to do anything. I live a fair bit away from the nearest train station, bus stop, town, etc. And I am beginning to feel a little bit lonely and scared I will never enjoy my teenage hood and that my friends will simply shut me out. They are still respectful and nice to me, however they are very aware of my situation, and they rarely invite me to anything. This and also the fact that they are beginning to go out with other friends more often makes me think that the reality of being a forced hermit will come true. I cannot make friends online as I have no desire to play videogames nor do I want to force myself to just make friends. I just hope that one day I can enjoy my life with my friends. I can‚Äôt even leave the area I‚Äôm currently in to go meet them and there is no one in my area who I could become friends with. Please, if anyone can have any advice, send it.

i did get close to sex once, two years ago at 21, and that was the only time ive been even close to intimate, it was off an app and it happened so fast i was too anxious to go through with it... it was kinda awkward and the whole thing put me off from anything sex related for a bit but luckily she was cool and had good things to say about me (sweet, funny etc) but it didnt go anywhere from there for various reasons. however, even without much happening, just having her attracted to me and complimenting me definitely did boost my confidence a bit for the time being and made me feel like more of a ""man""... and i can only imagine how much better i'd feel if we went further and i did a good job at it. maybe some of this is due to societal pressures, but i think its also natural to feel good when u get this type of validation, whether purely sexual, or flirtatious, or deeper. and you'd think since this one girl was interested it'd happen again... but i havent had any luck on apps since then since any matches i manage to get either dont respond or disappear after a few messages, online i might seem to ""hit it off"" with a girl or get some compliments but they dont stick around, and irl i dont feel i have the opportunities or means. it could be possible ive come across girls who ""desire""/are attracted to me but i wouldnt even know, and there probably hasnt been many since im a particular type... and at the end of the day they can all probably find a better off, better looking long haired lanky depressed looking guy and im just left in the dust due to my problems. 

to get to the point, i dont think i'll have that opportunity again and it makes me feel miserable to know that. to have a taste of it, but not the real thing... to know some of these girls might be out there who would like me, want to cuddle with me, compliment me, play with my hair and do ""cute"" things with me etc etc but i feel i wont come across them, i just lucked out one time and theres a good chance i'll stay a virgin. i cant even imagine what its like to have so many people who desire you, who want YOU specifically... and i get after a while you may become numb to it and take it for granted, and if its surface level attraction its not all that meaningful but damn would i feel better in that position, like in a different world. but really i'd just need one girls approval (who i approve of too ofc) and i feel i could go from feeling like trash to human. it doesnt take a million things to change someones whole life and outlook, could just be one good person/relationship... but im afraid i wont find it. o well",2022-06-16 04:47:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605339567,3,/r/lonely/comments/vddthi/the_desire_to_be_desired_pointless_journal_entry/,,0,2,the desire to be desired (pointless journal entry #563)

2958,vdfzi0,FollowerOfApocalypse,"All my life I haven't had and still not have a social life, mostly due to overprotection of parents, bullying from middle school and changing to different high schools in the past. My 20s just came and went with college and struggling finding work; now I have all of that.

But these triumphs don't feel like victories at all, all I do is wake up, drive, go to work, sleep, rinse and repeat. It's beyond rare of me going out, I don't have friends to hang out with let alone a girlfriend. Mostly people at their late 20s have already settled and have families. Me on the other hand *I haven't lived at all*.

I have been dealing with depression, sadness and frustration knowing that my youth has been wasted, I never had fun like a normal person would, I never had a girlfriend that I loved and enjoyed being with. At family gatherings people tell me why I'm always quiet, truth is I have nothing to share about myself. If my life was a book, there wouldn't be many pages to fill about my life experiences.

Today my mother and I had a conversation about my problems stated above, one thing she mentioned that bummed me out and also annoyed me is when she asked me at what age I plan to get married, reason is because she worries that I don't have much time to go out and have fun as I'm approaching my 30s; and if I plan to have kids. I answered saying that I don't plan (if ever) to marry anytime soon, and I don't ever plan to have kids (I'm very pessimistic about the state of the world and the future, it would be brutal for future children.) My parents still have that mindset that people in their 30s should already been married and have families, if you don't have that then they think there's something deeply wrong with you.

Now I'm just asking in sadness and dread if I'm considered young or old to salvage and enjoy whatever is left of my youth, if I still have enough time to have fun like happy, carefree youngsters in their early 20s, or if I'm already condemned to a sad, lonely, depressing life of adulthood from now on.",2022-06-16 07:07:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643715479,6,/r/lonely/comments/vdfzi0/is_it_too_late_to_finally_start_enjoying_life/,,0,7,Is it too late to finally start enjoying life being at 29 years old?

Sometimes I get in the lobby with people, gift them skins in games, buy them stuff hoping they would include me in their friend group or see me as someone they can hangout, talk but never happens. I know you can't buy a friendship but, I just wanted to show gesture and be nice to them and make them happy but they rather talk with a wall.

I even asked why she messaged me in the first place and she said: ""just chatting"". BITCH, I'M TRYING TO MOVE ON HERE, YOU CAN'T MESSAGE ME AND SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. So fuck me I'm going to message her again today, I can't help it.

2998,vdlkif,Delicious_Session_84,"I (19m) recently just graduated highschool and is about to enroll to college. The only problem is that I was so focused on my academic studies and trying to get good grades that I did not make any friends. The people whom tried to befriend me I have pushed away. Idk why I do the things I do but I just do and sometimes I overreact and get angry. After some time alone I realized that I may die alone and I may never find love.

The main reason I believe so is because I live in a very Conservative catholic country. In order for me to find love I need to escape my country since I do not find anyone in my area attractive at all. In order to leave I must finished college first and I did the math and I will be 21 when I graduate college. Which is fine but I also realized that I will need to work hard and earn money to get out of here so by that time I would have already turned 30 years old. Which means I would probably be old and ugly by that time so my chance are slowly dwindling. I feel as tho it is hopeless and I may die alone.

I guess this is my fate and I wish someone would tell me that everything is gonna be fine and reassure me everything is gonna be okay but I know for a fact it won‚Äôt. No one understands me and I don‚Äôt understand anyone. I have come to accept the fact that I will be alone and I have accepted that since I cannot change it. It is how it is I guess.

3010,vdp4kb,remnantsofrage,"Tonight, it all started sinking in and I realised how lonely I feel. My partner went berserk last night and left for the hospital to be institutionalised. And I am still processing it. I am strangely calm today and went out to run errands. But tonight I teared up. I didn't bawl or cry. But I am lonely. I realised in the last few months as I struggle and witness my partner go in and out of his depressive episodes, I haven't had a proper healthy conversation or banter with him for a long while. It is always so heavy around him like he sucks the life out of you. I used to think he is a good listener or a best friend to me. But now it has all sinked in that he hasn't been that for me. I recall even a few days ago, I shared with him about my friend and while he listened, he asked me to touch his dick. I don't know if he sees me as a person anymore. I asked him last night ""What are we even right now?"" and all he did was break down. So yeah I really think this might be it.

I looked through my phone tonight and wondered who could I talk to about things. I became sad because I realised I had no one to talk to. But then a person came to my mind and I called. I said ""I am down but I don't want to talk about it. But is it okay if we talk about random things and you listen?"" Yeah, so we talked about life, work, friends, ourselves etc. Then I said ""Alright I feel better now. Thanks for taking up this call."" And that was it.

My family hates me and is relatively abusive...all my friends live far away and are busy with their happy lives...and I have no idea how to form new connections in the state I am in now. I've started antidepressants so hopefully that will help...

In my new school the first year was horrible. i didnt really like anyone in my class as they were really different from me and we had different interests. so i made friends with books at that time. i had 0 friends then. then the year after i switched sections and was determined to make new friends and ended up meeting my till now bsf. that was when i was 13. 
made another very good friend in school then we got estranged because we changed schools again and she was in a different college. my now bsf aslo changed schools ..we were estranged for 2 years. those 2 years were miserable. i could not make new friends. both my bsf and other friend were on different schools and we didnt talk much. i suffered from depression. i was really lonely. plus i have dysfunctional family so that made it hard as well. 

My bsf and I got into same college and rekindled our friendship. other than i tried to be really social during the first few months of my college years but it was draining and the friendships made then were super fake and non lasting. other than that i had a classmate in my college with whom i was close with during my college years. but after graduating we too have drifted apart and hardly speak anymore. other than that i had many childhood friends but dont really speak to them anymore because they were basically picked by my mother for me to socialise as as child. 
Until recently my Bsf and i were on really good terms even after graduating. we talked regularly and met often. so that was nice. she is kind of my only friend. but she has other friends than me. i kind of feel jealous of that...but meh good for her she can make friends. We recently had a falling out..because i bailed on her with my BF after graduation ceremony. we both had invited our bfs after graduation, she wanted to drink and we were going to have dinner with her. but she started inviting people too..whose name even i didnt know. probably because she wanted someone else to drink with. so i felt uncomfortable with that..plus my bf was also there and it would have been too awkward to be with strangers. also i just wanted some quality time with her and her bf along with mine. i would not have minded it so much if she had only invited people i knew..or mutual friends. so was upset that i left that day. after that we havent really spoken to each other that much. i am busy with my post grad and she with her own job. i get that it wad a good opportunity to make new friends that night because rn i am complaining about not having friends. but i wasnt really looking to be social and make new friends that day...in my postgrad university also i am failing to make new friends. i am familiar with everyone there but not really friends...sigh. i wish i did more friends. i feel so lonely and these days i only talk to my bf",2022-06-16 18:54:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607088488,4,/r/lonely/comments/vdt6ub/i_wish_i_had_more_friends/,,0,20,i wish i had (more) friends

3034,vdtcn2,houstons__problem," I've been alone for a long time. Even when I was little I would be the one trying to play with the other kids and no one would ever come to me.

When I was in the sixth grade, I had my parents and my brothers when I came home, but there was almost no mutual person at my school. Now my mom had to take up a job, my dad works night shifts almost the moment I get home from school and my brothers are on the other side of the country for college (I'm not blaming them, they work so incredibly hard and I love them and am so proud).

Once in class, our entire grade had to say something nice about someone else in the grade. Out of 102, no one said a thing about me.

The thing is though, when I was younger I was so used to it. I would play with my toys and my imagination had no limits to whoever I was playing with because it was just me.

I found a diary from the seventh grade and almost every day someone said something to me that made me cry.

Quarantine was a walk in the park at first. Any texts I received through spring or through summer and now fall are about copying my homework.

In the hyprid learning and even last year, there are a handful of people that I see in school and talk to but every time I try to get close to them or try to open up they have absolutely no interest.

I can't even say ""I get along with older people"" because they find me annoying.

I can't even ride public transport without feeling isolated and hollow. I haven't made a friend since 11th grade and I haven't come close to any semblance of a relation ship since 12th.

3066,vdxnbv,LordDurand,"Hi again, it's me. I used to post here a lot back when this was my only way to vent. My last post was 2 or 3 years ago. People still message me about my posts from years back, asking if I'm doing okay, or just telling me they could relate. I try to reply to people usually, and I used to be able to say that I'm doing better for the most part. There were of course times I felt depressed or anxious or lonely, but they were never as bad as they used to be.

I'm in college now. I'm majoring in English because my passion is in writing. That's been going good so far, my professors tell me they like my writing, I had one submit an essay I wrote for a scholarship award, I had another strongly urge me to publish a short creative nonfiction piece I wrote. I do work for my college's newspaper, my bosses and co-workers always tell me how much they like my articles and what a good writer I am. I've made a decent number of friends, some who slowly warmed up to me, some who decided that I seemed cool and they really wanted to talk to me and then made the effort to do exactly that. Usually, if I really want to hang out with someone, there's someone there for me. I have a good social life, I'm doing well in school and work, I should be happy and fulfilled.

But I'm not. There are always pangs of pain. All my missed opportunities and failures and regrets and rejections still haunt me. They're always there, like a ghost clinging to my back and whispering to my ear. I am in constant fear that everything will fall apart. When I'm out with friends and having fun and getting along with everyone, I do not feel like myself. I feel like I'm renting someone else's existence, that I must be putting on some kind of act unconsciously because why would anyone want to hang out with someone like me? These feelings have never, ever stopped. I doubt and worry over every single thing I do, living in fear of the moment that everyone will figure out what a boring, inept, terrible person I am. These feelings have always been there, they've never stopped. But last night was the worst night I've had in a long time. For the first time, I thought seriously of suicide again.

I don't want to get into specifics. But my heart sank late into the night, I felt a great disgust at myself. I wanted to rip my body apart. I wanted to cut off every limb, every useless piece of me. I wanted to erase myself from the world. I was 17 when I looked down from the roof of a hospital's parking tower and thought about jumping and ending it all right there. I was 19 when I held a gun in my hands and knew if I really had the guts I could turn it on myself and wipe out every regret and every disappointment. I was 20 when I returned to my childhood home after three years and thought to take my dad's handgun, go out into the backyard, stand in the daylight, and shoot myself and be swallowed by the sun and soil.

I'm 23 now. I've worked so hard. I've learned to socialize and talk to people, I've worked out and become just okay enough with my body to be able to go out in public without wanting to head back inside immediately, I've started going to therapy to try to work through years of unresolved trauma. I have things to keep me occupied. I have friends. I have a partner. And I'm still miserable, and I still feel like I don't have anyone in my life I could tell everything to without them running away and taking everyone else with them.

Everything and everyone I have in my life is exactly what the younger me thought I needed. I hate that I was wrong. I'm scared I'll never really be happy. Maybe that just isn't meant for me in this life. I often feel like too much damage was done to me early in life and that there just isn't any way for me to possibly recover from it.

Last night I laid awake in bed, hyperventilating and thrashing around and whispering ""stop, stop, stop, stop, please stop I need it to stop please stop"" to the intrusive thoughts worming their way into my brain. In that moment, I felt like nobody else could ever understand. The pain was indescribable, even if I went deep into the details of it all, even if I knew just the right words to say and how to string them together, I don't think I'd ever be able to paint the perfect picture.

I felt completely alone.

I felt like meat long past its expiration date.

I should have died when I was 17, before I knew what Hell really looked like.

Because this is Hell. To always want more, to not be satisfied despite your best efforts, to watch some things slip away from you and worry that everything else will follow with it. Hell is having a taste of happiness so brief you think it might've been just a dream. Hell is having the smallest shred of hope, just enough to keep you from having the courage to cut your losses and cut your throat.

Hell is feeling like shit and not even having that good of a reason anymore.

Last night, at around half past 6, when the birds outside began to sing, I finally fell asleep. My last thought before my eyes shut was about how I felt like I was suffocating, and how I wished I wouldn't wake up.

Four hours later, I opened my eyes and laid there for awhile, my throat sore and dry. Light peeked through my blinds and I could see my hands and I felt disgusted at my body.

Then, I got up, and had to keep on living.",2022-06-16 22:22:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1387911021,3,/r/lonely/comments/vdxnbv/i_felt_it_again_for_the_first_time_in_years/,,0,1,I felt it again for the first time in years

3068,vdxtpf,pini4urthots,"Recently I noticed there are many toxic patterns in my life or maybe this is normal and my mental health has declined to where I think no one cares at all. 
I realized that all of my friendships do not have mutual support, a majority of them are people trauma dumping. Outside of that, no one is interested in me.  And the people that are, only keep me around as a friend until they find a romantic partner. Then the worst, where people I interact with in person, actually won't talk to me outside of getting views on social media. They don't want my friendship, they need me as a fan. 
I've tried to reach out to people, tried to make friends, but they're not interested or too busy to reply.
I don't know why it's like a knife to the chest when I'm left on read or people watch my story and don't reply to my messages. I know that no one owes me a response, I know that everyone goes through times where they don't feel like talking to anyone and I know that it shouldn't matter to me. I feel like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs for attention and no one even bothers to acknowledge that there is any noise. I only bothered to be online because that's where everyone was, and that's now how people seem to stay in touch. Now, it's just me trying to revive friendships that have been long dead.
In person, the only communities in town are church. That isn't my scene and I can't be myself in those spaces. I just feel really alone.

Rant vent and settlement
Ive been single for half a decade now. Idk where tf i went wrong in my life. Either way, im lovely, im jealous of all the guys pulling cute girls, meanwhile i sit at home alone. I just want somebody to love me, someone that needs me and i need them and love them. I miss getting hugs, cuddling, kissing, heck even holding hands. One evening i dm a girl, we change to talk on insta. Her acc is 100% legit so i send a selfie of me as she wanted. She calls me cute and that makes my day. Shes quite good looking to. Some more pretty dry chatting and she gets more flirty, saying shed want to cuddle and shit. At this point i got it: the feeling of bein wanted and appreciated. A feeling i havent had in 5 years (and as iz seems now, not again very quickly). My day is absolutely made. I stay up extra late as you wanted to to talk. I go to bed feeling great after some hard days. First thing i do in thr morning is text u. However you don't reply till later, totally fine. Our convo is dry, i have to carry it. None of the appreciation and wantedness visible. Only later at eveninc it all picks up again, im feelin good. After her doing all the bold moves, i tried my own, start subtle... i say ""pls never ghost me, youre awesome"" to wich she asked: ""do you like me"" ofc i say yes, how could i not after she said all this? I ask her if she liked me and she said ""i dont know you that well"" followed by ""i just like flirting"". I apologize for being creepy (note i wasnt, it just felt odd to flirt w someone who doesn feel anything). That very moment i crash down from my all time high in months, like a stalled plane... 

  
I just went back to some smalltalk and went to bed...

I cried, none of this was real, the feeling just a small taste of what could be, not even that was real, it throws me back into the miserable feeling of loveliness and not being wanted. Why does she play my feelings like that ? why me?
This morning i decide to tell you how it made me feel, and youre online (i can see you ignore me) but you don't respond to my ""morning"", like you did before with other messages... youre testing my patience and im abt to snap, but i dont wanna be rude.
I just want to be loved TRULY AND LEGITIMATELY, not played...

If you read to all of this,  thanks, youre a hero. 18m btw. To give this whole thing some perspective. If you have any advice please lmk.

3108,ve3hwu,shinypichuu,"i'm 25 and barely have any friends. i'm always the last choice for people so this year i just gave up and stopped chasing after people. very quickly i lost contact with my closest friends because they didn't care ans now we're strangers and don't talk.

even for dating i'm never a choice. people online tell me so many nice things like i'm pretty, and they would be my friend/want to date me if they knew me irl etc but how can i believe that? why are people online so nice to me when i've been invisible all my life irl.

i made a really close friend this fall/winter i was so happy about it and the second they went away to work a summer job they stopped talking to me and i was crushed. when ppl have no one else they use me but they always meet more fun interesting people. i can't blame them but it just hurts i just want people to care about and ppl to care for me. i want a friend group i can do fun things with like i used to i miss it so bad. at my age how the heck am i supposed to make friends it's so hard.

i always end up alone and always will. i'm sorry to anyone who relates i wish we could all be friends, we all deserve good friends :/",2022-06-17 03:27:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639023291,10,/r/lonely/comments/ve3hwu/always_the_last_choice_and_will_always_end_up/,,1,8,always the last choice and will always end up alone
3109,ve3j1s,Anoun12345,"To help summarize my predicament, I'll just start by saying when I was younger(around 15) I lost my mother, and it's been about ten years since then. But right after my mother dying I ended up in a toxic relationship, (mostly my fault) that lasted for about a year. Ever since then I have been afraid of relationships, and honestly think I don't deserve them.

I don't believe I'm asexual/aromantic. I still crave, and get romantic feelings, but I always have this trigger where I shut it down immediately. I most certainly don't think I'm emotionally or financially able to support a relationship, but I also feel all my years going by. I know that I was a toxic asshole when I was a teenager, but I'm afraid that's haven't addressed what caused that in me, but I also want to move on from it. As for my own personal happiness I think I can get it right for the most part, it's just the loneliness mixed with the guilt of just not feeling good enough, it creeps up and I can't stop it.

But I don't even know if getting into a relationship is good for me, or if I'm doing mental gymnastics to self sabotage my love life. Plus to also state, I don't want this to be anyone else's problem. And I also believe that I am just not ready at all for it, I guess I more so hope that I'm not alone in this?

I don't hate people or anything like that, I just get bad anxiety when it comes to having a relationship. 


Tl:Dr relationship anxiety, do you know of any steps to help me conquer my fear of dating?",2022-06-17 03:29:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653569552,2,/r/lonely/comments/ve3j1s/i_dont_know_how_to_change/,,0,1,I don't know how to change.

3112,ve3ng4,UseAVPNm8,"I'm 28 and I recently stopped playing video games as a pastime for the last month which involves not talking to that friend circle anymore. While I'm proud of myself for not playing anymore and I won't go into reasons why I quit as that's a whole another topic, the journey itself to finding ambitious friends is actually difficult. Just not having anyone to spend time with to do activities with has been excruciatingly painful and almost had several relapses because of that. I also want to be clear, I don't look down upon people playing games and it's perfectly healthy to engage in any pastime (video games, sports, tv, etc.) in moderation with friends or by yourself.

What I'm trying to say is, how I can go about finding someone that wants to do things with their life? You know, as I'm writing this post it feels so awkward as even I don't know what exactly I'm looking for. It all seems super vague to me. Maybe I'm just confused.

I've done things to help me feel less lonely by moving way closer to family, going on random meetup hikes, and I start going to university again in a couple of months so I'm sure if I just wait another 2 more months I'll find likeminded people there. Just the loneliness I feel now feels so painful and I try my best to cope by having healthy habits by exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, etc. but anything I do won't get rid of this painful feeling. On the meetup hikes, I've met a lot of super interesting people, but maybe due to my closed-mindedness, I didn't think they would be good long-term friends. I'm just extra careful now about the friends I choose because getting dragged down by someone is a different kind of pain.

I write this vague post to see if there is anyone who relates. I have no problem meeting new people. I don't have any anxiety. I just find that making the right type of friends is where I'm at in life now. Maybe I'm wrong in my way of thinking and I'm open to any kind of criticism. This post is kind of more to vent about the pain that I'm feeling right now, but if there is anyone out there that wants to talk, I would greatly appreciate it.",2022-06-17 03:35:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1528242651,3,/r/lonely/comments/ve3ng4/where_can_i_meet_motivated_people/,,0,5,Where can I meet motivated people?

Matched with a girl on tinder a little bit ago. Ended up talking to myself because she ether not reply or just send a plain picture of herself. Felt like talking to a brick wall and inwad the only one putting any effort in even to just be friends.

Then! Matched with a girl recently and ended up talking on snap, where not even 5 minutes in to talking to her she asked me what my hands looked like and went "" nope. Don't like your hands, sorry won't work out"".
I'm sorry what!!! You have a child and are a stay at home mum and I was willing to try being a farther figure to someone else's kid, but since you don't like the way my hands look it looks like i don't  even need to bother now.

3149,ve8vgt,PCB-Bits01,"Hi Reddit, 

I came across this thread and just wanted to share my story with people. This is not a vent but more of thing's came to be in my life leading up to the present time. 

Ever since as a Kid I always kept to myself but I always got along with people especially if it's 1 on 1 as it allows me to develop deep meaning conversation opposed to being in a group of peers. Just remember this quote, ***\*No one is born racist or a bully, this is taught and environmental factors come into play\*.*** 

During my younger year's I went to a primary school which was Catholic, majority of the student's family were middle class and was raised affluently which allows their Children to some what behave in a normalised way, with religion being factored in as well people were taught to treat others how you want to be treated. Being ignorant to the world when your younger is blissful. 

After primary school I went to a different high school apart from my peers from primary school. The high school I went to was one of the worst school's in my home town. Majority of the Kids there were from families who are drug dealers, red-neck, racist, unemployed, family domestic violence, single parents and plenty of prejudice. Me being the different one was severally bullied due to the colour of my skin and race. Who the fuck bullies another person because of their skin colour ? During those 7+ year's it was extreme hell. 

The people I know from high school have been in jail, drug addictions, been to court, unemployed and sold drugs, used drugs, single parent and don't really have high ambitions. 

I had a few close people in my life that I could see their life was struggling and needed support. I fed those who were down, I became their friend, I took them into my home, I treat them life a brother and family. I always shouted them meals by going out. I was alway's there for people any time of the day and was their cushion. When they got back on their feet they no longer needed me and try to find other people who were better than me, who the fuck does that ? 

I have found out over time, loneliness is a feeling. Being a lone is a state. 

I have tried to figure if it's me, but with my conclusion it's having shitty people in my life but simply I was raised in the wrong geographic location and met the wrong people in my life. I don't know if I can trust anyone in my life at the moment due to my past experiences... 

I gave my all to people but in return I received a bag of shit.",2022-06-17 09:09:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653983442,5,/r/lonely/comments/ve8vgt/loneliness_might_not_be_your_fault_but_more/,,0,2,"Loneliness might not be your fault, but more geographical and external factors."

If i tell them i feel alone everyone will jump and say no man.. u have me and all... but they just disappear again within a few hours...

3159,veatxb,Sugarbabyoda,"(28 F) I am truly scared I will be alone forever. Every single guy I‚Äôve ever gone on a date with or had interest in, whether it be via dating apps, school, at a bar, etc. leaves me and actually ends up finding love. I‚Äôve lived in multiple countries and states and experienced this everywhere. I have found that getting the ‚Äúsorry, not interested‚Äù text is inevitable and I really don‚Äôt think anyone will love me. I am frantically/constantly on dating apps hoping to just find someone who sticks. No matter how rich or poor, ugly or attractive they are, they leave me. It is painful knowing they find someone better and that they consider their life better lived without me in it. 

I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm beautiful all the time, I‚Äôve had celebrities (athletes, politicians, reality stars) watch my stories or dm me, but for whatever reason I can‚Äôt find an ordinary guy willing to settle down. I walk past lots of guys and see them stare at me, I think if I did sports leagues I might have some luck and meet a good guy. 

My family says I should delete apps and focus on myself for a year. I don‚Äôt see the point. I want a partner and I‚Äôll keep looking until I find one.

i don't know.

i was fine until i wasn't.

but seeing a friend being happy with something that i don't have just ignited something within me.

jealousy? 

maybe, i don't know. 

i don't have anything against them. 

but i just think, wow. 

it must be nice to be happy like that. 

i wish i had a hand to hold too. 

a person who looks my way. 

no i don't know how that feels like. 

maybe it's wrong for me to feel this way. 

but i just hate seeing someone live the life i've never gotten a chance to live. 

to be loved like that. 

when is it my turn? 

when can i finally feel that? 

i can hardly stand looking at their photo. 

the love that i don't have.

it makes me desperate. 

almost even lonelier than i'd already been. 

don't i deserve it? 

happiness? 

love? 

why haven't i gotten it yet? 

why is it that i, who always does so well for others, has not received such yet? 

am i not deserving of it? 

must i beg for it? 

my heart just wants to be wanted. 

i do so much for others. 

but why does everyone want everything from me except for me? 

what about me? 

why not me? 

what more must i do? 

i want that love too. 

i want to sleep at night knowing that someone thinks of me even when i'm not around. 

that someone waits for me to respond. 

that someone reaches out to me without needing any reason to, but merely for the sake of it. 

when? 

when can i be happy? 

i just want someone who wants me. 

not my body, not what i can offer, but me. 

just me. 

i want to be able to listen to a song i love and think of someone. 

when's someone going to try hard for me? 

i do everything i do with sincerity, not because i want anything, but because when i love, i love wholeheartedly. 

but why? 

why don't i get any of that? 

why am i recieving the short end of the stick? 

just, why? why why why?

i know i'll wake up again tomorrow and move on like this never bothered me. 

but it never goes away. 

it's just that i hardly have any solution to my problem that i can only leave it as it is. 

i hate it. 

all i've ever wanted was to be loved.

why does everyone else around me get that and more except for me?",2022-06-17 12:47:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654953235,27,/r/lonely/comments/vecejd/just_want_to_be_wanted/,,0,9,just want to be wanted.

 I know it's useful for a lot of people, but come on!

I just talked about anxiety attacks with a psychologist, and she's already talking about medication to calm me down when that happen, but I don't care about the anxiety attack, I don't want to stop having them just to ignore my problems, I've been ignoring them for more than a decade, so it's enough!

Since we broke up she had a lot of experiences and now she has a boyfriend (way hotter than me, just to point that out). Unfortunately I'm still very much into her and my feelings cross the line of obsession, but I digress...

When I was little watching fireworks was a yearly occasion for me and my friends, we used to watch them on the hillside to celebrate the end of summer and all of our perents were there. It was fascinating to watch those colours blowing in the night sky followed by a bang or a hiss. Everyone used to cheer, it was a special moment.

Yesterday was very similar in setting: a lot of people cheering, chanting, taking pictures, even the girl I used to date was having a wonderful time.

And I was there, looking upwards into those blinding lights and feeling no emotion, just numbness and boredom.
Have you ever being in class for 5 hours straight listening to the most tedious lecture of your life and thinking that the only thing you wanna do is to go home? That's the only thing I could think of yesterday.

3169,ved16h,_Ziggy_Zaggy_,"the last time I had a friend was a year/two years ago and she ended up being not great but at the time I was the happiest I'd been in a long time just because I wasn't alone anymore after so many years but now I have no friends again.


My social skills are horrendous which is a huge reason for this. I absolutely can not cope with speaking to people in groups and most people in social situations are already in groups so it's hard. I don't know how to speak like a normal person, my parents have tried to teach me a couple of social skills but I don't understand how to use them in any situations that I encounter. I can't even answer someone without making a long drawn out ""uhhhhhhh"" sound before every single sentence and it's humiliating. Some of these issues are probably due to autism and some due to social anxiety but I really don't know how fix them. I know the best advice is to just try and talk to people anyway but I feel like I can't. Anytime I have had a discussion with people, it just leaves me feeling worse because like I said I can't have a ""normal"" conversation and it makes me feel so incompetent and its so obvious that people feel awkward talking to me so i feel bad for putting them through that. I've mostly given up on talking to people in school now and I only go in for exams anymore and am on a reduced timetable where I leave right after the exam. They're all so loud and bold and I'm just nothing like that and I can't cope with it.


I tried therapy once but it did nothing. It was only like a 6 session free thing so I don't know if it just wasn't the right type of therapy or what but it was useless. The therapist asked me why I'm anxious to socialise and why I struggle but she didn't really help at all, she sent me links for help with covid anxiety when i hadnt mentioned that once and most advice in it was not applicable to anything other than health anxiety and in fact the sessions actually made me more anxious because I had to talk to her over the phone where my whole family was downstairs and they always ask what I talked about after. So therapy didnt work but I don't know how I'm gonna fix it on my own either because I've been this way my whole life and in the past year or so it's gotten way worse.



I'm worried I'm never going to find friends or a relationship because of my incompetence and it makes me very depressed sometimes. I try to distract myself but it's been nearly unbearable the past few days. I have even been considering joining more online communities and trying to make friends there but any time I've tried that in the past, it didn't work so I'm still not too sure if I wanna attempt that again but I probably will at some point in the near future.




It also depresses me a lot when I hear everyone my age talk about their relationships and I know that I've basically made that impossible for myself. I always tell the family in my life that ask that I have no interest in relationships cause I feel ashamed of wanting that since I feel I have no right to even think about it when I am the way that I am. But I do think about it a lot and it upsets me. I try to not focus on it but sometimes I go through phases where I just can't not focus on it. 



This has happened before and I know I'll be ok soon but I'm just tired of the cycle of feeling ok and then being completely focused on the loneliness all the time for weeks or months at a time tbh lol

What am I doing wrong?

No matter how much I try to connect with my peers, I just can't, and when I do, I can never get past the point of just being an acquaintance or the second option.

3196,vehzr6,IAmtheChosen865,"Im at a cliff and going to jump. I'm 19 years old, and I've let my life fall apart. I moved from being an excellent student with good grades who was confident in my abilities to feeling uneasy and apprehensive. had so much potential, but I let self-doubt sabotage everything and still continue to do. Now I think about people my age get accepted to their dream schools and pursue their dreams while I can't even see my own future. I feel envy thinking of people my age who are socialising, making friends, and pursuing their dreams in school. I've destroyed myself and will continue to trash my life. I'm still lost on what I want to do with my life. I felt like I was making significant progress in my life to improve it, but now I'm back on this sub, having problems with myself family, and it's all sliding downhill again. I'm not sure what I should do to be happy, and even though I have things, I still feel like something is lacking. I don't have much to keep me going, except from false dreams and fantasies of my life getting better, and I honestly believe that death is a better place than living as myself.
While everyone at my age has decided out what they want to do with their lives, I'm restricted to my room, playing video games, watching TV/movies, and reading books. I'm worried that as I get older, I won't be able to keep up. Because of my insecurity, I squandered so much potential. Now, I believe that others my age are admitted into the schools of their dreams and realise their ambitions, but I am not one of them. I am unable to imagine my fate. just be a fool. Because it's the only thing I know how to do, I destroyed myself and I will continue to destroy my life. I‚Äôm crippled with this self hatred for myself the way I look talk everything what causes me to have anxiety at everything I do to make it better by trying to make friends and maybe meet someone but I end up failing or just not doing it. But I don't see myself changing, I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing that has become crippling, along with my anxiety, to the point that I can't even leave the house to do the things I have planned. maybe it will get better, maybe not if I does I‚Äôll like to look back at these posts and see far I‚Äôve come, but i keep thinking of killing my self rather than living in a life I constantly hate and my self.",2022-06-17 15:43:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654809117,5,/r/lonely/comments/vehzr6/im_19_and_im_going_to_kill_my_self_now_im_at_a/,,0,7,Im 19 and I‚Äôm going to kill my self now I‚Äôm at a cliff

i've struggled with feeling worthy alot recently. got rejected by pretty much the only person being my real friend for 3 years. ever since then she's been keeping her distance, probably also cause i'm just sad 24/7. my other friends don't seem to care in any way, i literally cried in class multiple times and guess how many ppl came to me to see what was wrong ? only my crush. 

so, what to do with my friends ? i honestly kind of despise them for not caring enough, i even told them i was feeling kind of worthless when around them, and they blamed me... now idek if i'm the asshole here for holding them accountable for how i feel or if they really are toxic towards me. i've been numb in school for months, i can't talk normally to anybody while the rest of the class just seems to continue on like nothing

so, now back to my crush. yes, it's very unhealthy that i'm clinging so much towards her, but really what else am i supposed to do ? i tried to speak to her too and tell her that i feel kinda worthless around her, and she was actually the only one changing some things around me, but it just wasn't enough... and after speaking to her about it again and again she slowly but surely is distancing away from me aswell.

as it stands now i pretty much talk to noone in class, i don't do any outdoor activities anymore and i also stopped any good habits i was building up (i just feel way to exhausted for that)

Am looking for a lady that we can get to know each other better before meeting. I don't discriminate in terms of age,race or distance because I believe my rib is somewhere within planet Earth üòÖ!

I prefer a simple Christian lady, straight, family oriented, would like to have kids, not a racist and has a respect for marriage! Also in case we fall in love you don't have a problem of relocating or regular traveling.

I want a lady whom we will grow and develop together in everything.

Briefly tell me little about yourself, location, likes and dislikes! 

(KINDLY: If you will text me then disappear don't. I want the conversation to flow and see where it leads. Incase I wouldn't text back instantly just hold on I haven't ignored; just busy somewhereüòä). Simply don't ghost me!

You've read up to here? Thank you for your time! If anything has attracted you then be free to chat with me! Kindly reply with more than 'hi'.

3238,veqf7u,kindalastresort,"I'm mostly wondering if anyone else has felt like this and come out the other side with a different outcome than I can foresee.   


This post will be complete garbled, but I just feel I have to say something, anything, into the ether to have some kind of connection to this world I guess.  
I've lived on my own for about 5 years, since University. Uni had problems of its own, I wish I could redo it sometimes. I've tried so many things, but I've been alone since. I miss having other humans  I cared about and lived with. If I was stressed or sad, I could knock on someones door, smoke a little weed and watch a silly documentary about trains. People were only a message away and they really, truly cared. I still have friendships with some of these people. Their lives have changed since uni, and they don't have the time to be available for random meetups and our messages are more like long email exchanges rather than instant messaging if that makes sense.  


Basically, I'm struggling to see the point of all this. I've got a good job. About to start a part-time masters at Oxford. I have savings and stability. A cat (the only thing to make it alright sometimes) But it just doesn't matter if I get up at 6, interact with colleagues (we get on, but things never seem to get past acquaintance at work) get home at 6, sit alone with my cat, maybe try a hobby that isn't that fruitful and go back to sleep. It really feels that my best years are behind me. I'm really trying to fix it. I'm trying so hard to meet new people but I just don't feel I'll ever really have a close group of friends again or experience the exciting, intense emotions again of having a place in a g group of people. I don't remember the last time I went on a night out, got drunk and danced. I love dancing.  


I think if this is what life is like, I don't really want to be here in 5 years time. The thought of 5 more years of this is so awful. I jsut seem no solution.

3258,vete6d,ThatMathBoi,"Getting a gf in high school is completely off the table. I go to an all boys school that barely does anything with their sister school, and I'm generally not really outgoing in the first place. Additionally, I am busy with lots of clubs, extracurriculars, and homework so I wouldn't even have time for a gf.

In college I doubt that I would have the time for a gf, because, as of now, my plans for college are to double major, participate in marching band, and to work. And all those things combined would barely leave me with any time for myself, let alone a gf. 

After college I feel like I won't be able to successfully date. I won't have had any experience in dating from high school or from college. And since I'm pretty introverted and not very outgoing I wouldn't really be hitting up clubs and such once I get out of college. On top of that I don't really have any hobbies. As of now the only three hobbies I have are math, xylophone, and gaming (I've been losing enjoyment for gaming a lot recently though). And it's not like I can pick up a girl by telling her math facts. I've tried experimenting with different hobbies: drawing, writing, coding but I've hated all of them. I'm still sticking with learning to code because I will need it for a career in the future but I derive no pleasure from it at all.

3279,vew2to,burner191919191,"Does anyone else have these?

I (26M) thought I was done with them. I hang out with friends, I exercise, I treat my body how it deserves to be treated and I love taking time out to draw/hike/camp alone. I've been trying to build a better relationship with myself for years now, and I thought I was succeeding.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to get those stupid stabs of loneliness and jealousy again, particularly when I see my friends in healthy partnerships that have lasted years now. It seems that so many people my age have someone in their life they can rely on and be a rock for in turn.

I find myself cursing the boy I used to be. I wish I could reclaim lost years and drag my past self out of the malaise of envy, insecurity and self hatred that held me back from achieving the same kind of love I now see in my mates. The irony is that those emotions that restrained me are surfacing once again.

I know that envy is a truly useless and self destructive emotion, and that it's impossible to retread the path you've already walked. I am also aware that people can smell desperation, and often the desire to not be alone is the source of many a bad relationship. However, at the end of the day, I'm not getting younger, my head isn't getting any less bald, and my peers are pulling far ahead of me in this aspect of life, just like they always have.

I have a Hinge profile that accurately represents and sells me, and I'm trying to be as active on that as possible, to no avail. There's a girl in my group of friends who I fancy, but I'm fairly certain she doesn't feel the same way. These circumstances, alongside others, feel scarily familiar. I'm terrified that life is conspiring to crush me with that old friend loneliness and undo all the hard work I've been putting into myself

Does anyone have a remedy for this? I don't want to feel like this again. I want to be comfortable in myself, and finally accept that I'm probably not going to achieve my dreams of one day having a family and kids. I want to be feel happiness for the lives my friends/siblings/cousins are all building with their partners. If anyone has been in a similar situation and has managed to claw their way out, please let me know.

I once thought these feelings were all behind me. Now I'm scared that this is a battle I will fight for the rest of my life.

We had a practice speech to do, I fumbled because I literally couldn't speak somehow and felt embarrassed the entire week. Fast forward to the next session and she wanted to talk to me about it after class ended. We exchanged phone numbers and she slowly made me feel more comfortable in that class. We spoke to each other every now and then, called each other, facetimed, and found out that we had a lot more in common than we thought. She was in general a very nice person to talk to. although we never really got the chance to hangout, so we figured discussed doing that after our exams were over.

A little bit after exams were over, she called me, and we talked for a bit and since then, it's been a month since I've been able to contact her.

so if i dress cooler, improve at X Y and Z, and become closer to the image of myself i have in my head, the person i want to be, who am i doing it all for? myself? if im not going out much to hang out with people then it feels pointless... so then i grovel in my misery instead of taking any of those steps and end up feeling worse, its like a cycle. but if i tried taking those steps, it'd probably feel like im forcing an identity and i dont think they'd exactly change my core problems or help with my loneliness either. and tbh i dont even know the exact things i'd do/change since i dont feel i fit into any mold, which is part of why i feel im so disconnected from others. even ""alternative"" people have their own mold, im just on the outskirts not knowing what to do with myself. i dont want to be forced into some box, im just me and probably not cool or attractive enough to pull off most looks anyway. i guess thats another topic, feeling like i dont fit into any group

 Recently, I found myself being all alone with no people around me to talk to. All my friends are either busy, have others to talk to instead of me or are asleep because the play Dota 2 till 5 A.M. Yet, when people have time to have a chat or go hang out, I am never the first option (I think this way) of who they would call. I am an NPC who is behind the scenes, sometimes messaging people to, if we are making an analogies, give a side-quest of having to deal with/entertain/help me. I wouldn't say that I am a person that would need to be babysitted, it is mainly I that is trying to make up a conversation, come up with jokes, I am not the best, but I try.

 With that, I can call myself an individual, but it doesn't seem that way. My interests are rarely mentioned, my skills are forgotten when the time doesn't ask for them, so myself is left over for a good time use of when someone is bored or has nothing to do. I just feel insignificant, lonely and depressed for a long time... :/",2022-06-18 12:34:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649158440,3,/r/lonely/comments/vf5bcp/i_am_tired_of_being_a_background_character/,,0,8,I am tired of being a background character.

3377,vfbqf4,Specialist_Ad_6278,"I‚Äôm a 23F and I‚Äôve never had a bf/gf. 

I used to be fine with it up until about a year ago when it really started to bother me much more frequently. 

I‚Äôm not trying to make myself out to be a saint or anything, but I have so much love and care to give that‚Äôs just sitting in my chest. But I‚Äôm constantly rejected or overlooked causing me actual physical aches and I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs leaving a void behind my eyes as well. 

Not to mention my own friends don‚Äôt even wanna tell me things sometimes because apparently I care too much and they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna disappoint me‚Äù. I try to tone it down, but then I‚Äôm seen as stand-off ish or non-caring. So even in friendships I‚Äôm still left with aches and voids. 

I‚Äôve tried to get to know people as potential partners, but even though I desperately want a relationship, I still have standards and most people I‚Äôve met don‚Äôt meet them! Those that have met them are way out of my league and/or are usually taken. 

The only times I‚Äôve been pursued have been for sex which just makes me feel even worse about myself. 

I‚Äôve been talking to a guy since November last year who is nice and caring and we‚Äôre very sexually compatible and have a lot in common, but from the get-go he made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship and I respect his boundaries on that so we are just fwb.

At some point while talking to him though, I did develop feelings. I never told him and I never will because he‚Äôs the closest thing I have to any kind of relationship atm. I still kind of have feelings, but they‚Äôve died down significantly as I‚Äôm constantly reminded that nothing will ever come of our ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù (that‚Äôs what I call it now to detach myself). 
He is the only person out of all of the people I‚Äôve met and talked to that I would want to pursue, but again, he is not an option. 

So, again, I‚Äôm still left with nothing and no one. Only aches and voids. 

I hate that it‚Äôs gone this far, but I‚Äôm even jealous of my roommate and their relationship. Seeing them happy would normally make me happy. Instead I just silently seethe with a fat lump in my throat. 

I can‚Äôt talk to people about it because everyone else around me has been in relationships and couldn‚Äôt possibly understand how isolating and alienating it feels to have never loved or been loved EVER.

And please don‚Äôt tell me that I‚Äôm not missing out on much or that my time will come or that relationships won‚Äôt solve my problems. I know what I want and I want to reap the benefits of a healthy relationship and I want to mutually prioritize, deeply love, and genuinely care for someone intimately.

At this point in my life, it just doesn‚Äôt even feel possible for me anymore. 

I find myself wondering what I did so wrong or what I could have done differently. I consider settling for people who don‚Äôt meet my standards, but then I‚Äôd just end up miserable and feeling like an idiot, wasting my time. 

I don‚Äôt really want advice, I just want consolation and validation.

3383,vfcbvy,evilmonkey1973,"M UK, Just had a message from my friend of 14 years (occasional FWB, but since her marriage just friends) who has been going through depression that she no longer wants me in her life.
We were always each other's most honest friend, confidant, constructive critic, shoulder and safety net.
I'm in a dead bedroom marriage and while at the beginning it was all about the sex that soon fizzled out into a deep friendship. We've both been through the wringer over the last year and taken some heavy hits, career and emotionally...but we've always relied on each other.
Of course I'm absolutely going to respect her wishes and it would be crude and incredibly insensitive of me to try to dissuade her. I just miss my friend.
She said she'll always care about me, that she only wishes good things for me but our friendship has come to an end, that she wanted to cut her current ties and move on.

My heart is a bit broken.",2022-06-18 18:34:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600724490,3,/r/lonely/comments/vfcbvy/feeling_very_sad/,,0,0,feeling very sad

I'm very burnt out &amp; very lonely. and I feel weird posting here, I know I don't have it as hard as most people, especially who also have my disability. I know that other people are trapped in wheelchairs. I know I 'present' very well. But having cerebral palsy in itself is very isolating. and being a caregiver to my elderly father. and being autistic. and selectively mute. I've been dealt a bad hand.

I can't abandon my father in a nursing home the way he abandoned me. as a child. I had a terrible childhood, between him and my ""mother"" I'm ttrying my hardest to grasp at small moments of happiness, I have a best friend, but he's halfway around the world. I have a few people to help, but I feel so burnt out, withdrawn &amp; isolated.

I try to take it one day at a time, i try to make the best of things but everytime i turn around i get the short stick. I wouldn't change myself, no, but....it feels like it never ends. I grew up with neglect, narcissists and childhood sexual abuse. My first fiance disappeared. My second left me for a trans girl. everyone in my family is neurotypical, narcissist, dead or drug addicts and I don't feel anyone understands. I'm fatigued every day. I can't work, I'm scared about money in future. I miss loving someone &amp; being loved. I'm having autistic burnout &amp; idk what to do with myself. I can't even go pee without being bothered by my father.

I have a friend who helps me clean, but I don't feel comfortable talking with her. I was mute from age 7 to 17, but also she has a tendency to say things like ""you're where you're supposed to/meant to be"" ""maybe this is your purpose in life, to care for your father""and this just makes me incredibly angry. I'm 29. and with everything that's happened, I \*still\* haven't got to live my life.

I don't want much. Just some tea, a partner, some cats, a part time job, a home and maybe a lake house someday.

saying this is where I belong....i hate it.I grew up caring for my mom and now my dad, my life is on loop. He's just as unkind as my mother. and no one cares.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't expect strangers to care either.",2022-06-18 18:51:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1510885038,8,/r/lonely/comments/vfcnzm/really_in_a_low_spot_lonely_need_to_vent/,,0,6,"really in a low spot, lonely &amp; need to vent"

Almost 2 months ago my now ex broke up with me, completely out of the blue. He said it was because I‚Äôm not affectionate enough and he‚Äôd fallen out of love with me. We of course argued at length because since living together for a very short two months, it seemed as if every time I went near him, his dog would cry about it and I became jealous, therefore he‚Äôd run to the dog basically leaving me hanging. We now have nothing to do with each other and have only spoken recently to sort out a bill, it was a 5 minute conversation and that‚Äôs it. I know we aren‚Äôt meant for each other and that being apart is the best thing however I can‚Äôt help but miss him still. I still dream about him and writing this now I‚Äôm tearing up, I feel like I‚Äôm never going to fall in love again and my fucking god I have never felt so unloved and worthless these last couple months. I keep thinking that general hook ups and one night stands might help and ease that loneliness but I bail out so I haven‚Äôt been with anyone since him. I think about other people and I‚Äôve tried, but they either aren‚Äôt interested or again, I just panic. 
My next point, my best friend is getting married in 5 months, so things are obviously beginning to get serious with final planning things, and obviously my ex was meant to be going with me. I am DREADING this wedding right now. I‚Äôm beyond happy for her and her fianc√© has become a friend to me, and over this break up they have both been so so so supportive of me I can‚Äôt thank them enough, but this wedding talk is just reminding me that the man I thought i was going marry decided he didn‚Äôt love me anymore and that I‚Äôm going to be alone at this wedding.
I just had to get things off my chest.

3422,vfhudd,wastingyourtime95,"I recently lost every possible social outlet imaginable (dog, friends, family, therapist x4 years, psychiatrist x3 years). They all either blocked me or quit. I completely isolated myself in my room (for the past 2-3 weeks) and the only human interaction I've had has been texting my ex, calling my father, and suicide/warm-lines, which I do on a daily basis. 

I haven't watched TV, been on social media, left the house, left my room for longer than 2-3 minutes to get food, listened to music, played games, or done anything for the past 2-3 weeks. I spend the majority of my day sleeping and talking to the aforementioned people in between. 

My dad has started limiting our conversations to 10 minutes at a time, with a timer and everything. I don't blame him and understand my situation is overwhelming and frustrating. Additionally, our conversations usually make me angry anyway. Including the most recent one....prompting this post. 

He told me ""You're addicted to talking. No one wants to hear it. Go get a job.""

I am frustrated because I felt like I was making progress during our most recent conversation. He thinks it's all fodder and that I need to do something more productive like updating my resume. I have had 0 motivation to do anything the past few weeks let alone apply for jobs. I couldn't care less about working or living for that matter. Now on top of that, I have to feel ashamed about talking or venting my frustrations to anyone (him, ex, and/or hotline). 

Even writing this post I feel ashamed because I'm confirming my ""Addiction to Talking."" I don't know how the hell to process everything I'm going through (which is ALOT and way too much for any one person to listen to). I don't know how to get myself out of this trench. So what good is it for me to think about it all day, and not voice it to someone who could help?

Can add talkaholic to my list of diagnoses. Should just nip this addiction in the bud and just never talk to anyone ever again ü§ê",2022-06-18 23:14:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655420072,3,/r/lonely/comments/vfhudd/isolated_talkaholic/,,0,1,Isolated Talkaholic

3473,vfnusx,affectionateboi222,"It's so incredibly hard to even talk with women as a man these days and then for the littlest, smallest reason in the world they ghost you or aren't interested anymore. They had to make a term for it it's become so common called the ""ick"" literally they just for any dumb reason like chewing weird all of a sudden lose all attraction and feeling towards you. 

As a man you're constantly told you're not good enough and if you want anything in life you're going to have to work your ass off not only to get it but the whole time you have it to keep it. A man to even have a chance at finding a partner has to be the one who initiates, the one who chases, the pursuer, set up the dates, pay for the dates, be entertaining, be funny, be interesting, be muscular, be tall, have a deep voice, have your whole life planned so they know you'll make a lot of money and be able to provide for you. God help you if you're content just enjoying your life the way it is lol. And so so so so much more. 

For a woman to find a man...exist. just exist. Women are told they're perfect how they are and deserve love and a prince charming will come sweep them off their feet. Not to settle for any man even if it's the smallest imperfection because she deserves the best. 

No matter how ugly, fat, crazy, demanding, bad personality or whatever else any woman can post anywhere and get people to talk to and potential partners. The lowest woman in the world still has a remarkably higher chance of meeting someone compared to even average men.

We're classmates, and our seats are close to each other. We are at the very back of the classroom. His seat was in front of me, and I was at his back. Whenever he didn't have an assignment or I didn't have one, we shared it. On an ordinary day, he asked me, ""What will you do if I tell you I like you?"" I was surprised, and I only signaled to him an ""ok"" sign because I was panicking and don't know what to do, he asked what it meant and I just walked away. After a few days, he also asked my friend, who is a girl and is my close friend too, the same question. At that moment, I realized that the question was only his trick of his and that he just wanted to see our reactions. After that, he asked me the same question, but now I said I would say thank you. *I asked him two times ago when he would accept my friend request and he ignore the question. He accepted most of my classmates but why not me?*

**Our teacher gathered us all seated on the ground (Indian sit) with all of us to have an open forum because the school was ending too and it would be good if we said our emotions out loud. We have a choice; it's either we say thank you to our friend or say sorry. We had a ball on the open forum, and that ball is like a gift to your chosen friend. It's his turn. He said my name and said thank you because whenever he doesn't have an assignment, I am there he also said I am a good friend to him, and he said a lot of nice words that I haven't heard from anyone. After that, I can't remember what he was talking about because I was overwhelmed, and the next thing I knew was that he knelt in front of me and gave me the ball to me. I can't help but blush. I was stunned and my brain waltzed, and I don't know if that feeling is friendly anymore. I hate those kinds of feelings when someone likes me in a friendly or romantic way. I just don't know how to handle it. After the open forum, I did not say anything to him. I am not really good at expressing my emotions with speech, only in writing, so sometimes I write letters to people that I care for, but I will not give those letters away to them. We've been close friends until the classes were suspended I thought the classes would be back anytime and I was happy that there will be no classes anymore but now it all sank in because I miss my friends most likely him. Now, I feel lonely because I envy people that still talk to him while we don't anymore. It's been two years and I still don't have the closure. I can't just message him because I have no courage to do so because I am too shy to say hello to him with no context. That will be awkward. I don't know what he wants to talk about.

When I use dating apps I am the one who ALWAYS makes the first move, and more, I am sometimes the only one responsible for keeping the conversation going.

Rarely when I am messaged first, it's always something vulgar related to some assumption about my body or sexual role, it's never a f*cking cute message, seems like nobody has to gain my trust or intimacy, it's already a public domain subject.

I was talking to a guy the other day, and the conversation was going fine, just sharing jokes and pictures of our drawings, and out of nothing he started to send nudes and talking dirty, and I was like?!?!? Why??!?!?

So I started to really believe that maybe some people are just c*mdumps, it doesn't matter how hard they try to escape this fate.

Just learn to have fun on your own, do thing by yourself, I get that some of you have a need for attention and affection from people, it's a human need but instead of complaining about it try to figure out why you don't get those things. Expose yourselves to the public, talk to people, find common interests. You're not the only ones that feel this way about life. Also, if you feel lonely around people it is mostly because of you, stop waiting for people to acknowledge you and if they don't, it's their fault. Go talk to them, ask questions, do something. Most of the people here are lazy and scared, they complain about certain things but don't go out of their comfort zone to do them. How can you say that you're tired and miserable and that you hate this world when all you've done is stay inside. I got to say it, most people are pussies, that's it.

Now before you say ""at least you have a partner, you're not really alone"" it's more complicated than that. He already broke up with me for 2 months at the beginning of the year and he could do it again at anytime so I don't really fully consider myself to even have a partner bc he could leave at any time. In fact he told me the other day that he's thinking of taking a job where he'd be traveling for half the year so we wouldn't see each other as much.

Empty streets. 

Just the two of us. 

In broad daylight. 

Its unnerving.

The only time I am seen is when someone is paid or paying to do so. Even then it is hit or miss if I am noticed on anything but a superficial level. I stopped using self-check out at the grocery store for the off chance of eye contact or a conversation about the weather. I shop daily to min/max the chances. Its a numbers game at this point. 

I am, or was, a technician and would go door to door for my job. I have actually had people open the door and show me to their office then forget I was there. I would come out to tell them what I found and have them jump out of their skin at the sight of me. It happened often, 2-3 times a week.  I even had one person tell me she forgot I was there. She had let me in the door not 15 minutes earlier.

I got in the habit of attaching my keys to my tool bag so they would rattle and clank against my kit. So my customers could hear me coming, like you do in the woods so you don't startle the wildlife and get mauled.

I recently switched to an engineering role and work outside the home exclusively. I didn't think how much I would miss those over-the-shoulder customers. The arm chair tech gurus and tool enthusiasts. The single-minded hobbists' who can't help but tell anyone about their obsession.  Widows and widowers. Sometimes you can make a true connection with those people. Sometimes it's obvious they would be telling the same thing to a house plant; they just have to get it out. For their own good. Kind of like this.

The one exception is my son. He sees me all too well. I try to hide my distress from him and do sincerely enjoy the time we have together. He knows though... something has changed with his dad.  I took him to the park this afternoon and he immediately made friends with the others on the playground. You can't help but see him, he is a bright soul.

There was mother nearby, I gave her a smile and nod just to let her know I was there in case of playground disputes. She looked away immediately,  no acknowledgement whatsoever. This I am used to, its expected. Still when my son comes up for his water bottle and asks why my eyes are always watery now its hard to get a smile on my face. ""It's allergies little bud, just allergies."" 

I am profoundly lonely and in this I know I am not alone.

I just don't know what to do or say or provide him that will make him feel loved and seen and worthy of living.

It might be the staying up late and skipping meals talking but I feel so devoid of everything
I have no one that i feel truly cares about me 
I avoid most relationships since most partners i meet are big on hooking up as soon as possible and i just want to be held for fucks sake
I want a person to hug me and not feel like their counting down the seconds till they can stop
I prefer staying in mostof the time,reading my books
Maybe it's all the fucking 80-90s rom-coms i watch that has me delusional about what a relationship i supposed to be.
Ik their not supposed not be easy and carefree
But i want a simple conversation in the morning over breakfast on how the day will unfold.
I want to look at a person and feel happy and hope to God they feel the same towards me 
I want to yell, i want to argue over stupid shit and make up over it by the end of the day and fall asleep on the couch watching TV.

I am 25 and sicne i was 18 i have been experiencing rejection,indiference and nothing but emptiness fron the other gender. I am a stable man,with a stable job,who has his own appartment,speak 5 languages,train hard 5-6 days a week to forget about depression and pain cause sometimes i only can let my mind empty when i exercise. I have had suicidal thoughts since i have been 14,a shit of childhood,fought with my father,got beat up by my parents for years,and then as soon as i was 18 kicked out of my house. I worked hard every day of my life to make a future for myself,and i cannot understand why i cannot find anyone. This girl was so different,and i had such a good feeling,we both had to wake up at 5 AM and even then we stayed at the park talking till 23  pm the whole afternoon,having a great time talking about everything and getting to know each other,i didnt make any insinuation or any speech with a second meaning,i just wanted to enjoy the company of a person i was interested in. She also had some traumas with men in the past so even then i felt ashamed as a man for what happened to her. After that when we had to take different pahts on our way home,only then i just spoke sincerelly to her about the posibility of having some time a second date,cause i had so much fun and i found her a very cool and interesting person,she answered that she enjoyed a lot also the afternoon with me and that she also wanted a second date. So then why the hell after one week she just ignores me and lets me on read...i cannot understand anything,i only sent her 2 messages more after our first date cause she never started a conversation.first asking if she has been okay these days,and second only telling her that i was worried i did something wrong or something that may have offended her,and that if she is not interested anymore on knowing me further is ok,i mean we are adults but people nowadays don't have the courage to be sincere and direct,they always choose the easy hurting way. And today i just woke up and started crying all the morning,cause it feels like i am breaking apart,so many years without hearing a how was your day? Or any ""hi,how are you"". And i am just willing to not wake up anymore of my bed,because there is no reason left.

I had a poor effort with my last volume. To which I want to be making excuses. I wrote it, published it, &amp; showed it to people. Being an amateur is no fun but it‚Äôs free because there is no responsibility to it, which allows for something fun. Which is the result of freedom &amp; having internet access. Do &amp; publish. Which is in a public fashion &amp; manner. Though underlying, I do hope it helps someone, somewhere, or my high dream is that it sparks someone's mind &amp; contributes more to individual philosophy. 

2 - 

Again, I might try to use each chapter on one single theme. With random thoughts attached to it. I don't think I‚Äôll ever be fully coherent. But hope expressed in any other way besides realism can be held as fantasy. I think these words are some subconscious way to achieve my own immortality. But a failure to understand oneself, the external, &amp; so on, any point or form of criticism is interrupted as a personal criticism, if it‚Äôs in relation to one‚Äôs distraction, that the one being criticized will be attacked for puncturing that illusion that functions like a drug, either verbally or physically, sometimes both. When economics isn‚Äôt achievable rather than taking it up as a social issue, political, or even simply as economically, the mainstream &amp; to an extent, subcultures too, receive it as a personal attack. When there is a lack of understanding. Which is the potential risk when ending at least some sort of formal education or a personal undertaking in the continued learning. It‚Äôs when the celebrity sage comes into play or some figurehead that comes out of the fog. The illusion upheld beres nothing like the reality lived underneath. The people demand someone new. At the beginning of 2021, when a changing of American presidents happened, there hasn‚Äôt been a political fuck up in years, often the victims aren‚Äôt in understanding, so they protest. Entertainment is a great pacifier. In freedom, hedonism has taken place, why? Because it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs well documented that the sex industry, main prostitution, is the world's longest trade or business. Consumerism has affected everything we do. Including religion &amp; spirituality. That tension is real. I don‚Äôt know what I offer, I am a loner, not many people in my life whom I can call at any time, even the ones whom I do converse with regularly, they complain about the wall I put up. Which is not a pleasant feeling to feel or a bit of wisdom that I know. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve written anything that can be offered in a practical sense. Other than some words to motivate people to think for themselves, to write down a personal philosophy, or maybe just something to think about in their own world &amp; mind. In the altruistic vibe inside, I want any of my mystics whose testamentary writings go unnoticed, soldiers of the century. Though I didn‚Äôt stray away too far from my original idea of just writing in stream consciousness. And I‚Äôm going to miss everyone when I go fully, monk.

During the attempting writing of the last volume, it was not like I found God, but witnessed a warmth when interacting with a person I know. Which has thrown out, well not entirely of my sense of self. I began looking into orthodox Christianity. Like most in the west, it‚Äôs either Christianity or catholicism. My focus on thinking has changed because of it. Or at least a sense of self has changed. By luck, I have found the woman‚Äôs version, grow. Where prior, it has only been feminism &amp; some writings in criticism towards men's rights movements. Which, wgtow is an area I am most looking forward to exploring. So far, it‚Äôs not as far-ranging as the mgtow counterpart is, &amp; because of that, not as in-depth. The instrumental reason of interest in those groups, because at least the ideals of it, is doing life alone, but as a functioning adult who‚Äôs aiming for a healthy mind &amp; life. Like other similar subgroups, they have so many undertones of toxic traits to them. Of course, being a loner has something else largely to do with it. Various differing reasons, but I am joining, not fully advocating the above-mentioned groups. Well, not at least now. But in terms of wgtow, I have found countless online vlogging channels of women choosing to be childfree, marriage free, which is an area of exploration. Of course, I‚Äôm more likely going to find more men's groups, mainly due to being a male. Prior to writing this. Finding God or at least thinking of God now may be aligning to my No Fap or semen retention journey, which in other words, cut out the objectification of sex &amp; beauty in my single life. Well, that is my reason for doing so. Personally had come to a sense of no sex outside a committed relationship. In the meantime, porn, more healthy thoughts when it comes to lust, beauty, etc. For which FYI, the days between the viewing of porn have increased largely, there‚Äôs been times when in old habits, remembering NoFap, I would stop watching the video. Don‚Äôt leave the condom on the staircase in the apartment block.

One thing I had issues with, not leaving enough time from when the last volume was written to write a new one. Though I did have the intent to think it through before writing, with some sort of structure for the whole thing. Which I pretty much gave up. I did try to read over articles before each chapter before writing, jotting down notes, thinking it through, whatever. To which I gave up early on as well. Of course now, just writing it, researching is something that I really need to work on. On that note, letting other people read is another good blessing. In today‚Äôs modern technology, anyone, well, the everyday common person can now publish their thoughts instantly, either as a blog or vlog, to some platform, to some amount of people. Which for cultural history, social history, &amp; anthropology history which is so important. I think now this year, it is more common for people should personally share what they shouldn‚Äôt. For this reason, I want others to read it, to see if it makes sense, maybe give me a different pov directly, &amp; let me know if any idea isn‚Äôt well developed, let alone if it‚Äôs on the right track or not. That kind of feedback is so important. I‚Äôve properly repeated myself so many times. The only real control I have ever had is in the development of my character. 

5 - 
The freedom of speech argument will always be undergoing, regardless of the period of humanity, with that, since people are still alive, the interpretation of history &amp; the access to it isn‚Äôt parallel to the notion of free speech which is lacking in my view, will both issue for humanity. People can be deeply misguided. It‚Äôs a little-known fact outside certain learning circles that the nazi party made sure every German home had a free radio. Let alone the continued failed understanding of money &amp; the economic market. Compassionate capitalism allows for empathy &amp; emotions to be put in place. It took how long to implement the idea of matured apprenticeships, which most countries don‚Äôt have. I recognize that broad statement without forgetting cultural differences. Without access to information, I wouldn‚Äôt have been exposed to thinkers, such as Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges, &amp; Karl Popper. Let alone not have access to countless hours of Milton Friedman. For such broad introductions to the world, Niall Ferguson is a good start. But this is what happens in life. This is not necessarily an inherent immoral action, it can be argued as a sense of growth in relation to the individual. In the ability to be aware of growth, new information, different ways of action, the ability to think through the day, self-care, using the time to read, watch lectures &amp; interviews. I am regretting my early adulthood. Where I had worked entry-level jobs between sessions of active addiction, in the rare moments when I wasn‚Äôt doing either, I was passed out or gave into sloth &amp; gluttony. Freedom itself has given me room to change. That in itself has come at a price. The awareness of time that I had of never leaving my memory, attaching care to the wrong areas, issued emotions &amp; time spent to what I was thinking, which I can personally vouch for that it was more sinful to the actions as a free agent I performed. I guess the point that I‚Äôm trying to make, the second volume of ‚Äòliftings‚Äô had poor English, which due to my ignorance did not double-check prior to publishing &amp; became insecure about showing it to anyone I know in my daily life, which is still out in publication. The third one is just plain laziness &amp; inexperience. Reasons to mention it, reasons to keep it in public publication as the way it is, to keep the awareness of human flaws &amp; to hope to highlight others, which are worth pondering on their thoughts. For that, I‚Äôm suggesting anything be left undone, not finished, half done, lazy, whatever, I think too much for the love of lowbrow art has taken hold too much inside. Where avant-garde or direct cinema is something that I‚Äôm happy in doing. I am hoping to help out with anything critical of what I produce. Without criticism, everything is on a slower trajectory. I dare say, with less quality too. But, what the avant-garde has done for art, the least I can do is to help the variations of performing actions. 

6 - 

Not until I started writing it, that I actually wanted to write a philosophy for loners. Which is quite ignorant. A loner is more on the high side for individuals. Writing a collective philosophy is much easier. Knowing human boundaries is not fun. The underlying critiques of freedom, regardless of which state or areas of that state are always questions of morality. Depending on whom you ask, it‚Äôs not only a matter of moral behavior but issues with ignorance. Writing philosophy has never been an easy task. Each younger generation that comes into some sort of independent thinking, as they should, begin to challenge the immediate generation above them, it's easy to pass it over as idealism, ideas should never be shy, neither looking at them either. To possibly account for so many people, which I do not know, not even a small fraction of people. In itself to attempt to write for such people is a fallacy. The cult of self is some form of adultery. But I guess it‚Äôs one loner throwing out ideas, concepts, whatever I said, would hopefully give other people a sense of being a loner healthily.

Like the other three, I don‚Äôt know what this piece will entail. I had the strong thought of talking or writing my thoughts about God. How that has played its part in my previous individual philosophy, which did originally get inspired by Anton Lavey‚Äôs, ‚ÄòThe Satanic Bible‚Äô. Though I am sure those strong themes will remain somehow. With any sort of life, one would know that it changes, reality in itself has its own mind. I hope I can at least conjure up ways to express in the written word how the individual can develop their own identity in a healthy way, without forgetting the wide community, family, peers, dating life, basic life experiences, culture, &amp; art &amp; politics. Most of all, somehow improve. In the last volume, I have sent it out to some people I know, I hope I can work up the nerve to ask for some feedback. I think the whole piece was only around 30 pages or so. After all, we spend more time with ourselves than we do with anyone else. Hopefully, expand on updates in my personal life. I don‚Äôt really, maybe this is all some random obscure moral quest, like most of my past publications, it won‚Äôt be any sort of major marketing, links to my YouTube films, sometimes a tweet or a post elsewhere, that's it. See what happens. Which philosophy should never be subjected to any sort of law or the cultural norm? There isn‚Äôt really any comfort in knowing that learning comes to an end. 

8 - 

My hesitant temperament to join any church is perhaps giving up anything that's good or had worked for me. Or a wanting change initiated from the outside. Maybe the worry of letting people in. Maybe the fear of discovering something that doesn‚Äôt sit well, like how many motivational speakers or wellness people have you encountered that are selling something? Maybe I should turn to art to help find the articulation of my concerns. Explaining my personal history with addiction, that indirectly takes up admission that I‚Äôve done something wrong. Of course, the lack of self-care is a part of the seven deadly sins. The petty crime. Burning of drugs. Using my money at the pub. Never paying rent. The lying. Using other people. Regardless of the past, I wasn‚Äôt born into it all, so I had lived some sort of life. I‚Äôve fornicated too. It‚Äôs not necessarily the acts that bother me. Just the overall feel, intent, the avoidance of wanting to be a good person. I spent several years in this comfort &amp; knowing. Even now, habits act, &amp; things I‚Äôm still familiar with, that I do not think will go astray disappear. Looking back, I think it was the safety net of being young &amp; never bearing responsibility. Being in fear of both political &amp; social rights, in a crowd of people that want some sort of direction towards Heaven, that have a chant of protests that differ from mine. Maybe the growth, the path, the journey, whatever you call it, doing Fatiha on another person's pace, not of my own. Let alone the fear of rejection I have. I don‚Äôt know what will truly heal me, I honestly don‚Äôt think any good that I do now will separate me from where I‚Äôve been. I still think that the betterment of humanity still rests on the shoulders of the individual. Backward ache. 

TWO 

1 - 

Almost everything that has come to light, something discovered, new or renewed, a new product for the consumer, a locally developed landscape, building, or business has an allure of promising life-changing substance to it. This includes branches of philosophy. With effective altruism, some of the writings, well a lot of it, fail to include a person's selfishness, greed, &amp; insecurity. Where so often people conflict selfishness with self-care, personal truth as moral truth. The complexity of the world should never be understated. As a result, what is introduced into the wider community is presented with the results of being a born-again person. More specifically from the 80 the business culture or more pacific, wall street has gained the first place on the forefront of the figurehead for the working life. Where so many blue-collar people began to dress as Gordon Gecko. Where some fail to notice, a human invention, an industry no longer relying on the earth, but from solely human structure or purely human values in human ideas. 

2 - 

Over the last few weeks, I looked beyond the face of Simone Weil, yeah I began looking into her work, but hearing a podcast about her, &amp; watching a documentary about it, it‚Äôs not the fact that she‚Äôs a modern philosopher, but for the first time where her biography is more famous than her philosophical works. Where previous, well, it‚Äôs still in play that the biography is looked at after, in order to better understand the person, understanding the person means understanding the philosophical works better to continue only or have the dominant theme of philosophy only. For the second time, I saw philosophy connected to action, outside some nuggets in the world of effective altruism. Her life wasn‚Äôt underdeveloped, despite dying at thirty-four, but her substance in philosophical papers was. There is a lesson to be learned in that. Her religious life has had a lasting impact on her. An area I‚Äôm wanting to explore in her life.  

3 - 
There are plenty of concerns about organized religion. When writing on anything, I‚Äôll admit it, it is hard to remain objective. I won‚Äôt be comparing my problems with the wider community or to any individual. It‚Äôs not moral for me to do it. In my essence, being conformed to any expression is a worry. Considering living in relation to God, life, or higher ideals. 
 
4 - 

Rudolf Steiner, which part of his philosophy, is a philosophy for the individual. But looking at his work, he writes broadly across all areas, with writings on mysticism, kooky areas, &amp; who knows what. Writing for the individual philosophy theory incurs writing across multiple areas of life. 

5 - 

I‚Äôve been listening to Alan Watts on &amp; off for years. But it was for therapy reasons &amp; nothing for philosophical reasons. 

6 - 

Following patterns, ways, traditions, &amp; the format, is a part of the day. Everything that religion has a way to it, a format, a tradition, rules, commandments, &amp; so on. Differences between all, sure. At the moment, I still stand by that people are corrupted. Everything else, anything built from them, around them, for them, depending on them. It requires an emotional willingness to want to learn. Because to fall under a minimum lifestyle across the board, something is incredibly wrong. The humility which is so hard to grasp, to put it all into action takes out so much of life that too often the person has reached an age where there is enough life to look back on. Though no one fully knows what it takes to gain salvation &amp; that's freedom. When one does not understand completely, one utterly fails oneself. Thought that I‚Äôll more on the thought of God. at the moment, it's an underlying vibe or feeling that I just want to be more grounded. Or seek out some sort of remedy, finding a way to search for forgiveness, both from the outside &amp; for myself. The first step to understanding the world is to understand thyself. And no, I don‚Äôt want to die. I am not one who commands ideas through words clearly. Through a disguised illusion, a personalized fantasy I‚Äôve created over time, allowing myself to distract, justify, avoid. I‚Äôve talked about before, in regards to my past addictions, which I did turn out to be a complete junkie, imagine a drug addict's behavior. I‚Äôve lied, I‚Äôve been self-centered, difficult, couldn‚Äôt say no, quick to anger, quick to judge, jealous, a self of entitlement, should I go on? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve left out traits &amp; of course the details. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôll be reading this, if they know me, I‚Äôm sure they can think of things to say. There‚Äôs nothing I can do now that can change the past. Nothing. Not at least the memory. Sure it‚Äôs cliche to say to let it go, it is what it is, that was yesterday, &amp; so on. But when it comes to one, I‚Äôm sure that it applies to everyone else, when immersed in private affairs, it can't just shift, at least for me. Maybe this is all just a matter of my emotions. I‚Äôve gone through passages of time when I do not take the time to self-reflect or attempt to practice anything in virtue or growth. I have spent time developing self-knowledge. I think I‚Äôm a slave to my own emotions, which is very human, &amp; a slave to my ignorance too. That both can be summed up as very human. In previous volumes, I‚Äôve mentioned my weight issues. Sloth. If I dig into the individuality, the ‚Äòi‚Äô are collected from various facets that aren‚Äôt compatible. Hence my confliction, for that very weight gain was during a duration of thawing out. 

7 - 

There is no artist, no thinker, no politician, celebrity, no one on earth, in this reality, no family member, peer or close friend, even the lover, worth devoting one‚Äôs life to emulating. It has struck me how unethical the void of life has led so many people away. Maybe it‚Äôs on account of feeling time passing towards death, it‚Äôs a relentless endless moment for the time being. In the enlightenment period, secular ethics finally had reached the mainstream, then spread out 7 became normal. Where arguments about morality are in discussion. Where the local priest, pastor, or minister, let alone what title that person has, is now no longer the entire go-to person. I think that what raises some people, is the connection of current skill, the void between, &amp; the ideal. Which is the inarticulate mind turns to heroes or idols. I mean like, you do know they all have the same desires, flaws, shortcomings, insecurity, at least on the very human level, made the same mistakes. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of literature discussing the disconnect between the effort &amp; the reward. When another scandal reaches the front page of tabloids, we scream, we protest over moral renewal, change, something new when the puncture of illusion has been breached. Good writing isn‚Äôt what stirs the mind to think, but engages the reader to make an effort in action. Still, it‚Äôs easier to be in the collective than the individual. Think about Obama‚Äôs campaign slogan, ‚Äòyes we can‚Äô. Well yeah. The area that I strangely respect him in, is smoking. Life is harsh, smoking ether like a rolled weed, abused in finding identity, hug me, don‚Äôt reject other ugly, it was written that God doesn't like ugly. Perhaps turning to these idols is a way of passing the time, the excuse not to think of ourselves. In the awareness of it all. It‚Äôs bleak in the knowledge of death. There is no cure for getting people to think. The act of tearing something apart or the unwillingness or the avoidance of it loses its meaning. The value of looking at other people in the way they live their life is to work out the right &amp; wrong, any actions that can presently apply in a practical way. Simone Weil proposed that attention itself is the rarest gift. We all judge. Myth has never died. That it‚Äôs easy to look at people &amp; have it all worked out. What they do in private, is all very human. It's a safe way to discover what we might love. Finding qualities. Finding knowledge. We can even live through that person's life. Kerouac does a great job of romanticizing more of the modern world. Without knowing them, it's easy to surpass any wrongdoing. Like a toxic relationship. An individual remains, learns what they can, &amp; continues. I‚Äôm always curious to witness the breakdowns of a person. We idolize them, but the conspiracy boils up to the top. Regardless if you think Satan lives or not, to turn away from vice, character flaws &amp; evil, then your indirect enabling can be used as a reason in the why. 

8 - 

The matrix of morals, the matrix of the mind of all. It's demanding, exhausting, &amp; often never finding the language, which could explain the lack of action in the ethical actions, well at least a large portion of vice. It becomes a fairytale or myth when one ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt want to think about it. Actions are the cultural depth of the humanities. Critical thinking provides the oxygen to the lungs of culture. The Devil is written as once was the most beautiful Angel before the exile. In the birth of wrong, it is from not wanting to think about it. Why I support individual philosophy, I don‚Äôt write passages of poetics in the hope. I‚Äôm very well aware of the lack &amp; knowing full well of those better, how many celebrities can you name off the top of your head. When I write Daniel Tammett, how long did the google search take? Perhaps not all theory needs it, moral philosophy along with its broad range of it often lacks writing that provides the needed large volumes of variances in practical ways in putting into practice. I‚Äôm in the right to want a critical response to anything that I write, but wrong to expect it. Not all of us can be Audrey Hepburn, where we‚Äôre born into innocence &amp; grace. There‚Äôs spirituality for sale. The modern wave of it started with the hippies. Hendrix himself is or was the mainstream of his day. The bible had the award of being both the most bought book &amp; stolen one, at the same time, for so long. Language itself is important, it‚Äôs in our art too, though the inarticulate ways, most of us never go out trying to express our belief system to what it‚Äôs not. Hence the search for attaching to a collective group. Being a recluse from society, you‚Äôll need to utterly rely on the earth. Clean water, the soil, whatever it is, an escape from reliance is never there, which will never be fully articulated anywhere. We want what we want. So often we fail, in inarticulate ways, we‚Äôve committed to guilt, shame &amp; regret in the familiar way that's already in existence. But nothing can dictate anything that lays out conditions over any terrain that leads to independent thinking. The way its structure sets up a large portion of devotion. Countless years. An optical illusion. Though it‚Äôs in our value system. I‚Äôm not going to argue to extend the number of years of compulsory education. Education is practical philosophy. Proposing to normalize adults to write out &amp; publish their regrets. To have those regrets out in the open. Learning but the environment. No one likes a grown child. The problems of alienating anything, particularly in a free society, it‚Äôs going to be found. It's a political thing too, we all pay tax, our work generates the service or the item, critical thinking first, labor second, that labor generates, pulls together closer that tension between the individual &amp; the wider community. It‚Äôs a well-known fact that fast food is cheaper &amp; extremely unhealthy for us, though most people in the world can recognize those golden arches. So often people reach middle age than a sweeping wave of thoughts when it happens, that isn‚Äôt a good day. Something that I urge people who work in hospitals, nursing homes, &amp; private nurses to start talking more about, is the vast amount of people who die alone. I mean, it‚Äôs just not the lack of physical presence, but the actual thinking-awareness &amp; the emotions of loneliness.",2022-06-19 11:59:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655015033,0,/r/lonely/comments/vftmwy/tried_to_write_loner_philosopher/,,0,2,tried to write loner philosopher

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is, for years ive been alone. and not in the sense that 'oh i have friends i just don't talk to them', I literally have nothing. No contacts, No one added on social media i actually know and who don't care to know me.

&amp;#x200B;

This translates into real life. No one wants to talk to me. even when i initiate conversations you can talk. but theres no connection, and when there has been times where ive had something of a friend in the past. they turn out to be users. people who talk rubbish behind backs. People who are only there when they want something.

&amp;#x200B;

My social anxiety is the issue. Im in a prison and I have been for many years. my hope comes in a bottle. which now doesn't work. I used to go for walks but i was verbally abused outside by some bored teenagers and it brought back some childhood trauma. I don't look strange but my anxiety and body language comes across as such. 

ive been indoors since April. all attempts to try and get people to notice, nothing. everyone previously has always had an excuse not to. but then a few hours later are doing something with others.

I wake up daily to nothing. no notifications. no one checking up on me irl or online. i could drop dead and id be dust before anyone took notice.

 Nobody gives a shit. its the same story again and again. medical professionals gave up on me. Medication does not work, it actually makes it worse. 

trying for years. im drained. I'm worn out. its insanity. 

I just need something, some miracle advice. some hope that doesn't come from a bottle.

We played a game today together and overall had fun, but I wanted to get a sense of when they would want to do it again, yknow, something to look forward to. No reply.

3585,vg1fpm,IceLikesReddit,"I‚Äôve wrote so fucking many times here just because of these people, I‚Äôm fucking done with them.

They all keep hating, bullying, harassing, making fun of me, and basically fucking my whole life up.

This all peaked today when 3 of them decided to play a prank on me, by fucking up the whole Minecraft server. It is not the prank I am mad about, but the coordination these people were able to achieve, a few of them who I thought didn‚Äôt hate me much.

As a male, I just feel like girls are friendlier and less cold. Their insults don‚Äôt seem ill-intentioned, they seem like teasing. Also, in my country, due to raging homophobia, boys can‚Äôt even HUG or *TOUCH* eachother because they‚Äôll be bullied for ‚Äúbeing gay‚Äù.

When I‚Äôm with other boys I have to worry about EVERY WORD I SAY as they‚Äôll use ANYTHING against me. When I‚Äôm with girls I do not have to worry about this. They seem more forgiving.

Unfriending these people (most of which are males) will probably lead to me not hanging out with anyone since the people that are ok to me are either girls and I‚Äôd look weird and probably they‚Äôll probably not gonna let me hang out with them, or they hang out with people that are not ok to me.

I cannot think of any other solution to this problem than to change schools.

I think one more year at this school alone (FULLY alone, most likely) would be better than these toxic relationships.

It's father's day and I got to walk home like 10 miles because we tried to go out to dinner with my wife's dad and mom and sister and the sister was just so rude to me that I walked out of the restaurant and my wife tried to say she would pick me up. But I want the time for me. I've wanted to die for so long now and fight the urge off every day. I have guns and it wouldn't be hard to do. I've already planned most of it to where I shouldn't be found for quite some time. I just don't know how it will effect my kids or if they will even notice me gone.",2022-06-20 00:44:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613978945,2,/r/lonely/comments/vg8y7m/lonely/,,0,3,lonely.

I‚Äôm at that point of life where I don‚Äôt really care what people think of me as I don‚Äôt really care for myself. Trying to make friends is a waste of time. The people I consider friends don‚Äôt talk to me often. There is a line where I consider people to be friends or not. At this current moment, I don‚Äôt talk to others, other than my parents. I sympathize with people that post here just to share their feelings and not getting people to talk to them. I don‚Äôt personally start conversations with anybody since they only talk for one conversation. I guess I‚Äôm part of the problem then. I wasn‚Äôt always like this. Starting from 2020, I became isolated from others. My dislike for humanity grew. I got better at acting. I got better at not being me. I have become borderline-sociopathic, but I‚Äôm not mad at that. I don‚Äôt mind if my friends abandon me again. It‚Äôs not the first or the second time. There is one thing I have learned that I will hold onto until I die. The person that is always there for you is yourself. You are the person who has the capability to end it or start it.

3660,vg9vnb,Voice-Strange,"I (18F) have been battling depression and a binge ED since around 7th grade so about 6 years now. I have ups and downs obviously, but I realize that my depression gets really bad when my ED does. When I turn to food for help, to fill a void. I for a while was doing really well. I was healthy, I was training for a bodybuilding competition, in a really healthy relationship, in love, I had lots of friends, and even though the ‚Äúlots of friends‚Äù part  didn‚Äôt matter I had a very very close small circle of best friends, happy with myself for once, and wasn‚Äôt depressed or stuffing my face every night to feel happy. I can say that for the first time in my life I was genuinely happy. Well I fucked it all up. I made the mistake of getting on birth control thinking that I would be the one case that was different, who wouldn‚Äôt gain any weight, and convinced myself that I‚Äôd be a part of the 2% of people who lose weight on it. Go figure, I was incorrect. in fact I gained close to 60 pounds. It‚Äôs not that I was necessarily unhealthy but I was definitely unhappy. I was probably pushing an unhealthy weight. I don‚Äôt know but what I do know is that I refused to get on the scale, and when I went to the gynecologist a year later and finally saw what it had done to me I broke down and decided that that would be the last time I ever took birth control, and that I would suffer through agonizing cramps and endometriosis pain if it meant that I could finally be fucking happy with myself again. Why is this important you ask? My whole point is that my life was finally on track I felt like a real human being for that small period of time that I busted my ass to be the person I wanted to be. My birth control sent my depression to a nose dive. My senior year was absolutely awful I did almost nothing, and was barely involved in school like I normally am. I barely went out because I was so ashamed of how I looked and what I had done to myself that I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to get out of bed because I was so unhappy. My friends stopped talking to me. That has more to do with the fact that they don‚Äôt like certain views that I have and I‚Äôm not as political in their favor as they originally thought. It actually really fucking hurt when they cut me off even though it was gradual. But I‚Äôve now realized that I don‚Äôt really have any friends at all. My relationship hasn‚Äôt changed and I still love him deeply, but he‚Äôs literally all I have. No one ever checks in on me, nobody ever asks me to go out, nobody ever wants to hear about my life. I have to do all of that by myself. I have to invite people out. Most of the time they all seem too busy to make time for me. I put on a front that I don‚Äôt really give a fuck about anything but the truth is that I‚Äôm hurting so badly inside. It is so painful to try so hard to be likable and still feel like you‚Äôre never enough for anybody. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Even my two younger sisters I feel like they fucking hate me. I‚Äôm the oldest of three. My sisters are 16 and 15. They hang out all the time and despite my best efforts to be nice to them and invite them to do things it‚Äôs just like they want nothing to do with me. I just graduated high school and I feel like I should be so happy about that because I had such a hard time keeping up with my grades, but the truth is that I‚Äôm terrified because I know that I can‚Äôt really fake having friends anymore. Or at least in someway convince myself that there are people who like and care about me. I just want to know what‚Äôs wrong with me? Why does nobody care about me the way that I care about them? I have friends at work and stuff but they all have closer friends and none of them check up on me or invite me to things it‚Äôs almost like I have to invite myself.  I‚Äôm not even a first thought in their mind and then they‚Äôll talk about the plans around me and be like ‚Äúoh I guess you can go too‚Äù. I‚Äôm the friend that gets pushed to the side on the grass when there‚Äôs three of us walking on the sidewalk. I‚Äôm the friend that gets invited last. I‚Äôm The friend that gets ignored during group conversations and cut off. I‚Äôm the friend that puts their heart and soul into the friendships that I have and get absolutely nothing back. It just really hurts. I‚Äôm so lonely and empty inside. I really am trying so hard but life just feels absolutely impossible right now. I‚Äôm already in therapy for other things, so that‚Äôs out of the question. But I don‚Äôt feel like therapy can fix the fact that I‚Äôm just such an unlikable person. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.

3674,vgavf5,PsalmoftheSad,"I met this girl through work a week or two ago and decided to meet up for a range date on Thursday. Lots of fun -- it was even her idea to get dessert afterwards. For someone that has never been on a date before, this **REALLY** threw me for a loop. This last week or so of talking to her has been the most sporadic emotional rollercoaster I've been on in a long ass time. I laughed. I cried. The story became a part of me


Jokes aside though, I've been alone my whole life. I'm sure a lot of people here know what that's like and this girl gave me hope that maybe I'd finally get a chance to climb out of this hole of loneliness and abject misery. Nope. As per usual it was a red herring


I meet girls all the time, so I guess I'm being misleading. The interactions I have with them in person don't go further than a greeting, make her laugh a few times, she says what she needs (I meet them all through work because I can't find a social place to meet women without it coming off as creepy) and then leaves. Sometimes, in very rare cases, I'll give her my number and business card because she's just that gorgeous that I'll tempt fate, definitely punching above my own weight ... And it was this same girl that, two weeks ago, I did that to. She has been the only one in four years to actually text me.


Here's the catch though : she's shipping off for the army in less than a month. She signed up for a **five feckin year contract** and I won't see her till it's all over. To be honest? I'm not even sure society will still exist in five years. Who's to say she won't meet a guy in the service? That shit happens all the time.


There's **ALWAYS** a catch with the girls that I meet in person that seem at least a little interested in me. Either the ""relationship"" (and I use that term loosely) lasts less than a week, the timing is off or a combination of both. The girls I talk to online **don't** want to meet. Or they're fuckin nuts. Or both. It's like God himself wants me to be alone but will sometimes throw me a bone just to break up the monotony of being numb... Yet it somehow feels more cruel to be given such a gift knowing it won't last. What's worse? 



I hate having this timer on knowing this girl. She's awesome -- we're two very different people but have just enough in common to make things work. I know nothing will come out of... All this... But I guess the fact that I care at all in the first place shows I'm already emotionally invested. Maybe it's desperation? 


I could feckin ramble on for **hours** about how life's not fair and boohoo but it'd just be preaching to the choir. My **TL;DR** is : 

&gt;&gt; met girl, girl might actually like me for once. Doesn't matter though, girl's shipping off for the army.",2022-06-20 02:31:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,14,/r/lonely/comments/vgavf5/theres_always_a_feckin_catch/,,0,3,There's always a feckin catch

3. Excrise and stretch for and hour. Stretch 30 mins excrise 30 mins. Streching is enough most days and a very impotant one on the list.

While my peers were slowly getting used to socializing and going to classes physically, I hole myself up in my dorm room, thinking everything is comfortable the way it is. But then people start talking about how I‚Äôm not attending classes even though I live in the dorms and is only a few minutes away from the faculty.

Then I find out that a close friend of mine is chummy with the people who talked behind me.

But then that same friend is acting distant and treating me like I‚Äôm some stranger.

Another friend called me unsafe and said she‚Äôd need space from me which I‚Äôm so relieved of because to be frank, her existence affects me negatively. She speaks negatively of her experience and her abuser which is I think is how she copes but I can‚Äôt be that place she vents to because I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of how I was abused by my birth giver and her bringing up the topic most definitely reminds me of my abuse very vividly.

3744,vgi6jn,akstwo,"I'm a lonely, single 30something female, currently grappling with the loss of hope around ever finding a partner (I'm on the ace spectrum, a cultural misfit, it's a whole thing). Having cycled through periods like this for over a decade, I've learnt a few things, that I thought I'd share:

1) It takes courage to connect. I have some friends from my uni days and various workplaces. Some are not good to reach out to, they're not in a good place themselves. Some are more reliable. The thing is, there's no way of know who is in what category until you reach out and say something vulnerable. I have found two to four good people on any given day. 

2) Sometimes your brain says nothing will help, this is a lie. Your brain is lying to you. It does this all the time. Maybe it just doesn't know what will help. Maybe it thinks the only thing that will help is actually unhealthy and unhelpful and perpetuates your loneliness cycle. Mine kept saying that no one would ever be able to fully meet my emotional needs, this is the emotional deprivation schema at play and it is a bitch.

3) Touch starvation is real. Take a hot shower, put on your fluffiest bathrobe, make a hot cup of tea or hot chocolate, get a weighted blanket. Or go out with a free hugs sign. Arrange to see a good friend or family member, warn them you will want a good hug. They'll come through (see part 1). Some of my best hug memories are from when I explicitly asked trusted people for them.

4) It can all be a self fulfilling prophecy. You may not even be aware of your body language, eye contact, tone, what you are saying (open or closed questions?). If you believe you'll be forever lonely, you risk writing yourself off. Been there, I've been learning to be aware of myself (and continue to learn).

5) You can't predict the future. Sorry. You just can't. You don't know if you'll be lonely next month, you can guess and assume but there's a broad margin for error. You could go out tomorrow and have a movie moment and suddenly make a friend for life. Or you could wake up tomorrow and suddenly decide to do something brave that puts you in the way of people who will become friends over time. 

6) Don't aim for happiness. It's such a broad umbrella. Aim for contentedness and acceptance. Accept joy, accept grief, accept it all. It reminds you you're human, and sometimes it's shit to be human. Seek out joy. I'm straight up taking myself out on dates, consciously choosing to go alone to the symphony. It's okay to be alone. It's okay. You'll be okay.

7) Reflect on why you're here. Don't just blame it on others and society, how did you get here. What was your upbringing like? What were your parents like? What did you learn as a kid? What do you have to unlearn as an adult? I've had two great therapists who taught to me reflect non-judgementally. I am an exercise in curiosity. Be curious.

3752,vgj1ch,baobab_the_fruit,"To tell you the truth, im not entirely sure why im typing this. I do not expect noir think anyone will particularly care about what i have to type. But i suppose that its only human to want to be heard, and this is as good a place as any to share a life‚Äôs story i guess.   


It will have to be a multiple posts story, so i‚Äòll wait for the reaction on this bit of the story and then i might add the rest if people want to hear it. First of all, my life hasn‚Äôt been special in any way shape or form. That bothers me sometimes, i feel like im drifting through life without aim or any real goals. Don‚Äôt get me wrong my life certainly hasn‚Äôt been the worst, bit it most definitely hasn‚Äôt been the best. Having said that, here we go.   


**Youth.**  


I dont remember a great deal of my really younger years, i have an issue with memory and most of my childhood has passed into oblivion. But there are shards of it, but to do it justice id have to start around high school. Until then i was a rather normal kid, played my nintendo, came from a rather poor family, and was raised in the cult that are the jehova‚Äôs witnesses. I had no friends, no money, and just generally no particular motivation to join society.   


But as it is the law here i had to go to school, which for me turned out later to probably be a good things vs being homeschooled by people who think the end is neigh and that your sole purpose should be to spread the word. Highschool was rather uneventful, i was bullied for my appearance (my hair was always sort of short and my clothes cheep which kids love to pick at). I do remember the turning point of that quite vividly, i am not proud of it but i think its a good place to start.   


**Bullied, no more.**  


I was sitting in class 3th year, another guy who was bullied for years started to pick on me, suppose it was his way of trying to climb the social ladder. After enduring his remarks for about half an hour he started the good ol racist spewing Of words. At this point mind you i had been bullied for  2 and a half years and reached my boiling point. After the class i waited for him to come through the classroom door and i slammed it right into him. He got beat up by two more or less Krab and Goyle types, but i didn‚Äôt care I finally stood up for myself. (Or so i thought at the time, I realise now it just turned me into a jerk like the people that picked on me).   


the remaining two years at that school where uneventfuL.  


**At Home**

I was regularly beaten for stupid things like talking in gatherings (read church), not that anyone who was there ever cared. This kept happening until i was old enough and to big for my dad to keep that up, he is a rather mean man and a real piece of \*\*\* when it comes to animal abuse. (Killed my cat, twice. And beheaded a bird who came to fish in his pond amongst others). My mom rather passive when it comes to his behaviour you know, the whole ‚Äúobey they husband‚Äù thing. I did have some solace, i read books, lots and lots of books. Between being forced to go to these church meetings and get their propoganda pushed down my throat and being bulied or bored at the worst school in my country (officially titled as such back then) i got to read many many books.   


Alright guys,   
I know that so far this story has been rather boring. I‚Äôm 35 now, a dad raising his child not together with her mother. And i have a partner overseas. So there is more to the story, a lot more. And i would happily answer questions about anything. If there is enough interest or comments i will add more to the story. But i dont want to type this out and bore everyone to death.

I know it doesn‚Äôt last forever and that I can get lonely again in just a matter of days, to the point where Im outright depressed.

Am I wrong for wanting a girlfriend and then just, like, barricade myself with her in our apartment/house and then just do ‚Ä¶ nothing?

I often despise having surprise guests too.

I know that it sounds weird, but even though I like being alone in many parts of life, I still struggle with loneliness. Its one thing being with people in a massive overcrowded place, than being with one person (like a girlfriend) for the same amount of time, if that makes sense.

One of my sons is in university for environmental science and had to go on a research trip to Baja California for a few weeks that had him gone for Fathers Day.  We went out the weekend prior and had a well meaning, but awful dinner, due to the local college having graduation ceremonies the same evening. Everywhere was booked solid, so we had to compromise and the spot we could get in was terrible. 
We did have a nice conversation, and we enjoy each other‚Äôs company, so it wasn‚Äôt a total bust, just a terrible dining experience. 

My other son, however, didn‚Äôt even care enough to send a text yesterday, let alone a phone call, and god forbid, a small gift. 

He is in his early thirties, is well established in his career and I would classify him as being very successful in his career as a firefighter engineer. 

His birthday is later this month and I have already had two birthday gifts delivered to him and followed up with phone calls after I received delivery notices. His girl is throwing him a birthday party next week and two weeks ago he sent me a text with the birthday party invite so I can RSVP. 

All I received yesterday was a short ‚Äò Happy fathers day‚Äô text from their mother, whom I‚Äôve been divorced from for close to 30 years. 

When I discuss my disappointment with my peers, I‚Äôm told that holidays are for children, and I shouldn‚Äôt be upset, but the one day honoring Father‚Äôs, and I get snubbed. 

I don‚Äôt mean to sound like an ungrateful father, but due to financial situations, I‚Äôve had to move 3.5 hours away, and have been alone in a new city for the entire time, it‚Äôs been very difficult meeting anyone, and I‚Äôm very lonely.

Yet that door remains closed with the occasional person coming in to get their coats. That moment where your heart sinks because you hoped someone would see behind your fake smile.

3850,vgzb3j,_muddiest_,"I worry a lot that I'm the temporary friend. I worry that I'm the type of person that's only fun to have around for short periods of time. After a while, I find that most of my friendships just kind of fizzle out? I'm not really sure how to explain it. 

I'm in my 20s and I can honestly say that I have maybe one close friend? Even that friendship is a little strained as of late. Obviously though, quality over quantity. But I guess I would just like to have more people in my life. I'd love to have more close friends; to just have more people to care for and open up to. 

It doesn't help that when talking to people (especially online), I struggle a bit. I feel like I always open up way too fast. I worry that I'm being off-putting by being so excited. I always end up bringing everything to the table all at once, but then towards the end it just kind of fizzles out? 

I think I can come across kind of overwhelming at times too? I think my high energy can be a bit jarring at times for others. Which I understand, it just gets so lonely. 

The thing is, I think my biggest problem is maintaining friendships. I just become so anxious so quickly. I can be slow with responses sometimes, which I know is something I have to work on. I just worry that I'm annoying others a lot of the time. So instead of talking about these insecurities, I go quiet. 

I keep telling myself that I'll find my people one day; people that enjoy my company. I just want to be somebody's go-to person; I want to have that level of closeness in a friendship. And yeah, I might one day! But I know that in order to do that, I have to work on a lot of things first. 

So it got me wondering; is there anything I can do to change this? Are there other people out there dealing with this very same problem? If so! Hi hi! Maybe we can all work through it together like one big team?

Also it's kinda long and I'm sorry. I appreciate the read and would love to hear thoughts and maybe be a place to share and relate. This is very much my raw feelings and I sometimes feel I have no one to talk to about it. 



It breaks my heart when I have to re parent myself. When I have to be the one to pick up my pieces. I know I have people I could turn to but in a sense I feel like I can't. I just feel so alone. And it makes me so sad. I don't want to do this much longer. Something has to give. I need love. I need someone to love and be with me and care for me. I want to be someone's first choice. And I'm not. I don't want to miss out on that part of my life, but it isn't happening and I don't know how much longer I can take waiting. I don't know how to make peace with myself. I feel like I try and I try and nothing happens. I'm trying so hard to love myself and it's so hard. It's hard to do it all by myself. These last 9 or 10 days have made me really think. Cause hell I have nothing but time and nothing to do. This is my life. And yes it was nice to not have to worry about work and be able to just relax. But honestly besides going to work. This is it. I come home to be alone. I maybe talk to my sister and my cousins briefly along with my roommate and work friend but there is no one I just talk to or that talks to me. I'm no one's companion or priority. I want that and I want to give that back to someone. I feel like I have so much to give and nothing...just nothing. Bc when it's all said and done it's just me. And I don't want it to be just me. Bc me can't take it anymore. I want to be done. But I can't bc that ruins the people I love's lives so I stay here. Unhappy. Alone. I just don't understand it. Bc I feel that I am so deserving and should have the best. It's just so discouraging. The way the world is and how our lives are gonna change. What the future is gonna look like, it's scary. It worries me that I won't get my chance. My chance to experience what I've wanted. And it makes me angry. Bc so many people get to experience dating and partnership and love almost at an ease. And it isn't fair. I get jealous of the people around me. And I hate that. It makes me resent them and I know I shouldn't. They have done nothing wrong. But still I do. I get upset also bc I feel like no one can truly understand how I'm feeling or what I feel. My whole life has been this trauma of being overly attached to my mom then her leaving me and I feeling abandoned several times. Then ultimately when she decided to leave me forever. That and the other side of it is how I look and am treated bc of how I look. Being fat my whole life has not helped. It's made me miss out on alot of norms. I was never sought out for in my teenage years and I know that's affected me. It hurts feeling like you aren't good enough or wanted or desired. And if you are, those people get made fun of for it and then say nothing which again leaves me definitely thinking I'm not good enough. Or that there's something wrong with me. And that, that's what I've been trying so fucking hard on doing. I just don't expect the people in my life to get it. I'm 25 and I've never had a boyfriend. I never got to have any of that. And watching literally everyone around you get the one thing you want. Its devastating. And there is nothing that can be done about it. I get to just be unhappy and pretend to care and be the (my name) everyone loves but isn't sought after by others. Being the only single person in your friend circle and pretty much your whole family, it's hard. I have no one to turn to. No one to truly vent to. Bc it's all the same shit and I'm sorry but it's shit. I don't want to wait around. I'm fucking tired of hearing it will happen when I least expect it. Or that relationships aren't always as cracked up to be as they seem..that one is the best bc like then leave..no? Oh yeah bc it fucking miserable being alone. So don't give me that bullshit. I hate it bc I feel like I can't even talk to my bestfriend about this or tell her how i truly truly feel bc it could hurt her feelings. And none of it is her fault in any way. Bc i feel like she doesn't understand like I know she understands where I'm coming from and she's always supportive. But no one knows how painful it is to be so fucking lonely. I wish I could be sad and hate my fucking life and want to be done.. and still have a partner by my side. Someone to pick up the pieces if need be or take care of me when I can't. But I don't. It's just me. I feel all of that too and it's just me. And its hard. And I sometimes feel like I can't do it. That's the mean part. The part that would hurt her feeling bc again none of that is her fault. It's not her fault I'm jealous and have these feelings, which i feel mean about and I hate that.

3867,vh1cx0,kywas_,"Hi everyone. I think that writing here is such a desesperation of how lonely I feel, because I have to share everything through the internet in an anonimous way, so noneone can know who am I. 
Im 23 years old, living with my parents. I'm currently studying architecture, but my university stopped classes because of students demands. This means that Ive spent more time in my house that I would want to. In some way I feel as an introvert, but exploring the world by my own is such a beautiful plan. But now, I feel that being introvert is not by choice, is just what I have to deal with, since I have not many people arround me.
I'm not alone, I have a boyfriend and a few friends but everything feels very superficial, so I'm very lonely. Grewing up, I never learnt the social codes of how to play or how to develop yourself arround people. My father was very cold and he never was for me in my worst moments, I think I have that personality, because noneone counts with me. 
I ask myself why could this be, obviously is my personality but until now I havent been able to figure out what is it exactly. In some way im so scared of rejection that I just prefer waiting for the invitation. I learnt through my years that whenever I took 
initiative the plan went wrong or everyone says no. Thats mainly why I dont like celebrating by birthday, It just feels so sad everything and depressing.
Now it's winter and I barely have energy to do things. I started cleaning because of my anxiety. I avoid studying or doing whatever thing that could make me feel better, I just clean, trying to just control my enviroment because it's so depressing. I'm not poor, im not rich, I have a house, a bed and a lot of things. But I don't know how to explain the feeling inside this house.. Like I suffer because of my loneliness and I say to myself ""Maybe I could go on a walk and buy some coffee"" But I just don't have the energy to do so. I rather feel like absorbed by this house, it's very dark and messy and my grandparents die in here. I see how my family breaks everyday more, my mom usually cries because my father as I said is very cold, he only watches tv and when he speaks to me he is very mean. Today in the morning I cleaned the whole kitchen and finally I sat and made some tea. He came and saw my put the tea bag in the sink just to not drop it on the floor and get dirty again. He said to me, why do you do that? Are you mentally retarded? I wanted to cry, I just cleaned the whole kitchen and he barely noticed it, I just did one little thing in order to just keep it clean and just be chill, obviously later I was going to throw it in the trash. 
I see how he spends more time in a little cabin he is building out of town, I feel he gets annoyed by me, my mom and sister. Everyday they work until very late and I feel like when I was at school maybe I didn't notice those things, I was too distracted with activities and stuff, but now that I spent most of my day at my house, it feels very sad to see their dinamics.
Another thing is that before my grandfather died, I had to take care of him, I literally saw him die, and how he stopped eating and just agonize.
I always saw him with a little pitty, how lonely it was his last years, how he never wanted to go out, how he rejected his friends to do things, how I left home arround 8am and then at 7pm he was still doing the same things, alone.. It was so sad to see it and whenever I tried to encourage to do things he always said no to me. 
I feel like now I am him. I spent most of my days at home, alone, I talk to noneone, and the worst, I thought this was a choice I made, at the beggining, but now it feels like hell and Im so depressed to even do something about it.
I just want to cry, but i know my mom feels extremely guilty whenever I cry and my dad won't say anything to me.
In some way, I like how I am with my mom and sister, I feel like how I show myself to them is my true self and noneone have seen that, it's so hard to show it when you just push everyone. Ive thought ""If maybe people could see how I show myself to them, Im sure I could be a good friend"" But no, what I show to other people is whatever I try to do to fit in the puzzle. It's so heartbreaking to write this while I hear my mom cry, I just, don't know what to do, how to help this feels so toxic and I wish I had the money to be 540493409 kms away from here, but no, I could be miserable doing that too, I wouldn't be ok feeling that my mom is suffering with this man, and also I don't want my dad leaving alone, because he would be alone forever and that also breaks my heart. It's such a complicated situation and I just have to hold my tears so noneone sees me crying.",2022-06-21 01:28:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617983854,1,/r/lonely/comments/vh1cx0/im_feeling_overwhelmed/,,0,0,Im feeling overwhelmed

3916,vh5pz3,BoringPotatoSkin,"I‚Äôm taking a class at a local college, not really to learn, but because my Mom is worried that I‚Äôve cut myself off since I dropped out of school. She just wants me to meet some people my age. 

I do have one friend. I‚Äôve known him since we were in the first grade, and for all of elementary and middle school we only had each other. But he got into the advanced courses when we started high school and I didn‚Äôt. We could only really see each other on weekends and rarely at that. He has a life so he‚Äôs busy. Anyway we‚Äôve remained really good friends and have at least texted on a regular basis.

I started this class today. I was pretty excited as I hadn‚Äôt met anyone new since I dropped out of school, and I was eager to have some good experiences as a student too. I‚Äôm the only guy in the class and everyone else is staying in the dorms, so they already know each other pretty well. I ended up eating lunch alone and sitting in the corner away from everyone else laughing and having a good time. I just got all of the same feelings I got at school. The deep, crushing loneliness, and the anxiety stopping me from trying to talk to people. I just couldn‚Äôt do it. 

But at least I could text my friend. He‚Äôs always there to support me and I needed it. But he had just asked out a girl for the first time and was ecstatic that she had accepted. Of course I‚Äôm happy for him, so I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it by making him deal with my issues. I feel like I‚Äôve been left behind. My closest friend is in a happy relationship and I just left my bed for the first time in months and I couldn‚Äôt even effectively introduce myself to anyone. I feel pathetic. And even more pathetic that my selfishness is stopping me from being happy for someone I hold so dear.

The class is 2 weeks, 11 hours a day. I don‚Äôt know if I can make it. But I can‚Äôt let down the few people who still have hope for me. I feel like I‚Äôm caught between a rock, a hard place, a firing squad and a precipice of certain death. I‚Äôm 18 and the only person whose shown me affection in years is my own mother. I‚Äôm literally someone that only a mother could love. This just feels like the last nail in the coffin. Like if a speeding truck was barreling toward me, I don‚Äôt think I would move.

3918,vh5zi5,blank_name101,"Well I guess I‚Äôll just finally get this off my chest i keep this very deep down in my heart for obvious reason. It pretty long but if you want to read it go ahead.

I‚Äôm tired.

Well to get started i have to tell you about me and why it‚Äôs such a big deal for me. When people are born you don‚Äôt really remember much but the first thing i remember was walking with my sister but idk but also did know who she was and then images start flashing thru my head, it was like i was dreaming but i age pretty fast in my head. I was pretty confused on what i was doing most why me and then i just went with it you know.

Then boom i wake up and wonder where was everyone at like it‚Äôs the morning my mom was no where to be found and my sister wasn‚Äôt in the room. I went to check the kitchen and my sister was standing there with a knife at her neck. i was mostly confused but i saw her crying. I can remember even now her sayings to me ‚Äúnobody loves me‚Äù i just stood there wonder why and what i did wrong was i not good enough. I begged her to stop and i love her took sometime but she finally decided to stop. But i hated that she even thought about do it and sad. But I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. 

Then i started school but 1st grade don‚Äôt remember much, 2nd neither. 3rd grade is when everything change i was bullied a lot I don‚Äôt know why i guess i was weird but i never cared cause i was used to getting hurt from my mother. Honestly compare to my mom it was easy, my mother would slap me, hit me with the belt. Obviously I would cry but every time i would cry she would keep hitting until i stopped . Saying stuff like ‚Äú be man, men don‚Äôt cry‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a reason to cry.‚Äù My sister would even step in and take the beating for me sometimes. I would cry and hit myself until I wouldn‚Äôt cry so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to get hit so much. So when my bully tripped me or say something mean i won‚Äôt care.

But when one of the girl in my class told my sister i was confused like I didn‚Äôt think too much about it. But everyone was serious about this even my mom which confused me the most like she didn‚Äôt do that to me. So I decided to give them the son they wanted change myself. I would talk less, play less, cry less. But i bottle up my anger to them to the point where i feel like a different person was born. It was fine i was doing well.

Until 8th grade i had friends, good grade accept to private school for high school. Then my mom wanted to move again for the 5th time when i finally thought i was going to enjoy my life they just have to ruin it. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to move but ‚Äú you go where i go‚Äù all cause her husband cheated on her like, why move state tho. Before you say anything i was not shock about this like there was a lot of red flag before the marriage but she ignored them and said she‚Äôll change him. Yeah totally instead she fuck up my future plan and i got depressed i went to another school for 4 months until I randomly move to back where we were cause them got together.

That was fun, I don‚Äôt go to the high school i wanted and lost most of my friends and for nothing. That when i just stop caring, I skipped school and stay home looking at nothing. And i started getting a voice in my head pretty annoying, my mom found out and i got hit for it. But i just stood took the beating say something like ‚Äúare we done?‚Äù
And walked away. I would just stay home and listen to the shit in my head sometime i would cry or sleep. I obviously got therapy but i just wouldn‚Äôt care. I drop out and just do nothing I‚Äôll probably just end it if you get what I‚Äôm say. Most cause I‚Äôm tired or so i can get some peace and quiet for once. Or just cause im bored. But the only thing thats keeping me here is my sister. Honestly why put my here if you‚Äôre just going to fuck me over this much over and over again. I haven‚Äôt even gone to detail on how fuck my life is. It only gets worse the more i go thru it.

I‚Äôm tired of helping people, trying everything just for it fail repeatedly, try to be better just for people to still talk shit about me, pretending to be someone else, and just living .",2022-06-21 05:42:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655783927,7,/r/lonely/comments/vh5zi5/finally_telling_the_truth_about_myself/,,0,1,Finally telling the truth about myself

3928,vh71bq,Realistic_Ad4490,"Chances are you clicked on this because you understand everything within my head right now. You understand that the reason the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù sticks out to you so much is because of how much you‚Äôve been used, neglected, and taken advantage of to a point where you start to blame yourself. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù is our way of saying that we‚Äôre lost, that our chains have been pulled back and fourth until we no longer have our hope and confidence. 
Nicotine crawls beneath my skin as I write to a subreddit at 2:31am, head dried out, with a heart as fragile as glass. 

The reason we feel so alone when we genuinely aren‚Äôt is because no one will genuinely understand you. No one will genuinely know the real you. The way you see things, the way you see yourself. It‚Äôs good to remind yourself that none of that matters, but you can‚Äôt help but overthink at times. Demons now control the mind that was once so pure, and is now a dark, cold, and lonely mind.

3935,vh7nwm,burnedoutinlove,"The title says it all. The rest of my life is going well. I have a decent career, a home, supportive extended family, and good friends. I stay healthy and fit, no real mental or emotional issues. I even feel fine being single most of the time now. Yet at the same time I feel down that I just can't seem to find someone who's willing to make me a priority of sharing a life with.

The last guy (E) I was with was emotionally unavailable so even while dating he never made feel like I was his choice. I stayed with E for such a long time because he was better to me than the previous guy  (M) who started charming and ended up being a narcissist. Come to think of it E also started off being really charming, and because he was a nice guy I just kept trying to make it work. I wouldn't accept it when he got hot and cold. I thought if I could keep giving, eventually he'll come around. Well that never happened so it ended after nearly 10 years.

After that I was just so worn out from giving up so much of myself that I didn't care for relationships anymore. I thought it was too late to meet anyone that would be worth my time. I spent that energy finding myself again, finding ways to be happy alone, and then I met a new guy (J).

J taught me how to set healthy boundaries, encouraged me to be myself, showed me his vulnerable side, and we helped each other build confidence, set goals. It was absolutely amazing and I could actually see a future. Not only that, I thought he was worth it. What I wasn't willing to do for others, I was willing to do for him. It felt like I finally found what I was looking for...until he suddenly left me.

See, while being able to have this wonderful relationship, J had some unresolved issues from before he met me that got triggered when things were going too well. Ultimately he got spooked, went into shut down mode, no longer wanted anything to do with me. The last I heard, he went back to his ex with whom he had a less healthy relationship.

I'm just so tired of not being anybody's ""the one."" Half of my life's over and I have yet met anyone who values me enough or is in the right state of mind to commit to me. Despite me being totally ok with being single and no longer being willing to settle for a partner who's not right for me, it still hurts to see all my friends who have found love and are happy in their relationships.

I've been struggling a bit more lately after finding out that J was willing to abandon the great relationship we had for one that's unhealthy. Also, a few people I met while they were single have all found SO's in the recent past and even planning to get married now. Although I'm happy for them, they're exiting my life as well and it continues to emphasize the fact that they've found someone seemingly easily while I'm still here searching.

Anybody got something encouraging to say? I know it's probably cliche and I've probably heard it before, but I'm feeling really bummed right now and I'll take any form of comfort.",2022-06-21 07:34:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596773870,9,/r/lonely/comments/vh7nwm/im_so_tired_of_being_no_ones_first_choice_as_a/,,0,6,I'm so tired of being no one's first choice as a partner

Because everytime i look at someone like that all i want to do is just kill myself. Worse i don't even have enough courage to actually kill myself. I've tried that like 5 times in a month. I am a fucking coward.

You know what's even harder , when no one loves you yet you have soo much love you want to share with someone, 
but there is no one in front of you ,behind you or around you. You try to mingle but you float like a balloon 
when the rest of the world stays below. You just hope the wind takes you some place even if it leads you to the 
sun and you burst. Atleast now you can fall down and hope someone notices and picks you up, even if is just to throw you in garbage.  Now I feel better, back to reality.

3942,vh8u0z,39TrashGod,"I‚Äôm a 22yo straight guy who‚Äôs been single my whole life and am still a virgin. I‚Äôm not necessarily ashamed of it, I realize there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, but it‚Äôs not by choice. I‚Äôm a very sexual person but I don‚Äôt like to ‚Äúhit on‚Äù or ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù girls out of fear that I might make them uncomfortable and come off as a creep. But no girl has ever shown any interest in me either which is so demoralizing it‚Äôs almost driving me insane. I find myself looking long into the mirror wondering why no one wants me and then I hate myself for being so self-pitying. The sexual side of me has been bottled up and I‚Äôve been frustrated practically my whole life but on top of that I also, more than anything, just want to find a girlfriend whom I can have a serious relationship with full of love, care, comfort, and support. If given the option I would always take a relationship over a quick lay but at this point I‚Äôll just take whatever I can get. Yet, I can‚Äôt get either and it‚Äôs not for lack of personality or confidence, though I‚Äôm not one to flirt I consistently make those around me, including the women, laugh and smile and I often times engage in lengthy conversations with them. I honestly love to get onto a subject they‚Äôre passionate about and just listen to them as they get so lost in their ideas that they aren‚Äôt even making eye contact anymore and are just staring into space as they talk. That goes for everyone, I really admire people‚Äôs passion and it‚Äôs helped me strike up very memorable conversations out of the most insignificant relationships in my life. So I‚Äôm confident in my social skills and in being a likable and inviting person but no one seems to be interested in me in a romantic or sexual way.

I‚Äôve asked out six girls in my life, all between when I was 15 and 20 years old, and I was rejected every time in different fashions. Every day that goes by I think the pain can‚Äôt get worse but then the day goes by and then another day and another and then a full year and then two more and I‚Äôm still alone and struggling. So what am I doing wrong? Am I that ugly? I want that to be a joke but I can‚Äôt help but think it. It hasn‚Äôt always been awful, being alone has given me opportunities to learn and work on myself a lot but now I feel like I have nothing left to gain from this loneliness except meaningless torture. Especially now that I‚Äôm moved in with a couple of friends of mine which has ultimately been a very encouraging step forward in life but there‚Äôs one hang up. One of them has a girlfriend who visits constantly and I‚Äôm happy for him and totally support their relationship but it also serves as a constant reminder of how alone I am and I can‚Äôt help but get incredibly depressed when I see her buying stuff for him, how they love each other, and especially when I can hear them going at it in the next room nearly every night. I become almost paralyzed with depression just flooding into my psyche when I hear it to where I can‚Äôt focus on or enjoy what I‚Äôm doing because looming over me is that dread of proof that the thing I‚Äôve always wanted does exist and I just can‚Äôt partake in it because nobody wants me that way. I don‚Äôt want to feel bad at other people‚Äôs happiness but it‚Äôs hard when I can‚Äôt seem to achieve it for myself. And I genuinely believe a loving relationship is exactly what I need because while I know I‚Äôm still not perfect and I have issues other than just the loneliness those would be so much easier to live with if I had someone to hold my hand through it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and I really just need to learn to be happy alone but I‚Äôve been trying that for years and ironically, I don‚Äôt think I can do it alone, so what‚Äôs the point?

I don‚Äôt want to try and ‚Äúget‚Äù someone to like me or want me, I just want someone to like and want me, for who I am. I want someone who I can love and can love me back or someone who at least sees me as someone they‚Äôd like to mess around with. I just feel so unloved and unwanted and invisible despite my efforts to be the best person that I can be and though I‚Äôve tried I just can‚Äôt find a way to cope with it. Sometimes I feel like a narcissist who just wants people to see the value in me that I see in myself but everyone deserves love right? Maybe I‚Äôm not as self aware as I like to think I am and I actually deserve to feel this way. I try not to think that way but how can I be sure? If you‚Äôve managed to read this whole thing and can offer me any bit of help or advice please, I could really use it. I‚Äôve actively been searching for therapists but so far can‚Äôt find anything I could consistently afford. And thank you so much for taking the time to read my desperate pleas, I always feel like I‚Äôm being dramatic and over sharing so if you‚Äôve made it this far it really means a lot to me.",2022-06-21 08:57:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1563665686,18,/r/lonely/comments/vh8u0z/crippling_loneliness/,,0,4,Crippling Loneliness

I have never been in relationship with a woman before and I hate how I look. It's something I could improve on but I'm overweight for my age. Not obese but I'm super super insecure about myself. (it's mostly the fat stomach) that's it. But it looks so bad. I've been a chubby kid forever. Been fat shamed multiple times and I'm an introvert mostly. I didn't have any luck in secondary school (high school basically). Got friendzoned twice and I guess I think I can can be easily attached to people. 

Seeing people around me having better luck than me is something I hate to feel. I know I need to patient but I can't stop thinking about it. When you see how relationships are like nowadays. The cheating being normalised. People not committing to relationships is scary. On one hand I am scared to being in a relationship but at the same time I want one. 

Its not even about sex or anything. I don't think I get appreciated the way anyone would want and deserve and I feel like i won't have any luck with a woman. I feel like nowadays looks is valued a lot more than personality. At least with people my age and people I am around. 

Im scared to think that what if someone downright reject me purely because of looks. The thing is personality I'm not too worried about it. I'm basically that ""nice guy"" (at least I hope I am) that isn't really physically attractive or anything that gets sidelined most of the time. I tend to be very awkward and quiet if I basically don't know you or I am not too close with you. 

I am going to be going university this year and I hope I get some luck. A girl that I know loves me for who I am. Obviously not going to university JUST to get a girl but it's usually where you will find someone. 

I just want to be more confident and have a stable intimate relationship with a girl that would make me happy to live. 

In a world of hookups I just want a simple old school love that I feel like it's too much to ask with how things are going rn. I mean I believe in marriage and all and I would definitely see myself being in that position when I'm older. It's just that you need a woman with you for that to happen üòÇ

Anyways what I wanted from this post is advice and basically. Do woman really care about looks? Even if you are fat asf and look horrible. I just wanna know if ONLY having a good personality is enough?

I don‚Äôt want to die, it just hurts to much to live.
The loneliness is snuffing out any ambitions I once had. Living for myself just won‚Äôt cut it any longer. I always thought I was a strong person, but I was wrong. I can only be strong for someone else, it‚Äôs only when someone that I truly love is in my mind that is when I am strong. It‚Äôs too bad I no longer have anyone like that. All I have left is me and I hate me. I don‚Äôt even know who this so called me is. Is he my thoughts, feelings, or soul. Is he all three. Am I more than these things, am I more than me? If so than who am I and why am I. Why do I wear this fake smile? To keep people from worrying? No I‚Äôm much to selfish for that. I think I wear it to hide from myself in a way, as if the act of faking it will make it so. I find myself hurting more and more everyday, yearning for someone to truly love me again but I think I‚Äôm running out of time. What happens when I can‚Äôt fight me any longer. Will I die, is that bad? I imagine death as an endless nothingness but not nothing in the way we tend to think about nothing. I mean the kind of nothing you experience before you are born, and that kind of nothing is almost comforting. I don‚Äôt think I was distraught or lonely before I was born. I just wasn‚Äôt. Is that a bad thing? What is the point of life? You live to die and if you didn‚Äôt die did you ever live? These questions burn holes in my mind. I don‚Äôt think there is a point, whoever decided there was one? I think the reason religion exists is because the fear of death exists. Is it not foolish to fear something as inevitable as death? And if life is a great miracle why does it hurt so much? Why is mere existence so painful and hollow. Life is hard so death must be easy right? What if I am wrong and dying leads to more suffering, such as spending eternity in hell. But if the fear of spending eternity in torment is my only reason to live then what is left? A meaningless painful life and a meaningless unending torment. If god is real why am I this way? Why does he supposedly speak to people around me but seems to glance right over my suffering? Does he not care? I don‚Äôt think god is real and if he is he is a silent observer. I‚Äôm tired often and I wonder if that‚Äôs because sleep is kin to death. If I‚Äôd rather be asleep than awake in turn would I rather be dead than alive? I‚Äôm going to sleep now I guess to practice for the end I feel is so close.",2022-06-21 11:18:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604529728,0,/r/lonely/comments/vhaz1i/loneliness/,,0,0,Loneliness
3951,vhb6y1,OneEyedcreep,"I have been lonely for as long as I can remember. But only recently I have realised that I was lonely and what it feels like to be discarded or disregarded.....

The loneliness is driving me insane to the point that I cannot function properly. Whenever I see people happy and chatting in a group or a couple I am flooded with many emotions and negative thoughts. I have contemplated committing suicide many times. My life has been riddled with hurdles and downfalls to the point I want to just give up and die. No one to talk about it openly and no one to look forward to meeting to. I seem to have a recurring pattern of befriending shit people who end up using me and throwing me away when done. I never asked for any of this. Of course, I am no saint or an 'all good' person too but I have seen worse. I never had a genuine friend(s) yet I am surrounded by a lot of people. 

Having a relationship now seems too far of a stretch. I just long for someone to hug me one day and reassure me that the pain will go away now, that sleepless nights filled with tears are long gone and it's all okay now. Seeing my socials and people around me hooking up and having relationships gives me physical pain now. I guess I am a loner now. I tried to live the 'loner' life but it worsened my condition. The only people that I am happy and genuine with are my family but I wonder how long that will it last. Due to my current situation, I have to live away from them. To the people who relate to whatever I have written above, seek help and counselling. I did and it worked for a while but may work for you better than it did for me. The only reason I am breathing is the memory of my family and a gentle, sweet, kind and caring voice inside my head who I like to pretend is my imaginary girlfriend.

3952,vhb8ne,Kuunkulta,"I was supposed to have a date today. I have awesome girlfriend (lesbians), but it's long distance for now and we only get rare few moments together. Was supposed to be one of those moments. But she got ill. And I'm very worried about her. But I've been totally in pieces over this, and it's made me realize how alone I really am. 

I have two friends, they're not very social. I lost all my gaming buddies when I quit World of Warcraft, and later my new Overwatch buddies when I transitioned (I'm a trans woman). I lost my disc golf buddies soon after my transition as well. I lost a loose community when I stopped writing my blog, among few others. And the pandemic made end of even the support group I occasionally went to. Restrictions have been lifted but the group is still off. My remaining friends and I used to have a group chat with two more people. One of those two we kicked out as it became obvious she didn't share common values, and exhibited some predatory behavior towards much younger women in vulnerable position. The second one dropped out after she got paranoid about everything, global conspiracies and all that. 

And I'm realizing that group is what I miss the most. It was a small community and support group in one. Now I have none of that. Where the hell would I even start to get something like that back? The friends I have left are a couple and they dropped all their own friends and now I'm their only friend, but even still they're not very social. We talk and meet rarely. So it's not something to start building a new group on top of... I miss having a place to vent about life and having real support, and giving that back as well. I miss the giving at least equally if not more so, as I enjoy helping others immensely.

Friends, family, counsellors, strangers. Everyone does it!

My mum and my dad, if I share with them some thought or feeling I have, their response will feel very inadequate or unrelated.

My chiropractor will ask me questions about what has happened to me in between our sessions. But she's asking in a close-ended way, to check against her internal check-list. If I begin describing my symptoms in detail she gets restless. If I ask her questions she goes on long-winded explanations which aren't relevant to me.

My brother will rant at me about some thoughts or feelings he has, and seeks no interest in my thoughts or feelings about what he's saying. He gets upset if my opinions differ from his.

So after she walked over to us I slowly creeped away from the situation, and as I was creeping away I heard the last thing I‚Äôd ever want to hear ‚Äúhe has a crush on you‚Äù they both said. And they kept on saying over and over and as my crush was walking over to talk to me I got embarrassed and scared and ran away even if she was trying to talk. But later that night it finally kicked in of what happened and I felt mad of what my ‚Äúfriends had done‚Äù and  it just made me feel like I‚Äôll die alone and be labelled as a coward that no one likes. And it sent me into a further depression and sometime I‚Äôm scared to leave my house just to go on a walk because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll bump into her and I just feel terrible for running away from her I still fell like a dick head.

3974,vhg26x,DuckDuckingDammit,"‚Ä¶.And I‚Äôm not attending. 

I feel a weird mix of apathy and relief I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it. High School was the most isolating time in my life where I was truly alone and I‚Äôve emotionally and mentally checked out since junior year and I made my decision not to attend graduation long ago.

I don‚Äôt feel much. I don‚Äôt really feel anything right here and now. Not attending was the right thing for me and good for everyone that‚Äôs going but I feel I should be feeling something right? I mean I‚Äôm a little relieved since now I can say school is like OFFICIALLY over now. And it‚Äôs a little disappointing but oh well. I know some family members are disappointed and I‚Äôll have to talk to them soon which sucks but I‚Äôve made my choice and I‚Äôm sticking with it.

Why would I want to celebrate high school anyway? I made no friends, memories, or developed any hobbies or interests. And I‚Äôve heard a lot about how ‚ÄúGrAdUaTiOn iS aBoUt ThE pArEnTs!‚Äù But I completely disagree. It‚Äôs about me and I refuse to listen to that bullshit. My parents didnt do all my work for me, enroll me in AP classes, Dual Enrollment classes, get me a job, an internship, or contributed in any way to me passing high school. I put in the work because I want to go to college and get out of this hellhole. They struggled in life I won‚Äôt deny that but I don‚Äôt owe them going to a celebration I don‚Äôt want to be a part of. That‚Äôs all graduation is. A celebration. But I can celebrate in my own way.

I just can‚Äôt imagine what it would be like for me if I chose to go today. In an auditorium with kids I never formed a bond with or made memories with. Seeing them smiling and talking with their friends and family. Enjoying hair big day. While I would just be there speaking to no one while my dad takes awkward pictures of me pretend to be so so happy when I‚Äôm reality I just want to go home and block out high school completely and move on. Oddly enough I‚Äôm more comfortable here on my couch scrolling Reddit at 11am then being there. I mean I‚Äôm alone here but comfortable which does beat feeling lonely in a crowd. Especially at something as big as graduation. Sounds like torture to me.

If you read this far thank you just needed to get these thoughts out somewhere. But I guess its a wrap high shook really is over. It‚Äôs been fun‚Ä¶actually no it‚Äôs been quite awful but whatever. I look forward to throwing away all my notebooks, dumping all my school sweaters in the trash for the flies to feast on, and getting my diploma in the mail and letting it collect dust under my bed until it gets lost in the moving process.

TLDR - Graduation is today, am not attending because high school sucked for me due to loneliness and isolation, am feeling a lot of weird emotions and having lots of thoughts. But in the end I dont care because screw this point in my life.",2022-06-21 15:33:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1563858606,2,/r/lonely/comments/vhg26x/so_its_my_high_school_graduation_today_tldr_at/,,0,1,So it‚Äôs my high school graduation today!

So I did all the good stuff, ate healthy, did the chores, I was more thankful for what I have, said please and thank you, greeted people on the streets even when they didn't greet me back, worked hard on my hobby/dream job project, been a vegetarian for years, even worked out for like three weeks.

What do I get? My anxiety is stronger, I lost contact with my family after promising to visit my mum on her birthday then not showing up because I can't stand talking to my aunts an uncles and grandparents anymore ,all they're interested in is how I'm doing in uni and why I don't have a ""proper"" job yet (I do part time jobs whenever I need money, but as soon as I have enough to do without for a year or so, I quit),then they always let me know how much better my fucking brother is (I don't hate him but boy did they spoil him), then they talk hours about who's sick and who died and then they leave. Fuck no, I'm so sick of going through that. As if that wasn't enough, I'm getting nightmares every other day for like two weeks now. It's like tossing a coin whether you do a horror movie marathon instead of sleeping, every time before you go to bed. I also have a couple warts on my face and I noticed they've become like 5 more over the past months.

I feel like they're part of the reason why I'm still a virgin, turning 24 this summer. And to top it off I've gotten sick the last days so that I couldn't even work on my project, the only thing that really gives me a sense of belonging.

4114,vhxu81,sakata_gintoki_96,"I (26F) fear that I will live the rest of my life alone. I'm average height and a bit overweight- I have never had a romantic experience in my life. I've never been looked at twice and it's honestly depressing. I have two older sisters- both of them are married and have started their own families, and they are both way more attractive than I am. Basically, I got the brains and my sisters got the beauty, charm, and everything else that is desirable. I sometimes go to bars with my sisters in attempt to meet people, but anyone that approaches us will only speak to my sisters- my prescence is never acknowledged.. I'm quite used to this... Since they are married they always respectfully decline and the guy will usually walk away without even looking in my direction. It happens ALL. THE. TIME. This type of thing even happens when my mother is involved. My sisters, my mom, and I are all very close and we sometimes will go out somewhere and men will approach them and speak to my sisters and my mother while I sit right in the middle of the group and will still be overlooked. I'm not asking to be swept off my feet by some strange man I just met, but you can at least acknowledge my existence, right? Apparently not. It's just quite disheartening and discouraging because when I bring this up to my sisters or my mom- they're always annoyed or try to brush off my claim. I believe they think I'm fishing for compliments from them.. which I am not. I feel like they know this happens, but they don't have the heart to tell me the truth. Events from our last outing kind of confirmed my suspicions. Last week, we went out to a restaurant and I was telling my sisters and my mom about an upcoming trip I was taking and they asked me who I was going with and I jokingly said, ""my boyfriend,"" and they just looked at each other and laughed in my face.. like, loudly laughing- like it was the most absurd thing they had ever heard. (I was actually going with a couple friends, but yea..). I already have a complex about the whole ""never had any type of romantic experience"" thing, and them laughing just kind of confirmed what they really think- that I will never have a romantic relationship.

Anyone on tv or movies when asked ‚Äúwhat matters most‚Äù to them is expected to say family, and if they don‚Äôt then they‚Äôre seen as shallow. Love and companionship is seen as the one thing somebody needs to get by.

Well I can‚Äôt fuckin have that. I guess I won‚Äôt rule it out for all time, but for now at least I‚Äôm utterly disqualified from romance. Shit luck when I started dipping my toes in the water and the corrosion to my self esteem that brought has left me completely hating myself. Nobody ‚Äî no fucking body ‚Äî wants to be with someone who hates themselves like I do. I‚Äôm fucked up in other ways and must be horribly ugly to boot, but the self esteem shit alone is enough to take me out. So yeah, I could find somebody, technically. It would just take a miracle; either a miraculous rejuvenation of my mind back to at least a semi-operable state, or a miraculously stupid person to find some worth in me and decide to stick with the fucked up fixer upper I am instead of getting a ready-to-go model.

So yeah, what am I supposed to find so enjoyable about life that I just can‚Äôt fucking wait to open my eyes? I enjoy things, sure. I like Pok√©mon and music and playing guitar and watching YouTube. But none of that is enough to make me wanna slog through all the fucking bullshit like school and medical appointments and finding an apartment and making sure I have insurance and cooking and not getting too fat and having to watch my hair fall out and my body start to degrade while my mind is trapped inside it. I can‚Äôt fucking stand it here, I‚Äôm not built for this, and no amount of distractionary pleasures is gonna make that change. In all honesty, I‚Äôm not even sure something ‚Äúdeep‚Äù or ‚Äúprofound‚Äù like having an SO would help me like society tells me it will.

I figured i would just continue writing, the rant somehow helps and i got a few reactions and i don‚Äôt know. Thought today id write a bit more about my childhood and growing up quite isolated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**God.**

As a Jehova‚Äôs witness all i would hear growing up was ‚Äúthe end is neigh‚Äù repeated over and over again, i was not to be ‚Äùpart of the world‚Äù friendships with people that aren‚Äôt witnesses is and was actively discouraged, i didnt go on school trips, birthday‚Äôs, christmas celebrations or anything else for that matter. And as a single child this meant that i grew up completely isolated, though still going to school but as you are thought to isolate yourself even when surrounded by people it didn‚Äôt do me much good. God was to be put on the first place always, something bad happened ? Your fault, something good happened ? Blessing from god.   


**Misguided.**

I was made (I didn‚Äôt know this was possible) to hate people other then our ‚Äúbrothers and sisters in christ‚Äù some of these misguided things :   


* Homosexuality = bad
* Sex = very bad
* Education = uneccasary
* Other religions = misguided
* Other views of the world = inspired by satan
* The world - About to burn 

&amp;#x200B;

**Abuse.**

As a young one, I couldn‚Äôt disagree or not go to gatherings or church meetings so you will. But as a child sitting there for two hours in silence just wasn‚Äôt going to work, so i would make noise, I couldn‚Äôt pay attention to 2 hours of drilling on about how bad the world was and how happy we should be.   


So i would draw, write, make noise, you know, kids stuff. As we would always sit front line in the meetings i would then subsequently to my behaviour get dragged to a smaller room in the back, dragged along on average 200/300 people. In the back my dad would Spank me, i would obviously scream louder, and then i would stop and we would go back and all is well that ends well.. in their opinion, and since everyone seemed to be fine with it, what was i going to do about it ?   


This went on for years, my dad was a very aggressive man, lots of fighting and shouting. Until I physically became to big to be bullied around. My mother was complacent and just went along with it. Not out of fear but out of a misguided sense of ‚Äúthis is good‚Äù.   


**Moving.**

After moving halfway around the globe with my parents (this was their choice, i was a minor so no chance for me to get away) i went and worked and lived with my aunt. This was after failing school in an unspecified south american country. My aunt was a very sweet woman and i was finally awarded some freedom, as soon as i turned 19 i moved back to the country i came from And left my parents behind. They would soon follow back but i no longer had to live with them and went to my grandmothers.   


**In the next episode :**   
From here on i would go on to be part of ‚Äúthe world‚Äù and society. A lot of school, drinking, depression, a child, attempted larceny and more ensued.   


p.s As i write this, i notice that this writing down and sending it into the void that is the internet I find place for reflection, it helps. Again i thank whomever find and took the time to read to this point, and please do leave a reaction, ask questions or whatever you so please.

4140,vi22js,Reasonable-Month401,"It's quite easy for people to say that one can spend their life alone. But it is very difficult. When one enters their home, finding it empty and without people who could disturb them. This idea sounds really good and very tempting. But there is a time when it hits you very hard. The feeling that there is no one to talk to, there is no one who is expecting you to return hits very hard. When you are all alone and there is just emptiness, it rips apart one's heart. People might show that they are very strong and nothing affects them, but even the loveliest moon cries in the night when there is no one to talk to. Though the moon is waited for by a lot of people on earth so that they can show their love to their loved ones, nobody shows love to the moon.

People who are alone in their lives are usually the ones that light up the world of others. But just like the farthest stars, they are burning inside. They do have the light for others but don't have anything for themselves. But the funniest thing is that one should not hope this fire to die out. Because that causes the death of the sun. The sun might turn into a  white dwarf or a supergiant. But the end in both the scenes is very dangerous. The blast that comes out of these incidents is what rattles the world around that star.

4148,vi3as8,Simple_Equivalent_10,"This'll probably sound like incoherent ramblings but oh well. I'm 17, almost 18, male. All I do everyday is wake up, shower, maybe play on my Xbox, maybe eat, and go back to bed. It's been like this ever since summer break started. I have no friends or anything of that sort. I sometimes play with my cousins but I can't stand them. My family ignores me unless I'm of use. Everyday, the temptation of ending it all is starting to feel more and more like an escape. It's not like anyone will miss me. Even in school I sucked at making friends. I live in a mostly ""white area"" and me with my background and my parents being immigrants, kids just saw me as a weird brown kid who couldn't really speak English well. Even after I learned English and became better at it than most of my peers, they still saw me as an outsider. Even with the few friends I made, they'd eventually stopped liking me because they thought I don't care or like them because I never went to their birthdays and such, which wasn't true, it was because of my parents and always telling me that I shouldn't really trust the ""white folks"" and such and forbidding me to go anywhere with them unless it's in a school setting. If they didn't like that area then why didn't they move.

4151,vi46mc,m8rissaaaa,"
me and my boyfriend broke up yesterday over something stupid. my friends on discord were telling me it's racist that he's mexcian and say the n word which i didn't know was racist. So i went to go confront him about. now know; i didn't know how to adress this conversation because I've never had this problem before. I went off on him and said things the wrong way- i didn't know whaf i was doing. I said ""i don't support racist stuff and you're no better than a white person if you sav it
to friends and ppl who piss you off then"". This made him super upset and that's when he wanted to break up with me. I also said some other things like ""if you don't stop saying the n word, im leaving"" I know i shouldn't have said that and i truly fucked up. me and him have only had 3 major arguments within our entire relationship. The other 2 were about him always being on video games. 

Here's what I said to my friend: but there's also this big argument we would always have about the video games, idk if i was being to needy but it was bc i wanted to have like have one on one conversations with him without the video games or movies we used to do. alot of things got between us since we both game, watch anime and spend our time alone and i started getting sick of it- i wanted to be closer to him but i didn't know how- i could never come up with anything to talk about with him, i never had any plans and it would led to us having small arguments. I understand he wants to spend time with his friends and play video games with them but i also want to feel wanted while he does all of it ig i was being to pushy with it."" We would also call alot almost everyday and do our own things on call without actually doing things together but i always wanted to do things with him. 

i fucked up really really badly and im truly sorry. He won't talk this over with me or anything, i can't get any answers and i feel like everything is my fault.

4199,vic40e,MurcManB,"Twenty-two years ago I lost my best friend to suicide.  He was more like a brother to me (he lived at my house).  Though I have a wife and kids nothing really fills out that hole where he is supposed to be.  My sense of adventure is gone and I just know I am missing out on life.  I guess I should be more grateful for the things I do have but it doesn't stop me from feeling like I have no one to turn to.  


I have tried making friends but lately that has been tough.  After my loss it was hard to trust guys and it has always been easier to be friends with women.  I guess it is because of the trauma and for some reason I have it in my head a male friend would let me down.  My wife knows I am better friends with women and understands but even with that it is tough to make friends these days. It gets rather lonely having no one to share with.  I mean I have my wife but you know somethings you just don't talk about.  Does anyone know what I can do just to feel normal?  


For anyone younger reading this I would just like to add please don't hurt yourselves.  It may seem like no one cares but trust me they do and if you do you are just making more lonely people.  Also there are things for you to look forward to believe it or not.  Though I am terribly lonely there are bright spots and days I was glad I was here.

4248,vikcbr,SceptreOfLeon,"So recently ive really been annoyed with my friends and their lack of communication with me. Whenever we meet up its only to go out drinking and when ever that happens its me who has to make the inital contact to see who is around. (We only go drinking because my friends have no other hobbies and its honestly my only outing)  Last weekend really annoyed me because i asked on the saturday morning was anyone around and no one relpied untill one of my friends replied around 7 that night to say he wasnt and then right after he replied the rest of them did with the same answer, meanwhile all of these friends have no issue responding to messages about stupid things like love Island or other trival matters to my other friends in the chat.  One example of how why i am so annoyed recently is a friend of mine who dissapered for 2 years with a girl he was seeing, (ie spending all his time with her) broke up with this girl and one of my close friends has been messaging him and being all buddy buddy with him yet i have been there the whole time and he just ignores my plans i try to make.

I feel like I have wasted years with these frineds who do nothing, for instance im into photography, cars and gaming, and i have no frinds to share these hobbies with. Everything I do i do on my own and for years I though it was because me being soicialy awkward but I feel its because I have no connection to any of my friends. What makes matters worse is Im getting older (28) and Im afraid that if i drop these frinds and try find new ones and fail i will have no social life and in turn not find someone to date, marry have kids with and ill live alone forever. 

Should I drop these frinds ?

4254,viksap,lotusflower40,"I am married, have 2 kids. One is 16 and not at all a troubled teenager. One is 4, hence, the never alone part. I am not depressed right now, although, I was depressed for many years. When those dark clouds where above me, I was disposed of by so many ‚Äúfriends ‚Äú and even by my husband. When I was no longer a fun time, it was lights out‚Ä¶ end of the party‚Ä¶ end of the road for these relationships‚Ä¶
I am soon to be 40, and it has taken a lot of self love, some therapy and self healing to be where I am today. I have a good sense of who I am as a person. I am comfortable with being alone, as a matter of fact, I enjoy being alone sometimes, but rarely get the break I need to have that. 
My husband is a good person, although in the past, he has cheated on me in the most humiliating kind of way. I chose to forgive, and I gave us a chance to rebuild our relationship. As I rediscovered myself, so did he. He re discovered me, we have never been better as a couple. But forgiving doesn‚Äôt mean you no longer have triggers. It doesn‚Äôt mean that certain situations make you uncomfortable and bring you back to what has happened. I have worked hard on not going back to the past on our arguments, I have never brought his infidelity into an argument. For all I know, he does regret his actions and is taking steps to being a better person. Or rather, to act in more skillful ways. 
However, I can‚Äôt open up to him, I can‚Äôt feel sad around him, especially if my sadness is related to a trigger that reminds me of the past. He immediately takes a defensive stance and it‚Äôs no longer about me and how I‚Äôm feeling, it becomes about him ‚Ä¶ so, I can‚Äôt be vulnerable, I can‚Äôt open up‚Ä¶ I have to constantly wear this mask‚Ä¶ because at the first sign of sadness, he immediately goes back to the time I was depressed and he absolutely hates, loathes that ‚Äúme‚Äù. 
I have no friends, today I decided to cut from my life the last ‚Äúfriend‚Äù left . She like many others, became a toxic presence. Someone who is always ready to take, who is never open to meeting me halfway. Getting together has to always be at her house, in the last year and a half, she came to my house 2x. Both times for a party‚Ä¶ I, on the other hand, have been to her house countless times‚Ä¶ Today she texted me saying she was going to a concert, 20 min away from my house, and when I asked her why she didn‚Äôt let me know about , since she knows I would have loved to go, she says: ‚Äú I forgot about you‚Äù. So, farewell my old friend. I wish you well, but can no longer have you in my life.

4268,vimha0,CompetitionLittle147,"I feel sad tonight. Always the same reason why too. My posts here are like a hundred percent loneliness. Anyway. I know life is all about living and learning from mistakes and well everything especially with people and people will come and go in our lives no matter what but even so I still feel very sad, depressed and anxious about it. Doesn't change how I feel and how it and the loneliness never ends. Whenever I begin to form a new promising friendship and a nice reciprocal connection it makes me happy, maybe too much and it ends up badly, every damn time and it's always my own fault. I don't know living and learning from every experience in every relationship with others is good in all except for when I repeat it, so frustrating. I'd rather just be able to maintain long term close friendships and actually have the skill to form them and keep them. I work so hard at it probably too hard honestly I have no doubt my desperate clingy soul shows. I'd just like to skip the mistakes, learning and rejection which is sometimes ill perceived from low self esteem and anxiety and all that other fun stuff which then turns into a self fulfilling prophecy and the deep loneliness, sadness, regret, and the damn mistakes continue, just skip all that and be happy again and stay that way.  Idk I enjoy having good friends and I'm sad I can't make them work out. It's like a curse I can't break free from. I feel extra sad lately cause I just lost yet another nice friend from my false perceived rejection, anxiety and low self esteem and I screwed it up badly and there Is absolutely nothing I can do to fix it at this point except to learn from it and let it go which is so hard for me to do, I hate letting people go especially when it was my fault they left in the first place, but unfortunately it is the only choice I have left and the cycle will just continue again with someone else until the end of time.  Perhaps forgive myself too, the hardest part, if it is even possible to do so.  I'm trying very hard to not ruminate on it or I'll just cry and cry. Had I been able to not get so damn anxious and let my low self esteem trick me, none of this would have happened in the first place and I'd still have my friend who I now miss terribly. I miss that happiness,  having a friend to talk to and laugh with, make me smile, and actually care about my daily existence and make my days better. Those type of connections are so rare and special,  such a blessing to have, and I always screw them up, makes me so sad and just wishing I could turn back time and not mess things up with ppl I care about and just get all these friendships back and keep the rare new ones if lucky enough to make but I always push people away, always my own fault too, all that guilt,  regret, and sorrow to follow.  Damn this toxic cycle. The self loathing never ends. I just wanna be happy.  I envy the lucky people who can form and maintain their close friends. I'd give anything for that, I don't know if those people even know how lucky they are to have that. I hate only having short term friendships where I always screw them up with my damn low self esteem,  anxiety and depression, and the loneliness that gets In the way of em in the first place. I just feel sad tonight and really bummed and disappointed And mad at myself for losing yet another nice friend and that brief happiness I still couldn't maintain. Sigh.

4274,vin8il,Tripwire86,"TL/DR: Married, but am strongly attracted to a friend. No longer in love with my wife, but don't know what to do.

I'm 35/m, married but separated. We have a 10 mo old, been married for 6 years. At first everything was okay. Shortly after we goot toogether I started to notice her convos with her friends were being hidden from me. Nudes being sent, etc. I even destroyed a laptop i bought for her by putting my fist through the screen. Fast forward a few months, I began to notice she was putting on a mask when we would go to church.

We had a bumpy road a while back. She had a surgery that severely strained our income and ended being evicted. We split across country to start fresh in AZ where my parents live. I soon learned that was a mistake. My parents nearly divorced because of the differences with the wife.

We left on as best terms I could negotiate and ended up in Florida with her folks. Been here for going on 4 years, met some good people and some bad ones. I had a falling out with her family which nearly landed me in jail. I lost my job as a result. We managed to bounce back, but I've had enough if the lies, drama, and lack of humility I was witnessing in my wife. This came to fruition in February. Wife is at her mom's with the baby and is trying her damnedest to turn herself around.

A couple months ago, a mutual friend of ours plead for my help when dealing with a bad divorce. It had been revealed she has had feelings for me since we met, but i never caught on. We'll refer to this friend had T. T and I let our emotions spill that night and we began to talk daily. Her divorce was finalized earlier this month and somethings changed. We had agreed not to act on anything since it was too soon and I'm still married.

I have every intention of being there for my daughter, even if her mom and i split. And wife knows this. T has reverted back to her long hidden rebellious activities of sleeping around and leaving guys she begins ti feel any attachment to to protect herself. We've established it is a phase but there's no telling how long it will last.

T knows the gravity and genuine nature of how I feel about her and is content on not hurting me by acting on those feelings. We still speak daily. She's always known how to read me, even when I don't say anything. Something my wife could never do.

I'm asking you all for advice, not judgement. 

What should I do? I feel a strong bond with T and don't want to spoil anything we currently have as friends.",2022-06-23 03:27:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1360302880,1,/r/lonely/comments/vin8il/broken_and_lost/,,0,1,Broken and Lost

4285,vio0r8,josephl1995,"College senior. Have had my job lined up in my hometown for long enough that its the reason I went to college. Which mind you is an hour away. This is the first summer of my life I've experienced this. 

I've had about 5 friends here since kindergarten. All of them are in different states. Next 5 less close friends. All gone aswell. My siblings, gone. Very close cousins of same age group, gone. It makes no sense. All my friends from ""home"" and family either moved out to work or stayed at school for the summer for the first time. Yet all my friends from school except 1 went home for the summer.. Girlfriend went home and never get to see her because we work so much so far away. 

Holy fucking shit man. I've had some dark depressing years in my life but this tops them all. I have always been very, very social and go out even on weekdays after working 10 hours and knowing I have to be up at 5 am. Used to fish a ton with my buddies after work. Now I just go to the gym when I get home then lay in bed. I know it's temporary pain but Holy crap it's hell. I dont do social media or phones much and I hate texting and calling so ""long distance relationships"" are just essentially no relationship at all. Feel like I've lost my entire social and love world and feel trapped by having a girlfriend I can barely communicate with or see. I really like her but I need some social aspect of my life and a woman I could actually be with right now would be so nice. 

How do yall cope with this? I know I'm strong and I'm fine but I just can't eat due to no appetite and I burn so many calories at work. I am ""fit"" but I have no weight to loose and I've been trying to gain it for years with very very hard earned and minimal success. It's just so depressing and disheartening. 

Not sure if anyone will read this or care but I just needed a quick vent.",2022-06-23 04:09:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654659464,1,/r/lonely/comments/vio0r8/first_time_truly_experiencing_loneliness/,,0,0,First time truly experiencing loneliness...
4286,vio3dc,QuiverinPumpernickel,"Have been married for over 5 years now, together for 10.  Things were great or at least I thought so.  Felt like he was there for me although most times I was there for him when it came to normal everyday adult duties which he was never openly thankful for.  I get the groceries, bills, clean, I'll be cleaning up for his D&amp;D group tomorrow as usual since he works before then.  Not sure why it wouldn't occur to him that he could clean the prior day after work.  I'm expected to after I work sometimes for his friends.  He has ADHD so this stops his motivation to help unless asked.  At least that's what I have gathered.

He has a whole group of friends that come over every Friday in our very tiny apartment.  I'm not in this group nor was I invited.  Also, wouldn't feel comfortable with the people in it but they are kind to me when they come over.  I sit in the backroom while they play and most of the time I can't find anything to do so I load up on pills to sleep through it.  This is every Friday.

Whenever I bring up something to him he can't handle it.  Instead of looking at my concern in any way, he turns to self hatred.  Even with the smallest things.  And we barely already talk normally so it's not often that things are brought up.  When they are it's something that we need to discuss before it poisons our relationship because I'm hurting or he's hurting.  His response is usually ""I'm a piece of shit"", ""I should die"" ""Look what I do to us I'm worthless"". Then he sometimes self harms himself with lighters or hits himself. Then I assure him that he's a good person, has friends, he's funny, quirky, I appreciate him and etc.  When I cry from feeling hurt, over half the time I don't get any warmth, I'm left to sit in my sorrows and spiral with my worries.  While he thinks about himself. 

I am left feeling so alone, even more alone than when I lived by myself.  I suppose I had friends then but still it's way more intense.

I have been trying to make friends but it's hard with my social anxiety, PTSD, I don't know when it's time for me to leave someone's house and idk how to entertain anyone at mine.  It also makes me uncomfortable having people here but I want my husband to have people and to be happy with what he loves.   I'm also afraid to drive.  

The friends I do make are usually big triggers to my anxiety and they don't always seem like safe people.  There's a girl that would love to be my friend but she has BPD and has gaslighted me at work a couple times.  Sometimes I'm tempted to bring her into my life just because I feel so alone and she is so weird so she gets me. She's also very involved in some heavy drugs and is a hypersexual.  I'm going to try my best to stand clear for now but she would listen to me more than my husband would.  It's like my husband isn't equipped to deal with large emotions or conflict.

Idk sometimes I think about getting VR chat but I can't afford the equipment and my computer sucks.  We're about to be tight on money too since he got a job that pays less because Amazon was ducking him up mentally.

I also don't have family to go to. My mother is a narcissist and my dad is in fully controlled by her.  She even looks at his phone and answers texts for him.

 I just feel so alone and scared that my stomach knots.  As someone with ASD it's nice to have a safe person.  Right now I feel naked and messed up 
 
The marriage could be doomed but not sure yet.  Just scared that I will be left with nothing.  Right now I haven't talked to him for a good day because I feel like I have nothing positive to say and I don't want to bring up our fight last night.  He came home from work like normal, laughing at YouTube videos while I looked hurt and gagged.  It wasn't until I started crying later when he got angry and slammed shit then grabbed a beer.

Anyways, over the last 5 years I had slowly gained the weight back and then some where I now weigh 20 pounds more than the heaviest I was as a teenager and now im back to being largely ignored and hardly anyone talks to me. Which all of that has also turned me somewhat bitter since I know the reason for what has happened to me, and I wasted far too much time just trying to power through my BED and just lose some weight which never happened and I just kept gaining.

4298,viok93,Darryl_0220,"Around 3 years ago, I became depressed and started using self-harm as a coping mechanism. At the time I was bullied in school and faced some trouble at home from my folks because of behavioral issues at school. When COVID hit, I became very isolated and struggled with speaking about my emotions. I tried to kill myself for the first time, but it was quickly thwarted when my father came in and stopped me. I got a psychologist and was diagnosed with MDD and anxiety, and was prescribed medication which I took for around 9 months before I stopped. At that time, I looked towards weird apps (Yubo, Discord, Wizz) to meet older women that made me feel valid. There was one girl, in particular, I consistently talked to, who would ask me for phone sex, nudes, etc. She would praise me as an amazing guy one day and scream at me over the phone how I wasn't shit the next. It took a big toll on my mental and impacted my mental health at the time. As the world began to re-open, I found myself entering the ninth grade at a new school, and met this person within the first week. We talked for a few days and they seemed cool and told me a lot about their past experiences and trauma. They invited me over to their house to study with them, and when I came over we ended up going for a walk and watching a movie. On the walk, I felt comfortable and opened up about my past experiences of feeling used. They acknowledged this, and told me how sorry they felt and whatnot. Later while watching a movie, they made a move on me and asked me if I wanted to have sex. Being the scared little virgin I was and not wanting to fuck up this moment, I blurted out yes. Afterward, they completely ghosted me, bragged to all their friends about how good it was, and refused to address the fact until many months after. Events like that and many others have made it hard for me to trust others, and it's seriously taken a toll on my mental well-being. I have awful mood swings, I can't stand abandonment, I constantly flip between loving and hating people, and do whatever impulse tells me. These things have put me into dumb situations, such as trying to kill myself during school, having reckless sex, and cutting off all my friends at a moment's notice. I've been bed-bound all day pondering what the fuck is wrong with me, and cannot come up with an answer.

I (21F) have a friend(20) who is LGBTQ+. We‚Äôve been friends since high school and I honestly don‚Äôt know how because we have literally NOTHING in common. I think it‚Äôs because I was the only person who listened to them when they talked because I was too polite not to. The only remote sense of relatability is that I thought I was LGBTQ+ too at the time and I‚Äôve changed since then. The thing is, this person is toxic. Meaning that if I told them that I no longer identify as LGBTQ+ that they‚Äôd make fun of me or disown me‚Ä¶etc bc I‚Äôm straight. Not only that but they‚Äôve never ever been there for me in any sense. I told them I was going through a tough time and they just replied ‚ÄúF‚Äù as if it was a joke and nothing else. I used to have very bad social anxiety which has since gotten way better and I would stumble over my words when trying to talk to strangers. One time we were out ordering food and when I ordered, I stumbled and it got a little awkward and she made fun of me all day about how awkward I was and stuff I thought they were just bugging me but they still mention that til this day and this happened 4 years ago!!! they act like I‚Äôm still that way and that I haven‚Äôt changed. I have mentioned countless times that I don‚Äôt like that, yet they continue because they act like they‚Äôre better than you. Everything is always about them and I find myself avoiding their calls and not wanting to hang out with them. I would go months without talking to them until they‚Äôd call and I‚Äôd answer thinking they‚Äôd changed but they‚Äôre always the same.

4301,vioua3,anonymouse439,"Literally everything in my life is going wrong.

I lost my job, lost my ""friends"", I've been dealing with online harassment. I just wanted to escape and try to act like I was worthy of love, so I redownloaded tinder for the first time in several months. It never works out for me- only ever get straight dudes (despite being a gay man), men trying to cheat on their wives, or guys looking for hookups and nothing else. Same goes for every dating site/app I try.

But okay, I redownloaded it. Actually got match within a few hours. Bisexual guy, okay that's great! Not another straight dude. We chat, we're hitting it off. Asks for my number, I'm not really ready to give that up yet (you can find a lot of info with just a phone number). Asks if we can meet, I say okay, as long as it's somewhere really public because I have a history of being assaulted many times and severe PTSD from it.

He suggests a park or a nature center..... that's. Not really public. He suggests walmart. I've been assaulted in a walmart, you're pretty much alone in most of the aisles. He brings it back to a park, says ""well a public park is pretty public"". I point out that most of the time you're walking trails at a park, you can't see other people (pretty much all our local parks cut through woods). Also been assaulted at parks multiple times.

He says ""well I'll tell you something I usually wait to share until after the first date. You can use it as collateral if I try anything and it might make you feel better if I share"". He gives me his last name and tells me to google him.

So I google him.

He's a fucking REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. I tell him sorry, no can do. He says, ""this is why I don't like sharing. I like people to meet me first so they can get to know me and I can tell them my side. I guess this isn't one of those times."" This fucker is an RSO because he raped or molested a 9 year old girl when he was 21. There is no ""your side"" in that situation, especially not when you're talking to a CSA victim/survivor.

I dealt with enough pedos in my teens, and even had a long term relationship with someone who ended up being a pedo and only ever loved me because I was a minor when we started dating (he stopped loving me when I turned 18, by his own admission).

I just wanted to feel attractive. To feel lovable. But instead, the only match I made was a fucking pedophile. Why can't I just feel like someone wants to be with me? It's been years. I miss being told, ""I love you"", even if it's empty. At this point, I'd even take another abusive relationship if it meant not being fucking alone anymore. I dont even have friends I can turn to for comfort or company.

Maybe this won‚Äôt apply to EVERYONE (And trust me there was a point in my life I didn‚Äôt have anyone in reals life in my day to day to turn to and talk to) but it helped me in my situation. There were people who I was friends with who love to see me and appreciate me who I was ignoring because I hated myself so much I thought everyone else must. I have had lovely experiences once I open up . Two - don‚Äôt be afraid to make a big change. I‚Äôm moving back to the city I‚Äôm from to be closer to family. I long for the day maybe I won‚Äôt live alonebut until then I know I‚Äôll be near loved ones and I‚Äôm never far from human contact . I‚Äôm still dealing with depression and suicidal ideation but I also am making an appointment to maybe even get on some medication and /or talk to someone who can help me. My point is to look towards the future and make whatever small, positive changes you can now . It is hard the past couple days I work nights and on my days off I see myself slipping into sleeping 18 hours , eating bad, crying when I wake up etc but I am wanting to work so hard to do what it takes and I have hope .

I'm 18 yo and when I look around i see people roaming around in groups, have good friends and great network in general.

Somewhat somewhere I want that too but mostly i don't want friends. Weird i know.

The problem is about 5 months ago I shifted to new city to attend uni and I currently live away from my parents and with 2 roomates. 

My other two roommates are social butterflies and pretty too. I realised that when I wasn't surrounded by people I never cared about not having friends.

But now as I see them having friends, being wanted by many I kinda want that too.

It feels really weird and sad to roam around everywhere alone all by my own, not having anyone to share what happened during the day or anything in general.

Thankfully I have very loving parents!

I was always arrogant ngl but till my 11th grade(15) I felt very confident and knew my arrogance could be backed up. I was good at studies, had girls crushing on me evwn though I was 5'4 and brown cause I was confident. Not everybody liked me but people liked me, its a fact that people like everyone who is confident enough no matter how much of a jerk they are. 
Then I moved to another city and there the people showed me my place they didn't know me so had no reason to be scared of me....but you know what they still liked my dgaf personality and like I said I was smart and open. 

But as time passed by I got concious about my behavior, started giving every single fuck there is to give.I started feeling guilty, and sad and everything bad.....I know it sounds ridiculous but it's true. The GUILT never left me till date. I lost my old personality, now I was an apologizing piece of shit. I started being nice.....tooo nice. And that's when my friend started bullying me. I faced harsh racism like really bad. Unlike USA where racism is serious in india its a joke. I was the joke of the whole damn school. I was never taken seriously. My opinions lost all meaning.... whenever I tried saying something I was brutally bullied. I became depressed stopped playing sports, became ugly as fuck and there started another wave of bullying. 
They didn't even leave my family, they said I looked like a laborer. They said my mom was a shemale. They said my dad must have been an electrician. 

They said everything to hurt me. But that makes anyone wonder why be so harsh on me. It's because I have the big ol anger problems, I reacted just the way they wanted me to react I tried to give a comeback bur I went south pretty soon. Infact they called dumb and chutiya so many times that I now believe that I am chutiya and now I literally am a dumb person. U talk to me your first impression will be that I am dumb. My words lost all its weight. 

After the Hell 2 yrs I grew so angry and defensive that I  was looking to protect myself from the slightest of the criticisms. 

When I got back to my old city I started mocking my old best friends and started attacking them for slightest of the jokes......and I lost them all 1 by 1.
That's when I realized they destroyed me. The old smart me was gone. I withdrew back from society so as to not offend any more people. I became lonely.
Now I don't have anyone to talk to. It's not like I tried but basically forgot how to talk to people. I just keep thinking what to say so that they don't get offended and I don't open upto them. They leave coz they can't keep up anymore. 
Now everyone can see I am destroyed emotionally so they don't talk to me. 
I am 20 yr old and I am mocked even by kids. I have 0 confidence.
NO CONFIDENCE BUT STILL ARROGANT AND ANGRY MADE ME LONELY.

I could write another 300 words in here
Under this column 
 Here are some of my stories how people treat me:
1) At new years party I was the butt of a joke I dont remember about what and everyone was laughing at me and I suppose I took it as a joke as well. But then a 14 yr old kid started calling me by my name and making up funny scenario out of me.....that's when I knew I lost my life. I am not respected like I was.(This is one of 100s)

4362,vj0kfb,voughtever,"I‚Äôve been beating myself up all my life. I‚Äôve disqualified myself, I hated myself for being antisocial, I‚Äôve labeled myself as a social outcast.

But recent experiences with people have changed my opinion. People don‚Äôt constructively come to conclusion that I‚Äôm ‚Äúintroverted‚Äù, ‚Äúodd‚Äù, ‚Äúweird‚Äù, ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù or whatever, after a fair evaluation. Instead, people think all these things about me in a split second after seeing me. These people can be someone I‚Äôm meeting through acquaintances or they can be complete strangers, who know nothing about me. I can clearly tell from their faces. This is not me projecting my inner thoughts.

They give me this disgusted/creeped out look immediately after seeing me, without my ever putting in an effort to talk/interact with them. This is a major hurdle for me that blocks me from making a good impression with anyone.

And if these people go on to become acquaintances, they always make sure to call me out every chance they get by saying ‚ÄúYoU dOnT tAlK eNoUgH‚Äù.

Well, how tf can I do that or why tf would I do that when you outcast me at first sight?! And I‚Äôm not even half as bad looking as the people they hang out with.

And then they go on social media and preach bullshit that one shouldn‚Äôt discriminate based on looks and all that virtue signaling.

4378,vj3hgf,ShopDrawingModel,"Does anyone relate to my social struggles?

I‚Äôve been really lost lately trying to figure out what could be the matter with me. I believe there has to be something wrong with me since by social life is greatly affected. Ever since I broke up with my boyfriend in November of 2021, I‚Äôve been on my own. I feel horribly lonely again like I did before I met him (he was truly my only friend for 3 years). I have a very very hard time making new friends and communicating with people, and I attempted to write exactly why that is in detail. 

I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist, she said it‚Äôs possible I could be Neurodivergent or autistic, but I feel like this one is a stretch, though it would be great to say that as I would have an excuse to be myself. I‚Äôve also looked into AVPD but yet again I don‚Äôt horribly relate to it. And for the longest time I did not identify with social anxiety or phobia, I only believe I had social anxiety around the time I‚Äôm symptoms started, about 11 years old, but not anymore. I just don‚Äôt relate deeply with anything I read about and I really feel horribly confused, and sometimes I think I may just be making the problem up. One thing I do relate to is alexithymia, the inability to understand your own emotions, which makes diagnosing me VERY hard. I just want to know if anyone relates to my symptoms:

	I believe everything I think and say is either socially unacceptable* or very offensive. On top of this i avoid offending, challenging, debating, or provoking anyone at all costs. Therefore I have no thoughts when talking to people, my mind filters so much that there is nothing I can say**. I cant find a balance between things I actually want to say, and things that can be said. 

	To work with talking to people I have created a false personality. This is the result of my filters where I attempt to communicate with others in the most sensitive, unchallenging, passive, agreeable possible. I attempt to conform myself with whomever I am talking to as to not offend them. Sometimes I attempt to push my true self out of this facade, but It comes out disfigured. I try to reduce my thoughts into easily digestible sentences so I do not provoke anything from anyone. I have big grand thoughts I always recite and talk myself through almost constantly, but when I try to talk to other people about these things it‚Äôs horribly spoken. For example, I was talking to someone about consumerism, they admitted to being a consumerist. I said basically this ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so funny, I was talking too my parents about the same topic but they tried to say they weren‚Äôt consumerist, though they are. They‚Äôre just so stupid.‚Äù I feel horrible I said that about my parents, they‚Äôre good people. But I just had to push something out of my mouth, so I end up sounding stupid, and horribly spoken. 


*I don‚Äôt mean to say I‚Äôm basically itching to say the n-word at all times, I‚Äôm saying what I desire to talk about is not acceptable, mature, or appropriate. My topics differ from the rest

**I was talking to my friend, she blamed me for getting her sick all the time (i have tonsil problems she uses as the scapegoat), in reality she‚Äôs sick all the time because of her dogshit hygiene. In my mind I thought this, but it was not even a single option for that to ever be said out loud.

This isn‚Äôt the most encompassing description but I just need to stress I have NO CLUE what to say when speaking to people. All this conversation I do is exhausting and straining and when my one friend (I managed to make one friend) invites me anywhere or to do anything I dread it, because I know I‚Äôm going to be uncomfortable the entire time.

She agreed to have me present during the intake appointment and she purposely left out that she had an actual plan.

When the intake left I told her she needed to be honest so she could get help.  She has no medical insurance and she was worried about the financial burdens of inpatient commitment.  We talked a lot and she finally agreed that she should disclose.

When the intake returned to discuss her discharge my friend disclosed she had a plan.  Which at that point her discharge was revoked and she was involuntarily held.  When she heard that she kicked me out of the hospital (said no visitors).

Yesterday (Wed) I called the behavior health unit and they connected me to the dayroom phone and I asked the person who answered to put my friend on.

I felt uncomfortable there because I couldn't fit well in those and began to withdraw. I had had a connection with someone who shared my loneliness, and it was so good that we ended up becoming best friends and falling love madly, we were in a relationship for about two years until recently. I used to feel so good about sharing everything with him, from minor details to significant events in my life. However, since he recently made some new friends and changed, he has stopped talking to me and claims he no longer feels the same way about me.He said he no longer loves me and is taking a break . Since I don't have anyone else to talk with, I keep looking at the screen of my phone, hoping to receive a text message from a former classmate or really any cousin, but no one talks with me.. no one loves me really haha :D Nothing has ever helped me or made me happy, despite my attempts to read books, go out alone, and watch Netflix. I fear that loneliness will be the end of me. 

Are there any online groups or places where I may meet people to chat with? I don't want to be alone anymore. I wanna be happy again. Please.",2022-06-23 19:35:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655980542,12,/r/lonely/comments/vj54e7/loneliness_is_scary_23f/,,0,6,Loneliness is scary - 23F :)

It lasted an hour during which they talked about topics specific to them, memories they had with each other, with me having nothing to contribute.

I said 4 sentences in total. They replied to each of them which is good. It used to be that when I spoke it was awkward, glad this is no longer the case. Think before you speak unironically helps, I always spend a couple of seconds munching a thought in my head wondering if it's good enough to say and oftentimes it's not so I stay silent.

2 of the sentences I said were jokes. Both jokes got a laughter.

For a second I locked eyes with someone while he was laughing at my joke. Jesus Christ, is something so common for normal people supposed to feel this amazing? Someone liking what you said so much they are completely grinning, their face all brightened up looking at you. He probably forgot about this interaction 2 seconds after, meanwhile I'm teary eyes writing this paragraph.

No, people love the idea of me. Once I finally let them in, I am always just too much for them. I am outspoken, opinionated, smart, a fireball of energy, accepting, loyal, kind but refuses to take anyones shit. Sometimes I recognize this and just step away before it gets too deep. People take me for granted, use me, pretend they care about me until I have had enough and confront them so they find someone  who is quiet and stupid. When ever I do find someone who truly likes me for me, they rarely stay around for very long. Maybe it is because we are afraid we will hurt each other, or one is more domineering. It could be quiet possible one is not willing to blend in with the other as we tend to outshine every one. It does not matter though, we are a lonesome type of folk, always have been and always will be. Society was not made for people like me. So no, people do not love me, they love the Idea of me.

But even if you have to go now, I know you will miss me. There will be no more violins when we kiss. No more fanfares and roses falling from the heavens. Is that supposed to be it? I just didn't know better. 

Everything has turned to be a habit. But I guess that‚Äôs always the danger. Routine took its place until it was unbearable

Why didn't I say anything? You have asked me so often. What is this? What brought us here?
I never reacted. Time went by, I didn't move, no, I didn't... I did nothing. I stopped thinking about you, about me, about us. And so I left you alone.
You cried despair and unhappiness‚Ä¶ I'd rather talk everything down, and yet said exactly nothing, no, remained silent. In the face of evil and let it be‚Ä¶ Allowed us to move further away. Before a heart breaks, it dries up. 
Now I see. I can see clearly now. I can't look the other way any more. I can't avoid trouble any more, because I know‚Ä¶ That I too am lonely. I left you alone for far too long.. To despair and be unhappy. Your heart has dried up, now it‚Äôs broken. And my silence has  changed nothing. 

For once, forget your pride. I know you still love me. I know I love you still. But I‚Äòm afraid I came to my senses far too late.",2022-06-23 23:07:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1631030403,1,/r/lonely/comments/vj9rgc/26m_this_is_for_you/,,0,0,26m - This is for you.

Where did all the friends from those times go? All living their own lives now, moved on I suppose. Where they ever really my friends or just acquaintances of conveinence? I'm not sure. If I close my eyes I can still feel what it felt like back then. The energy and excitement from exploring someplace new together, laughing the night away and talking about the future.

It feels like another life, someone else's, not mine. Mine is boring, lonely and grey, theirs was vibrant and full of the unknown. 

I'm still living there, but noone else is. They all left a long time ago. I retrace the sounds, feelings and locations in my mind. The bonds and emotions. But it's just me now, just me walking down empty streets filled with cardboard cutouts of people long gone. Vainly reaching for something that no longer exists.

The hang-out part tends to break my heart as I often encounter them enjoying with others without my presence at all. And when I ask them if we wanna hangout together, they would give endless excuses like they are busy or if they have something else to do. Okay, but if they are busy, then why do you hang out with others? That itself isn't an issue. The problem is when you said you are busy, but you are hanging out with your other friends for fun?

I'm happy they're supportive, they care about me, and that they trust me with things. Though, they got each other and I know they discuss the things I tell them, so I feel like I'm being absorbed into their relationship, like I'm intruding on something. 

Talking to people hasn't gotten any easier either. I'm much better than a couple months ago. I've gotten back to a bunch of people, but chatting is such a chore. I hate dry texting so it takes a lot of effort to respond. Though, it sucks when that energy is not matched and they don't seem as interested as I tried to be. No one really checks up on me out of curiosity, they always need something. The sweetest thing in recent memory was my Japanese teacher installing a program on my chromebook to ask if I was okay and to let him know if there was anything he could do.

4491,vjgb4z,Pomegranatepirate_,"So this is something that I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone about and I was wondering if anyone here has felt this. You know how sometimes the presence of a person feels lonelier than no one there at all? 

I was with this person for 2 years, and my family basically disowned me (straight up didn‚Äôt talk to me for 6 months and ripped me apart when I tried to reach out to them) because they didn‚Äôt like him. They insisted I was choosing him over them, that his family was ‚Äúmy new family‚Äù as my mom would say over and over again.

The truth is, I have no idea why my parents were so violently against me being with this guy. Our relationship started and I was dealing with their constant disapproval on a very intense scale. My boyfriend saw that and instead of assuring if i was okay, pushed me to do lots of things I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with. He would buy me tickets to go in trips with him without asking, just telling me I was going. 

I feel like my whole relationship with him was out of survival. I was in my last year of college, I didn‚Äôt have a job at the time, my family hated me (we had always be very very close), and this guy was acting like I needed him. 

I didn‚Äôt have a chance to think about him, but after breaking up, I did. My family immediately welcomed me back into the fold. Nothing was EVER said about my relationship‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost like it never happened. It‚Äôs so weird.

But only after I broke up w him (I got sick and he kept pushing me to do things and I realized it was just not healthy) did I have the time to even think about him and who he was and what the hell happened in our time together. 

He was my first relationship‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt love him. I never got to know if I did because my brain was in so much shock from my family abandoning me. I just keep feeling like I was with him out of survival instinct.

Bad news: I was right.

This isn't really a shock; I was expecting this to occur;¬†it always does, but now that it's happened, I think it's just more validation of something I already knew was the truth. It's something with *me*. There's something fundamentally wrong with who I am, which is why, no matter what, everyone, and I mean everyone, runs away from me. 

I can't hold a friendship at all. No matter how much I try, no matter how much I work to be as cool, interesting, and funny as possible for them, they always run away. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Is this some sort of curse? Is that it? I'm just some placeholder friend, and now that they've found someone to replace me, I've been kicked to the curb once again. 

This is how it always goes: it starts off *great*, but then conversations turn to chit-chats, the hours spent talking turn to minutes, and slowly, despite how much I try to circumvent it, they ghost me. Not all at once, no, they drag it out for as long as they can until their three, two, one-word texts turn to nothing at all.¬†

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I keep trying my best, I really am, but I can never breach just being an acquaintance or whatever the online equivalent of a school friend is.

I was an abusive piece of shit to my ex more than 2 years ago, I was jealous controlling and emotionally abusive. this has caused me to lose most my friends and I've burned any remaining bridges since I didn't want people to have to deal with me. I'm now 17 and very lonely. No friends, not close to any family or any people and beside work and summer school I hide in my room all day everyday. I hate being so damn lonely all the time, I want a partner but I've sworn to myself to never date again because I'm scared I'll revert to my terrible ways. I've done counseling and have looked back at everything I've done and I feel so much regret for it.

4515,vjibfr,AutisticThrowaway125,"I haven't really made any friends in years now and feel kinda empty inside, I have autism + adhd so I don't really leave the house unless I have to, I wouldn't say I am like overly anxious or anything but I'm a creature of habbit trapped in my own mind--

I would say I feel optimistic to find someone like-minded but I realise I'm a minority in society.

If someone messaged me it would be nice if we had some common ground and some info about yourself c:

A few main things about me would be:

I love creepy videos on YouTube and general true crime or horror related stuff, or just educational rabbit hole content

I'm a bit of an anime nerd, I haven't watched anything recently other than demon slayer season 2, but my favs were devilman crybaby (mainly for the ost), jojos bizarre adventure, attack on titan, Erased and Made in abyss to name a few~

My fav music would be EDM, synthwave sort of music but I have several hundred songs on my playlist some artist that come to mind that I like are in no particular order  The weeknd, gorillaz, tame impala, porter Robinson, s√°imes, basshunter and random game OST stuff like persona 5 or something haha

I'm currently play Lost Ark a bunch atm, but my fav games in general are dark souls borne + sekiro and elden ring stuff, god of war, monster hunter, final fantasy series in general, resident evil, persona 5 amongst other stuff, I also played runescape for years one of my fav childhood games

Also I enjoy art and creative stuff in general, mainly like colouring and lineart stuff so if you like to draw I'd love to see 

Lastly I have a pet hamter, he says hi üêπ 

I feel like I'm a good listener and don't take myself too seriously or anything like that, I personally hate the feeling like I could be stepping on eggshells around people",2022-06-24 07:00:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636567230,7,/r/lonely/comments/vjibfr/25_introvert_lacking_any_meaningful_friends/,,0,2,25 introvert lacking any meaningful friends

I struggle a lot to make new friends at my age - I'm 30, even if people actually tell me I look like a highschooler. I have someone to hang out with right now, but I've been lonely for around 6 years. Since when my best friend moved to Germany, and my two others friends got a boyfriend, and the other friends just moved on with their lives. It also doesn't help the fact that I suffer of anxiety - I don't even drive because of this, and I live in the sorta countryside - plus I don't have a stable job and I have a shitty physical health. I also suffer of depression. It's just so hard to create and build a bond, as soon as you get out of school, and people usually just prefer their boyfriend/girlfriend. I'm also asexual and biromantic, which makes me feel even more excluded...because asexuals aren't really accepted very much by society and they're not an ideal partner for people. So I'm also single, even if people tell me how stunning I am. Great. Not that I NEED a relationship, but the feel that you can't even have it because no one is gonna accept your sexuality is really meh.

4529,vjjw14,RealMrCommunism,"I just feel like venting my life story, so here it is. My childhood is really fucked and no one believes me, and it‚Äôs okay if you dont!

But ever since I was a kid I remember my parents always fighting, and most of the time it‚Äôd get physical. Though I don‚Äôt remember my dad taking the offensive a lot. However when I was about 7, my parents were dirt broke and spent all their money on weed and some white powder, I don‚Äôt know if it was meth or what i‚Äôm not sure what those drugs look like. I even remember my dad taking back his birthday present to me so he could buy weed. 

But because we were dirt broke we always lived in a trailer without electricity half the time nor water. So we moved in with my dads mom who was recently married, though it only lasted a few months. I‚Äôm not sure why they divorced but the man stole my ipod and money I had saved up by myself. I remember he had a very nice car that my grandma wouldn‚Äôt let him have after the divorce so he hired people to stalk us and fire weapons at us. I‚Äôm not sure if they actually planned to hurt us,  but I can still hear the sound of them pouring gas on our trailer. I also remember my dad freaking out and yelling because apparently they shot a bullet through the window and it had a note that said they was gonna kill me and my siblings and make my parents watch. Or once they slashed our tires and while we was driving the next morning they actually fell off going down a hill and I remember my school bus passing them everyday. 
My dad couldn‚Äôt do nothing about any of this because he had a warrant and so did my grandma we was staying with.

Eventually because of all this, my moms mom who lived in another state legally adopted us in 2011 and we have been staying with her ever since. And I wish I could say my suffering ended there. 

She ended up being extremely strict, for example I am 17 and im not allowed to have my license, or even go outside without her being right by me. I have not hung out with anyone outside school since december. Although I do have a car, I worked everyday to get that though I didn‚Äôt actually buy it. One day as I was working she texted me telling me she took MY money from my bank account without telling me, and then bought ‚Äúmy‚Äù without telling me about it, and put it in her name. She drives it more than I do currently. 
She also has a problem comparing me to other teenagers which makes me so insecure. There‚Äôs a girl across the street my age, and my grandma works with her mom and my grandma is asking me why can‚Äôt I be like her? Why can‚Äôt I have all As and already have college offers? I told her about my dream job once and she told me it‚Äôs stupid and i shouldn‚Äôt follow my passion for jobs. She is constantly putting me down and. have such bad social anxiety and low self esteem because of it. 

You‚Äôd think me and my siblings would be close from what we went through in our childhood? No. Both my brothers refuse to talk to me and always exclude me from plans though i‚Äôm the middle child and more of their age.
I see both of them everyday but I can‚Äôt remember the last time we had a conversation 

I don‚Äôt get what i did to deserve this?? At school and work no one talks to me anymore and my whole friend group constantly insults me as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. Even once we was making plans at lunch and someone asked if I was invited, and someone else said ‚ÄúNo (my name) isn‚Äôt invited to any of this‚Äù and everyone agreed, RIGHT INFRONT OF ME.

and that bring me here, 5am not being able to sleep or eat because I can‚Äôt afford more weed and going through horrible withdrawls.

Relationship wise, my past 3 relationships have been a huge failure. I was cheated on twice, and when I thought I found the one, she was murdered in a car accident. I literally just can‚Äôt win at all.

Now I have huge trust issues and refuse to get attached to anyone in a relationship. I think people have made it clear they don‚Äôt want to be around me, and I think i‚Äôm decent looking sometimes. 
 i‚Äôve just learned to not even try when meeting new people anymore. 

When I was a child I knew I was sad but I could never think of EVER hurting myself, fast forward to now it doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad option 

edit: typos

edit 2: My father 

Ever since my grandma adopted me, i‚Äôve only officially met with my father a couple of times. He was doing really good! He was sober and finally had a decent job and had a new girlfriend. 
It all went downhill when we walked into my high school with a knife for my ‚Äúbirthday present‚Äù
and recently I found out through my mom he is back on meth and from his Facebook account, he thinks covid is from a satellite from Jupiter, and thinks that Donald Trump is his secret father and that JFK is his uncle.
Most scary though, apparently he thought I had an evil twin and he emailed my local police department about it and his plans to murder the evil twin. Which meant he could hurt me.  
However, a couple weeks ago I actually saw him at my job since I work at a restaurant. I knew in an instant it was him, though I was too nervous to talk to him. (nervous, not scared) But he needed cash out at the register, and I eventually gained the confidence to go do that. But nothing happened. 

He didn‚Äôt recognize me.

edit 3; thanks for the dms but I don‚Äôt think I want to talk to anyone about it. I‚Äôm more then comfortable to, it just has never helped me to be open with others. I‚Äôm not looking for pity or anything I just feel like I need to let it all out",2022-06-24 08:52:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1548597788,3,/r/lonely/comments/vjjw14/my_life_has_been_fucked_since_childhood/,,0,1,My life has been fucked since childhood

4531,vjk3xc,Moogirl1590,"Has anyone else just accepted their fate? I (24F) have been wishing for real friends since highschool. I made a lot of friends and lost all the friends I had since then. I have yet to meet someone really genuine and kind hearted that will stick with me through thick and thin exept for my husband who‚Äôs my only friend alongside my mum, pathetic right? My husband is the first person aside from my mum who really saw ME and loved me for me. He made me feel safe. He saw that I was a gentle person too empathetic for my own good. He is the only person who didnt see it as a weakness and used it to step on me. My empathy is what has set me apart I think. I can‚Äôt physically be mean to another person and I have difficulty seing when others are mean to me because its not something I would do to them. People see me as weak because of my heart and I have always been a target and a punching bag. People have often abused of my kindness too from strangers to friends. I just can‚Äôt become mean or be someone else, no matter how much I wished I cared less. I‚Äôve learned to stand up for myself more but there‚Äôs just something about me that people don‚Äôt like I guess.  Its like they never really want to get to know me. 

I have no interest in gossiping or judging other people and I find thats what most women my age want to do. I‚Äôm also a converted muslim and don‚Äôt drink or party and where I live, this is very popular. I have many interests that no one knows about because no one ever inquires about my life. I read, I play piano, I sing, I create tiny house models, I paint, I sew, I love to knit and I love hiking and biking and being outside. I love joking and im known to be pretty funny for the very few people that have actually known me. The thing is, It took me a long time to know my worth but I know it now, and I have yet to find someone who appreciates a good person who‚Äôs always there for them and is never judging them. I have yet to meet someone who sees my value. I‚Äôm the kind of friend you can call at any time crying and I will wake up and make sure you are okay, I never forget special days and birthdays and always show up! I am never jelous towards others especially not competitive with other women, I prefer to make my friends feel good about themselves always! I have had so many bad friends I cant begin to count, I feel that most of my friendships with other women were always tinged with this sort of jelousy towards me. I am on the prettier side and I didn‚Äôt used to know this and I think it actually makes it a lot more difficult to make female friends as they always see you as competition and everytime I used to go out with my friends I used to get all the male attention and at the end if the night, my friends always acted bitter towards me. Ive experienced this from almost all my female friends. 

I no longer have friends because I have been so dissapointed by other people. I just care so much and its never a two way street. Ive just come to terms with the fact that I will be friendless probably for most of my life and I feel sad that I cant share my love with more people because I have a lot to give. For now I am my own best friend, I think I am really funny and crack myself up, I keep myself busy with my hobbies, my husband and talk to myself a lot, I hype myself up and try to be the best friend I wish I had.",2022-06-24 09:07:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627522990,8,/r/lonely/comments/vjk3xc/come_to_terms_with_loneliness/,,0,4,Come to terms with loneliness

It just really ended any issues with depression when I gave up and just focused on making myself happy.  Eventually you just have to admit a lot of relationships are just based on situations that you may not be in. Nor is that relationship or friendship going to end your depression.  

 I also live a life where I am not going to have the more ideal situation to form a relationship with a quality person.  It just is what it is at this point.

4603,vjwuxl,TheQuietFury,"Being a queer person of faith is a unique cross. As I grow older, I continue to feel great loneliness. I‚Äôm not wanted in the Church because I am sapphic, and the LGBTQ+ community does not want me because I am Catholic. No one wants me. I don‚Äôt fit in their assigned boxes. A few weeks back I experienced anxiety over going to Mass at a church - this was the first time I ever felt this way. It reminds me of when kids are at school and they‚Äôre having lunch in the cafeteria. One kid attempts to sit at a table only to be rejected by the other kids there saying, ‚ÄúSorry, this seat is taken/You can‚Äôt sit here.‚Äù Luckily that Mass went well in the end, but I was scared I was going to hear something homophobic from the pulpit like I have before in that specific church. I don‚Äôt really have anyone in the Church to have that sense of community either. I am the only person in my immediate family that tries to practice the Faith daily. I don‚Äôt have family or friends to be a part of my faith community/journey. Even though I love my Faith - the Mass, the Eucharist, the Rosary, the Saints and Angels, the Holy Souls in Purgatory, Jesus and Mary - I really do feel that I am going through it alone. The LGBTQ+ community is the same. I have tried dating apps, I have tried going to Pride-related events, I have gone out once with a girl to see if there was a potential spark between us. None of these worked. Clubs and bars aren‚Äôt really my spaces - I‚Äôm not into alcohol or partying late at night ‚Äî I am a young adult with the soul of a granny, lol. I am also scared of being roofied or harassed by dangerous people in these spaces. I also don‚Äôt do casual relationships. It‚Äôs just not built into me. I know there are queer spaces outside of bars and clubs, but they are hard to find. Dating apps are ‚Ä¶ a mess. I am almost 30 years old, and not once have I ever been in a romantic relationship. Never held hands, never been on an actual date, never kissed. 
For a long time I wondered if there is something wrong with me. Think about it: the entire world can‚Äôt be the problem of why I don‚Äôt fit in with any communities. I am the common denominator in all of this. I must be the problem. I have been to therapy, I have done self-reflection, I have been working on my shortcomings for a number of years. I sometimes wish I did not have these feelings for wanting to truly belong with a group or desiring to be in a relationship. I wish I could be content with how things are in my life. I sometimes wished too I could be like some of the Saints in my religion who could physically see Jesus and Mary and talk with them one on one. Maybe I would feel less lonely.
I typed this out in a bit of a ramble, so please excuse me if things seem a bit scattered. I needed to get this off my chest. Talking to family and people I am on good terms with doesn‚Äôt help.

4606,vjwz4d,feelshitdeletelater,"Almost 40 years of this now. Last year I thought I found a way out. Thought I'd found someone who could help me turn myself around. Should have called everything off when I talked about having no friends and she laughed and said ""what do you mean"". Turns out I've learnt even more-so just what I've missed and being missing out on these past however many years. I mean, it's 3 decades where I can honestly say I've not had any friends (and even when I was 8 years old calling them friends would have been a stretch). Until last year I'd never had the opportunity to hold hands with someone who wasn't family. To be touched. To hope there was a chance I'd not be alone. But now, here I am. And it feels even worse, now to know exactly what I've missed out on. Exactly how broken and messed up I am that I can't even react well to being touched. I mean, how the hell am I even meant to move on from this, to actually try and interact with people when I know it's been so long that I can't even act normal in those situations.

Ages ago I made the decision on how I wanted to end it. Last year I checked the feasibility of it and felt incredibly sick upon doing it. A few weeks ago a cousin of mine killed himself. How it made me feel, what it did to his family, it just gave me second thoughts. But I really don't want to continue doing this. I don't want to continue growing old with absolutely no one and nothing. I don't want to continue looking around me, living life vicariously through the experiences and expectations of others. But it's a never-ending cycle. It's being stuck in the exact same hole and the only assistance you get from people is a new spade delivered to continue digging down because the old one got too blunt. And it's absolutely pointless posting this.

I really don't want to do this for another year. And yet I've got to. Because I'm too much of a wimp. At least my cousin had the strength to end it.",2022-06-24 19:58:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610890497,5,/r/lonely/comments/vjwz4d/another_trip_around_the_sun_done/,,0,2,Another trip around the sun done

Yes, I'm sad that I'm single but I'm also sad that I don't have friends to enjoy these moments with.

But I am never invited to anything that they ever do. I will see snapchats or IG/facebook posts on parties, resteraunt outings, road trips, etc... that I am never invited to.

They acted like I didn‚Äôt exist. I posted stuff on Wattpad, they barely watched it. When I posted announcements about MY mental health, they‚Äôd change it for theirs or just answer to a portion of it. My family is no better. My father doesn‚Äôt want me to show any emotions too loudly, else he‚Äôll tell me to shut up and stop. It just ruined the moment. Then he will never apologize even if I told him he needed to, he never did and never will. 

Anyway, I just think that no one really truly cares, because when I say something about me or do something to help me or even trust someone, I just get shoved away, and they always listen to others and care about others. When I post something and someone else post something really similar, THEY get more attention than me, even though my stuff is better than theirs. Just because they‚Äôd know them for longer doesn‚Äôt mean to let down the new. This specific friend, that I had trusted over 4 times, succeeded in breaking it all the time, called me selfish for blocking her after I noticed that she didn‚Äôt care and it made me angry.

It‚Äôs not always about her. I‚Äôve know her for 2 years. She always said sorry, I treated her with kindness and was there for her, but she never did the same. She never told me how she felt about me, and would later on treat me like shit because I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it, when I didn‚Äôt even know she had problems. Never asked her, and she never asked if I had. Now she thinks that she won, when she just lost someone, again. I stopped caring, but when I confronted her about not interacting with my stuff, she said I was supposed to do that, and she never interacted with mine in ways to help the non-existant-anymore relationship. I told her some wise stuff, that I acknowledge that I may had done some bad stuff, and to not do the same mistake as I did. She called me a hypocrite just for telling her that.

I know I talk a lot about her, since she needs to understand I‚Äôve got feelings too. She probably never will since she think I‚ÄôM the bad guy, when she is the one in the wrong.

So out of loneliness and wanting comfort I reached out to my ex before the current one. He is a manipulative narcissist. He caused a lot of mental trauma when we dated. But I just needed someone and he was still a friend. So we hooked up. And did a few times after that. Now he's not talking to me as he said I pushed too much. I will admit I did get a bit obsessive as I got caught up in the affection. It's better this way really as I shouldn't be with him again..but it still makes me feel unwanted

My friends were supportive with the breakup in the beginning but now since it's been a month it's like they don't care.

4640,vk0gw6,Alarmed-Entrance8040,"Hello. Just venting here because I don‚Äôt want to vent it to my friends, say the wrong thing and make them think I hate them all. I am straight 17M. My friends however are almost all female and are LGBT+. They are wonderful people, the closest and greatest people in my life! For some background I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, single my whole life and very touch deprived. 

Anyways, one on one I like hanging out with them, very energetic and uplifting, caring and just overall amazing friends, but when multiple of us hang out, it becomes very apparent I‚Äôm the outcast of the group. They‚Äôll crack many sexual jokes at one another, which can be awkward at times but that‚Äôs there humor I guess! But that‚Äôs where I started to realize I don‚Äôt fit in, they make those jokes they‚Äôll laugh, if I were to make one (I never have, or ever will) it would come off as very creepy. I mean that‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs just some jokes, but then there was this one particular incident.

We all got together at one of their houses and just overall having a good time. But that whole time I just felt like the outlier. The distance in my demeanor was rather apparent to the host, and she tried her best to check on me and make me feel included (much to my appreciation). Just to visualize the setting for you, there were some chairs scattered around in a circular shape, with a couch thrown into the mix. I was sitting there on one of the chairs just hanging out, then slowly they all gathered on the couch, just embracing one another and being physically intimate, in a platonic way. 6 of them all huddled on that couch just being happy and overall together. Then there was me, just sitting on a chair, alone. That whole ordeal lasted 5 minutes maybe, but similar things happened in smaller scenarios and groupings throughout the night. Now I understand that this may come across as creepy, but I just wanted to join them and be held and told everything will be alright. Seeing the closest people in my life enjoying each other‚Äôs embrace, I‚Äôve never felt more distant. I pretended to feel tired just as a form of dismissal just in case they asked me if I was okay. But the night ended 30-ish minutes later without any real sense that anyone noticed my apathetic mood. Being alone with no one around can be desolate, being alone in a group of people is‚Ä¶ depressing.",2022-06-24 22:42:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656076595,7,/r/lonely/comments/vk0gw6/no_thought_out_title_sorry_just_need_to_vent/,,0,3,"No thought out title, sorry, just need to vent."

4699,vk56g4,Unusual-Biscotti1259,"I am a 23 year old guy living in Ontario Canada. There are two aspects to me being lonely, both having no friends and no lover. I've been single all my life. never even been on a date. I have had a few hookups if you'd call them that. I am bi-sexual and yet even having both men and women be a possible love interest to the shitty game i call life, i can't seem to find anyone. On all these dating apps i never receive matches or if i send a face picture the other person immediately ends the chat. I'm not cocky, but i don't think i look that bad at all but i guess I'm wrong. 

When it comes to friends, i have none. There's a story as to why on my profile if interested. I have been on reddit looking for friends and for dating (not just on reddit) for a while now and have had no luck. everyone wastes my time just to ghost me the next morning, or they even waste my time for multiple months of chatting. i am fine taking it slow, if you want to chat for a while first I'm all for it. but then when we decide to meetup all of a sudden I'm ghosted. 

I struggle with depression and social anxiety big time. but i have been working through it and unfortunately coming out of my bubble has seemed to make it so much worse. Online chatting is fun and all but i get bored of it. i like to be in person, hanging out with people, doing things. I like peoples company, it is very comforting to me. 

Something i have always wanted was a best guy friend. like a best friend that knows everything about each other, that hangs out on the regular, maybe even cuddle lol. Idk but at 23 i feel like this is an impossible thing to get.

I just finished graduate school and am looking for a job. I‚Äôm super excited to work until I die!! 

My dad is dying of stage 4 brain cancer. He was always the parent that I leaned towards because he was ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù. 10 days after his first surgery, I almost found him in a coma. I told my mom to call 911 and that is the only reason he is alive today. He suffered a brain abscess, stroke, and bacterial meningitis. His high intracranial pressure alone could have killed him. Anyway, I bought him time and now watch him waste away in front of the tv, a very different life than what he is used to. 

My mother has not been supportive but how could she be. Her own sister is dying of stage 4 brain cancer too. She has been cold and distant to me. After school, she quickly cut me off financially. She is feeling strained too with all of my dads medical bills. My dad had been the breadwinner of the family all my life. He always took care of us. 

When she cut me off, it terrified me. I had some money saved up but of course with a masters degree I have loans to pay. I was stupid enough to go on a sugar daddy website where he gave me a few thousand dollars. A few dates later, after meeting his brother, I found he re-activated his account, looking for new girls. The money didn‚Äôt make the experience worth it. I thought meeting his family meant that I was somehow ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt enough apparently. 

To be quite honest, I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend. I talk to friends but physically I can‚Äôt be close to them because they are far away. My father is dying. My aunt is dying. My mother takes her anger out on me. It has gotten so bad at home that I wanted to start sleeping in my car overnight. I feel like I don‚Äôt have much to look forward to.

4711,vk6z5x,DGW7601,"Recently, I was between apartments, and during the few weeks in which I was waiting for my new lease to start I had a few friends from work generously allow me to stay with them.

On one hand, the mere fact that I had friends, who were nice enough to take me in like that, felt like testament to how far I've come in the last year; one year ago I was working a janitorial position, I never spoke to anyone at work, had no friends and no social life whatsoever, and life felt thoroughly pointless. I pretty much relied on superficial gratification (e.g. food, escapism through TV/film) for any positive experiences on a day to day basis. In the time since then I quit that job, started a new one, and now I have people who feel like true friends to me, something I haven't felt in a while.

On another hand, said friends were a couple. During my time with them I was present whilst they engaged in their daily routines, in which they saw each other as intrinsic parts of each others lives. The activities they engaged in on a day to day basis were simplistic; mostly movies, occasional activities such as puzzles or board games, audiobooks, but even so, they seemed so very content.

I guess my point is that while I am extremely grateful to them for taking me in. and while I enjoyed their company during my time with them, it still stung to witness them sharing this mutual connection that I feel I will never get to experience myself. All my life, my social anxiety has only gotten worse and worse, and while as I established earlier in this post I have made some progress recently, I still feel as though I will never know what it's like to have someone to come home to and spend your day with, who sees you as an integral part of their life, just as intergral to them as they are to you. Such a feeling is one that I have yet to come close to experiencing, and as much as I want to, I fear I will never get to feel it myself.

4739,vkadb5,lunaag10,"We‚Äôve labeled ourselves as bffs because we‚Äôve been in each other‚Äôs lives since we were literally born. Recently, after a lot of falling outs and betrayals from other friends, she became the only friend i had, besides my partner who I‚Äôve been with since HS. 

I‚Äôve been there for her through all her breakups and heartaches and we lost one of our childhood bffs when we were in college and went through it all together. I was always a phone call away and would drop everything to be with her and comfort her, and honestly still would. Recently i started noticing that i would never get that energy back. The only person who ever did that for me was my partner but i always wished i had my ‚Äúbffs‚Äù support too.

I‚Äôve started noticing that whenever she has a bf, she kind of tosses me aside and doesn‚Äôt reach out or want to hang out as much, honestly not at all. And shes been with this bf for almost 2 years now and lives with him and I‚Äôve only met him once. They live with another friend and it honestly hurts me that they all spend so much time together and post it on socials and i don‚Äôt get so much as an invite. I‚Äôm literally only invited when it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgirls‚Äù thing.

I‚Äôve tried countless times to invite both of them over to hangout but there‚Äôs always an excuse or she would show up without him and would have an excuse for him. I even invited them to hang out during one of my lowest points in life and neither showed up, only my partner‚Äôs friends. Before she got serious with him she told me about his life and how he socializes and she would literally drop everything to be with him and his friends, literally all last minute things but when it came to me, i was always a last thought.

She refused to go to a family member‚Äôs funeral and it made me disappear and distance myself after i told her it made me upset and after the loss, i went through my first major depressive episode which made me want to disappear more. I just felt so low, from grief, rejection, and feeling so alone and unwanted. I got a couple of texts here and there from her but not much else. I did get an apology but they were just words to me at that point, it felt like she was dismissing my pain and hurt so she didn‚Äôt have to acknowledge it.

I invited them both to an event and she said they would both be there and i was so excited because i hadn‚Äôt seen him in over a year from the first time we met. Only she showed up with an excuse for him and i felt so upset and i tried not to show it. I had even texted her right before, letting her know that i was so excited to see him again and hangout and she didn‚Äôt respond because she already knew he chose not to go and when i saw her i asked about him and she gave me an excuse again. 

After that i felt so unwanted and so rejected and hurt and like there was something wrong with me, i just distanced myself even more after that. Since then, I‚Äôve only seen her 2-3 times this year, only for special events and i still haven‚Äôt seen him. But the couple of times I‚Äôve seen her, she acts like nothing happened and nothing‚Äôs wrong, for my sanity and mental well being, i chose to go along with it and deep down i know she‚Äôs no longer my bff and i no longer have any close friends.

4743,vkat8d,Naive-River-8334,"\*\*TW\*\* - Suicide, depression, mental illness

I was bullied in grade K, and so I switched to private schooling shortly after. There I met several people who were good friends for a VERY long time. Met a couple from Grade 1, and the grades following. I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that people can just say ""Fuck you,"" (Metaphorically) and cut all connections in a matter of seconds. There doesn't even need to be an instance of argumentative talking, but it's so abrupt I'm still dealing with the fact that my life is already over. I overthink way too much, which normally leads to plans for the future, but lately, all of my plans are either committing suicide or having a proper fucking friend group. I don't have any friends, maybe like 1 or 2, but they aren't close. And whenever I'm walking through the halls of my school now, all I see is friend group upon friend group upon friend group. I don't understand. I go to the tables in the cafe, and the moment I sit, every. Single. Person. Gets up and walks away. Legit, what the fuck did I do? The only thing that I've done would've been wearing a dress to school (Male). Which was purely for jokes, but I don't know... maybe people thought of it to be weird? I just can't seem to make use of my life no more. The only plans I have are MAYBE becoming a novelist, but God forbid it's something other than a carpenter or something else. Not to mention how tiring writing a novel is, might as well just put iron in my mouth. Like, I see old friends all the time walking through the halls, and most of the time, it's either they ignore me, or wave. Which is fine, I don't expect everyone to remember who their old friend was, but that's just how it is. I had this one friend for a bit over 5 years, who just started lying to me. No reason whatsoever. It also doesn't help that the mood swings I have are stupid. I find when I'm not feeling lonely I rarely have mood swings large enough to both encompass suicidal thoughts and the feeling of joy. But now that 2 of my 10-year-long friends have both blocked me, it's... something else. I don't know, maybe I should've gotten the hint when I was the only person asking if they wanted to play video games. I was always the first person who asked them if they wanted to do something; it was never them. And maybe that's one of the reasons for the extremely sudden blocking and ignoring. As for saying ""Private school was the worst mistake"" It comes down merely to the loneliness felt by not having more than a couple of friends. The only good part of a private school was the teachers of my later grades. The worst part though is during the summer. I fucking hate summer. Not because it's hot, or wasps, or anything- except the lack of stuff being forced down your throat. Atleast with school, I could (attempt) to forget about the lack of meaning I serve and focus on studying. But during the summer, I look on social media and see old friends having the time of THEIR LIFE. I've never been invited to a party, and I'm (sooner than later) going to graduate from high school, but some of the people I work with are years younger and they have so many tales to tell about the 'best night of their life least. People are having the times of their life, and here I am, just writing. In terms of wearing a dress, I sometimes wear a skirt when I'm bored and because of this, my mom thinks I'm transgender, and my sister thinks the same. If my dad knew he would kick me out in a heartbeat. Thing is, I'm not trans, nor gay, just religious human experimenting; and that's another thing my private school put a stop to. Since it was a religous-based school, everything was for god, but now I'm thinking that if there was a God, then he would've popped the wheels of a semi-truck while I was crossing. I want to do it so badly, but I know if I were to jump out in front of a vehicle, it would both devastate me, and the driver's family. I've had a few times where I put a blade of sorts to a part of my body (ie neck, etc) and have cried. I'm getting sidetracked, but long story short is that my friends left me and mental illness is a douchebag  


TL;DR - Friend's I've known for more than half my life abruptly blocked me on social media, while their other friends post pictures of extremely fun-looking scenarios. And a few life-altering mental issuesFriends

4749,vkbiu3,Moon_And_Stars9,"All of my friends are gone. They're alive, but they just left.

I had three very close friends, L, S, and Q. I'm probably never talking to any of them again. And what's worse is that they all left without saying goodbye.

L is an online friend, and attempted suicide a few months ago. Luckily it failed, but his parents took his tech until July, and in July they'll be monitoring everything a ton so he can't really talk to me (he's not supposed to have online friends). Even if we could talk again, we've gone so long without talking that it just wouldn't be the same. 

S ended our friendship last year because I was a shit friend and they were trying to distance themselves from people because of their depression. They also attempted suicide. It failed, but we got to talk for a little bit and basically all that happened was that they said not to feel guilty and reassured me like they didn't just try to take their life. A mutual friend told me about them attempting in class and obviously I broke down, and in a convo with the mutual friend and them (I got a screenshot of the convo from the mutual friend) they basically said I was overreacting and it made me feel really shitty thinking that they saw me as ""weak"" or something bc I cried. So yeah we're probably not talking again. We swore to each other that no matter what we'd always be friends, but unfortunately life can't accommodate the innocence of two 10 year olds that couldn't predict the future. 

Q ghosted me and when I confronted them about it, they told me why, and long story short, they had a crush on me, told a friend, and was emotionally abused about it. So much so that they had to ghost me because I reminded them of the abuse. I really fucking miss them and I wanna talk to them again, but I don't want to trigger them. One night I texted them and I asked them if they ever hated me for talking to them (I ghosted them after school ended one year and then we reconnected a few years later) and they didn't respond. I really want to be friends again, but like I said I don't want to bring back bad memories. They had told me that they weren't ready to be friends again bc they were super happy and didn't want to mess it up when I confronted them the first time, which I know means we aren't talking again, but part of my wishes that we could.

I don't have anyone left. Not even friends that aren't super close.

This happened a couple of years back I just randomly thought of it and decided to share it since it is a fucked up story and I'd like to bring a little bit of attention to it. My friend and I went to a music festival, it was a leap outside my comfort zone but I've read that getting out of your comfort zone helps you become better and grow as a person. So we were at the festival, the two of us just having fun, drinking and enjoying the music and having a good time. It was like close to midnight and a group of 5 guys approached us and started a conversation, we were vibing they were super charismatic and seemed like a cool group of guys so we decided to hang out with them for a bit at the festival, 30 minutes in one of the guys hugged my friend and another put one of his arms around my shoulder talking to me, they sort of split the two of us a bit. We had our cups in our hands, I turned back to my friend to tell her something and I saw her getting hugged I was like 'aww' but, as she was getting hugged she had her hand and the drink in hand to the side and one of the five guys slipped a pill in her drink, which I saw. So I told the guy next to me to give me a minute and I told my friend about it. We were both like what the fuck what do we do now. We didn't want to let them know that I saw it so we asked to be excused to go to the bathroom, but we left the festival as a whole that was super fucked up imo. That was the last time I went out 'partying', which might have amplified my loneliness. Why are some men like this? 

If you had similar experiences, or just want to talk to me in general please don't be hesitant to hit me up. I'm always down to talk.

I know I shouldn't be getting attached so quickly but she's so gorgeous and bubbly it's a little hard not to.

I know couples don't have to agree on literally every single thing but to me that was a really hot button issue and I don't know if this will workout going forward. I'm disappointed but ultimately better to have a bubble burst early than too late. I'm not perfect and I try not to be too judgmental. In regards to the Ottawa Protest there were some issues I agree with but overall I wasn't in support of it. We seem to differ on this one core aspect. I believe in science and vaccination and would prefer to find someone on this same wavelength. I guess 5 minutes of brief but genuine connection is better than none at all. Anyway I've pretty much said what I have had to say. I haven't told her my thoughts on vaccines but this could be problematic in the future. Just wanted to throw my frustration out there.

4783,vkhupz,beingrandom77,"Hi everyone. Hope you all have been holding through well, or at least trying to do so. Firstly, a little about me. I am 21 years old, still in College, studying law. I love studying, reading books, listening to varied music, history, art, social science and cultural studies, making trivias, watching movies, working out, travelling, doing small things for people I really love and care about and having deep conversations. 

Although I've always had friends, but could never really nurture any of my friendships enough to keep them for long. It's a mistake I admit and want to rectify. I'm still young and have a long life ahead. I want to meet new people, from different backgrounds, with different stories and experiences and get to know them from their heart and hope to nurture a relation with them for long. I recently (this week) had a breakup from a five year old relationship. The girl I loved was probably the best thing ever happened to me. If I see our relationship apart from the attachment and romance, we were really good friends and did a lot for each other. Just this time, she said she was too tired to go through any bad times with me, which is fair enough because I somehow hurt her because of my mental health issues. Though, somewhere I still hope that she will come back and we will resolve things as always, I've been feeling abandoned. Today, I took a therapy session and learned new perspective and understanding. I really feel that everyone around me, all of you as well are going through something, and it's just too hard to deal with all of it alone.

Hence, I want to reach out to all of you and just tell you all that I want to talk to more people and really talk, not just the small talk but actually a heartful conversation. We all carry so much baggage and burden, if I can really help someone lift them, I would be really really glad while also having found someone to keep me company. I'm still grieving but surprisingly, I feel positive about myself most of the times, and want to reach out and spread the feelings of love and care to everyone I can. If you are going through anything, or need someone to talk to, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm there for you.",2022-06-25 15:48:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656093886,5,/r/lonely/comments/vkhupz/really_want_to_talk_to_more_people_and_get_to/,,0,0,Really want to talk to more people and get to know them

I'm a strong introvert, won't talk much unless i get close to. I'm a sensitive person, with great honesty and discipline. I was thinking about whether to post or not.

 I have lonely for a long time, kinda living alone. As I have mentioned, I'm 24 M single, who haven't been in a relationship before (and yes virgin). It's little bit common in the my place. I haven't even kissed or hugged a girl before. It's not that I'm ugly or something, I look good and i often workout.

Every birthday, I tend to spend the day alone with no one giving me a surprise gifts or cake cutting. I don't talk much in reality, but I'm good only in chat.

As from the teen, the hormones started to play, and been longed to be with a girl/woman. I have never been loved before.

Want some girl/woman to chat with, if things go well we can be more. Even interested to ppl who are elder than me. Show some love! Need some hugs!ü•∫",2022-06-25 17:16:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653140138,3,/r/lonely/comments/vkjpac/24m_need_someone_to_chat/,,0,2,24M Need someone to chat

4799,vkl06h,ocpradhan,"I'm a 22 male. These past few months I've feeling very lonely and I'm really tired because of my life. I've always tried to be nice to others but I don't get that much in return. The most what I get is ""You are a good boy"" from people and sometimes they don't even say it to my face. And I'm talking about my real life. I am not that religious but sometimes I question about my Bible is that ""Why people read Bible if they don't want to follow it outside of the church?"" It doesn't make sense to me. I used to serve refreshments to people and clean the church after the  church get finished every Sunday and now I left it know why. 

My loneliness mostly comes when I think I'm useless. I'm in my 4th year of my college now and Im studying Computer Science and I still haven't made any solid project on my own and I have nothing that good to show on my CV. I can't concentrate well during my lectures and I really don't know what will become to me in my future. If I'm just good at my studies I think I won't ne lonely as I'll have something to live for. My favourite thing is to play badminton and seriously I'm really good at that. I can play it whole day. I wanted to make it my profession but my father just wanted to me to study. He just told me to make money just like we did for you. Even if he calls me It's always about me money.  I have irl friends but as we are about to graduate now they seem they are ignoring me, they now have girlfriends, so maybe they are always busy with them.

I studied in a boys school so like I talked with very less with girls. As I started college it was very difficult for me to talk to them and still it's difficult. I never had a gf, so I just started imagining things. At first it was just holding hands, hugging each other but as i got desperate it turned into pervy things, it was fun but slowly by slowly  it turned out be  my greatest nightmare now and it always kills me from inside every night. If you want Know more about me, like what sort of a person I am you can check my profile, I never delete my posts and tbh I found someone online whom I can love and she accepted me as the way I am and I really wanna reach her out in the future and I am trying my best to do that.

I just want someone to just text me Good Mornings and Nights. I tried making friends in Needafriend, I really made good friends but most of them don't start a convo first. I just want someone to just text me first, just a Good Morning and Nights will work and it would be more than enough. 

This was like more of a rant and it pretty long.

4800,vkl83y,ServiceNice4614,"Having no friends is fun. :(. Being betrayed by the people you though cared for you is fun. I am on a ship. People that you were ‚Äúfriends‚Äù for over 5 years suddenly become enemies. They stop talking, start ignoring you, make you feel like a nobody. You start to wonder: have I done anything that did not satisfy them? You start to question yourself, why? you ask. You start to blame yourself, what have I done?. The last time you went out, was to give them money for presents. After that they make new group chats making shitty excuses to avoid you. 

Just because I choose to be myself. Not someone they want me to be. Is that too hard for people? I know what is the problem! I am too honest. When I was asked for my opinion I gave my opinion not the opinion they wanted. That is punishable by lies and deceit, I guess. 

I would appreciate them coming to my face and telling me their problems. I would always sit down and listen, I believe they were there to hear from me as well, but hell na. 

The only messages I got from them was for homework and study help. They not only lie in my face but they also think I am dumb. As I said, I have seen this happen before. When we were one whole friend group they wanted to start moving away, I tried to tell them that hiding it is bad, they did not listen, why would they? Now I am in the same situation.

No one would really check up on me or ask me how my project's been or if I'm down for a chat or to eat out, I never was an option to any of these people. It's hard because I know it's not their obligation to check up on me daily or weekly but it's what I feel and I try to stop feeling like this because they don't deserve the hate or anger I feel towards them. I used to text lots of people to tell them I miss them and I share posts which remined me of them and they just ignore it. I also hate when people say ""miss you hang soon pls"" when they never even invite me out. I do have a boyfriend but we're hours away from each other, we're busy and broke to see each other. He somewhat fills the void sometimes but the distance is hard because the longing I have to be close to him is so strong, he's the only person who actually talks to me but it's different when you have a group of friends especially girlfriends who you can just chat with.

If you've been having a tough time on reddit or other apps making friends or finding people to talk to , give my app Openup a try! The only way to talk on there is to actually call people, it's not like here where you will message someone and they don't reply for hours on end. I've made this app in hopes of helping out all the lonely people in the world and hopefully help people find the love they need to keep going, give it a try and let me know if it helps you or not. Thanks everyone.

4854,vkr5gs,udontthrowmeaway,"(30s)m i haven't been in a relationship with anyone in the past 5 years. And i hadn't really had feelings for anyone in the past 3 years. Ive been focusing on myself but ever since covid hit everything changed, i had to change jobs, my mental health had gotten worse. I grew apart from my friends and im always so busy i havent had time to really connect with anyone.   And when i tried i would just end up getting friend zoned or turned down. So for a year i just stopped trying to date and work on myself, but i started to just feel lonely all the time. I tried reconnecting with my friends,  trying to make new ones but it didn't help. i tried talking to some women online but i really just felt like i couldn't develop the feelings. After a while I felt broken. Ive felt broken for a long time, i hate my job, i hate my life, my body, and its unfortunate but im stuck in a situation and it will probably  be a year or 2 before i can get out of it and everyday it feel like im just digging a bigger and bigger pit that i will never get out of. Work shut down for a week and i didn't have much to do, i started talking to some people online and this girl randomly messaged me, she seemed really interested in me because she liked my personality and I liked hers and it was nice because i started to feel things. Just a bit of a crush nothing serious. But i started to feel not so broken. Im the ""unnatractive guy who makes up for it by being funny and having a great personality."" And tbh i hate to be that guy. But im him and there really isn't anything that i can do to change it. Anyway we had so much fun talking, and then we decided to exchange pictures. She was super sweet and nice  but i could tell she wasn't attracted to me, and im fine with that i wasn't really expecting much. And slowly the time between our messages has been getting longer and longer and i know its only a matter of time before I just stop getting a response at all. And it hurts so much because so many terrible things have been going on in my life lately that i haven't had any control over and the moment i try to grab just a sliver of happiness i get hurt.",2022-06-25 23:21:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1556299262,3,/r/lonely/comments/vkr5gs/im_about_to_get_ghosted/,,0,2,Im about to get ghosted.

Ever since I was born I‚Äôve been such a burden to my family and I did not get any genuine social interaction until I was 13 with my close friend. Teachers were racist as hell, I had no friends, and my family ignored me. My close friend who I met in 8th grade is amazing and has brought me so much joy in the past 6 years. But what I feared was going to happen is starting to happen. We‚Äôre both in college but we go to school in different states and she‚Äôs moving onto new friend groups and opportunities as my life gets worse and worse. She‚Äôs all I have tbh and I didn‚Äôt realize that until today when we had our most recent conversation that we might drift apart. We have less time for each other meaning she‚Äôll spend more time with her new friends. There is a possibility that we‚Äôll still be close and be friends but with my life‚Äôs track record so far it‚Äôs most likely going to be that I lose her and spiral into a deeper depression than I already have. We usually spend my birthday together since it‚Äôs in the summer but we might not be able to this year meaning I have to spend it with my shitty family. I was looking forward to spending more time with her but it looks like that‚Äôs not possible. I‚Äôll spend my summer crying inside my room as my mental health gets worse as she lives a better life than me. Sure I don‚Äôt know the full story of her life but with what I‚Äôve seen and heard so far, she‚Äôs doing better than I have in the past 2 years. Which is why I‚Äôve decided to kill myself at 25. My life so far has just been taking constant L‚Äôs. Honestly I want to kill myself tonight but I‚Äôm too lazy to. Don‚Äôt comment Dumbass corny shit like I have more to live for because I don‚Äôt. The fact that I didn‚Äôt get the bare minimum of motherly affection and kindness has set me up for failure the fact that I haven‚Äôt killed myself yet is a miracle. I cannot believe I chose to stay alive in my senior year of high school just for this bullshit. I refuse to spend the rest of my life trying to replicate what I never had. I‚Äôll finish college and maybe make it a couple years and see if my life gets better but I doubt it.

4864,vkruec,RefrigeratorOk7070,"So this year I turned 30 years old. At this point in my life I always plan on doing more. maybe being married maybe even having kids. The life didn't go like that, the first time I fell in love I watched it crumble. The second time it utterly destroyed me. I picked myself back up so much and tried to put together all those pieces each time being more and more perfect. Until people saw me as successful, but even with all that there is still something deep inside me that cannot be filled. Each day it just gets worse and worse as I watch loved ones and friends move forward in their lives. Finding love and happiness. As I sit here feeling like I'm decaying, falling apart each day more and more. Feeling more alone and more isolated no matter what I do and destroying every relationship that I have from my own insecurities and fear of being hurt or abandoned again.

This lonelyness is different, from anything I have face before. It's almost like it's a weight bearing down on me. Pushing me deeper and deeper into this mindset that I just can't get out. I'm so scared now that I feel like this forever. That I'll grow old and alone with everyone just looking at me with sad eyes for the person I used to be. I wish this pain go away, I wish I would heal and go back to how I used to be. I wish my family stopped saying that they wished I would go back to how I used to be.

Hours go by. He stops responding again. 9pm. He tells me his friend finally got there. 7 hours late. Because he thought his friend was getting off work earlier.

4895,vktx1u,PolyethyleneLezBean,"Dear reader of this post,

Your soul matters, your living, beating, pulsating mind is very valuable. A repository of all the wonderful personalities that you have. You means a lot in this world, to exist, for someone and yourself.

If you're down lately, you might feel as if nothing matters anymore. Life or death just suddenly seems like it's just a state, just a 0 and 1. But you'd be wrong, there's always something waiting for you up ahead. Something wonderful, something that will make you feel like your life is anything but that thing.

Some people don't care about you, I'd say walk away. There are probably better people, better place, that gives you the care, love, and affection far more than what you have right now. So keep looking forward, up ahead, chin high. For you will be meeting someone, or something that'll give you the genuine care you deserved.

Have a great day,",2022-06-26 01:57:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644063607,19,/r/lonely/comments/vktx1u/i_just_wanted_to_say_i_hope_everyone_have_a_great/,,0,2,"I Just Wanted to Say, I Hope Everyone Have a Great Weekend &lt;3 You Deserves to be Loved as Much as Everyone"

I never realized how alone I was when I was younger because I had my best friend. I stopped talking to her when she moved away. She really just became a new person, not the girl I knew. 

Basically 4 years later me and my brother were messing around and decided to prank call her. I don‚Äôt really know why it led up to this. When he called her he was pretending to be some surfer boy or whatever and messing with her. Her friend in the background asked who it was. My old friend said ‚Äúmy lil childhood white best friend‚Äù. 

I know I‚Äôm being dramatic.. I KNOW. It just hurt me a lot for some reason. I mean that‚Äôs all I am to her man.. shit feels terrible. I was always there for her. I supported her in so many ways and that‚Äôs all I am to her. Just those simple words. She was all I ever had.. it hurts bro. 

She gets everything she wants in life too. I know she has family problems and all but besides that she got everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. She‚Äôs like barely 14 too. This girl goes to parties, completely stunning, has multiple friends, EVERYTHING. I‚Äôm so jealous of her. It upsets me man. Why did I have to be the one who gets nothing? 

Just to put this in perspective
I have absolutely no friends. My entire life my only friend was her. I may just be her childhood friend but to me she was my only friend ever. She was the only person that was there for me.

4943,vkzqnz,Wide-Durian-6663,"It was just too exhausting. The things I had to do to keep the friendship alive. We had a mini clique back in highschool and I was kinda, sorta, the 'leader.' It was no 'mean girls' kind of clique but just a bunch of girls that are not popular, who also just don't want to be alone. Years pass by and we meet each time it is someone's birthday. The set up was not perfect but I learned to accept it and made accomodations to everyone's ""busy"" schedule as well as their likes and dislikes.

This year, I was just exhausted about all my relationship but I thought to myself, this the one friendship I am willing to fight for, turns out, I was already a ticking time bomb and just over it. One friend was ticked due to change of plans and decided to not go the birthday celebration. I was heartbroken. This is the only occasion that I really care about and she knows that full well, and she decided not to go. I begged, pleaded and asked why, what is going on, how can someone be so ticked to decide to just not go to an occasion we have been planning and we have been doing in forever. 

I cried for days, it really felt like she was checked out on the relationship, as for the others, they can barely care. I felt like I was the only one feeling things. I thought this is probably because I was the only one single in the group, I work from home so I barely have social events and highly introverted, so whomever I have, that's it for me. Sigh üòî

I was left constantly second-guessing myself. I started reading 'the mountain is you' by Brianna Wiest and I was presented by an idea that maybe, just maybe, they are not my people. That there is life that exists where I don't have to constantly beg for people's time and attention. Where I am not the only one putting up effort... Where there is a friend I can call when I am feeling down and not just be shutdown by laughing emojis... And there is a friend who would be happy to share life events to me ...

I am not perfect, but I saw myself slowly growing cold because of people like them. I see my light slowly dying because of confusing signs of whether or not you want me in your life.

Hey all

(English is not my 1st language so excuse the grammar)

I am 31F and i have gotten to the point in my life where i feel i will never love anyone. Has anyone felt this way ? I don't have a problem finding suitors and guys tend to catch feeling for me but i just dont feel the same. I cant help myself. I feel so numb. I just dont gaf about anything these days.

I do want kids and a family, so i am almost starting to think maybe i should just pick someone and go ahead with the family making. I feel like this is something that would make me really happy and suit  
me. I do have a career in my respected field but i really don't get any happiness or self-fulfillment out of that. I do like it but its like...meh. I do it for the money. I wish i had something i truly love.

My last relationship ended about a year ago, it wasn't the best and the guy was ''narcsissist''. Im over that now completely and i have healed. The problem is, that i have so many nice, decent guys interested in me and i just don't like them.

There has only been one person in this life, that i could see myself with but that's never going to work out so im not hoping for him. I think its part of the reason i cant find anyone else attractive because i always compare to him.

I feel so alone, sad and without perspective. I know that me being lonely is my fault and my fault only. People tell me that all the time, that im too picky. But then again, i do want someone who i at least like a little.

I don't have problem meeting guys but finding anyone interesting :( :( I feel like a bad person for that.

Has anyone ever felt this way and actually was able to feel again? Or is ''love'' overrated and i should just pick with my head (like some of my friends have done, but they are not particulary happy i must say) Any experiences similar to mine?

I am so sad about this and i really don't know how to help myself. I have struggled with depression a big part of my life and this situation is not making it better. I do take AD's atm, i think if i didnt i would not be here anymore. I just hate always being the lonely one.",2022-06-26 13:58:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639086426,2,/r/lonely/comments/vl5b6k/lonely_and_unable_to_love/,,0,7,Lonely and unable to love
4973,vl5do9,FearlessEmu8423,"I‚Äôm really tired of feeling like I‚Äôm in this world by myself and confused. It feels like I‚Äôm not aloud to say I do want to be in a relationship and that I do care what men think about me and how I look. Everyday I get so many conflicting ideas on social media do this if you want a man, do this if you want a man to take you seriously. It‚Äôs just so many ideas and I‚Äôm just spending my adult life just spinning in circles doing everything trying to figure out how to get a man to love me and I‚Äôm worn out. 

It‚Äôs just so exhausted going on all these dates, meeting different people trying figure out what they want. These guy want you to look like this, you can‚Äôt say certain things those guys because then your to ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù. Your not aloud to express hurt or anger or distrust in men because then your ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù.  Your expected to just keep giving and giving and being used and you have to do it with a smile and ‚Äúfeminine energy‚Äù. I wish Y‚Äôall knew every hoop I jumped threw for men losing weight, gaining weight, changing my hair, my job, moving, giving away my money my time my body for men begging men to love me and they just won‚Äôt. I checked every box I was lead to believe I needed to check in order to find a life partner. 

I joined the military and had a respect job. I remain fit, feminine, no record, natural hair, no kids, good job and I‚Äôm still not enough and I don‚Äôt know what else Is wrong with me. I‚Äôve never said he had to be this tall, or make this much money because I honestly didn‚Äôt care I just wanted to be loved. I just wanted somebody who would really stick beside me and not take advantage of me. I just can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself but what other choice do I have then to keep playing the game? I want a family more then anything because I don‚Äôt have one or anybody really and I‚Äôm just so tired of living in this world by myself. I don‚Äôt have any kids, no siblings so no nieces or nephews. No uncles or aunts my mother had 1 brother and they have both passed. My grandmother has dementia she doesn‚Äôt know who I am. I have a few people I‚Äôm friendly with but nobody I could burden with this no girls nights or trips people have there own lives and families. When my mom died I was so sad I felt unnecessary here but I just couldn‚Äôt let myself fall to far because I still had the hope of a family. I thought I could create what I was missing and pour myself Into them. But I‚Äôm failing at that too. 

I just get sadder everyday and I just feel so used up.  I feel like I can‚Äôt trust any man anymore and I never wanted to be bitter or broken but I guess I am. And I‚Äôm mad. Nobody in this world needs me and I don‚Äôt make any bodies life better I‚Äôm useless here. If I didn‚Äôt show up for work tomorrow my job wouldn‚Äôt even have anybody to call and ask. I‚Äôm exhausted and Im 30 I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to do this for another 40+ years.

4985,vl7afj,X_renamon_X,"**25M**. Before I didn't care if I didn't have many friends, a girlfriend and things like that because my hobbies were enough to be happy day after day. But since a couple of weeks ago I started to feel...lonely. I live with my father and sister so I am not completely alone, even so I feel that I want to be with someone, give and receive affection, **love**. I am someone who imagines or fantasizes a lot and that makes things worse because it makes me continually think ""I wish it were like that"".

Now, following the title. When I woke up today I felt bad, in fact I still feel bad right now. I was nauseous and thought it was just that but after a while I began to realize that it wasn't. I started to feel like I want to cry, I cried a little bit. Now I still want to cry , I guess I need to vent.

  
I suppose that for years this feeling of loneliness has been accumulating without realizing it and now it is beginning to take effect.

Currently it is really difficult or almost impossible to find someone and it is my fault, since I live very isolated from society. The only people I talk to are my 3 best and only friends.

I fully recognise she has made the effort to be friends / be friendly and keep it that way, but it still stings. Without sounding too sappy about the whole ‚ÄòThe heart wants what the heart wants‚Äô, I wish I could move on sometimes but I struggle to give up hoping that she might change her mind, even though I can rationally say that is likely to never happen, especially considering she turned me down once already, and only talks to me when I reach out to her (not vice versa).

5011,vlap7d,J7944,"My best friend of 3 years is ghosting me and IDK what I did wrong....

Just...I'm not sure, venting. Don't want advice. Please don't give it. Just need to get this off my chest.

I recently celebrated my birthday (in my late twenties), and went bar hopping with Bestie (F 29), another friend, K (M 32), and my partner of 1.5 years. We had a good time, but as the night wore on, I could tell Bestie was getting more irritable. I thought it was because Partner, K, and I got drunk and started talking about anime, and Bestie isn't a nerd like that. But even so, her annoyance really didn't seem to add up. I'm sure we were being mildly loud and goofy, but not obscenely. She even started snapping at me as the evening came to a close. We got back to my place, K passed out on my couch, and Bestie gave me a weak hug and left. 

Later, Partner and K both commented on her attitude and said that she was probably mad attention wasn't on her. K even stated that at my birthday last year, she had attempted to flirt with him and got actually mad when he turned down her advances. Even said, ""Well, I thought you came out so we could have fun?"" K is a very handsome, ex-military guy. But he politely told me she wasn't his type. 

This girl is a handful. I won't lie. We bonded after my mother passed away from cancer very suddenly, so I know our relationship is trauma-based and not the healthiest. But it still sucks. I don't have many friends. I had an unorthodox childhood and wasn't ever around kids to grow up with. I have my own batch of mental health issues, such as avoidant attachment and anxiety, so I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with. But I've always tried to be an uplifting and supportive friend.

I'm not one to text constantly and demand attention or confront someone. I feel like if it's important enough, they will reach out. And maybe that isn't healthy either, but I've always been that way. 

Roughly two days ago, Bestie randomly texted me and asked me out for drinks. I was at the gym and running errands, so I couldn't go. By the time I got home, I asked if she still wanted to hang out, and she said no. She was in a mood and just wanted to stay home and watch TV. I don't know if me not dropping everything to go see her then and there upset her, or what. Then, yesterday, I was bored and had the day off. I decided to go to the movies spontaneously and invited her. But she said no, she was waiting to see that exact movie with her mother (they do a lot together, so that was fine. But it still hurt a bit.)

I know this is a lot. If you read the whole thing, thanks. Like I said, I try own my own issues and definitely know I'm not some perfect little victim, nor am I trying to come across that way. I just feel like I'm losing my best friend. It sucks, but on a weird flipside, I also feel somewhat relieved. Bestie is mildly toxic and demanding and having the month to myself with less drama has been nice. But it also isn't because I don't have anyone to talk to other than my Partner, who is great and supportive. But it's not the same. 

Anyway, that's really it. 

Again, not looking for advice or input. Just needed a somewhere to vent.",2022-06-26 18:10:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656264591,5,/r/lonely/comments/vlap7d/ghosted_by_my_best_friend/,,0,13,Ghosted by my Best Friend

5017,vlb427,notokipromise,"I'm (31M) from Florida and I have  a Filipina Girlfriend. We've been nevermets (in a relationship without seeing each other personally) for about a year now and we have been doing everything that we can to get her here. She filed for a passport renewal a few months ago and knowing that we had to wait for the appointment slot for so many months (it's hard to get a passport in Manila) and knowing that she's doing everything on her own makes me proud. 

After she got the passport, we immediately filed for a visa application (which is kind of expensive) and it took us another couple months. She went to the interview with the important papers and her huge hope of coming in here. Halfway through the interview, the consul stopped asking her questions and just told her that they have to deny my GF's application.

We didn't know why. My GF went home with a heavy heart and that was the only time when she could text me (phone's are not allowed inside the visa office), she told me she tried everything but still nothing is happening. She wants us to take a break. But I don't want to. But I respect her so much and now I'm torn between giving her what she wants or I should continue fighting for our relationship. She has done so much and I feel so guilty.

I want her to know that I am willing to compromise. I am here. I want us to finally be together. I want everything and I'm not backing out.

I'm planning to surprise her a few months from now by going there but I'm afraid that I will get rejected. I don't want to fuck this up, she's the reason why I started to believe that something good can still happen to me.

5049,vlehj3,Substantial_Ad_9889," Dating sucks for everyone. When you're in this disastrous pool of debauchery, random profiles on dating apps, ghosting, hookups, cheaters and emotional inteligence of a dead fish it's really easy to loose hope.

Sometimes the connection and chemistry are on point, but then I am told (or showed) that the dude treats the dating app we met on like an uber eats for pussy. Sometimes the dudes are just nice, but nothing more. And sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a donut.

No disrespect to any of the guys there (most of them have been really nice from my experience), but I feel like I'm swimming in a garbage dump, trying to find a pearl. Is love really that rare?

Meeting people is like having a second job and I feel so drained right now. Of course I'm taking breaks, but each time the desire to get back on apps is less and less encouraging for me. For now it feels like I'll never find anyone, ever.

By the way - I'm having support from family and friends, I have a cool job and hobbies, I have always something to do - I'm not desperate. Just sad that the primal need I have - to be loved and cuddled - is still unmet.

Just by scrolling through a feed of everyone else enjoying themselves, having friends, successful with attraction, and doing things is a MAJOR slap in the face to us who've struggled to adapt or keep up with the constant changes. 

I fucking hate being lonely. Even with ""material distractions"" like a nice car, decent clothes, and even good looks I still have NO friends. I can't attract anyone. I'm like a fucking repellent. 

I'm so tired to the point where I don't want to even take care of myself anymore.

5101,vlj8nx,Far_Car_8615,"I had a girlfriend for 6 years. We did everything together. Went through high school, graduated. We experienced lots of ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù together. But to say that this relationship had its issues would be an understatement. It was tough as hell most of the times. She suffered from extreme anxiety and was constantly stressed out about pretty much everything. She also had medical conditions that is honestly a whole story within itself. I think a lot of this came from her childhood experiences. Obviously this wasn‚Äôt good for my mental health neither, but I guess I‚Äôm a nurturer. I love helping people and being there for people, especially people I care about. I want to make them happy and give them a reason to keep going. Anyways, fast forward  a year ago and we ended up breaking it off at the same park we had our first date. We were both exhausted and realized it was probably for the best. We‚Äôve had so many ‚ÄúI think we should break up‚Äù talks in the past that I was convinced we would never do it. But this time was for real, and we both new it. Anyways, i told her to keep searching for what she wanted out of life and I haven‚Äôt talked or seen her since. I get extreme anxiety when I cross over to the side of town where she lives (I‚Äôm not even sure if she still lives there) and I‚Äôm terrified of bumping into her one day. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôd do. She was an extremely kind but lost soul traveling in a world that was way too harsh for her and I wish the absolute best for her future. Anyways, I still think about her constantly but I figure the healthy thing is to start ‚Äúlooking‚Äù again. There‚Äôs this girl at work that started staring at me hardcore. We would constantly catch each other sneaking glimpses at each other. Obviously I took this as ‚Äúshe‚Äôs into me‚Äù but because it‚Äôs literally been since high school that I‚Äôve actually walked up to a girl and started talking to her, it took me awhile before I actually got the courage to at least speak to her. She seems too attractive to be into somebody like me but maybe that‚Äôs just me talking down on myself. One day I decided to finally talk to her so I did and we chatted a little. I asked her what she does outside of work and almost immediately she mentioned she had a husband .-. I get for most people love and attraction are two entirely separate things but this almost seemed malicious. I don‚Äôt know, I guess I don‚Äôt blame her for have feelings of attraction but to this day, every morning she strikes up a conversation with me as if she still wants this to go somewhere. I‚Äôm cool with being friends but it‚Äôs kind of weird being friends with someone you‚Äôve caught numerous times catching mad glimpses at you. Anyways, I find myself thinking of my ex more than ever nowadays and it‚Äôs making me miserable. After graduation we became completely reliant on each other and cut everyone we knew out of our lives (mainly our friends). So after the breakup I‚Äôve found myself, for the first time in my life, completely alone. But I keeping moving, one day at a time, trying to make the most out of it and not let it define me. Finally practicing what I was preaching to her for all those years. I do wonder if she lives by anything I said I‚Äôve ever said to her. Guess I‚Äôll never know.

5118,vlkgtz,gunsmithalex,"So I (29M) was chatting with this girl (31F) whom I match in Tinder, and now she told me that our relationship is not going to work because she thought that sex and all was going to be a problem and basically dumped me.

Context: I've been in dating apps for over 5 years with ups and downs... well, only downs if I got to be honest. Anyway, I matched with this girl and we get along pretty good, we got sale interests, you know the drill. Recently she got horny and ask me to do a video call in which we both get naked, it was really good and sexy (I love this kind of interaction), but later on she felt lots of shame because, as she told me, she gave me another impression not this one. We talk and I explained her that this didn't change my impression of her and that I really liked it and that we could work our way to a relationship including the sex. But at the end she couldn't bare it and dumped me, her reason being that she didn't want to start a relationship with sex and wanted something else. I tried to explain to her that I didn't mind and I was interested in being romantic more than horny and so...

She said ""ok, let's do it"" but at the end she dumped me anyway. Saying it isn't my fault that my action or words didn't influence her decisition, ""It's all on me"" she said and left.


I really think I'm the one to blame here, Idk if I'm cursed or something because simply I can't get a relationship. Was I the baddie?, I didn't started this slide, I accepted it and asked her all the way if she wanted and by the end of all it didn't matter. Really hurts me, because I start to think that maybe I'm not designed to be with other, I end up hunting them by action or inaction, by caring or helping, idk...

I said ""Well, let's keep going"" but that's a lie, I will remember this all my life, I'll carry it even when I don't want to, this will hurt me forever, can I be with other?, am I going to find my significant other?, a girl I can be with before my time expires?

I've had people who I thought were my friends try to convince me to have a physical relationship with them when I was mentally not doing well and acting out. I've had female friends just use me as a therapist and like only be there for the fun times but not for bad times. Although I've always been there for their bad times. They couldn't be there for mine. I've had one leave me bc I could no longer play the therapist role after going through the most traumatic event of my life. She didn't know what I was going through but she probably thought that I didn't care about what she was going through. A theme in my female friendships is that people don't care to ask to how I'm doing or if I actually say how I am then it's too much for them. I'm going through something very intense. I guess it's not fun to be around and after going through an assault I've had my female friends distance themselves from me bc I couldn't be their emotional support or their fun party friend anymore like how I used to be. I'm no longer of use. I needed them this time tho and they didn't want to be there for me which has broken my heart more than any romantic relationship can. I expect men to break my heart but when it's someone who referred to me as their sister one point in time it really hurts. Nobody wants to be around a sad person that zones out all of the time. That can't crack jokes anymore. I honestly lost two girls that I thought were going to be my sisters for life. I'm distraught. I have trust issues.

My mom is not so much of the listener type, but she is caring in some ways too. But it makes me really sad.

We just get so engrossed and indulged in the day to day proceedings that we forget to be thankful for what he already have. In the race to achieve greater and good things, we often lose our sense of peace and happiness and it troubles us for a period of time. If we were to appreciate what we have with ourselves at the present, maybe we could try to cherish the little things, instances and moments in our life and thus this way we try to find happiness in the smallest of possible things and therefore in the bigger picture, we would have an outlook and approach that would strive to create a positive and happy environment that would support for a healthy self growth and development. This outlook or style of approach has been helpful for a lot of people and so does research from Positive Psychology supports it. 
Some people do not take the efforts to acknowledge or appreciate the things they have in their life. When sometimes i walk through the streets of Bombay and see the poor people who have not been bestowed with what we have, my heart feels for them. I wonder to myself that such people even though not having all the amenities in life, still have that smile on their face and the happiness speaks through their smile. We would particularly compare ourselves to people of higher status, the ones who have a lot of money, cars and etc but to compare ourselves with a person of poor status is not something people do often.
The human aspect of being grateful for the things they have in life is very important for an individual to attain. Running after temporary things in life that cause loss in sense of peace and health by the temporary world has become very common.

I am that balding coworker who's always on his desk while the main character is head hunted for better jobs. And the main character always is able to one up on him. So it's justified that the coworker is stuck in his role and he doesn't deserve anything better.

I am that side character who sees the girl he's in love with flirting with a guy who claims to be the side character's best friend. The main character asks him if it's okay if he asks her out. He can't say no because then he's being unreasonable, is the bad guy and obviously the main character and the girl should be together. So what does he do? He says ""of course!"". The viewers don't care about him and that's the last time they see him.

I am that dull friend who just stands there and listens while the main character talks about his adventures and experiences. He doesn't have anything to add to it because he could never afford to travel, maybe?

5182,vlrfqw,Ryazas,"Trigger warning: abuse, self-harm, suicidal thoughts

Hi everyone. Yesterday I found this community and everyone seems really nice. I‚Äôm a 25 yrs old female and I‚Äôm struggling a lot with loneliness lately. Not just lately but I just need someone now more than ever.

I‚Äôve been through a lot in life and to be honest most of the time I had nobody who supported me. My mother used to mentally abuse me and both of my parents emotionally neglected me. I have no words to describe how _horrible_ that is. We used to have fights every day too so I was happy when I left the house. They taught me that who I was wasn‚Äôt good enough and it‚Äôs the hardest thing ever to change that feeling. When my parents divorced I supported both of them including my little brother. In all of that time there was only 1 person who asked me how I was doing. They just asked my brother and parents because everyone was just like: ye she can handle this. But I needed love and support too. 

I had a really toxic relationship for 5 years, where he used to beat me and broke me mentally. It took me 5 years to get the courage to break up. He cheated too, threatened to kill himself when I left him and he threatened me too. Again, nobody was there to support me. I shut down all of my feelings.

In 2016 I‚Äôve had a rare type of cancer and when I‚Äôve had the operations to remove the cancer I just broke down. I got depression, anxiety disorders and I started to hurt myself. I was all by myself, nobody noticed it and everyone ignored my asks for help. I went into therapy and ever since then I am in therapy. Currently I‚Äôm in therapy for other things but tbh I‚Äôm not sure if I want to do this anymore. A lot more happend in my life but I don‚Äôt want to tell everything because it would be a long story lol.

I have no loving family, no boyfriend, no parents who support me, and I don‚Äôt even love myself even tho I‚Äôm trying too. I literally told my best friend I‚Äôm not doing well and asked her for help, but she doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with it so she ignored it. I understand, but I‚Äôm so fucking tired of people ignoring my needs. 

Every day I fight and I don‚Äôt even know what it feels like to be happy. I‚Äôm _lonely af_ and I just need someone to be there for me just how I am for others. I just want some love.",2022-06-27 09:24:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622938628,4,/r/lonely/comments/vlrfqw/new_member_story_time/,,0,9,new member story time

They all have that one friend they spend more time with. They might have been friends longer than me or just understand each other better. They tell me I'm one of their best friends but I know that, let's just use their initials, H &amp; S are best friends. I know that E &amp; A are best friends. I will never be as close to them as they are to each other. They do want me to be with them but I always feel like I'm third-wheeling. They have their dynamic and I'm just watching from outside and feeling alone once again. They have a lot more chemistry between each other and I don't belong there. I know that it isn't their fault that they just don't like me that much but it still kinda hurts. I'm no one's #1. I'm not **that** important to anyone.

If they wanted me to be with them, why would H &amp; S meet up with two other friends and send photos of it into our group chat without even asking me to come over? They probably wanted to have an evening with another pair of best friends. I might be overanalyzing this but who tf cares.
And this group also vibes a lot better with each other. Whenever I'm with them I also feel that the two pairs of best friends chill and I'm just there. I will never really be a part of any group.

And even though ive dreamt and imagined countless times what it would be like to have a loving, caring girl by my side, if I try to imagine it being a geniune reality, it feels weird.

Like, I think about what it would be like, imagining going out, shopping, watching Movies and cuddling together with a girlfriend. And it seems so unreal. Like its complete Fantasy or science fiction.

Maybe its because im so used to be completely alone all the time, that experiencing the opposite just feels super unrealistic.

I do have a couple of friends, but I wouldn't say they are very good friends to be honest and I still feel isolated especially now that it's the summer holidays for me.  I play with my friends online most of the time but usually it's either they are really mean and say offensive things which upsets me a lot, or they are listening to music or watching videos! I really like speaking to people in a voice chat but these things happen too often when I look for friends or they just ghost me at some point. My friends also make fun of me for some of the things I like such as the pigtails hairstyle, all because they think its for younger people when it really isn't! Plus they make fun of me all because I get upset over the horrible things they say.  I'll admit yesterday was a great day because it was my birthday and I did get to take a lot of the family to my party which was at an arcade and laser tag, just sucks that I had no friend to come with me as well.  I also have anxiety, shyness, and other social problems as well, I can't start a conversation with someone very well, I always get anxious when I'm around a bunch of people in school, and I find it hard to enjoy myself with a friend when they are with others! I prefer talking to individuals.  But yeah I would love to make friends here, also for extra help please if it's OK can someone recommend me a community where I can make some friends?

Honestly I‚Äôm writing here because the passed few months I‚Äôve been very lonely, and I do feel that this is all my doing I‚Äôve always had the mentality I don‚Äôt need friends. when I was in school I would always have three or four friends and that was it I can‚Äôt do manny people at once but after school ended I had absolutely no way to stay in contact with most of them and the ones I do still have contact with live in a different state but this loneliness is not about friendships nor even love but some sort of romantic-ish buddy ‚Ä¶I know that must be odd to Have these fantasy‚Äôs I am 22 and I‚Äôm still a Virgin I can see why I‚Äôm not the most conventionally attractive at all for some rough description I have lightish  mocha/Caramel skin tone and a stocky build and  when I look in the mirror there are very few features of myself that I say oh hey that‚Äôs kinda cute or that‚Äôs not bad looking beyond that though I isolate myself I have trouble functioning in larger crowds and it‚Äôs hard to imagine finding a place to just go and hang out that‚Äôs quiet and not crowded and even then if I did I know what I hope for it absolutely absurd the types of fantasy I have about finding these buddies or two I‚Äôd like to have aren‚Äôt the same as When I was in school it‚Äôs always of a sexual nature those weird porn names that make no sense in real life if you will, though at the bottom end of it I just want to touch and be tocuhed by another Guy/Person  not only sexualy I suppose you can say my life is one of little affection 22 and still haven‚Äôt even had my first kiss and I‚Äôve never cuddled with another person sense I was a kid cuddling with his parents. I think beacuse of this is why I feel lonely and empty, what I want is a friend who would do those things with me without need to put labels on it and let each other free to do what we want both with and outside of eachother but I know my wants are to specific and I know that with my lack of going out to even try to meet people there is no way for me to ever find something like that and yet I can‚Äôt do it for my own limits both mentally and other more outside factors such as I don‚Äôt have my own car so I suppose I write here because though I know or at least feel I can change my situation in my life telling someone anyone about it just maybe might make me feel less empty inside of my chest so telling all the lovely people here who are in similar situations I hope does something anything at all truly. and I‚Äôm sorry for pouring all this out to you and I know that this pales in comparison to probably everything else here but if anyone actually listened or rather Read then I thank you I also hope that it has not dampened your mood to much and I hope y‚Äôall have a wonderful day ahead of you!",2022-06-27 18:55:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626861691,8,/r/lonely/comments/vm2xi6/empty_and_knowing_why/,,0,0,Empty And Knowing why.

I would say I feel optimistic to find someone like-minded but I realise I'm a minority in society.

If someone messaged me it would be nice if we had some common ground and some info about yourself c:

A few main things about me would be:

I love creepy videos on YouTube and general true crime or horror related stuff such as Junji Ito, or just educational rabbit hole content that youtube algorithm recommends to me xD

I'm a bit of an anime nerd, I haven't watched anything recently other than demon slayer season 2, but my favs were devilman crybaby (mainly for the ost), jojos bizarre adventure, attack on titan, Erased and Made in abyss to name a few\~

My fav music would be EDM, synthwave sort of music but I have several hundred songs on my playlist some artist that come to mind that I like are in no particular order The weeknd, gorillaz, tame impala, porter Robinson, s√°imes, basshunter and random game OST stuff like persona 5 or something haha

I'm currently play Lost Ark a bunch atm, but my fav games in general are dark souls borne + sekiro and elden ring stuff, god of war, monster hunter, final fantasy series in general, resident evil, persona 5 amongst other stuff, I also played runescape for years one of my fav childhood games

Also I enjoy art and creative stuff in general, mainly like colouring and lineart stuff so if you like to draw I'd love to see

Lastly I have a pet hamter, he says hi üêπ

I feel like I'm a good listener and don't take myself too seriously or anything like that, I personally hate the feeling like I could be stepping on eggshells around people

For the others who continue I apologize yet again, but for the lack of words I don‚Äôt have to describe it I can however describe it in overwhelming detail and I would like to get it off my chest this way once again I do not blame you if you do not read it all. I shall begin now in the with that I am unsure if I wish to live or die. I do not wish to be melodramatic when I say I am in pain. Pain may not be the correct word for it either. I don‚Äôt know how to lead into this I want to be strong, but I feel I am weak. I have tried committing suicide in the past I cannot remember why though I just know I felt so alone so utterly and completely alone when I still had others around me. I obviously survived and I then told my parents what I had done. They were understandably upset with me and just asked I never do it again. They asked if I needed therapy and I said no. The reason I have brought this up is not because I blame them for anything it just hurts that was one of the few times I have ever genuinely felt like I was seen by them and the last time I had cried. They aren‚Äôt bad people my Father is a stoic man who I have seen cry a few times he has been smoking most of his life and has lung cancer. My mother has health issues and struggles with her depression. They are both good people I do not blame them for me.  It felt nice getting that off my chest I do not like getting sympathy from others due to my parents situation I don‚Äôt like bringing it up at all if I can I just wanted to get it off my chest. To get back on topic of my own pain or whatever it is I would like to describe the overwhelming pressure it puts onto me. I would like to talk about the physical pressure first such as this sorta empty feeling in my chest that constantly hurts and makes me feel as if there is a huge weight on my chest and sometimes makes it extremely unbearable to sometime inhale and exhale. As well as being aware of what feels like every hair on my body and what it feels like. Now then this is the last thing I would like to talk about. I would like to talk about my emotions I feel I have a fake self when talking to others a fake happy self I show others so they do not worry. However it doesn‚Äôt feel real and I don‚Äôt even do it on purpose sometimes I feel I am just watching some act as me while I stay on the sideline and watch. Other times however I feel cold distant within myself and at the same time keenly aware of everything around me and In me. everything around me isn‚Äôt overwhelming it‚Äôs this feeling of sadness where I want to cry and I went to bawl out in tears and let it out yet my body is completely dead not a single tear will even begin to form and my voice feels trapped within my throat. This is the pain I speak of the complete pain of being trapped within myself and wanting to escape it. The isolation the encasement and just the pressure it makes me consider dying I tried to be strong and overcome this, but no matter how strong I become or believe myself to become I cannot escape it I‚Äôve tried countless times it feels like and yet it always feel like I‚Äôm in its grasps.

5334,vmfv8f,Trdrrrr,"I have no friends. I'm sure this isn't a groundbreaking post on this sub or anything, I just wanted to rant a bit. Warning, it's long.

I've always kinda been a misfit- I'm super shy, skinny, also a minority (asian) so I'm sure you can already picture me in your head a bit. The only ""good"" quality of me (as deemed by society) is that I'm quite tall, but that's not really a good thing because I have bad posture from sitting so much, and also being tall makes you stick out in crowds, so all people see is a skinny nerd with bad posture.

Just a bit of background. I had a few friends growing up, but most of them were family friends, which meant it was easy since our parents were already friends. So I never really learned how to make a friend myself. A few of them moved away, others found their own friend groups.

But what really did me in was this- at around sophomore year of high school, I went off to a boarding school (which I highly regret doing btw because it effectively terminated all my old friendships) and I realized I had no friends anymore.

And once I got there, I messed up by not socializing enough my first year, and was left behind. By the time I wanted to change something, it was already late junior year of high school, and all the social circles were established. Now at the time, I thought that was fine for me- it would be really awkward to try and insert myself into one of these friend groups, so I just took the (bad) advice to focus on myself.

Mostly focusing on academics, but also working at hobbies and just trying to be an interesting and well educated person. So no, I never had the quintessential high school experience. I never went to prom, or parties, or anything to do with girls, or whatever the hell else other normal kids do at that age. I fell into a deep video game addiction, the only way I knew how to cope with the loneliness. The only person I talked with was my roommate, who I lost contact with after I moved out.

Fast forward- I got into a decent college with a good program, majoring in something I liked reasonably enough. Freshman year was all online- fine, COVID happened. That was a reasonable excuse to justify why I still had no friends, right? But no, that summer was miserable.

For the first time in my life, the loneliness started hurting. Up to this point I had always coped with loneliness by being ""productive"". Whether that meant schoolwork, sleeping, gaming, reading a book, doing a hobby, hell even something like showering or washing the dishes. As long I occupied myself. But this philosophy which I had carried for so long, started to fail me.

It just felt too robotic- every day I woke up, did my internship (which was remote so it was basically impossible to make friends), and slept. Over and over, for 90 days straight, over the summer. Objectively it wasn't that bad- I was making good money, had free time to work on my interests on the side, and still felt a bit of excitement to get up. But the loneliness that I had suppressed from years past had started to finally catch up to me.

It was subtle at first- my hobbies started to lost their glamour. What used to be so interesting, had suddenly become extremely disgusting and boring to me. At first, I thought I was just tired from doing them so much- but then I went months at a time without touching them, which turned into years. Then, video games, something which I had used to cope with my loneliness, suddenly stopped working. I couldn't stand them anymore. They started to become unfun, and as a result I had a ton of extra time, which just rubbed it in all the more. 

Then, I started having trouble sleeping at night. Staying up until 5am became a common thing. And it wasn't like I was doing anything- most of that time was spent idling on some social media platform, or watching youtube videos in my recommended. I started to masturbate a lot more. By the end of the summer, I was ready to get out of my room for good. After all, that meant I was going back to school again and could finally break this downward spiral.

I was going into my sophomore year of college and I told myself that no matter what, I would find a way to make one new friend. Just one. Surely, I could do that much. This was the moment I would finally break out of my shell.

And, well, absolutely nothing changed. I was too scared to go into school clubs (not like bars, but clubs in school) to meet people. I walked to the very doors of the meetings, heard the voice of people laughing and having fun, and it just- scared me. I didn't want people to see me- I felt they would know instantly that I was a complete loser. That I didn't make friends in high school. That I wasn't someone who would introduce them to more people, because I didn't have any of my own friends. I felt like I didn't deserve to be in the same room with these people.

Then, being too scared to enter the club room, I would just turn around and go back to my dorm, cursing at myself on the way back. I was even too scared to even talk on public discords, for fear of looking stupid. That's how little confidence I had in myself. Why was I like this? Why am I so afraid of talking to people? It's then that I realized my confidence was gone. I spent so long looking at other people's lives that I forgot how to live my own.

Every day, I would see groups of college students walking down the busy street, going to restaurants, parties, lectures, and making memories together. The loud laughter they generated. The way they all walked in sync, smiles on each of their faces, and you just knew they were the best of friends, a camaraderie, forming close bonds that would probably last into their old age. Most likely, they would all stay together and help one another through the journey of life. They would go to each others marriages, meet each other's kids, and boost each other careers. What an amazing thing. I know this sounds exaggerated, but at the same time, you can't deny that it is true to some extent. College is the absolute best period of your life to meet friends and even find a future partner- and I was squandering it.

In those very moment I felt absolutely disgusted at myself. What the hell am I doing? Why can't I just be in one of these groups? What I would do to be normal again... I felt like I was falling behind, and every time I passed these groups I just wanted to die.

Fast forward a year, and it's summer again. I'm going back into that same downward spiral. This year, it's even worse. I can barely bring myself to do my internship anymore. I used to love producing music, or making video games, or playing chess (my hobbies). But now, all those things disgust me. How can you be creative when being lonely is always on your mind? Who will care if I make a new song, or release another video game? No one. Absolutely nobody will.

Every day, I just want to sleep in until 1pm and watch mindless youtube videos or browse 4chan. I feel myself going down the NEET path, though I probably will never fully go down it since my (very asian) parents would kill me. My discord, reddit and phone are still empty. I check them everyday anyways. For what even? No one is going to message me. No one knows I exist.

I used to lurk discord servers, or watch twitch streams for hours on end, but why do that anymore? They don't care about me. No one cares. I don't even type in any of them, so why bother? I'm too much of a pussy to talk to anyone, even online.

Hell, even writing this post is hard for me. It's embarassing. I don't want to admit I have a problem, but I do have one. Everyone is living their own lives, full of adventure. And sure, there might be some heartbreak or pain as well, but that's good right? At least they have an interesting story to tell from it. It's better than feeling absolutely nothing, like I do each day.

I'm turning 20 in a few weeks, and let me just put it this way. It's like I'm stuck at the start line of a track, the track of life, and I'm getting lapped by everyone. Some of my old friends, I've seen on social media. Some of them have girlfriends. Others are in pictures with big groups of people, smiling. Why can't I be like them? Where did it go wrong?

Don't get me wrong- I'm not an incel or something who believes getting a girlfriend will fix everything. That's just delusional. But you have to realize, working on yourself won't make you happy either. Humans rely on other humans for happiness- some more than others, but we all do to some extent. That's what I've realized deep down.

I've never believed in depression till now- maybe that's from my upbringing, or also that I refuse to believe that we can't change our circumstances. But for the first time in my life, I believe in it, and I feel utterly hopeless about my future- like nothing will change, and all my worst fears about being alone forever will come true.

i feel like the rest goes away if my ""friends"" make any effort to care about me. 

i feel like I'm not depressed if I'm lovable by people who dont only love me because i share blood with them.

I've had best friends that i genuinely cared about ghost me twice. I've had friends not accept my invitation to hang out. I've literally never been invited by a person other than my ex or family to hang out. people just don't care about me. 

speaking of my ex, i do my best to give her everything. shes the only person that ever wanted to talk to me regularly. I've realized that i will likely not be happy about myself years ago, so i clung on to her. all i care about is making her happy. (ik its not healthy so dont bother telling me) but yet even with my undying love and such a natural connection, she decides that she doesn't want to be more than friends. 

what a special kind of hell. no one wants to be my friend exept the one person who I want more from. my needs will never be met. I'm unwantable.

I'm very very grateful for my family because i know many don't have that. but at the same time, it feels like it means less than an authentic connection that was built because they actually like me.

5375,vmnyqc,sad_and_bored,"like the title reads, I just wanted to make it known and a little reminder how skewed the view of the world is through the lens of social media and dating apps. the cold hard truth is; these companies are not nearly concerned with the quality of the information you are being fed rather than the quantity. that‚Äôs how they make their money, engagement. they don‚Äôt care about you making friends. 

In fact, you are more likely to be shown something that is borderline provocative that will get you to quote retweet in a rage to you rather than something interesting that you will like and move on. tiktok is literally made to keep you on your ass for hours. same with YouTube which is unfortunately my guilty pleasure and escape. i credit Facebook for being the first real big platform to fester this culture of isolation and alienation, since zuckerfuck of all people literally created it just to rate who was hot or ugly at his school. makes you think, doesn‚Äôt it?

anyway, a lot of people my age credit social media for their networking and their capabilities of keeping their circle close. i ended up deleting instagram in a blind rage a couple years back and I still get some anxiety just thinking about going back to my account. for years I was under this pressure to meticulously craft some sort of facade of myself to show how fun I was to be around, that I deserved friends and hoped I would get invited to more things, but shit barely matters in the end. a lot of the time people want your company to look good, if they deem you as such a popular person. true friends will reach out to you just because they want to see how you‚Äôre doing. Instagram has definitely screwed up the way i experienced my adolescence. 

even Reddit, a lot of good comes out of this app but it doesn‚Äôt quite even out all the bullying and rude people. I‚Äôve seen people try to reach out for help here and comments would read just, awful awful things I wouldn‚Äôt imagine saying to a vulnerable person. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on dating apps. They are meant to keep you alone, no matter how they market themselves or how many acquaintances of yours are tinder success stories. they quite literally want to make you feel low just so you can come back to the app and see if you got any matches, just for that one tiny dopamine hit. i have been on tinder for years on and off, yet I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. I‚Äôve been on countless dates with people who seemed like they needed a rebound or some company. I would take one good night with someone who cares about me over this any day, yet that doesn‚Äôt seem to exist on dating apps. I try to avoid them now, realizing how much it is a dumpster fire trying to get your engagement so they can milk you for your money until you quit. these companies are fighting for our attention, not fighting for us to be happy. That is their last worry. They want you to keep redownloading hinge. 

anyway, rant aside, I hope everyone is having a good day. If you feel the same way I do, feel free to say something. shit is hard but I believe we can make people feel less alone if we voice our concerns and discuss how these things make us feel. i know im glad to be in a point where I don‚Äôt need to social media to thrive yet i feel so alone and disconnected. Anyone out there  feels the same?",2022-06-28 14:00:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1577655324,17,/r/lonely/comments/vmnyqc/youre_not_alone_social_media_has_destroyed_the/,,0,7,"you‚Äôre not alone. social media has destroyed the way we see friendships. if you feel lost, I‚Äôm with you"

5380,vmpd86,929yiyi,"Tw I guess, does mention suicide.

I‚Äôm a teenager, not too young but not too old, and I‚Äôve always had an empty life. My life was filled with people throwing me away then using me when the needed me, wether it be for money, lifting something, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

I made it through primary school (kindergarten to year 6) with no friends, then friends who had gaslighted me, and manipulated me into doing what they wanted. But the worse one, kept telling me that she was being bullied for hanging out with me, that they were bullying her for hanging with the fat kid, the weird kid. And that just made me feel so- dead.

As I made it to high school, I approached a kid on the second day and became friends. But sooner that year, more people joined this small friendship group and took the attention and any connection I‚Äôd ever had to the others. The only one I felt I could confide in were these two friends.

Friend one, my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù who‚Äôs a female, has been stolen away all the time by my step sister. Who joined my friend group since she wasn‚Äôt one to socialise. She took friend one from me, I never really even get to talk to her anymore as my step sister makes her leave where the group is sitting to go somewhere else. 

Then my male best friend use to be close to me, yet he‚Äôs just distant now. And I just feel so lonely, not even my parents have time. For me, my parents are always dealing with my suicidal mentally challenged sister, if I were to get the smallest bit of attention then she‚Äôd take it away by pulling a suicide stunt. 

I spend my days now, curled up in bed with the slightest hope someone may finally care about me on discord, when I go to school, I‚Äôm just often sitting alone, listening to music as my friends don‚Äôt even look for me, don‚Äôt ask where I‚Äôve been, hell, I‚Äôve had some say they didn‚Äôt notice I was gone. I feel so empty.

I‚Äôm too ugly for anyone to love, too fat for someone to want to hang around me, and I‚Äôm just never happy anymore. I feel so damn lonely that I don‚Äôt even care if I‚Äôd die. It would probably feel better than having to keep trying to sit around when I obviously have no friends that want me anymore.",2022-06-28 15:04:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1557034607,3,/r/lonely/comments/vmpd86/i_feel_like_i_have_nothing/,,0,3,I feel like I have nothing.

5387,vmr3iv,Soggy_Information616,"I (18M) just completed high school; besides the n number of problems thst are going on in my life currently, it's really just brutal to realise that these people I've known since 4th grade, are just nobodies to me anymore. I thought I had it good in my sophomore year I thought I had Friends, a community, people who liked me. And I thought the same through the pandemic. Now that, where I live it has reasonably come to a close, none of these old friends called me once, messaged me once, or even thought to tell me that a good friend I had committed suicide.

It's, terrible man; it's almost like I never had them as Freinds, our meeting and interactions were all circumstantial and those days that I spent with them in school, those days that felt so real and meaningful are in hindsight, entirely superficial. The more I think about it the more it dawns on me, we practically never met up after school, I barely messaged them because, ""bah I can tell him in school tomorrow anyway"".

And the thought that all this is over now, I will never see them again, school has come to a close for good; who are they to me? Who were they to me? Who was I to them? Was I really *anyone*? I saw a trailer for some Netflix show the other day, that show where the trailer goes, ""this summer, this boy, this could be my dream"" or some such thing. Shows like these are set in high school,  should I not have had at least some analogue of such an experience? One fun night out? Highschool romances and other related stories, I am past their target audience, aren't I? That feels so weird to say. 
    I feel not older than 12 and I feel like I wasted and am wasting my youth. I have no Friends who care, not family that gives a shit beyond schooling. I like to be alone in some sense, but the thought something I thought I had, never being there is viscerally painful. I don't know who I am.

5403,vmutdg,PieceOfPOS,"Let me first make clear that I am by no means an incel if you include misogyny as part of the definition. As of writing, my voice is shot from attending anti-Supreme Court protests both in my city and in DC every day since the horrific ruling came out. I also have female friends, although they are significantly older than me (retired women who I‚Äôve met through my volunteer work).

I am, however, an incel in the literal sense of ‚Äúinvoluntary celibate‚Äù. I‚Äôm a 23 year old cishet guy who‚Äôs never been in a romantic relationship before. I never get any likes on dating apps and I always get rejected by the women I approach in bars. 

I don‚Äôt see myself as being a bad person, and I actually have high self-esteem despite women viewing me extremely unfavorably. I see myself as an adventurous, interesting and kind-hearted person. I moved to a developing country to learn a rarely-studied foreign language for one year. I‚Äôm involved in two different volunteer programs to tutor immigrants and refugees in English skills and run prep classes for the American citizenship exam. I don‚Äôt have a massive social circle, but I‚Äôm not completely socially isolated either (I would say I have 4-5 friends who I meet up with at least once every two weeks, and some more acquittances I occasionally text with). I‚Äôm not ugly, maybe like a 5.5/10? 

Despite all of what I see as positive, attractive qualities, there aren‚Äôt women who are interested in me. Nothing ever seems to work, just endless misery and rejection. It makes me so upset that I considered chemical castration so that I don‚Äôt have any desire for romantic or sexual companionship, but I was told that I‚Äôd still have romantic desire so I decided against it. 

I don‚Äôt understand why women hate me so much, because I certainly don‚Äôt hate myself. I feel like the current dating culture is the reason I‚Äôm in this position. With the advent of dating apps, even unattractive women have 200-300 men pursuing them at any given time. I just feel like I‚Äôm not good enough and it‚Äôs impossible to get attractive enough to start dating, because the bar for straight men is at near-perfection since straight women have hundreds if not thousands of options.

I really don‚Äôt want to end up like all the violent misogynists that get posted here, but the further I go getting inevitably rejected by women, the more I start to empathize with their worldview.",2022-06-28 18:55:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644372773,62,/r/lonely/comments/vmutdg/dont_want_to_end_up_like_an_incel_but_no_one/,,0,47,"Don‚Äôt want to end up like an incel, but no one wants to date me and I feel like I‚Äôm falling into the incel sphere due to my frustration"

so into my problems: I just feel so alone in general. I have no relationship with my family, just casual ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre doing well!‚Äù texts every once in a great while. I have like maybe 2/3 friends that I can reach out to who I know will respond, but at some point you come to the realization that nobody‚Äôs waiting for you at the end of the day. no one‚Äôs asking how your day was or what it was like. my days are spent doing nothing but work because nothing brings me joy and I‚Äôm unable to find the energy to put myself out there considering whenever I do hang out with my close friends, we seem to do nothing. I‚Äôm ignored. just aimless conversation. it feels like I‚Äôm constantly going in one ear and out the other. it feels like I‚Äôm there physically but they wouldn‚Äôt notice if I wasn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt just tag along to eat or go shopping when they‚Äôre just on their phone the whole time telling me about their future plans with other people. I can‚Äôt keep texting them and waiting hours or days for a response. I‚Äôm always alone. with my thoughts and they aren‚Äôt good ones.

I‚Äôm trying to find joy in little things, but honestly doing everything alone and going day to day with no one to talk to, and no one to go out in public with, no friends to take pictures with during funny moments. it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted: to be included and indulged in, but no one really cares to. being alone and doing these things just constantly reminds me how alone I am, and how there is not one person who I can take with me. idk I‚Äôm bad at writing this out, when I think about what hurts or what I really define as a problem in my head, I just feel pain, so it‚Äôs hard for me to write it out. 

I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, that it‚Äôs my fault I‚Äôm distanced from people, when I‚Äôm a very personal person. I love going over details and picking someone apart in conversation, but it seems no one in my circle is interested.

5459,vn3n7y,idrovetoofaragain," About a year back, I had an amazing friend. We'll call him A for the sake of anonymity. A was my best friend through the entirety of middle school, and high school, and for the years after graduation. We always stuck together, always helped each other through tough shit, and I truly felt like I could be vulnerable around him as he did around me. We talked about life, about our pains, got advice from one another, and whenever there was something going on- we had each others' backs.

We had two little groups. One of which was the group with him, I, and a few other old classmates from high school. Probably...4 or 5 people total? We'd always get food together every now and again and I considered myself very close to them.

The second was my group I introduced to him, and they loved him, *at first*. It was 4 of us- 2 girls, and us 2 guys. We went on trips together, spent a lot of time around each other, and truly had a grand time every time we got in my little car together.

I started dating one of the girls from group 2. We kicked it off very strong and started doing about everything together. We'll call her S. A and I began to drift apart, and it took less for us to get upset at one another. Fights are normal with close friends, but we'd always repair them.

A lot of it was on me. I'm not saying I'm the sole culprit of the issues; there were some things he did that weren't cool, or that I didn't agree with, but I was immature in my attempts to rectify them, and chose the route of being a dick back.

One night, my ex-girlfriend (S) was driving, and I had a little bit too much to drink. I wasn't operating any vehicles. We met up at a park to talk, and I went off on him. All the tension that had been building up between the time we started dating and the day at the park erupted out of my mouth, and I basically told him that he was a terrible person, a terrible friend, and that he was wrong about everything he had to complain about.

I turned group 2 against him. I watched them block him, smiling. I was a complete, utter, jerk. I treated him like he was the antichrist.

I am aware what an AH move that was. If this was an ""AITA"" post, I'd absolutely be the AH. I compared him to another ex-member of our group who was, quite frankly, an awful and manipulative person, and basically said that if he didn't get his shit together he'd be nothing better than her.

I'm sure that shit cut deep. He drove off with another member of group 1, and I stopped talking with that entire group. So, now minus A, I had group 2, one of which I was in a very invested relationship with.

Quite frankly, a lot of that confidence (or...arrogance?) came from that relationship. I thought I was better than everyone because I was with S. We were very intimate, lived in the moment, and had a great time. I thought that she was all I needed- never crossed my mind once I may not have that, despite how different our priorities in life are.

Group 2 fizzed down to three. Myself, S, and S's friend. I started coming to her social events, a few parties, get togethers, and befriended a lot of her other friends. We did something just about every night, and I truly felt like I was on top of the world. I had a whole new arsenal of friends who I genuinely cared about, and cared about me. Beach days to hot tubs to jam sessions with a few of their little group's band. Lots of beers and lots of memories that, despite it all, I still cherish to date.

Then, we broke up, maybe 8 months after hooking up for the first time. Over time, she had become extremely harsh and hurtful, and I'm not just saying that to make myself look better this time. She was extremely distant, didn't communicate, and hurt me. If I had a grievance about something she did, she flipped it on me, and I didn't feel like my feelings were valid. Taste of my own medicine I guess?

I ended it. She smiled when I did. We were intimate for the last time that night, and went to one more party together at her house as ""friends."" Then, three days later, she was with someone else, and I was alone, as I am to date.

I tried to maintain relationships with that group of friends, but they all removed me as a contact, stopped responding, or even blocked me in some cases. I don't know what she told them about me, about us, but I don't want to know in the slightest.

So friend group 1, and friend group 2 is gone, and has been for a year now. I have had people to talk to online, but not a single true *friend* since then. And, man, I'm lonely.

I have so much regret over my choices in their entirety. I destroyed my best friend, the person I went on roadtrips all over the place with, who always had my back, who knew me better than even I knew myself. The one who woke up at 2:00 am to jump my car in the hail, driving illegally before he had a license to get to where my car was. The friend who would do anything for me. The group who I loved and cherish, and the second group who I knew would always be down to have a grand time.

I've tried to reconnect with A- but he's uninterested. I can't say I blame him in the slightest. I sent him two texts, one just inviting him to connect and one as a huge drunk apology letter, begging for forgiveness- never got a reply on either, so I stopped trying. I saw him driving the other day (he didn't see me) and he looked truly happy. I'm insanely happy that he was able to push past the bullcrap I put on him and the hurt I caused him to continue living life.

I know that, eventually, people will come- but it's been really lonely recently. I've probably been drunk at least a third of the nights I've gone to bed, and picked up a couple really bad habits to help dull the pain. I keep putting myself out there, going out, doing things, trying to live- but nothing's being yielded, and it hurts going home every day knowing that if I were to die, the only people that would even know would be my work and my mom.

Being twenty and having nobody sucks. Having nobody because of the actions you took, things you said, and way you approached things- that's a much, much, worse feeling that I don't think I'll ever be able to shake.

I just had to get it off my chest. I'm prepared for the hate. I've never told a soul this, and think writing about it in the full truth helps take it off my chest a bit",2022-06-29 01:40:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646120454,2,/r/lonely/comments/vn3n7y/i_used_to_have_ride_or_die_friends_who_always_had/,,0,1,"I used to have ""ride or die"" friends who always had my back.

I got a spam call and even tried to just talk to the person scamming and they wanted nothing to do with me lol. Life just seems like one big joke lately and I‚Äôm just a punchline.

5467,vn48sb,GERGAAA,"Ok, so a little bit of context.

I started college during the pandemic, so most classes were online. I'm a very lonely person, but there was a girl that got very close to me and made me feel good. Six months ago I met her in person and we started going out... for just a week. I was feeling very anxious with how she was in person (her personality wasn't as I had imagined and she would say really mean things about others) and I had to stop the relationship. It wasn't the best way to end it, just a week after, but I had to do it.

Since then I'm feeling lonelier. In the past she made me feel better by being always there, but I also felt really anxious with her around. Very weird thoughts, huh? I'm still glad it ended, but the repercussions weren't as expected.

We kind of tried to keep being friends for the first few weeks but I think she was expecting something different, like, I guess, me being the same way I was when we had feelings for each other. We haven't talked since April.

But I have some high school friends who have had the chance to meet her now that classes are in person. And they have alerted me that she has been telling everyone about our relationship and how I ended it in just a week. Someone told a friend of mine that he didn't like me because of this, even though he doesn't know me. Now I feel a little bit isolated, even now on summer vacation, but I can't imagine how I'll feel the moment classes begin again.

I mean, we are a very small group, and even though I don't consider myself an introvert, she is more skilled than me in meeting new people. I fear she will antagonize me with the whole group just as she did with other classmates a year ago and I reaaaally don't want to be very close to her now that I know what she's been telling everyone about me and our relationship. I think I will feel uncomfortable and would prefer not to hear about her while in classes. 

Any ideas on what could I do to feel a little bit better during classes?

So my grandparents supported me and I took a break and started working and I just study by my own and got my high school diploma before I turned 18. Now I'm an university student since a year and half.
In that time living with my grandparents I find out about an abuse that I suffered from the brother of my father and it really messed my head up, I wait a long time to tell my family, I first told my grandparents, then after a while I finally told my mother about it. The same day that I told her that, she told me that my father wasn't my biological father and that everyone in my family knows that. That freaking messed up my head even worse. She made a whole drama and I think she did it just because she didn't wanted to talk about it anymore, and she left, she told my brothers and my father (they are divorced) about my biological father thing and about what I told her.

5511,vnabb6,Invisibleman021183,"I know I get worked up over PDA and most of it that gets to me is just them putting their arms around each others backs or hugging. I'm at the coffee place and sat in the back. There is a back room which has a sofa and chair. Usually I get my coffee to go but I needed to get something done and it's a quiet place that helps me concentrate on what I have to do. I'm sitting there doing work and this couple comes by where I am. I assumed they were going to the bathroom but they didn't. Instead that stood in front of me, then bent down to open a couple books on a low shelf. The place has a few books. They look at each other and give each other a kiss and it wasn't a friendly one. It wasn't fast either like a peck but a slower kiss. I looked at them surprised. They looked back at me like I was being an a-hole and walked out. Obviously it lead to the lack of an ability to focus on my work and I had to walk out. I walked home in depression looking at the sidewalk. Those two did what I never will in front of me. Right in front of me. I'm the biggest f'ing loser ever and have been mentally beating myself up since it happened. I must punish myself for not being good enough and I deserve pain. I'm not good enough for any girls. I never have been and I never will be. I keep thinking about them kissing. The look they gave each other is in my memory. I'm all messed up and it's 4am. I can't sleep. Has this happened to you?  Since I've never had a relationship, it hurts that much more. What did you do when or if it happened to you? I don't mean a hug but a loving kiss or even more in front of you. One time a couple made out sitting in front of me and I shook as I walked home but that was years ago when my depression wasn't as bad. I should have never been born.

It's always people who are constantly surrounded by people who love them who say this stuff. Like, how do you know that? Huh? How can you, someone who's never had to face the feeling of nothing but sheer loneliness, the ache to have someone, anyone, even if they hurt you, know whether or not friends are optional?

I know having them back wouldn't fix anything either, but pretending it would gives me just a little bit of solace; it lets me pretend that there‚Äôs a solution to how I feel and what I am.

Maybe it's because *I'm* the friendless piece of human dogshit that doesn't have anyone else to fall back on; that's why it still hurts so bad.

I tried various things like working out, playing sports and all of that stuff to remove those thoughts. I watched porn in my childhood but somehow stopped watching it, so I can do something good in my life. But the truth is Im very bad at whatever I do and I'm a very slow learner. I'm just about to graduate in a year and I've done nothing I can be proud of and I know It would be very difficult for me to get a job with these skillsets. The only thing I'm good at is sports and especially Badminton and I love it very much but I can't make it my profession for various reasons. If I just got to play I'd be really happy and Id won't be seeking help here.

I've never been in a relationship, I tried to talk to women IRL but they never seemed to like me because I have nothing to give back in return. From what I've observed is that people only like someone who have great personality and all of that stuff and to give back something in return. I'm not intelligent but I am always seem so desperate to learn, but the problem is that I can't talk to people that well and it's killing me everyday.

I try to fix myself everyday but those perverted thoughts never go away, even when I am working out, studying or playing badminton.

I don't know what I want at this point, if just get good at my studies, that would be more than enough, then I can get a decent job and can have a relationship. I know most of the women don't like perverted people but I want to change myself but nothing is helping. I can't go to a therapist too because of some personal reasons, I know they can help.

I'm really tired of my life, I keep studying, working out, do various things that would help to get out of this situation but nothing's helping.

5532,vngqqt,throwzzzawayzzs,"I am 20. I have no friends and don't interact with my family.

A couple of years ago, I had been through so much trauma school/family related that I became a social void. I cut ties with everyone and I was not (and am not) regretting it.

I have some moral values that, well, people my age never do. For instance, I am straight edge and have never and will never do any type of drugs. I am also sexually abstinent (and a virgin) as I don't see sex as something worth pursuing for quote on quote ""self satisfaction"", but as a symbol of adoration for someone, something that you do to someone who means everything to you and something that should only be shared between two like-minded people. These values, coupled with many more, amount to my ""options"" being practically non-existent.

I never found someone to connect with, I never found someone that I'd like to be around and get to know, because I never met someone that shares (at least part) of my values. That's not to say people are not interested in me, I often find myself being chatted up and flirted with, but I simply don't reach anything close to a relationship as I always shut it down whenever someone else has values that do not match mine.

I am content with my decision, but sometimes, embarassingly, I find myself wishing I had someone that was like me.

I'm just feeling lonely. Like no one cares. My friends don't message me and I have to initiate everything. I don't get texts or calls. I have to do it.

5538,vni5qz,RoutinePhrase4620,"(This is a longer read if you have time I‚Äôd appreciate It so much. I feel like I don‚Äôt know where to start but I‚Äôve had a really close best friend for about 4 years now, we had a break this fall for about 2 months after a vacation we went on (if someone actually reads all this I‚Äôd love to vent about what happened on this vacation I did fuck up) (it was hard but we came back together and we‚Äôre better for real, we had finally gotten healthy space but recently after we came back from a cruise we went on with her family (had the best time together she‚Äôs like my sister) and she took a break with her bf, we started falling into old patterns and bickering more. There‚Äôs no more patience when we have issues because we have been seeing each other everyday and bickering fairly often for tooo long. So it came up that after this summer we would take a serious break one with maybe no end date, we both agree we need separate lives, it sucks knowing our circumstances really ruined us like this, maybe we aren‚Äôt 100% compatible personalities, we agreed I always cared more and if I didn‚Äôt try so hard we wouldn‚Äôt have stayed friends. 


Some backstory on our friendship though. We met in highschool we weren‚Äôt instantly best friends but things developed over school years and summers and by my sophomore year we were best friends. However in our sophomore year this seems to be where I think I made my first mistake, we were both having a hard time skipping class often plus my grandma who I lived with at time passed away, my best friend decided to leave school and do HS online so I decided to join her. Her parents didn‚Äôt know I was doing school online so it didn‚Äôt seem like we would just fuck off all day, so I‚Äôd just see her like after 3pm. She was never able to get her own car bc it‚Äôs so expensive, I had just been licensed so I drove us and her wherever she or we wanted go. Because she was my best friend and I was really leaning on her during this time, it was providing me a escape from my house and plus we had a good time together. We both hated our original highschool so when basically one of closest friends at the time was leaving ( I was also failing a class so starting over would erase that) I wanted to go instantly. Apparently later down the line in our friendship to her this seemed like I was just blindly following  her and it was rash of me in a sense to chose to leave with her like that. I think I have always been the one pursuing our friendship more but idk i feel like I have valid reasons for wanting to leave also and I mean this is someone who was my best friend and skipping everyday with , if she was leaving so was I. Spending everyday single day together or at least seeing each other for part of it became a regular thing. She had no other way to really leave her house so I‚Äôd either give her a ride or we would hang out. despite having our difficulties later on in our friendship we still kept it going. I mean honestly we both agree our special circumstances ruined us, we never got too much space and it drove her to be sick of me in a sense and I was always trying too hard. She became really all I had , as I don‚Äôt get along with my family / they passed away. Not too many friends, I‚Äôve always held a job up but never met anyone worth while.  We have a mutual friend but I‚Äôm not the closest with  her, I mean she‚Äôs been one of our besties since HS but I can‚Äôt vent about this. I‚Äôm now only 19 and really feelll I have no one. I also don‚Äôt like my living situation, I live with Bella‚Äôs grandma and she is a bit crazy (I live here bc it was closer to work and 10 minutes away from my bestfriend) well not my bestfriend now :/ it‚Äôs just so hard for me right now. We were hanging out Monday and I could feel the tension between us not talking much, once I brouGht up things she basically said she felt done between us now, and that we really aren‚Äôt friends, we needed to end things before summer was over I mean I agree we need separate lives . This is extra hard for me, our lives are still connected, I mean even after that conversation I still spent 2 nights at her house as I was helping take here little brother to summmer camp. It just sucks this is all had to end this way, plus it is summer my favorite time but I feel so down and alone. We are  hanging out on the 4th of July too with Bella and maybe more people. Maybe this isn‚Äôt the healthiest but I can‚Äôt spend my summer alone :( we agreed to see each other in group settings and I‚Äôll probably see her solo a few times. She is getting back together with her boyfriend on the 15th of July, we both agreed this would make it easier to seperate as we both won‚Äôt be doing nothing 10 minutes up the street from each other, shelll be at his house. But on top of it all I‚Äôve been struggling sometimes mentally with intrusive thoughts I‚Äôve been doing research reminding myself thoughts are just thoughts and don‚Äôt reflect my character. But with this and losing my closet friend ( despite for the better) I get filled with this bad pit of. Anxiety sometimes, welll often . I just feel sad and frankly lonely .

5550,vnl34g,_Forever_depressed_,"she's not just my best friend, but also my only friend. I like her a lot and she told she like me a lot too.(At least thats what she told me)

However, recently (like 1 week ago) I noticed she has been giving me the cold shoulder. She sounds really dry most of the time in my dms and i often feel really awkward because I have no idea how to sustain the conversation. Like I tried my best to make it interesting by asking her questions, but she doesnt really say much, and she doesnt ask me any questions back.

The only time we have a proper conversation is when she's bored and that none of her other friends are online. But when the others are online, she would just leave me out or suddenly act uninterested and spend a lot more time with them. Its almost like she is only using me to keep herself entertained when all of her other interesting friends are busy.

This upsets me a lot and because often times she made me feel special and she said that im her best friend and the only one she can trust. But all these changed like a week ago and I found it kinda strange, but I do speculate that perhaps the reason why she's acting dry is because I sound too much like a deadweight, and thus boring her a lot. 

And her friends are not like me at all, they dont really suffer from any mental health issues and therefore able to be so enthusiastic in their conversation 24/7. And I cant do that because I have like severe anxiety and possible autism, so sometimes talking too much can be really draining for me.

i could try communicating with her about this but im just afraid it wont work because she tend to overreact whenever I try to confront her about this, even if i did it in the most polite way. 

This isnt the first time it happened as well. But those times were before she admitted that I was her best friend and the only one I could trust.

I was born to a family that would've rather seen me hanging from a coat hanger  had they known how raising me would have felt like. No matter what the topic is, I am always wrong. I have always wronged. I keep getting reminded that I am a huge mistake.

Nobody seems to remember that I exist, even if they spend a lot a time with/around me. I have to remind them that I'm in the same room when they start bitching about me. Sometimes, they do that even if they acknowledge my existence in the same room. I just deserve it I guess. I wonder why I'm so untrustworthy, uninteresting and uncomfortable to be around. 

My family doesn't love me. My friends don't love me. I'll never have someone to come home to. The best part is that the only people who care about me are the ones trying to fix me as if I were a broken toy. 

""Am I broken?"" Now that's a question that lives rent free in my head. I've spent countless days trying to figure that out. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

Not the usual post here ill admit, but hear it goes..

I am a fan of a sports team, it's not my local team, the stadium is one/two hours away. We had some though years as a team. And we got better and just won our 2nd title in a row. Last year, tho the distance factor. I bought two season tickets, one for me, and the other was supposed to be as gift for my dad. I bought it with the knowledge that he wouldn't come to every game and i would try to invite friends or just live with the expense.. The year went by, it was rough. He didn't like where the sits located, and sometimes just grunted for no good reason. Also he didn't like driving the train. Its hes character to geunt so i figured maybe just live with it, but now there's is a new season, and i come to acceptance thats its not ideal, and he wouldn't come. With inviting frinds it sometimes did and sometimes didn't work out.. but i dont have many friends and dont have close connection with them. Tried maybe even so invinting them to split the coast with the new season, again to no success.

I like going to game, but it feels like it doesn't live for it full potential when im alone.. its also hard for me to connect with strangers or even anyone for that matter, and the nice cool looking group that sit next to me doesn't seam to including me even the slightest.. I'm bad at talking i guess..

Anyway i will renew one season ticket for me . But i dont know what to do with the other one.. obviously i dont have anyone to invite. But the demand went out. It's a sold out season (again) and next year probably going to be the same. If i won't buy another seasonticket. I wont have a chance to invite a friend in the near future.. however who am i kidding? I'll probably wont find anyway

5572,vnonke,IndianManlet12345," jesus christ this shit is incoherent sorry

So I'm 17 and Indian, growing up in the west. I have started hanging around with more people and have become more outgoing recently. All well and good until the talk comes to previous sexual/romantic interaction. Which in my case the only intimate interaction I ever had was a)unwanted and b)i was fucking 10 only like 3 people IRL know this and it still bothers me to this day so yes i am inexperienced and i am completely okay with it but when i think like person X says ""this girl wants me bad but i'm ignoring"" or ""i did this and this with x and y person last night"" and then they prove they aren't fucking bullshitting. I think like ""damn someone actually desires them that bad"" and then i come to the realization that no one likes me as anything more than a friend yet and i have a hell of a lot of friends rn which is cool but sometimes you want more

So on the outside i keep playing my hard ass character and keep saying shit like ""well it's their fault they don't want a piece of this i'm such a catch"" but on the inside i think ""you're too fucking short/ethnic/etc. no one is ever going to like you in any way that is not platonic ; you are just that one dude no one notices ppl like you but no one *likes* you""

so in order to combat these thoughts i remind myself of the things i am good at and the things i like about myself and then i come to the realization that no one likes me as anything more than a friend yet and i have a hell of a lot of friends rn which just brings me back to this and it makes me feel like shit

Thing is, I've heard the ""you'll find the right one"" stuff many times from guys who have successfully attracted many people before so until i find the right one i just got to prove to myself that i have what it takes to actually be desired by anyone which frankly i don't feel yet and the thing is IRL, in actual interactions i am hella confident, I‚Äôm not a simp or a niceguy, I have some amount of bravado so the just be confident shit won't be actual advice.

keep reminding myself that I am attractive(i hope so; pics on DM no spicey stuff) funny(i hope so) and smart(i know so) but still i can't escape from the shit that's on my mind except when i'm drunk or with friends but then again i still return home at night and am trapped again in this loop and it's seriously fucking with me, am I literally no one‚Äôs type? No one‚Äôs No.1? and i have no idea how to escape it

Normally I try to change up my mentality and work on myself when I'm depressed but this time I just can't and if i tell my parents this or seek professional help I'll be seen as a goddamn joke

so I'm fucking stuck

Hi, I‚Äôm a psychology honours student from RMIT University in Australia and I am currently seeking participants for my research project that will contribute to my final thesis. 

We are seeking to understand if loneliness contributes to an increased reliance on possessions and which behavioural and cognitive emotion regulation strategies contribute to this relationship. 

The survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete and includes questions about your background (e.g., age, gender), general wellbeing, emotion regulation style, level of perceived loneliness, materialistic values, experiences of nostalgia, emotional attachment to your possessions and your accumulation of possessions (this includes items you have bought, gifts, mail, free giveaways etc.) 

Participation requirements: 

¬∑ 18+ years old  

¬∑ Access to any electronic device 

¬∑ Proficiency in the English language

5607,vnvl0u,givewhatican,"A lot of bad things happened to me growing up that lead to really intense social anxiety and I completely caved in on myself as a kid. I missed out on actually socializing with my peers, and my family just kinda made things worse. For as long as I can remember the best part of my day has always been whatever part involves not being around people anymore. Finding an abandoned/empty space outside, or coming home to curl up with a book, are the only spaces I ever feel like I can breathe.

But it still fucking sucks. I moved somewhere new recently and was already planning to build my life alone, yet watching it actually play out that way is so depressing. I really just don‚Äôt know how to open up enough or be fun or whatever else enough to really make friends. 

My dating history is rocky and I just don‚Äôt have the capacity to even think about that. Not only have I realize how I‚Äôve been a really bad partner, I‚Äôve also come to terms with the fact that I tend to attract neglectful/narcissistic people because I‚Äôve been desperate and a pushover. So I‚Äôve been single for a few years now and dating has changed so much in the last few years that it‚Äôs overwhelming.

I don‚Äôt know how to be any different. I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm so lonely but it feels worse around people because I‚Äôm just pretending to be ok, or normal. I feel like I have no idea who I am and thus can‚Äôt connect meaningfully with anyone. Honestly all I can plan for anymore is finding a way to move somewhere super remote and rural, get a a few dogs and just wait to die alone. 

The only good thing is that I‚Äôm no longer desperate enough to put myself through the pain of forcing things or enduring abusive relationships just to say I‚Äôm with someone. I just kinda accept that it is what it is (and it is‚Ä¶ quite shitty.)",2022-06-30 01:09:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656362023,13,/r/lonely/comments/vnvl0u/most_comfortable_when_im_alone_but_still_hate_it/,,0,4,Most comfortable when I‚Äôm alone but still hate it

I have no irl life friends I'm a sahm of two toddlers under 3 my husband doesn't seem to see me as anything but an object for whatever he needs at the moment so Kik is all I have and to see that just kinda crushed me a bit.

5655,vo29zu,CaptainLurks3,"It has been 2 years since I‚Äôve last talked to someone. Lately the person I had talking too, I just seem to fuck up.. I have no idea where I go wrong. I‚Äôm just myself around them but I always end up overthinking things tbh. My last experience really hurt, I wasn‚Äôt expecting that from them it was a complete curveball. 

I started talking to this girl from work as we had both found each other attractive. Our mutual friend had told me she was a cool person and just gives off good vibes overall. So I made my move and began talking to her. We clicked right off the back, we began taking more often. One day we agreed to hang out. That day came, I thought it went well. We ended up getting to know each other better. That same day I also held her hand and kissed her. Which surprised me since I‚Äôm not an affectionate person, it takes times for me to get comfortable. With her I didn‚Äôt even question it, she made me feel like I could trust her. Which I really liked about her.  Things were going great we were talking on the daily and hanging out more often.. We were feeding of each other‚Äôs energy things we‚Äôre beginning to get more serious as well. The question had come up about ‚Äúwhat this was?‚Äù We would discuss about it. She told me how she felt and what  she wanted too. At first she had said she wanted to hook and just see what happens. However for me I also wanted something more serious. I just hadn‚Äôt told her what I wanted, I just hate saying what I want because I feel I always either fuck it up or it either goes wrong.  

I took my time and was just thinking about what I truly wanted at the end of the day. Two days had passed since she had asked me what I thought about the situation. I had just told her I didn‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend if things went wrong. Since at the beginning I had also mentioned how I end up not being friends with ex‚Äôs cause I cut them off. So the day I was about to text her and tell her I do want to try things with her and see where they go. She messaged me telling me it‚Äôs better off if we end things and just remain friends so no one gets hurt. That  sadden me as we had talked for over a month straight. 

Idk what to think.. all that was on my mind was I had just lost her. One of my worst outcomes had come true. I had agreed to give her space and see if things still might have a chance which I told her. This is where another problem came up. I know I told her I would give her space, but something happened and I needed a friend to talk too.  So I reached out and texted her again. I got no reply‚Ä¶ she ended up telling our mutual  friend that I wasn‚Äôt leaving her alone. Which saddened me to think she thought like that. 

It sucks seeing her at work, especially when we are right in front of each other. She doesn‚Äôt text me but she randomly says hi and might make small talk at work. I wonder if she does that cause we have a mutual friend. It‚Äôs been weeks since we truly had an actual conversation. At times I want to go up to her and hug her.  I‚Äôm so lost and confused are things really over??

Some guys I have encountered and spend time with devolve into subhuman apes that just exclaim how much they want to fuck everything. There was a point where I subscribed to the fact that men act like this but do truly want a loving partner that treats them like a real person but I suck at picking people tbh lol. Thus, I am unfairly biased. However, I can feel this toxic mindset is a part of me now. It was a joke at some point but now it's not. I just think all dudes want a hole and maybe an oven to ""expand their legacy."" I know that this can't really be true but I feel it is the case. I just have never or very rarely felt like someone likes me as an individual unless it was a woman. I didn't need to be useful or sexy or cool, I just needed to be myself. Now keep in mind, I am a recluse that spends time with ppl on the internet (around ages of 19-25 year Olds, including myself). So maybe it's just a thing ppl do anonymously? Or when they are young?

5701,voc111,givewhatican,"I‚Äôm pretty new to Reddit and only just started getting active in/creating communities. I‚Äôm sure this is in guidelines or posted somewhere but it didn‚Äôt occur to me until I started getting weird DMs on here. Looking more into it I saw that the DMer‚Äôs were heavily involved in 18+ content (nothing wrong w/ that and not trying to kink shame or shame in general) but the types of comments were the issue, and the way they targeted me by my posts here and approached as someone who was just ‚Äúhere to help‚Äù is the issue. As someone who‚Äôs been down this road too many times I wanted to bump this word of caution: BEWARE THE PREDATORS.

It was really, painfully easy to tell how insecure I was as a teenager/young adult. Physically I dressed to hide myself, I walked hunched over, avoided eye contact, held myself, etc. If people interacted with me I was very shy/docile and overly nice. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time but I was being tested too when people would say random insulting/mean things, and then noted when I avoided confrontation and brushed it off. I was always off by myself, nose in a book. Same story every time: I‚Äôd get involved with them, become super attached, and then a cycle of abuse started in which I convinced myself nothing was wrong and had no boundaries because I just needed to feel wanted so badly.

I wish I had someone in my life to guide me during these times. Please, especially to those of us  posting on here exposing our vulnerability about lacking connection, please be mindful that there are people out there who clock this behavior and who can tell how badly we need someone. This is NOT to discourage you from being open to relationships nor to make you believe you don‚Äôt deserve love and attention, but to encourage you to have boundaries (which is your right.) I spent so much of my life waiting for a fairytale like the books I relied on to keep me sane growing up, and there were many predatory people who fed on this (literally to the point of making the kinds of romantic declarations the hero gives the heroine about how they‚Äôve never felt like this, they can‚Äôt breathe without you, etc.) They do this to trap you. They want something from you and don‚Äôt care about hurting you. In fact, some of them like hurting others because it‚Äôs just a power play for them (romance/sex are huge power plays and a significant form of coercion.)

Do not be afraid to say no or tell someone to leave you alone. Do not be afraid to tell someone when they hurt you, and never feel bad or wrong about being hurt. In fact if someone tries to tell you it‚Äôs your fault or that you‚Äôre wrong for how you‚Äôre feeling instead of being willing to talk it out, that‚Äôs a huge red flag right there. You deserve better. You can‚Äôt always be the wrong one. You deserve to feel good in your relationships, not anxious/scared/exhausted all the time.

Also, if you‚Äôre 25 or younger being approached by people in their 30s or older, please be careful. I‚Äôm approaching mid 30s and while I respect and value younger people (I don‚Äôt think teenagers are incapable of making choices or are stupid or anything like that) I honestly cannot engage with them on a friend or romantic level. I have nothing in common with them and I am not at all attracted like that, nor should anyone in their 30s+ be. It‚Äôs still your decision to make at the end of the day, but as someone who was targeted at 17 and 22 by people significantly older than me, I caution you to consider that they are doing this because they know you still likely lack experience in some areas and are still figuring out a lot about who you are. Youre brain is literally still developing too until around 26. You‚Äôre vulnerable and that‚Äôs totally ok, but just know that not everyone is going to protect that the way they should.

And to the predators, you are just disgusting. Figure out what went wrong with you, if you‚Äôre even capable of that level of self reflection, and put some honest work into being better. Stop taking advantage. It doesn‚Äôt make you the god you think you are, it just makes you a huge asshole and that shit WILL catch up to you one day.",2022-06-30 16:07:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656362023,35,/r/lonely/comments/voc111/beware_the_predator/,,1,20,Beware the predator.

I've been thinking about this lately. Many people are coming to the conclusion that they are more at peace, and more content living their life without a significant other. This of course doesn't mean that all romantic and physical contact will disappear for some people, but I just wonder how does this affect an individual psychologically. How important is physical touch? Nonsexual physical intimacy like hugging, or hand holding, etc. Can platonic hugs from friends, cuddling pets, etc. really fulfill this alleged need - or is it just a desire?",2022-06-30 16:36:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639414110,5,/r/lonely/comments/vocq35/is_it_possible_to_live_a_healthy_life_without/,,0,1,Is it possible to live a healthy life without physical touch?

Salutations everyone, I am he with the name of Michael, preferable nickname is Mike, has a pet rabbit, aged 24, blue eyes, stands up to 5‚Äô11, personality traits of an Ambivert, zodiac sign Aries, single, from Colorado, moved to California for collage then moved out to Oklahoma to work on getting a life in a nice place with unpredictable weather. Also tends to be creative with headlines.

As a self-taught student of computer programming I still turned out to be a passionate, team oriented, software developer who aspires to work on large-scale projects, learning new tech and applying new skills whenever I can. Currently finishing my UCSD classes for my C/C++ Programming certification. Working at the Braums warehouse saving up for my own place.

If you‚Äôre someone that expects instant responses 24/7 then probably not compatible with your list since there will be times when I‚Äôm really busy with life in general but rest to sure I‚Äôll get around to responding when I have time to do so, do not mistake it for ghosting. Those probably a little faster if it‚Äôs a conversation, it bugs me not to finish a conversation. If you jump in my DM and think your gonna be posting (NSFW) content or trying to sell cookies then yeah got another thing coming so keep that to yourself.

If you‚Äôre into video calls then that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs probably a good way to develop a connection that is stronger than texting messages back and forth and for the love of God please don't suggest Discord, I already had enough bad experiences on that platform as it is, Snapchat creeps me out, and god damn it if it involves giving away my number then assume no, so that means no WhatsApp, Telegram or whatever I haven‚Äôt mentioned. I‚Äôll do video calls on Instagram since I‚Äôve already established a spot there with many connections I made over the years.

**Hobbies:**

I enjoy things like listening to music, playing musical instruments such as Jaws harp and an Ocarina, learning new things, landscape photography, reading about technology, writing lots of documentation and poetry, ham radio, gardening, puzzles, Minecraft, mentoring newbie programmers, building games with Meson build system and SDL2 media libraries, solve programming problems with C, C++, Julia and Python just for fun.

5734,vogt5g,Zypher132,"Just venting and seeing if anyone else encounters this issue. A little backstory: growing up in Wisconsin, 4th of July weekend was always a big deal for me and something I looked forward to every year. It really signified it being summer time. I would often go with my parents to cookouts or host them in our neighborhood. Sometimes I'd go to cookouts with my friends or go watch the fireworks together. Sometimes we'd camp. My dad liked fireworks and we'd go and buy a bunch to light off together. It always involved friends and/or family and a weekend full of fun.

Fast forward and I'm now 33. Lost my dad in 2017 and mom in 2019. Even before they passed I found it hard for the holiday weekend to live up to my memories as a kid and young adult. After they passed it became even harder. 

Now here we are approaching the holiday weekend and my wife and I have off Sat-Tues. Turns out our best friends are camping way up north (just found that out or we might've tried to plan to go with them). Our other married couple friends are going away all weekend. Our one bachelor friend is busy all weekend. So now I'm staring down a depressing and lonely weekend with no plans and no one to spend it with other than my wife. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with her and I'm super grateful she'll be by my side, but we spend every weekend together and the prospect of spending this holiday weekend just lounging around the house has got me extremely sad. I know my dad being gone is a part of it as I have this romanticized version of what this particular holiday weekend should be like. 

Does anyone else run into these feelings on a big holiday weekend? I just know I'll see people all over having cookouts with friends/family, camping with friends, going on vacations or having parties, etc. And I'll be watching from the sidelines.",2022-06-30 19:33:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1546972457,3,/r/lonely/comments/vogt5g/4th_of_july_blues_long_lonely_weekend/,,0,1,4th of July Blues - Long Lonely Weekend

So... I've moved to a new city like a year ago for work and I'm pretty lonely here. To be honest I like the job, and the people there is nice, but once work is done no one seems to do anything outside office (And it's almost impossible to do things at the moment since lots of them are remote-working).

Anyway... Since I don't know anyone I normally have two kind of days, the once I stay at home and just work on my stuff and the days I just walk around the city hoping something will change (On which I end up pretty depressed to be honest, but I know I won't change anything if I just stay at home all day).

I just... don't know how to approach people without knowing anyone, I don't know where to go on weekends to know people and actually feel like it would be weird to go alone and end up being alone for the whole night...

Lately this has been affecting my work and mentality but I'm blocked on how to find/know new people just by myself.

5748,voiivy,BaronesseRouge,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty new to Reddit. I'm 37 years old, single, no children. Two years ago I lost my best friend who was the greatest blessing in my life apart from my family - I've no siblings and only my mother left. I have two ""friends"" left you could say but actually they only call me to rant about their life, they're rather misantrophic folks (call me to tell me how sh\*tty the world and people are) and barely ever ask how I am, what I'm up to, what interests me, whatever. Well, I have no problem with people ranting and thinking the world and people can be sh\*tty but I'm fed up being only a listener while they don't even notice when I'm sad, I could never talk about my friend for example. All this time I thought it was me and I had to be a friend to them, but I realize it really is just one-sided.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had no luck meeting anyone new. I guess it's difficult at my age. I force myself to go out and put on a smile, I greet strangers but I seem to be invisible. Last November an old friend reached out. Someone I really liked and I felt soooo happy to be back in touch again. Turns out he had just broke off with his girlfriend, was bored with lockdown and that was it. The meeting I was looking foward to never happened until this day. Maybe I should call myself lucky that he remembered me at all and reached out. At least I had two very nice conversations on the phone...

&amp;#x200B;

It's summer and I'd love to go hiking with someone I feel close to, talking, laughing, having fun. Or just chilling with someone and talking about all sorts of topics. I so miss someone who looks at me and feeling liked, maybe even loved. I miss caring for someone, I miss relating to someone and feeling like I belong somewhere. I wish I had found love. Having kids one day was my dream. Okay, it may not be in the cards for me but having absolutely no one apart from my mother who has her own problems and is getting older... Actually I always had wanted to make her proud. I'm a loser, my life as it is now is just empty. Job-wise of course I haven't succeeded either but that wouldn't even annoy me that much.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry guys, if anyone is reading this - I don't want to put you down. Actually I feel ashamed to admit all of this. I really don't know where I have gone wrong and what I have done wrong. I've been battling an anxiety disorder for years and now I wonder why I did all the things I did to get better - I'll be alone forever anyway it seems. And again, I'm really ashamed to tell all of this openly but I just can't stop crying today. I wish I could be happy again, but I'm tired of distracting myself all the time, I'm tired of reading, watching movies, trying to kill the day and have false hope that some day things will change.",2022-06-30 20:49:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655503599,9,/r/lonely/comments/voiivy/ive_never_felt_more_lonely/,,0,5,I've never felt more lonely

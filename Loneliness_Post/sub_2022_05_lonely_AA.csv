6,ufo2sc,LiminalSpaceLiam,"Long story short, I’m 14, in 8th grade, and it’s almost the end of the school year for me. There is this girl who WAS interested in me, but only because of how good I looked with my hair. I’ve always been this laid-back and chill hippie type of dude who happens to love the ‘60s and shit, so naturally my hair resembled George Harrison. This reflected my personality very well and I felt comfortable because of that. Until it started growing past my shoulders which is not even my style. So I decided to get it all cut off. Now it’s not that I look bad with a buzz-cut, (although that doesn’t match my personality because it makes me look like a fucking douche which I hate) though my barber messed up (nothing personal to him) and now my hair just looks uneven and awkward. The next day that I saw her, she just looked at me and laughed. She hasn’t talked to me since. But that’s not all! Even my friends mocked the way my hair looks, all because my barber fucked up and didn’t even give me a proper cut. So in the meantime I’ll be depressed until about high school probably when it grows back, knowing that I chose to cut off all my possible chances. TL;DR, My barber fucked up and now everyone treats me like shit including the girl that was previously interested in me.

29,ufq5zx,birdylock,"I am a 19 year man, I can't tell my whole childhood story, but I can say what I feel in result of said stories.
I feel excluded, I feel like I am destined to be alone, and I feel that anyone who I connect with on a deeper level, will get dissapointed by me, sooner or later. I've always been teamed up on as a kid, which isn't the easiest experience, always find myself being abandoned by whoever I get close to, with smirk on their face ""what a shithead""
I ve always had a small circle of friends, but recently, I understood that they aren't really friends, they are just available people, the same as I am to them, the first invitation from any other person and they try their hardest to ditch the group. I have a girlfriend, I love her very much, we are in a long distance relationship, it doesn't help right? especially when physical touch, and tenderness is a very important need for me in a relationship. She wouldn't understand what it feels like, she is constantly surrounded by other people, always having the best laugh with the best supportive, most fun friends, she is in a band on campus, enjoying the company of many friends, and here I am miles away in a house with a roomate that we hate each other's guts, we literaly don't talk.

32,ufqe86,liberalsRmindless,"So I got sober from meth, alcohol, weed, caffeine, and tobacco 2 years ago. Something about the way I work internally meant I had to be all or nothing about it. Unfortunately, I suffer from severe chronic back and neck pain, as well as jaw pain from tmj, and I have been taking something called kratom for the past year for the pain. I haven't really decided if it is a relapse or not. It is definitely addictive, but it is the absolute only substance I take and without it I'd be in so much more pain.

I feel like I long for a mentor right now, or a spiritual leader, or something. I am so lost. I'm crying right now, as I write this. I don't know what to do now, I don't know how to find purpose anymore. For the past year I have been treading water, living off my measly SSI payments and starving myself to make it each month.

But I live in the world of distraction. I live to be distracted, I can see it so clearly. Starting to take kratom, I feel, might be part of the problem. See I was sober completely, and I had to have my wisdom teeth removed. My face got way too swollen afterwards, and they put me on codeine for a week. During that week, my back pain completely disappeared. Once the Codeine ran out, for an entire month I remained sober. I took 3 Aleve per day for one month, but relative to the absolute painlessness of being on Codeine, Aleve couldn't compete. Relatively I was in extreme pain. Somehow my body had acclimated to the pain before Codeine, and I dialed with it by excercising once every 3 days, but since I couldn't handle it after that first month of Aleve I started to buy kratom. I have now been addicted to kratom and nothing else for a year.

Before I relapsed on the kratom though, I had been experimenting with removing porn and social media, and video games from my life. Something about being on zero addictive substances makes your mental addictions suddenly stand out strongly. I caught myself slipping away to the bathroom to jack off whenever I faced a difficult decision or stressful situation. I realized I was using the porn as a way to ""feel good"" to counteract ""feeling bad"", just like I used to drink alcohol whenever I was stressed out before I got sober. So I had actually spent 90 days free of jerking off, and I had deleted all my porn, etc. But after the codeine ran out of my system it was suddenly open season on porn use, it's like I returned to it with a vengeance. Same with video games and social media. Just scrolling, making sure to avoid thinking about all the terrifying things at all costs.

I feel like I need an acid trip, I fear I traumatized myself with my last meth binge. It was horrible, and it was the first time I was put out on the street by everyone I loved. My best friend, then even my brother made me beg and pander to him to avoid getting kicked out. I lost all sense of stability, and I can still feel it, I do nothing but fear right now, all I can do is be terrified I'll end up on the street again, terrified that no one will ever love me. I am completely removed from my authentic self, I have no clue what I am supposed to do now.

Because of my physical disabilities and especially the tmj, which, after almost 20 years now of neglect has become horrifying, I can't talk for more than 5 minutes a day anymore. So I can't get any job where I'd have to talk. I am starting to feel so cut off from the world.

I am feeling horrible bitterness. I see people leading normal lives, and complaining about things they experience that I can't experience. They complain about problems with their friendships, and I feel like I have been avoiding my friends because of the jaw issue specifically. So it makes me hate those people, I loathe them. I feel neglected by the world, left to rot.

A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that I have been pretty isolated for the past year. I pretty much only speak to my therapist once a week. I have a brother, but since he got a new girlfriend he barely has time for me once a month. Otherwise I stay in my room. I am terrified of people. I don't want to be. But I feel like something is missing in my brain. The peace that I found the first time I got sober (2 and a half years ago), I completely destroyed when I relapsed just to get help again. I was told that I couldn't get more help unless I used meth specifically again, so I did in a desperate fuck it moment, just to get help. Because I was thriving there, and they released me to a shelter and I wasn't ready for it and it was terrifying.

But now I find myself battling with myself. I don't know what to do. I dropped out of UC Berkeley 10 years ago, was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic two years later, worked in bars and restaurants ever since. I really do miss learning, I used to be so good at it. I feel like I can't get myself secure feeling enough to focus on learning anything, but I don't know if that's true. I doubt my intelligence every day. I fear that my drug use has destroyed my intelligence and that I am no longer capable of returning to school.

I try to motivate myself to learn coding, or design, or something that I used to be good at, but some voice within me tells me that I am not supposed to just work, something about living in Berkeley has me feeling like I'm selling out somehow by working. But when I'm not working I spend all of my time worrying about how to make it to the end of each month, skipping meals to make it every month. Surviving with only $150 to spend on food each month after rent.

Part of me thought the answer would be to buy a car or van and live with it. I could borrow money maybe and then if I owned the place I lived in then I could spend the full SSI amount on food each month. But then I'm like If I had enough money to buy a van, I should spend it on fixing my jaw. Get orthodontics or whatever it takes.

Then I'm like just learn coding to get a job to fix my jaw, stabilize myself, and then I can decide what I really want to do after I do that for a little while.

But my therapist just discouraged me from that plan, when I told it to her a few days ago. I think she was trying to help me, but she used my inability to remain motivated as evidence for why maybe I just didn't like doing these things I said I wanted to do. And it really fucked me up in the head man. How am I supposed to change when every time I am about to they say ""how can you be sure you want to do this when historically you haven't done this?"" That's why I always had to move friend groups, so I could be new people over time.

I used to be so busy, now all I can do is think about what I should do, but never do anything.

I personally think the answer is to just do something, literally anything, just pick it and see if I can let the world fall away and start focusing on it like I used to be able to. I think putting so much emphasis on what to pick is what fucked me up in the first place. At Berkeley I had changed my major 6 times, and felt horrified of the decision because I feared that whatever I ended up with would be the last thing I got to study. When in the past my skill was being able to study and be good at a variety of things. I was the kid who won the math olympics, and also tutored English, and was good at drawing. I didn't believe in the science/math/artsy person being different, and I didn't want to have to stop learning. But Berkeley put so much pressure on me and told me if I didn't pick soon I'd run out of financial aid in one semester, they said I was already above the unit ceiling because I had taken too many classes and I already had enough credits to graduate, I just needed a few more classes for psychology in particular and I could finish. But I didn't feel ready. And then of course I started hallucinating and had some freak outs and the whole things just ended and I couldn't return until I paid back my grants for that semester so I just stayed out because I didn't have $6k.

And here I am 10 years later, feeling like an absolute loser. I spent 8 years drinking and working in restaurants and bars, and now that I'm sober and my pain has caught up with me I feel incapable of continuing to work in those fields, my body can't handle it. So if I'm going to work I need to use my mind, but I can't pick what I should do. I wish I could just live with my parents for a while and just spend some time learning anything just to test the waters, but my parents are toxic and I've stopped speaking to them recently. And I doubt that decision every day too, but my therapist supports it because I'm incapable of saying no to my dad, so at least if I don't pick up the phone I can't be controlled by him.

But that leaves me with no one. I feel completely alone. I used to have my brother but now he's never around because of the girlfriend, so I'm left with nothing. I left Facebook a few years ago because I couldn't handle it, but by doing so I cut myself off from my old college friends.

I've just made so many horrible decisions. Isolated myself out of fear too many times, and now I'm left broken and alone with no one to comfort me or guide me. I'm starting to think being controlled by my dad would be better than this, at least he still likes me sometimes.

I'm so filled with hate lately. I know the answer is love, but I'm filled with hate. I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/a1lcp9/comment/eaqx6uv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) when I got sober the first time, when I felt so at peace. Something had clicked in me, I felt. Now I look at it and it feels like it was written by a different person. I can't make eye contact with people anymore, I can't do anything but fear what they are thinking about me anymore. What have I done to myself. I regret so deeply smoking meth again, I was harder on my body and mind that time than I had ever been before.

And I can't tell if I can't focus on things now because I am clouded by fear or because I damaged myself beyond repair. I have been set free by acid in the past, it has allowed me to clear away the chatter and clear my mind and focus, it might be able to help me again, but I do not think I am in a good enough mindset. If I were to do that I'd have to reach out to some old friends first.

That's one plan, I searched and searched, and recently found the phone number for this one old friend who had previously helped me gain some peace of mind.

The problem, and I know it's the problem, is that I am waiting until I have figured something out to do things again. The revelation that set me free the first time I got sober, I think, at least, was that I was willing to try to do things whether I felt ready or not. Now I always feel like I'm not ready and so I never do anything. I am nothing but a pot of doubt.

But working isn't spiritually dead, right? You have to support yourself, right?

To be totally honest a big part of me wants to check back into a mental hospital. I've been in several throughout my lifetime. This is starting to feel like one of those times where I would benefit. I'm just so terrified of being turned away. It happened twice. But I need somewhere to start, I don't know what is best for me right now. I'm not sure if I have to live off disability for the rest of my life, or if I'm actually capable of coming out of it.

Something feels so wrong about coming out of it. Or trying to motivate myself to come out of it. Like is it so wrong to motivate myself to learn coding just to earn money? Something seems so spiritually bankrupt about that. Like I'm supposed to be doing what I love or something, right? Do I love it? I used to love just learning everything, I would try learning anything, and make it a challenge to wrap my mind around it. The thing is I haven't been doing anything I love either. So it's not like by not learning something to help me earn money I've spent more time doing what I actually love. I spend my time in a waking horror. I feel terrified of everything, I need to find some breathing room. My therapist just recommended medications again, I think I'm going to say yes to trying it this time. I'm living in a world of distraction, like I said at the beginning. I'm not doing things I love, I scroll through endless tiktoks and feel hateful and angry at people being happy and living their lives and expressing themselves because I cannot. But I do it anyway, why? Why do I keep distracting myself like this when I feel so horrible? Or I will play a video game and hate myself the whole time. I cannot quiet my mind at night anymore.

I stay up all night a couple times a week because I just can't fall asleep, it feels like something horrible is about to happen and I have to figure out a solution to something. So my mind just spins, and I need to find peace.

If you have any guidance I'd love it. Especially about getting some mental peace. I tried to meditate to sleep and the way I did it used to work but it doesn't seem to as well now. I try to focus on an invisible point above my eyes, and then any time I start thinking about something I visualize the thought dissolving and then keep doing that until I kind of stop trying to think and then hopefully find some mental quiet. But lately like with the jaw pain and stuff it just comes through it, the thoughts come anyway.

I feel terrified to post this because I have come to expect hate from others. I feel I will be mocked for being lazy and not figuring it out by now, etc. Please be kind, I am trying to change, I don't want to live in the world of distraction anymore, but I don't know how to find what I love, and I don't know how to learn again, I have so much doubt in my ability to even try learning.

35,ufqrgd,eternalconfusion7,"i’ve just been so sad and lonely lately like i really feel like i don’t have friends anymore. I graduated college in 2020 and have a great friend group from school but most of them moved to other cities after graduation. and i know this is a ~super confusing time~ and post grad life sucks a lot at first but it seems like none of my friends are having the same experience as me. even my roommate who is my best friend from school has her high school friend group she’s super close with and i literally have no one. 

it’s just hard seeing my friends living in nyc and dallas, etc. all together having so much fun and i’m just here. i went to school in georgia and moved to atlanta afterwards and it honestly fucking sucks because no one is really trying to meet people since most people have their friend groups from college here. idk why i’m even posting this i guess i just want to vent…i’ve always considered myself a social person but this past year has been so difficult and has made me feel like maybe i’m not as social as i thought i was. i mean i probably haven’t don’t a great job putting myself out there but i’m just not happy here it sucks",2022-05-01 03:12:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637253998,2,/r/lonely/comments/ufqrgd/im_so_fucking_lonely/,,0,2,i’m so fucking lonely

37,ufr1qh,Clol1l1l1,I don't know if it's just because I had bad friends or have no friends now but the thought of having friends is a fantasy to me. Something I can make a Pinterest board out of. I think that if I have friends all my problems will go away and I'll be super happy. Obviously that's not realistic but having friends sounds so good. A lot of people don't realize how lucky they are to have someone to talk to everyday. Normal people usually fantasize about what their future partner or house will look like while I'm just imagining having a friend. I want to have a little friend group with like 6 people. I wanna get invited to parties. I want to text people and tell them about my day. I want to wake up exited because I know I'm not the only person I'm gonna see that day.,2022-05-01 03:30:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632271712,6,/r/lonely/comments/ufr1qh/dos_anyone_else_have_a_idealized_image_of_what/,,0,1,Dos anyone else have a idealized image of what friendships should look like?

47,ufse4z,[deleted],"I know everything I’m about to say is going to come across as prideful or narcissistic. But I’m sure if you read this I’ll change your mind. 

This is about to sound like a jayden smith quote but as I’ve grown up and undergone many trials and changes. Delved into philosophy. Spend all my social interactions trying to understand the human brain so I can find out what’s wrong with mine. I’ve come to some serious conclusions. No ones actually better than anyone else. It’s just circumstance. Everyone is fighting there own demons and in everyone’s own situations I can understand why people are sometimes disrespectful to me and I can’t help but forgive them. I try to go back to the how I thought about the world before but it’s not the same I just don’t feel the amount of hate or passion for revenge etc. that I felt before. And it’s freaking lonely man I feel like an observer watching everyone around me knowing I too make choices and say things Purely out of my realm of understanding and why I feel I have been wronged or why my situation is better. Yet I’m still observing.

I wish I could be naive again but I also don’t because that would mean I’m again open to the world and that means a lot of real pain. I’m basically a recluse. I rarely go out ever since I was 15. I still am good in social situations and have a lot of friends that I keep engagement with but I don’t go party or go out anymore like at all. 

The worst part is I haven’t dated properly ever. And I see all the girls in my life as somehow seperate to me and I don’t think I could go along with the sherade of innocent flirting and childish behaviour. It feels inauthentic and all I want to be now is authentic. I’m also not an ugly guy but I am a bit awkward yet women come to me on the rare occasion but I just don’t feel I could be intimate with a woman my age.

This may sound nice to some but it’s a hell. So my question to you lonely men and women am I overthinking this and if I actually put myself out there again the thoughts and feelings will come naturally and am I just too isolated or am I feeling something everyone starts to feel eventually and doomed to my place in this world?

I had a ""friend"" which i had a friendship for 4 years. I always remember his birthday and gave him gifts, put in alot of efforts for him. And i got nothing from his side. No wish no nothing. And this is not first time. He never ever wished. 

I have this another ""friend"". We have been friends since childhood. And HE also didnt wished me. 

You do so much for other and you realise you are not special to anyone. You feel like you and other person has something good and special bond. You finally have a friend or something. You enjoy with them and be happy with them. You put so much effort towards other and you get nothing. You are never someones special. You are nothing to them. 

Seriously, lonely people knows the value of love and relationship and thats why they put so much love towards other.

Edited : From the bottom of my heart thank you everyone for wishes. I really cant appreciate enough. Every year i feel so damn lonely. Like no one even cares or i am special to anyone.

52,ufsp2q,cyberpunk77777,"I’ve been a total loner for so many years now. Tbh I haven’t had a single friend since I was 14 and every year since then I just feel more and more isolated and more and more like a social outcast/reject. 

I struggled a lot in high school with bullying and because of that no one ever wanted to be around me, I’d get made fun of and beat up all the time. I just felt so left out because I was never invited anywhere, no one would hang out with me at school, I never went to things like prom or anything, and I obviously never experienced what it’s even like to be in a relationship.

I thought things would change once I went to university but the social dynamics were almost exactly the same. Everyone had their friend groups no one was really there to make any new friends. I tried joining some clubs but it really didn’t change anything. I felt even more invisible and unwanted going to uni and I’d feel so sad whenever I’d see people with their friends. It’s gotten so bad that last fall I decided to drop out, mainly because I wasn’t studying something I cared about but also because of my nonexistent social life. 

Now I’m 21 and I have nobody in my life and everyday I have such a hard time accepting that this is what my life is. Every time I look at people I knew from school on Instagram posting themselves with their friends or just seeing people outside I feel so depressed and jealous like “why doesn’t anyone want me around?” I feel like I’ve missed out on so many experiences because of this and now as an adult I feel like it’s impossible for any of this to change.",2022-05-01 05:13:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1546555536,8,/r/lonely/comments/ufsp2q/having_a_hard_time_accepting_my_life_as_a_loner/,,0,8,Having a hard time accepting my life as a loner

You know what sucks? I never even had problems coming in terms of my sexuality or even bullying. I never really minded it all because I know back then that being yourself is powerful. But is it tho? How come that I am still single after all these years? Not even dated nor in a relationship? 

I envy people like Nick or Wilhelm because they get to experience what is it like to be loved by a man and who would stick to them even if they are figuring themselves out. That there are people who would literally do everything just to make them happy, even if they cannot reciprocate properly. I wanna have that life. I know I would reciprocate, maybe even more. I would never hide my love. Yet, I am not even given the chance to be with someone. 

Loneliness is such a huge storm I could never escape. All I can do is distract myself from even feeling it. Drowning myself in my hobbies, work, and studying but then at the end of the day I am left no choice but to confront that loneliness back. At this point, I am tired and defeated.

I'm sorry but this s*it sucks. I try to be happy for the ones that are in happy relationships but I can't. Everyone seems to have a partner always, wherever I go, except me. I'm tired of this.

140,ug4eha,PandaVortex98,"This is just a dump of how I’m feeling. I have struggled with the feeling of guilt since I’ve been a kid. Watching my family work hard to earn every single penny to hearing my mom talking about how grateful we should be and that we should be cognizant about where we have reached and from where. 

But instead of feeling grateful or anything, it would invoke this feeling of guilt every time I would have “fun”. All I’ve seen is my parents prioritize spending time and money on things that are “needed” than what they “wanted”. This made me also always question this feeling of having fun and whether it was right or wrong. Somewhere I realize now that coming back from college to me home country and city and spending time with my family again, I started internalizing this again. I stopped myself from being in positions where I need to spend money to enjoy my time. Whether it be going out to club (which is an activity deep down I do have fun in as well) or going on a trip with friends, I would overthink and feel like I don’t deserve to have fun. Lately, I have started fearing such situations, I feel excited making plans but scared to follow through and go. Im working on this lately changing my mindset from productivity to being happy, but everyday something reminds me that I’m not worth anything because I may not have a direction in life.

I know this entire thing doesn’t make sense but idk this is what’s in my head and I just want it out. I feel so many things these days, I’m tired. 

I feel alone: I know we are alone in this life and that reality is what you make of it, etc. but lately every second of my life im aware of that fact and it’s only made me feel more isolated and lonely all the time.

I feel guilty: I feel guilty of being the bad guy in my parents eyes, I feel guilty of not spending time with them but I find myself in a constant debate with myself about if I want to or not and somewhere I always choose the latter. But I’m tired of trying to fix stuff, I’m tired of facing this issue. Im always aware of the flaws in my parents and that is a struggle I need to get out of where I need to accept them as human and also accept them. But somewhere that acceptance hasn’t come yet. All I see are flaws that make me irritated everytime I spend time with them.

I feel lost: I feel completely lost in life. I don’t know what I like, I don’t know what I want to do, I don’t know how to disassociate productivity with my life, I don’t know how to live honestly, like not in a suicidal way but in a I don’t know how to be happy in life anymore. One second I feel good spending time with people, the next I feel completely alone and lost. I don’t know how to get out of it either.

I feel tired: I’m just tired of dealing with all this, I’m tired with chasing after happiness, I’m tired of just having to make the most of where I am. Idk I’m just tired. I struggle to get out of bed 99% of the time, I struggle finding the motivation to gain control of my life, I just feel tired.

That’s my rant. I know I need to work on this and I am, slowly, but I am. I guess I’m not looking for any answers or any judgement but just someone to open up to. I know I may not be the best of people and I have a lot of flaws too but yeah. I just needed to get this out of my system.",2022-05-01 17:09:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1561351888,3,/r/lonely/comments/ug4eha/im_tired_of_dealing_with_everything/,,0,0,I’m tired of dealing with everything
141,ug4hb6,Jealous-Tea4559,"When i was a kid I was raised by just my mum after my dad committed suicide when I was a year old. Really I'd say my sister raised me. My mum was an alcoholic for a large part of my growing up and would spent most days in bed and most nights talking to people on a C.B radio. There would be times where she would disappear for weeks at a time, there would be times where we'd be locked in our rooms with the upstairs electricity turned off so we had no light and times where my birthdays were forgotten. I used to have a fond memory of visiting my sisters school one day and all the other girls in class looking after me, but I found out when my mum passed away that it was because she moved in with a guy  and his kids in a differnet town and didn't tell us. We used to pay for electricity back then putting money into a meter and we had no money so we'd spend the nights by candle light playing board games. We had a gas oven and we'd eat fish cake sandwiches. I remembered them as fond memories, but the reality - wow.

Growing up I was always guarded. I couldn't let anyone get close and fully trust them and this put a lot of people off. When I allowed people in I would scare them away when they saw the real me. The amount of times I would warn people and be reassured is too many to count. I worked at a place for 5 years and only two people knew my private life. One left after 6 months and I didn't speak to them for over 10 years and the other was killed when a car hit him. I remember my boss hearing me talking to my then girlfriend and not believing I was talking to someone and taking the phone from me to confirm I actually had a girlfriend. When that place shut down I didn't say goodbye to anyone. I went to the work party, but didn't have a group to talk to. I tried to get drunk, tried to join in and even tried to dance, but it felt so forced so after an hour or so I left. I remember seeing a woman I sat next to called Charli walking towards me a few weeks after and said ""hi"" and she blanked me. I'd sat next to her for 5 years, helped her make my Yoko Littner cosplay outfit inbetween calls. Helped her when she passed out due to suffering from panic attacks. Blanked.

158,ug72mb,Expert_Lifeguard_578,"This my first time posting about something this personal and I'd never thought I'd get to the point where I'd be trying to talk to random people on reddit about my personal problems. 

A little about myself:
I'm a 31 year old male. I've have the same job for 10 years working at my parents business where I make very little money because it's a non skilled job. Even then I tend to become lazy and I'm still late for work often even after ten years. To be honest if it wasn't my parents who were my boss I'd be fired a long time ago. 

Even though I use to have friends and girlfriends in high school my crippling anxiety and depression ruined that and I did nothing about it.

Even though people say I'm a good looking guy I've pushed away all of my friends and most of my family. When I get off of work I go straight home and just hang out. My friends stopped trying to hang out.  Also because they all have started a family and most have kids and it seems like life is passing me by so fast it makes my depression worse. I only sit at home and smoke weed and play video games with my brother and sister online sometimes. I've become addicted to porn and I'm very impulsive. I've also become addicted to pills in a bad way. 

During my twenties I've had one girlfriend a few years ago when I was 29 and she was 19.. it lasted a year and the relationship was toxic. She ended up cheating and leaving me.. making me feel that much more of a loser. 

I started to lose my hair because of my addiction and stress. I let my health go even though I'm skinny and semi fit. 

My social anxiety Is so bad that I won't even leave my house if my neighbors are outside for the fear of them striking up a conversation and me telling them that I'm a single high school education loser with no motivation for my future and no goals. 

I just want to be better slowly but surely. Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

171,ug9aor,Arnetty,"For one, I'm glad this subreddit exists because this is by far the most common feeling I experience every day. It's crazy how difficult it seems to have gotten to make friends these days. I've tried probably over ten times this year. Conversations don't start unless I start them and never last. Starting to really hate texting because I keep getting ghosted. Never mind dating which I somehow keep failing out, apparently even just making friends is just as hard.

I'm sure she didn't mean it but this girl I dated and then stopped because she wanted to be friends instead... I felt shamed because in her words she couldn't understand why I feel the need to talk every other day or so. Sheesh sorry I'm not as independent and can't go a week without wanting to talk to you. And apparently several other of my friends are like this. I get there are people out there like this. Respect. But Idk, I didn't like the way she questioned me like that. 

It's hard finding friends who are willing to talk a few nights and hang out like at least once a week. I don't even know where to go to meet new people. Seems like online is the only way to meet new people, friends, dates, and if you're lucky not get ghosted.. 

I love bird watching but there's no birding groups near me. I love hiking but no hiking groups anywhere close to me. The most social I've been this week is when going to the coffee shops and talking with the baristas and I don't wanna bother them and their time if I wanted to be friends with them. 

Like I've always heard it said that you need to be happy with yourself and love yourself first. But do the people saying that mean that you have to do that in practically isolation? 

All I can really think of doing is just setting a daily schedule for enjoying myself, reading, writing, exercise, watching good movies and shows, and having good me days. But like I wonder how I can refrain from getting sad even when I'm having hundreds of productive ""good"" days if it's just spent alone with myself all the time.

177,ugaays,treneod,"Hello everyone

Firstly, I want to apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, english isn't my native language

I'm not sure where to start, so I just do as I feel like..

I don't have many friends. In fact, there's only one person I consider as a real friend- everyone else in my life just seems to be a temporary appearance, which I might even get along with, but won't ever create any deeper connection to- probably because of my own fault

At the moment there are some people I might call friends, but those are only very loose connections, and it's feeling more like ""better acquaintances""

And there's also someone I'm chatting with since quite a while, but we actually don't really know each other because we met on reddit. That was quite a comfort because I actually felt like I got along very good with this person, but somehow this has changed at some point, and now we're only chatting here and there, but those conversations mostly aren't pretty meaningful.

Although I'm not completely socially incompetent I really struggle to approach people, get to know them and afterwards actually keep the friendship going 

With my more introverted personality, especially in my past, I allways was rather shy and reserved in presence of others, and even though I managed to make some friends at school, I lost contact to them pretty much the same day I left school.

Overall, I feel like social interactions sometimes still challenge me, but I got better in handling them. That does mostly only apply to superficial contact though. 

Due to all of that I feel like I have only comparably small experience in basically any subject that requires social skills, what really causes me to feel somewhat inferior to others. 

When I think of my life in retrospect I can't really find a point in which I was happy. Of course I'm not always sad, it's not like I can not enjoy anything, it's more like my general state of mind has been overshadowed by some melancholic feeling since I can remember. It's sometimes more, sometimes less noticeable, but always there.

Now I'm 22 years old and I feel like my life is already over- I've been feeling like I'm just existing for more than the last two years. Like I have no purpose

I sometimes ask myself if my severe loneliness is the only cause for how I am feeling, but I'm not sure about this. That's also the reason I put the (?) in the title.

The thought of my life going to stay like this makes me anxious. It feels like my current state slowly but surely consumes me. I'm losing interest in things I used to like, I barely can sense excitement or joy for things and overall my whole emotional state feels kinda dull. 

I don't think that I am depressed, at least that's what I assume. But I do think that I'm on the best way to actually getting a depression if it goes on like this

And the best part of all of this is that I am completely aware of the fact that I am the major problem in my life, so I can't really blame others for my situation, and if then only to a small degree

I honestly don't even know what my first intention of starting this text even was. Probably to feel less lonely by writing something instead of just staring at the ceiling

Thanks for making it that far, kind stranger",2022-05-01 21:49:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630338976,7,/r/lonely/comments/ugaays/loneliness_is_slowly_consuming_me/,,0,1,Loneliness (?) is slowly consuming me

181,ugb9ia,Draconian000,"I'm a 25 male from Tunisia, my culture encourages sociable behavior and puts great emphasis on community values. I felt disconnected from all the social fuzz ever since I was a little, on the surface I had friends and a normal community life but deep down I didn't really trust people and always felt ashamed of myself, probably because of my parents and because of my own internalized thoughts and patterns of thinking. Things were fairly normal but started slowly getting worse and worse until I got where I am today, I'm 25 and I only have one close friend and few meaningless acquaintances and old friends from my town  (I cut off so many close friends because of my radical borderline reactions and behavior sometimes).    


I'm not quitting on my life, I crave friends and I want to fix all the mistakes I've made and cure my social anxiety, but my own thoughts are blocking me, and this is the point I'm trying to make: I feel like I lost the opportunity of having ""true social life"" which is in my definition being a true part of the local community (my town) and having connections in one way or another with all the people there, basically like any other person in town. I feel like I want to have solid roots and a deep connection with my town before I can go out to the world and know different people, I don't have that connection, and because of that I feel ostracized and a ""no body"", I say to myself how can a person have a future without having a past? Without having an origin? That's how I perceive my culture.  


Possible solutions:

\- I completely start over in a place far away (could end up really bad).  
\- I try to reconnect with my community and I sacrifice more years of my life and more energy that could be used in different things such as investing in my career and making money.  
\- Accept the situation, suck it up, and get out to the world knowing that I will never find myself where I want to be.

199,ugd4pw,cola-cats,"I was a military brat growing up and that definitely contributed to this. When i was in first grade, one of my only two ""friends"" was mean as fuck to me for no reason and the other friend like her more. In 5th grade my two new friends liked each other more and would do stuff like go to the movies during their sleep overs and never did that with me, then they both left me for other people in middle school. The new group of friends I met had known each other basically their whole childhood up until that point. 

Thats how it's been my entire life. I try to join peoples groups but i can never really make it in and eventually they just fade out of my life. 

I decided I was gonna put myself out there and actually try to make friends when i went to college, but that still happened. I literally got replaced by someone who was more popular than me. 

Now im a junior. I thought I had something with this classmate, and eventually we started having casual makeouts. It's pathetic, but it's the closest i've had to a serious relationship. She even convinced me to be an RA with her over the summer. 

Lately she hasn't been talking to me as much. I wanted to get food after dnd with her and she completely blew me off and got food with her roommate. I was worried I was starting annoying her, but decided i was being anxious and over dramatic. I got the confidence to ask her if she wanted to room together during the RA thing, sure she would be excited, and she just said ""I'll think about it,"" and i tried to save myself by saying ""that's okay, i'll be fun to meet new people with the randomly selected roommates"" and she like the message and didn't say anything else.

Obvs there's more to my relationship with her but i'm p sure it's over at this point and I don't know why. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends and foster that kind of relationship. I don't know why it seems so effortless for everyone else and I can barely keep up with having more than 2 people in my life.

I have tried being positive and not focusing on that too much.. but i have to come to terms that my life is just me my job and my dog… my dog has been with me for 13 years and she is slowly fading which is super hard to think the end is coming, and so even more loneliness and heartbreak is in the horizon. My heart is broken by my view on what life should look like.. and by the people who have come into my life and chosen not to stay. Ive tried to be strong to keep going but i dont want to wake up tomorrow to 38 with the same life ive been having. I pray to God to let me see my life’s purpose so that i can be ok with my loneliness but i can only feel my heart’s desire to be loved and married again . I cant stop crying rn.  I feel like everyone else is too busy for me. I reach out to friends and extended family but everyone’s always postponing plans we make or just busy… some people dont even answer. I feel bad, man i just feel like shit. Im not an introvert, im outgoing and friendly, im not shallow and work hard i dont ask anyone for anything, i support myself,  and im not horrible to look at… i don’t understand i really dont.

221,ugfb82,ANCHBOX,"So basically I've never posted anything on Reddit before so I hope I don't mess up. I'm basically gonna summarize my story from approximately 3 months ago. 

I am a 14 year old male in high school right now and my life has been a mess ever since quarantine. For an entire two years of my life I didn't speak to a single person. All my friends have forgotten about me except one.

I met this one girl who invited me to sit with her and two other girls. We became friends and I was still depressed and felt horrible everyday. At the same time during lunch, I was bullied by this group of people and they were horrible and I felt horrible everytime.

This one girl in that group of friends, hugged me for the first time in my life. That feeling, I miss it so much, my entire week felt amazing just from that. She stoped after like two weeks and only hugged me four times. I felt horrible after that, I was wondering what I did wrong. I've been hugged two more times by one toher girl since then, and one of those times was when I started crying in class. I love my four friends so much, if I didn't have them, I dont know how I would survive.

I introduced one of those girls to my friend that was a guy and after only after like a week of knowing each other, they started hugging everyday, and holding hands and stuff. They were doing that as friends by the way. I'm so jealous of them and wish I could do that with her.

Now, I'm in my room and I cry every single night from saddness and loneliness. I know I should be grateful for at least some friends but the stress and everything is too much for me.

If you actually read everything thank you so much for spending your time, I spent so long writing this.",2022-05-02 02:16:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611798243,4,/r/lonely/comments/ugfb82/i_dont_even_know_how_i_still_have_the_energy_to/,,0,4,I don't even know how I still have the energy to wake up every day.

228,ugfw88,Pluggboiriq,"This might be all over the place. But I never had a real friend growing up. It was always my twin brother by my side but we go through the same thing in a way. School and soccer always kept me from trying to make any genuine connections and conversations with anyone. I made “friends” in school but never hung out with any of them outside of it. Never went to any parties or other functions partly due to my parents, but it still made me feel some type of way. I see my “friends” now doing stuff with people I know while I’m here at home doing nothing or studying or training. It started to weigh me down to the point of me being envious to my older sisters who talks to their friends every day or hangs out with them every weekend.

I don’t even have a friends phone number on my phone besides my family’s or work related numbers. I’m 24 now and it’s becoming painful how lonely I am. I’ve actually tried going out to events, bars, or other social settings to make friends but it’s so hard for me. Especially having social anxiety, it’s like I can’t never put my best foot forward. It’s even harder trying to talk to women. Im just unlucky or something I honestly don’t know. Is it how I look or come off to them? No clue. But I never grab their attention. It’s not hard making conversations with others guys as I had small group of in HS, but majority of my friends in college was from me being on the soccer team. 

But it’s more like people knew who I was from something than knowing who I am as a person. It’s hurts when even my parents ask me why don’t I don’t hang or go out friends and I have to tell them that I don’t have any. I do love talking to people. Either deep, thought provoking convos or silly dumb ones. I have lot I want to speak on but I don’t want to make it so long. I just found this subreddit and felt like it was the place for me.

Then when we stopped having class together the other disappeared as well. It's not a distance issue we all live within 30 minutes of campus.

I’m a social butterfly. I have a lot of acquaintances in my life, I have no problems socializing or meeting people. But for some reason, no one wants to be close to me for very long.

I just want people to be close to. Best friend(s), family, a significant other, even my own child doesn’t really like me much of the time.

But I don't think I'm gonna do anything about it. I cut her off and she lives too far for me to have a proper relationship where I'm at in my life anyways (barely 20, no car nor license, late work times in retail apprenticeship).

Just, it fucking hurts man. I don't know why it hurts so much. Guess I'm just that lonely.",2022-05-02 05:45:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1457809201,3,/r/lonely/comments/ugiokv/dreamt_romantically_about_someone_i_cut_off/,,0,2,Dreamt romantically about someone I cut off

258,ugiub2,igottaclique,"I moved out of my small town to live in the suburbs a couple of years ago. A year later, I moved to a different state. I haven’t had friends that I see consistently since hs. We all went our own ways, I still talk to one of them though, frequently. 
     I have a coworker, who moved up really fast in the company and became my boss 7 months in. He kept saying his gf and I should hang because we’re so similar. Having not had a healthy/real social life in awhile, I gave it a shot when she eventually asked me to chill. It was kinda awkward and she felt like she was asking me all the questions, but it felt like it was a really one sided conversation on my end as well. Anyway it went the worst way I possibly could have imagined, and we didn’t dislike each other she had a nice vibe but we didn’t exactly hit it off. This was my first chance in awhile and I sucked at it. I want to try it one more time and if I don’t like it I’m done. But I can’t help but feel like this is gonna be my life forever. Lonely asf. I thought I was better off leaving my small town but look where I am now, lol. Idk what I am doing wrong 
:( Can’t help but feel like life is just cruel and that I don’t wanna be here anymore. My family’s always been disconnected from each other so I lack a strong support system.

274,ugjzw0,Icy-Essay4371,"I’ve been with my wife (dating - marriage) about 8 years now. Throughout that time she’s always had a serious difficulty making female friends. It makes me feel terrible because I have a healthy amount of close guy friends, but she has no girlfriends she can consider close. Particularly speaking there’s a friend group that I have been friends with for about a decade (3 married guys). I’ve also known their wives for almost as long. They’ve all known my wife for quite some time now, from the moment I started dating her really. The issue is that all their respective wives seem to take absolutely no interest in truly being friends with my wife. And although I can understand how this is bias coming from me, my wife is one of the kindest, funniest, down to earth women I know. She’s very outgoing and positive and everyone I know in my life loves her. Even the wives of my friends, on a surface level get along with her and seem to like her as well. I’ve seen her initiate conversations with all of them, invite them out, try to ask them questions to get to know them better. All the things you’d expect out of someone who is sincerely trying to make friends. The issue is that when it comes to a real friendship forming, it never happens. They are in their own world amongst them 3, and never include her in outings, group chats, photos, etc. It’s become an issue because my guy friends invite me and my wife to do things with them regularly, but my wife feels perpetually out of place because she can’t break the clique barrier that she feels is there. Furthermore, my wife isn’t a desperate, people pleasing type person, so if she feels she’s being thought of as not good enough or excluded on purpose, she closes up and it becomes hard to convince her to give the situation a chance. I’m at a crossroad because part of me feels like I should have her express her feelings to the girls (seeing as that we have such a long history), but at the same time I don’t feel like it would help anything, because it might just be seen as a desperate attempt for approval. At the same time, I can’t just cut off my friends because not only won’t that help the situation, I know it would make my wife feel terrible. But I can feel this situation is reaching a breaking point with her where she will simply cut them all off and I’m not sure how that will affect my relationships. Of course if that’s what she needs I am willing to support her. But I would like to avoid buring bridges. I can admit that there are some issues that I can identify that may be at the root of the problem. First of all, these aren’t all my best friends. Only one of them is. That friend has always told me that he and his wife see us as their closest friends, and that now that my wife and I are married They see my wife as a sister. But that has never actually been the reality in relation to how his wife treats mine. She’s cordial and we hang out from time to time but there’s never any real connection that forms between them. my relationship with these guys has fluctuated not because of any issues we’ve had but just because they’ve always been in different phases of life than me. For instance they all started dating their current wives before I dated mine. They all got married around the same time whereas I married my wife 1-4 years after they did. Now they’re all having babies and we don’t want a child. Also, my wife is Trinidadian, and all their wives are Hispanic so they have an underlying connection that they don’t share with my wife. Although I don’t think that it’s right that those differences should make it so hard for us all to get along, my wife is convinced that it might have something to do with ethnic background. Not that she thinks they’re racist but she thinks that the fact that they’re all Hispanic has added a layer of difficulty to them accepting her as a friend. I’ve never had issues making friends with guys and I’ve always been perplexed at why it seems many women tend to have issues making good friends of the same gender. From what I’ve observed their friendships tend to be competitive, shallow, and full of insecurities. So it’s very hard for me to connect to her situation and give her good advice. I’ve done all I know to do to keep her patient and positive with the situation. And of course I can’t nor do I want to force her to try to get along with people who are clearly not interested in her value as a friend. I’m hoping someone can help me navigate this situation.",2022-05-02 07:16:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641669887,1,/r/lonely/comments/ugjzw0/trying_to_help_my_wife_make_friends/,,0,0,Trying to help my wife make friends

 Rant:
Hayo, I'm a 15 year old girl. I've been homeschooled for 4 years. it started off great, and I still enjoy it because I can learn things the way I want to and I don't get bullied. But, at the same time, I have become extremely lonely. I have 0 in person friends who are my age. (And yes, I do get out of the house. I take in person teen Martial Arts and I go to local concerts) whenever I attempt to talk to another teen, they look at me like I'm a complete freak. I'll try my hardest to introduce myself, but it always comes off as cringey and weird. Some people will blame this on .e being homeschooled, when really, I know of a lot of homeschooled teens who actually have friends. I have never been good at socializing, even when I was in public school. I have always been awkward and different. All of the public schools near me are trashy and complete shit, I wouldn't feel safe going to public school. I live near the ghetto... too many gangs. 


Now it's been getting harder than ever to deal with the loneliness. I have a lot of online friends, and they are all going to school dances, chilling at the mall with friends, going on dates, going to parties with friends.. and I have to admit. I'm extremely jealous. Don't get me wrong, I love my life. My parents are amazing, and I go to a lot of great concerts. But at the end of the day, I wish I had someone to hang out with and actually talk to In person... Like my age.. who's genuine, and not fake. But again, I'm just really fucking shitty at introducing myself.. Especially in groups of multiple people. I never know the right things to say.. I wanna give a good first impression.. but I also don't wanna lie. People will always tell me to just ""be myself"" so I do, and then I get viewed as a freak. I really don't know how to handle it. It's always just a loose loose situation for me.


When I was younger, I always dreamed of being a teenager. (From watches TV shows, movies, reading books) Now I'm actually a teenager and im experiencing none of the things that I think a teen should experience. For fucks sake, in 15, turning 16 fairly soon... and I haven't even had my first kiss yet! Or anything similar. Infact, nobody has EVER actually even thought of me in a romantic way. I fell like I've been lied to my entire life by media. Altrough.. other teens (including homeschooled teens)  are experiencing the stuff that media shows.. so I really don't know. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's really not working out.

290,uglp90,varunj6v1k9,"I'm alone since 2016. Never left my house except for college/work because of my parents and their habit of instilling fear regarding people, trips, etc. The thing with loneliness is that at first it kinda seems easy and comfortable but for some people like me, after a few years it will start acting like a trap from which you really want to break free. So getting a partner is pretty out of reach for me due to my looks and my conversation skills. Also people tend to ignore/ghost wojaks/doomers so getting a normal friend is also out of reach for me. The only option now is to spend the rest of my life alone.

But what if I have at least another wojak/doomer(s) by my side and me for him/her/them? At least we ain't gonna be alone. At least we have someone to curse at life together, hangout and do stuff that you never could do because you didn't have friends, etc. In fact, even better, I would love to be part of a group of wojaks/doomers hanging out together.

295,ugmux0,MoparMan831,"Hey guys,hope you all had a great weekend.so…I live in Oregon and it’ll be my two year anniversary of living here in August. I grew up in Santa Cruz California and I miss it every day and lately home is all I’ve been able to think about. It’s such a magical place,I mean it truly is. I left my heart there and the only real “friend” that I have. Me and hun haven’t been in touch in quite some time now. We both stay busy because of work related stuff and what not so it’s understandable but I often just feel like happiness is far behind me now and an eternity of loneliness has positioned itself for good. I work 50 hours a week,therefore I don’t have time to even think about going out to meet new people or do anything spontaneous even as much as I dream about it or would like to. All I can seem to find comfort in is sleeping and spending time with my dog which isn’t even much now given my situation. I just miss home non stop. Constantly. 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I’m in southern Oregon and about an hour and a half from the ocean as opposed to growing up where I did and being a two minute walk away from the beach. I miss waking up to that fresh salty breeze flowing through my open window,the sound of seagulls,sea lions,the late night and early morning fog…watching the surfers,sailboats,stingrays swimming close to the shore. Going to the wharf for an amazing warm bowl of clam chowder. I took a drive to the Oregon coast about a month ago and was so disappointed. The long drive being one thing,but the atmosphere once I got there and a million other small aspects made the experience not so pleasant. In fact the journey made me more depressed. My heart remains back home. It’s an 8 hour drive which isn’t bad by any means but it’s not something I can take time out to conquer whenever I please. But I am on a mission to get back as soon as I can. I watch videos almost nightly on YouTube just so I can watch and listen to the waves crash upon the cliffs over in the west side. Or to listen to the laughter of the couples or the children having the absolute time of their life while walking the boardwalk. That was me at one time 😓 I watched said videos before typing this and broke into tears. I just needed somewhere to vent and I’m hoping it’ll help a bit.

Going through the uncertain and unpredictable phases of life at this stage, from which our personality and dynamics of behavior are moulded, we are developing with age and time. Social situations etc make us react to them which mould our emotional responses and this in turn adds to our emotional growth. Many teenagers are confused and perplexed with the changes they go through, it is tough for some to even comprehend, and tough for some to even face.
Even though being surrounded by tons of people, many of still feel that void within us, something that is still empty no matter how much we try to fill the gap with the presence of people. Maybe it is not such a great feeling after all, but it does definitely keep one wondering for the rest of their life. The void makes one think about their existence in this hustly bustly world surrounded by people, from which we obtain happiness in their presence, while us being alone are left with thoughts of loneliness.
How would one overcome this void? Is it something us humans can get over? Is loneliness something all of us humans suffer from? Why does the feeling of being lonely, being all to ourselves not keep with the concept of self-love and self-growth?
I hope people get more clarity with themself and their loneliness, i hope they overcome this and enjoy their own company for not everybody, except a few people whom we seem to get a reciprocation of maintaining a relationship from, are the ones that would define us and our social circle.

335,ugttaz,deplone1,"I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. That was nearly 30 years ago. We have very similar tastes and personalities and we genuinely enjoy each other's time. The friendship was pretty open (not THAT open), we would sit by the fire together and chat for hours.  I would hold her and we would support each other with our relationship problems and other life issues.  We would see each other many times per week. I adored her but I also knew she was WAY out of my league.

And then, one day, I decided to tell her how I felt. As I expected, it wasn't something she was interested in but what I didn't expect was that it would change our friendship forever.

Gone were the frequent outings, the multiple text messages per day, the chats by the fire, all physical contact except for the sterile hugs one gives to someone they don't know very well. She stopped telling me about her relationships and other life issues.  All interactions became very acquaintance-like, devoid of any emotion or feeling. Our IRL interactions dropped from multiple times per week to maybe once or twice a year. I would get occasional ""how are you"" texts but if I actually tried to tell her how I felt, she would shut down the conversation quickly.  She did NOT want to talk about it.

Over the next 10 years or so, I was sort of able to convince her that my feelings wouldn't get in the way of our friendship so she opened up a bit but nowhere near how things once were.

I was never really a very emotional person. But as I got older and mid-life kicked in, my crisis kicked in full speed and I started having emotional feelings I had never felt, including love like I have never felt.

Over the past few years, my friend has had to go through some major personal tragedies and there would be days where I would spend them with her helping her out with various things. Just being near her would give me these intense emotional highs.  Any physical touch, no matter how platonic, was electric. I stopped seeing her age or physical attributes and started seeing the most wonderful, amazing, and beautiful woman I have ever seen. When she makes eye contact with me it feels like I am listening to an orchestra full of rainbows. I am literally high on emotions and hormones.

That high of an emotional feeling doesn't happen without a crash.  After a weekend together helping her out, I sit here at my desk at work with this indescribable emptiness and tightness in my chest. I keep staring at the text message notification to see if I got one since that last time I looked 5 seconds ago. The 40 ton pressure of loneliness is just relentlessly crushing my soul and I cannot stop it. I cannot get away from it. I can't just stop loving her. I cannot work, I cannot relax. I have severe withdrawal symptoms after every time we meet.

When I am with her, it makes me so happy. All of my worries and concerns are just gone. But once we part, the sadness and emptiness returns along with the realization that we probably only have a handful of times left to be together.

It is torture.

thanks for listening

edit: I just wanted to add that I don't fault her in any way. For the same reason I cannot stop loving her, she cannot start loving me.  I don't believe we get to pick the ones we love. And while I appreciate that I still get to spend some time with her, the times I am away far outnumber being together.  And that roller coaster is not a fun ride.",2022-05-02 16:41:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650979249,23,/r/lonely/comments/ugttaz/in_love_with_my_best_friend/,,0,6,In love with my best friend

338,uguace,EERMA,"There’s little we can control in the world. Other people, the stock market, weather, or world events are outside of our influence. However, we can control ourselves, and that’s all we need to control. Changing our inner world leads to the changes we wish to see in our lives.

It may be hard to believe that changing our thoughts or attitude can make us healthy, wealthy, and wise. However, making inner changes can have dramatic effects on every part of our lives.

### Enhance your life by making these internal changes:

**How you view failure.** Do you view failure as an embarrassment? Is it something you should avoid at all costs?   
 

● What if you viewed failure as simply a step along the way to success? **Failure just means that the approach you used didn’t work.** It’s an opportunity to re-think your process and try again. If you keep learning and making improvements, how can you possibly fail in the long-term?

● The way you view adversity plays a big part in your overall wellbeing. How do you view setbacks? – are they personal, permanent and pervasive or temporary situations to be built upon?  What view would be most useful to you?  
 

**Values.** Suppose someone valued charity, kindness, and modesty. What type of life would they lead? Suppose someone else valued freedom, adventure, and courage. Now, suppose a third person valued money, power, and greed. It’s easy to see how these three people would lead very different lives.

● What are your values? Do they support the life you want to live? Or, is your life in line with your values?  
 

**Beliefs.** Beliefs frame how you view the world. What you believe about yourself may be limiting. Beliefs evolve through time: do you believe the same about Santa Claus now as you did when you were six years old? 

● List some of your beliefs about the world, yourself, and life in general. **How are those beliefs helping or hurting you?** What beliefs would be helpful for you to develop and enjoy the life you desire?

**Attitude.** Do you expect things to work out for you, or are you primarily pessimistic? You’ll be less likely to try to do something if you have negative expectations. A positive attitude can help with your patience and ability to persevere when things aren’t going well.

● Consider how your attitude is impacting the results you’re generating in your life.  
 

**Gratitude.** Giving yourself a reminder of what is already working in your life can positively impact your attitude and expectations. It can also reduce anxiety and benefit your perspective.

● Take a few minutes from time to time to list the things you’re grateful for. Notice the small things – they’re often, actually, the big things!  


**Thoughts.** Our thoughts are under our control, though it might not seem that way. It’s easy to prove this to yourself. You can choose to think about an ice cream cone or a green cow. You can choose to think about anything you like.

● It’s valuable to take control of your thoughts. **If you’re predominately thinking about negative outcomes, you’re going to struggle.**

● Monitor your thinking, keep things in perspective. Note those recurring, unhelpful, thoughts: challenge yourself to challenge yourself.

I think because I don't have a close relationship with my mom that I can't connect with others because I never learned how. For example, I'm talking to a girl, seriously, for the first time. I've always found girls attractive but never found a girl I liked as much as her. I constantly need reassurance from her and feel as if I need her. 

I am capable of being alone but not having any friends or family I can talk to, hurts.

Dealing with my mommy issues alone makes me feel lonely because everyone, but me, has someone to run to.

346,ugvnk0,MaybeIJustNeedSome10,"For almost 27 years of being alive I tried to fit in many times. Have quite a bit of friends because of that, wonderful people. I play games with them every now and then but back when I lived closer we used to hang out and eat out irl or watch a movie. 

Even then I feel so lonely. Friends can only do so much, a person needs to find genuine connection and I always feel so out of place. Maybe I should just let go of that idea and allow myself to become normal but I have tried many times and it never made me feel alright. It feels so uncomfortable and limiting.

I find it so weird how a lot of people can easily connect with others, maybe they're just comfortable with themselves that in any situation they find themselves in they're okay? 

Am I the weird one for feeling so extremely out of place? I just don't get it. I've only ever felt complete once in my life but life ain't like the movies so it ended and that was almost 6 years ago.

I keep wondering when my moment would click when I'm fine being where I am and okay with whatever tomorrow brings and find enjoyment with that peace. I feel so out of touch, this is something teenagers worry about not adults like me?

I have a job where I'm actually really good, got a place to myself which isn't a big one but that might have to change soon to a smaller one if I ever get forced to work back in the office or I quit.

I've always felt like life was supposed to be simple however I cannot at all control this feeling that I have. It gets very overwhelming sometimes and I don't really know how to deal with it.

Life is really short and I want to enjoy it. I want to be a father and raise my kids with a wonderful partner. That's my end goal.

But I just think that I'm too odd to ever find someone to have a family with. I am slowly losing my reason to live, I find it rather sad that I wake up with a heavy feeling of extreme loneliness more often now than ever.

I don't know what change I need to do anymore, I feel like there's nothing for me out there.

352,ugw68m,Angele-_,"I (18F) want to preface this by saying that I am very happy for my friend (also 18F), she deserves to be with someone and has always wanted to be in a relationship. She’s my most favourite person in the world, it’s just sad that now I am not hers, possessive as that may sound.

There is a part of me that has never felt more alone. I rarely see her now as she always goes to see her boyfriend (who lives a few hours away), and even when I do see her it feels like he’s all we talk about. That or my love life (nonexistent) which gets frustrating after a while.

Sometimes it feels like she’s tired of being around me, today she passively mentioned that I make no effort, which felt sort of unfair as lately it feels like neither of us have. After a while of having my invitations to go out ignored I’ll admit I’ve stepped back a little. Thing is I have no one else to run to and that used to be okay, but now when I acknowledge that around her she seems judgmental. 

I want to make other friends, I just seem to be atrocious at it, we both used to be. However now she’s grown out of that, whilst I still remain face down in the dirt. I don’t resent her, but hanging out with her makes me feel inadequate, I don’t know what to do.

Today she also said she wouldn’t come out with me for a while to save money for a trip her and this guy are going to go on. That felt like a stab to the heart - some sort of confirmation that she really wants to be with him more than me.

I am considering giving up and just accepting the fact that I was born to be alone. I feel trapped in a loop of being broken and not having the skills or the support to fix myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I just am alone so much of the time and it brakes me. 

Not to mention all the trama that I have to deal with. From childhood abuse and isolation. I find it hard to love myself when all remember was being bulled. Whether that be my sister, kids at school, teachers, or even my parents. I have so much trama. From kids in my elementary school saying that they would rather kill themself than date me to high school bullies making fun of me. Teachers use to blame me for stuff like valium or spreading lice (never had any in my life) to constantly saying ""stop giving your mother grief"" (That was said by my elementary school special ed teacher).

364,ugwybz,NoHope5086,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety and crushing loneliness for years now. Student loan repayments and other life issues that have happened to me have only magnified all of it as the years have dragged on. As it is, I basically have no one and the few people who do show up in my life inevitably disappear soon after.

Once a ""friend"", a very tenuous definition of one but still someone I talked to on and off, offered to listen to what was bothering me one day. After telling them about some things that had been really weighing on me, instead of just being supportive and trying to be a part of my life to help with the loneliness, basically just said I was ""too negative"" and didn't have any fight in me so I should go get therapy. After I explained to them that I literally couldn't afford it when I'm already struggling because therapy is expensive, they said that if I actually wanted my life to get better I would find a way to make it happen. When I was just like ""that literally isn't how any of this works"" they ghosted me and haven't spoken to me again, in years.

I'm so sick of things like this happening, because this wasn't the first nor the last time something similar happened. People offer to be there, but what they REALLY mean is that they want to feel like a good person by doing something but don't actually care enough to give you time out of their lives. So they throw some generic zero effort ""advice"" at you and pat themselves on the back, then when you say that it doesn't help, blast you for being too negative or some other nonsense.

If nothing else it exemplifies how few people care unless you serve some kind of direct benefit to them, and how few understand or care to understand how lonely and crushing life can be for others.

375,ugy4il,Possiblyovrthinking,"Dating is really tough in this world, at least when it comes to having a genuine connection with someone. I (25M) have had two long term relationships in my life. The first, I never should have been with as we had NOTHING in common, but she was cute and I had been chasing her for a while. Also, I was seventeen. You live and learn.

The second relationship was a much more genuine connection and I am so thankful for her being in my life even though we wanted completely different things by the end of it.

Aside from those I have had dates, and flings, and complicated stuff in between, but nothing that was tangible.

I've been on dating apps for a while now and after several, uninspiring dates, I recently went on what was probably the best first date I've ever been on. I've never felt so comfortable with someone so quick. The next two days she didn't text me back and I felt miserable. Then she did text me back, explaining that she simply didn't feel the same.

That's how the cookie crumbles. I think finding a person in your life that you ""get"" and ""gets"" you back is such a special thing, but also... It's not everything.

You have your family. You have your friends. You have little things like books, and movies, and music that you enjoy. Maybe it's tv show or a sports team. Maybe you have a hobby. At the end of the day, we are individuals no matter what. It's easy as all hell to feel ""incomplete"" without someone to share your life with.

So I think what I'm saying is put yourself out there, but don't feel too bad if you're not having any luck. I think a lot of humans feel the same way. The same frustrations and short comings. It's rare to find something real and you'd be surprised to see just how many people are settling.

Focus on yourself and what you enjoy and what makes you feel alive as best as you can, because waiting to live your life for a second person, in my opinion, is no way to live.  Enjoy yourself. Love yourself.

Now I’m in college, never had a girlfriend, struggled with friends. And I’m just tried. I think intimacy is like a good diet, we need it to be healthy. Right now all I have is p*rn (trying to quit) and maybe talking to a drunk girl at a party. This is like eating nothing but junk food. Lately I’ve been depressed, bitter, and on-edge. Lashing out and using things to cope. 

Yeah I’m a guy, but I’m very meak. I need physical, emotional, and spiritual intimacy. I need someone to snuggle with, someone to share my life with. Someone who will reassure me that she loves me.  

Problem is, not matter what I do. It doesn’t happen. I’m also very awkward and shy around girls unless I’m so drunk that I can’t even be myself (if that makes sense).

I feel like a failure and that there is no future for me. With each new big step in my life, I tell myself that it will change. New people, new environment and nothing changes. I make efforts to be more sociable, to be interested in others, to pay attention to my appearance and I remain invisible. 

I won't go into details, but my life is myserable and I am determined that I have no future. I am not desperate, no. That would imply that I have expectations and am disappointed. I simply have no hope. I don't expect anything.

Like I know why Im alone. Im too introverted and dont have that strange social anxiety to keep the convo going. 

I also cant relate to a lot of stuff that people are interested in. And things I like I dont want to talk about. I dont feel close to someone if I do have 2 or so many things in common. Like an example is I like to watch baseball - but only live. And I dont know many players and I know absolutely no history about them or numbers. I just like the actual sport being played. I dont have any affinity for celebrity things or wealth as entertainment. And Ive sat mostly in 2nd row behind first base seats like 1-2x a year but everyone I have taken doesnt like even watching the sport. So I dont go anymore bc I have no one to go with and baseball fans are usually die hard people whom know all the players want to see certain teams face off and all their numbers. 

I also am really bad at pretending or faking interest as all I got is smile and nod. And you do it 3 times in a row etc. 

Im an introvert and also prefer talking about facts or science. New inventions and discoveries. Or how something works. I like pets but I dont really want to hear about peoples pets at work - or tell them about mine. I like experiencing the animal and meeting ur pet is the only part that Id be interested in. One ex friend I told a year and a half ago that Im adopting a cat! And they went off on a tangent about things I need to start doing right away like brushing their teeth. I dont want to hear any of that. Id first say have you ever owned a cat before? And Id say yes 3. End of that chat. Would be my happy place.

Like how asking what kind of music I like is really a pass. IDubbztv has an episode on it that describes my feelings about that to a T.

My way of thinking is something that comes packaged with high IQ, low social awareness, and a high intolerance for stupid people... Yet I have come to see that the more intellectually unaware people are the happier they seem to be and the more socially accepted they are. I'm pretty sure some part of this is a function of having a face that always looks worried. That even when people do talk to me and I talk back it seems like within a few sentences of alienated myself somehow and as far as I was aware I was being nice.

1 friend has just shut everyone out.

432,uh55ta,Ok-Independent-1231,"Soooo I'm in college and during first semester I was hooking up with this guy.  He's really funny and we have so much in common, but we were just hooking up.  I always had to text him first and would be straight up avoided sometimes, but I couldn't help being into him.  He just makes me feel all fuzzy when I see or think about him.  I never told him I wanted more because quite frankly I don't think he's into me whatsoever.

After a few months I saw him again at the bar.  Apparently, he was really happy his friend started talking to me so he could.  He asked how I've been and about my bf (who I've been broken up with for a bit now) and why I haven't been snapping him.  He was being all flirty and I brought him back with me once again, but this time he asked to stay the night.  He has never stayed the night or even asked to.  And then he sat and talked to me in the morning before crawling back in bed to sleep more together.  Haven't seen or heard from him since and vowed I wouldn't snap him first again, but I really want to.

I know he doesn't see me like that.  Honestly, I'm not even sure if he's actually attracted to me or just thinks I'm easy.  If I tell my friends how hung up, I am they'll be so disappointed I let it happen again.  There's only two weeks of school left and over summer I could get over him.  I just don't wanna have to.  I like talking to him and hearing his goofy laugh.  I think I'm definitely getting my hopes up thinking anything more could happen because then I just feel so sad after.

476,uhb679,VeryMentallyStable,"Things just work better when I’m alone. I wouldn’t say I’m happier, but I’m never happy so that’s not really the goal. But things just feel more functional. Being around people just makes me feel like I’m having to grit my teeth to get through until the social interaction is over, and then all I want is to go shut myself in behind as many locks as possible in a place where I know no one can reach me. It usually takes all my effort not to say or do something that goes against who I think I am or who I want to be, and when I do slip up and say or do something like that, it gets added to my internal conflict and self-hatred that I always feel.

I’ve found that I only really like the idea of people, how they appear in the fake scenarios I daydream about from time to time. But reality is never like that, in reality people are always disappointing or frustrating or hard to deal with or they let you down constantly. Always leaves me either just having to tolerate and go along with shit I don’t want to because I don’t have the energy to fight it, or I do have the energy and end up feeling like I’m beating my head against a wall.

I know that I’m better on my own, that I’m more myself, I’m more mentally stable, and I feel less self-hatred when it’s just me. I have zero friends, no one I even talk to at all anymore because I ghosted the last people I knew over a year ago and have been avoiding social interaction as much as humanly possible since. Only consistent person I’ve ever had in my life at all was my sister, but she got hit by a bus just over a month ago, so there is literally no one anymore.

But the frustrating part is that I can’t seem to escape the overriding feeling of loneliness that comes from living like this, even though I know for a fact it’s the best thing for me on every level. I play out scenarios of running into people I used to know at the gym or something in my head on a loop, even if the scenario involves me being angry at the person and probably walking away without even talking, because it’s still some type of meaningful social interaction. 

And today I was walking out of a store and the greeter at the door said goodbye to me and I just had this overwhelming feeling that she just looked so gentle and sweet, she wasn’t even exceptionally attractive or anything, but it just made me think of how much I’d like to be able to just have someone like that hold me and let me lean on her for a while. But I could never do that, I don’t even like people knowing about my past or anything like that, so there’s no way I could ever bring myself to break down like that in front of someone else. I’ve tried to talk to people about the stuff that makes me uncomfortable before and it make my skin crawl and they always treat me differently, even if they become more caring towards me or something “positive” like that afterwards, it makes me feel sick.

I just don’t know how to stop feeling like this, how to stop getting these extreme pangs of loneliness and touch starvation, or at least lessen them so they’re tolerable and don’t put me at risk of doing stupid things I know I’ll regret. I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years across multiple different therapists, multiple different types of therapy, been on more medications than I care to remember and none of it helps at all.

When I finally got the apartment, I completely neglected every responsibility in my life and spend the majority of my freetime planning and working to make this my dream home. I felt like this could be the chance to make some changes in my life.

After the first week of living there, I already knew that it's not gonna happen. Hell, it might even get worse. Back home I had my parents and my brothers but here I have absolutely nobody.

I don't have friends that I could invite over. No girlfriend. Most of my family lives too far away to come visit regularly and my parents and brothers are the only people that sometimes come over.

I thought that the independence and freedoms that come with living alone would help me get out of my comfort zone and make me go out more and socialize. And even though I'd love to, I don't know where to go, where to meet people and even how to do it. I'm terribly introvert.

488,uhdrma,EggplantElectronic37,"I (F24) never thought my life will turn out this way. I’m in my mid-twenties, I only have a few friends and never been into a relationship. I was builled when I was younger for having acne and it fucked up my confidence and self-esteem ever since. I’m having a hard time socializing since then as I’m scared people will hurt me again which is why I don’t have that many friends and never been in a relationship I believe.

I feel like I need men validation so bad right now to feel better about myself but I’m scared to put myself out there and be rejected.

Since COVID started I haven’t meet new people and I feel like I don’t even know what I look like to other people if that makes sense. Do people think I am ugly? Am I average? Are some men attracted to me? Am I pretty enough to be loved? These questions are driving me insane. I’m almost missing the times where people will bully me because at least I knew what people thought about me and I knew what I could potentially change to be more attractive which is fucked up I know. I feel like I don’t look as good as I could potentially be and it makes me sad.

Men keep saying that women have it so easy and that they can easily be in a relationship which makes me fucking depressed because I’m wondering what am I doing wrong?

499,uhf313,VeryMentallyStable,"I wish I could just remove whatever pointless part of my mammal brain is responsible for turning human contact and touch into a need. 

It doesn’t serve any purpose for me at all, I don’t need it for my survival or anything, and so all it’s doing right now is adding internal conflict to my head since I don’t like people and I don’t want to be around them, and the type of person I want to be would have very little to do with people, but the pangs of loneliness and touch-starvation still hit regardless of who I want to be, and how much I can’t stand people. And it either leads me to do stupid things I regret and that don’t represent who I want to be, adding to my internal chaos and self-hatred, or I have to push it down and ignore it until I become crippled by how alone I feel. And both outcomes contribute pretty heavily to my underlying, constant suicidal thoughts.

It doesn’t matter how much therapy I do or how many medications I try, nothing makes a difference to the fact that I don’t like people and I can’t connect to them. 99% of people are just garbage. But even the ones that “get it” are problematic to me. I can’t feel or maintain a lasting or deep connection to anyone. I don’t feel comforted by people telling me they relate to me, I still feel misunderstood in some way. 

Even the few times that I have had relatively positive experiences with people for a while, it always ends one way or another, and most of the time it leaves me feeling confused, angry and bitter. I can’t “let go” of it, no matter how I try to frame it in my head, or who I talk to, or how much therapy I do, or whatever else I try. I’m always just left with more memories that I don’t want to think about, places I can’t visit anymore, songs I used to enjoy but don’t want to listen to, movies I can’t watch the same way, and everything “good” about it turns to shit with hindsight and I just want to forget the whole thing ever happened. 

I can’t seem to just enjoy things for what they are or take them as they come, because my head just doesn’t work like that, I can’t look back on the time I had with those people with any fondness at all, it all gets tainted for me. And it makes it almost impossible to see the point in engaging at all, because I’m not going to get my needs met either way, and 100% of my previous interpersonal relationships have fallen apart in the past and I’ve got nothing but bad memories and regrets to show for it. Doesn’t leave much room for wanting to try again, just makes me feel like I’m not learning my lesson, which is that people aren’t for me.

But the alternative is awful too. For over a year now I’ve been completely alone, apart from my sister who I talked to occasionally, but she died just over a month ago, so I really am 100% alone now. No friends. No family I trust. No one at all. And it works for a while, but eventually the loneliness and touch starvation grows until I can’t push it down anymore, but I can’t do anything about it either. I know that interacting with people will only make me feel more alone, so I end up doing really pathetic things like holding onto a pillow in bed every night, pretending it’s a pretty girl who loves me and wants to be there. Just makes me feel pathetic and weak, not at all the stoic, independent person I’d like to be.

I just wish there was a surgery or pill or something you could do in this position, when your mental issues are seemingly untreatable and only worsen as time goes on, and they prevent you from being able to get these needs met. Something that could just remove the need entirely, so I could just be the person I want to be, and not have to deal with any of this, just be 100% independent and capable of fulfilling all my needs completely on my own.",2022-05-03 12:33:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582906064,4,/r/lonely/comments/uhf313/it_feels_impossible_to_do_anything_to_help_my/,,0,0,It feels impossible to do anything to help my loneliness with the issues I have

Hear me out.

For the past 3 years, I have been feeling this inexplicable sadness. Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes it fades. I can manage the sadness; it doesn't make me feel too tired, or render my brain completely useless. There are some days im uplifted but other days I feel dead. My therapist said she would not put a name, but js place it as ""I'm mentally tired.""

Last year i did go for counselling and therapy after telling my parents. However, the effects of the therapy wore off soon after it ended. At that time it was quite bad and i almost took my own life. There were also penknife marks on my hand. After seeing the way my parents reacted, I decided that I don't want to hurt them again by opening up to them that therapy hasn't worked. Anyway, if end up taking meds for this, there is a high chance I can't attain my dream job in the future. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to in school, and my friends generally have other friends too they can talk to. My parents don't find friends important, and I just wasn't happy. I got into a 6 month rs. The girl got toxic towards the end and my parents found out and made a total shit show over it. Frankly, I js haven't been happy in a long time. I have made 1 close friend  and she's the sweetest, but I do want more friends, and friends I can be closer to. 

Loneliness is the big problem here. Not too many people are there who can understand me. Besides, I don't think my life is as tough as others in this subreddit. People tell me I'm a nice guy, but in my heart, I just can't believe that. I've caused lots of pain to others. I don't think I am as good as what other's say. I need to live up to their expectations.

I've been dying to get to know and love someone since my breakup. On top of that, not many people seem to want to be my friend, simply because I take a friendship too seriously, and also I score As is most of my subjects. Sometimes, I really feel like flunking my tests, but it never seems to help me get friends. 

I've been indoctrinated to believe that relationships and friendships aren't as important as studies. I haven't had a close friend for the past 15 years (im turning 16 btw).

genuinely feel that they forget about me and I have told them that I have been feeling this way for a long time and this bothers so much that I almost didn't celebrate my birthday because I wasn't sure about where our friendship stood. I sometimes feel pathetic because I always say that it doesn't take much effort on someone else's part to keep me their friend like every now and then you can remember me or when you are going somewhere just ask me if I would like to join them, that is all I am asking for, is it too much to ask that?
Funny part one of my friend has been my friends for way over 14-15 years and now I feel that she tends to forget about me when we are our with other people. She says that she doesn't know she is doing this so I have talked to her about this many times but now I have given up. My other friend is a bit more sensitive and when I talked to her I thought she genuinely understood my side but today I find out they have gone out again and didn't even bother asking me. It is not like I am constantly cancelling on them, in fact I have always gone wherever they want to go even if I feel like I might not enjoy but I went just so they won't forget about my existence.

Lately I have also started to pay a lot of attention to my weight or specifically how my belly keeps in getting bigger whenever I eat something. I never used to pay this much attention, I have tried to stop eating but always end up eating unhealthy things.

I have an acquaintance that vents nonstop about her life and anytime I bring up something about me , she somehow redirects it back to her. I find this is true with most of my interactions and the pattern has turned me off to socializing, yet I need to feel connected. 

I have no one in my life that ask me how I am and really listen without putting a timer on me( therapist). I’m starting to believe that’s an unrealistic dynamic but yet people say I give that to them. I used to but not anymore.

 My Mother who used to show me unconditional love has pushed me away since getting re-married recently to a man who doesnt like me, my Grandma who used to be my best friend when no one else is around has severe dementia and isn't the person I know and love.

The friends that I do have will never put me first and I have to practically beg them to spend time with me, something I just don't have in me anymore. I always try to make new friends as well, go into it with a positive mindset but I somehow always get let down. I even recently got a dog hoping that would bring me something, but no, he ignores me even though I show him nothing but love all day, every day and pines after the boyfriend I live with. 

I just don't see the point in living, I feel like I'm purely existing at the moment and don't worry, I'm not suicial because I annoyingly have an instinct to carry on no matter what, but I really just wish someone would love me for who I am. I know a lot of people say this or think this, but I really do think I am a nice, kind hearted and genuine person and I have so much love to give, to just receive it back would be great.",2022-05-03 22:57:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623006978,2,/r/lonely/comments/uhsf24/feeling_lonely_247/,,0,2,Feeling lonely 24/7

I picked up all the spanish I could, but I always felt different. I wanted to fit in somewhere so bad. My close childhood friends all moved away. My highschool friends were all mexican/hispanic. But I never let people in my life get close to me because I was insecure about being biracial and my family dynamic. I felt boring and weird, scared of being judged/rejected.

I don’t cry myself sleep anymore because well I can’t cry anymore. I still feel sadness, anxiety and a desire for some purpose in my life however. 

I feel like I tried my hardest to set up myself for success despite my flaws. But it was to no avail, I’ve simply come to learn there are flaws in my character that make unlikable. I’m not a bad person, in fact I have a lot time for people and have never intentionally went out to harm someone. I just cannot connect with people. How many times do I have to put myself out there before people stop gaslighting me and telling me I don’t try hard enough. I mean understand why they offer me the same generic advice, because it works for them. I do take care of myself. I shower every day, have a nice hair cut, nice style, go to the gym. I’m not a good looking guy but I don’t think it’s my looks holding me back it’s something deeper.

I’m just out of solutions… I can’t hold a job… hell I can’t even get past interviews these days because of my awkwardness. You read on linkedin about how “progressive” these companies are regarding neurodiversity but it’s all virtue signalling bullshit. Being awkward and behind socially is essentially a death sentence. People treat you like a murderer a creep, all because of something you can’t control.

Looking back on it now, I wish more than anything I could go back and warn my sophomore self not to fall in love with him. Because when I fall, it is not a small thing. I put my heart and soul, my time and thoughts, my hopes and reality, into the idea of a person. This is the story of the time it happened.

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know I walked up an extra flight of stairs every day for a full year to get to class? I could ignore my aching feet after a long day, because all that pain washed away when I would pass by your class. Every time you saw me, you would smile and wave. Then I would wave back. Like clockwork. Did you know that those waves were your greatest weapon?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know that when we would have an assembly, I got less and less interested in the actual performances? Instead I would silently search for the aisle right in front of the stage, where you would be peeking out with your Nikon D3500 to get the best shot for the yearbook. Did you know I hate the yearbook?

Dear Photo Boy:

Did you know what you were doing when took a picture of us during our project and made it my contact photo? How about when you moved your desk next to mine in class and gave me an earbud so we could listen to music together? Did you know what you were doing when I said my hair was messy for Homecoming and you brushed it out of my face? I hate the feeling you gave me. I hate the suit you wore, and I hate the dress in the bottom of my closet that I cannot touch. Because all along I thought it meant you liked me. You never did.

Did you know what you were doing when you fell in love with my best friend?

I didn't. But I do now.

There is something about a broken heart that needs someone to blame. But who? Not my friend-- she had to keep her feelings for him a secret for months because she was afraid to hurt me. Not any of my other friends-- I couldn't open up to them, so they never even knew. And as much as I want to-- not Photo Boy. Because he never saw me as anything but a friend, and I never told him otherwise.

Dear Photo Boy:

Like I tell myself now, I no longer love you. But falling out of love is not a linear decline; it comes in waves. Like when I catch a glimpse of Her phone in class and see months of text conversation with you. Or when you ask her to slow dance at Prom and she asks me if I think you 'like her or not'. these are the moments where I feel myself slip. how DARE she ask me for crush advice with him? a year ago I was counting WAVES. Do you know what I would have done with a single text? But then again, I can't be mad. You didn't choose me. For reasons I will never know, reasons I will spend staring at the ceiling at night over, reasons I still can't understand-- you chose her. and more than anything, I want to see her happy. Because she is my *best friend,* and she is dating the boy she loves. Now my job is to let go of the past for her. But above all, for myself.

Sincerely,

A friend.",2022-05-04 01:04:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634347814,6,/r/lonely/comments/uhuv0l/an_open_letter_to_photo_boy/,,0,0,An Open Letter to Photo Boy

628,uhwhg8,cameraangel,"It wasn't always like this. There weren't always so many of us. Think about the old couples who've been married for decades. We wonder how they did it, and often their advice seems lost on us. Overly personal, quaint and lacking the modern perspective. We must ask ourselves collectively not if we are able to ""make it work"" (especially since so many of us can hardly seem to find someone to even begin to fail with), but are we able to we recreate the conditions that led to their happiness? 

In the past, communities were more tight knit. Depression was unheard of, if it can be believed. Of course, there was sadness, but its prolonged, often seemingly rootless modern manifestation was not. Family was more emphasized, even to the point where marriage was a family affair. I'm sure many have heard that in places in the world where arranged marriage persists, its success and happiness level is in fact not less than our divorce ridden western ""marry for love!"" landscape. Of course, the vast majority of aforementioned western old couples we know weren't arranged. But they were also more engaged in real life, something which probably is a boomeresque eyeroller to many readers, but there was actually more life worth living before we all collectively retreated into the media which has surged in recent times, be it on a computer or television screen. 

Indeed, this sub and all of social media in fact is merely a surrogate community. Ironically the internet's promise of connection has alienated us further, by tempting us with the promise of curating our communities only to have them not measure up to a physical one. People had to interact with neighbors, among other real life community members, before the web. Maybe they were annoying but out of necessity, people compromised with each other. Neither felt they were the main character with a Flanders or Dinkleberg who'd be better written out. On top of this, they had a physical space in common, which probably means more than similar music taste or even sense of humor. And this meant more than just one next door neighbor, it was a whole neighborhood that saw a lot of each other and came to see the community as an organism they had a responsibility to maintain. This applied to both childrearing and being part of a local workforce. Society was a group project, not something astroturfed by corporations and a government completely unaccountable to the consent of its governed.

The media saturation peddled by said corporations also has the detriment of mental sugar rush. The upvote, the like, the retweet, and even the coom, we all live for these tiny, artificial moments of validation. Our dopamine receptors rely on the constant stimulation of both these and whatever media we binge, consoom, daily. It's very easy to see how this overexposure quickly fries the capacity for pleasure. But more specific to the loneliness aspect, the social media mediated, technologically soulless abstraction of ""the soul"" from the physical. Humans did not evolve to have our emotional needs satisfied in text. Each day someone posts on here longing for contact. But the question is: do we have the strength to kick our addiction? Must we tear it down so it is no longer a social requirement to have a smartphone?

So I return to the core question: can we be as our grandparents were? What will it take? In my view, the diagnosis is simple: ask ""what's different now?"" and compare the less lonely days of our ancestors to the situation we're in now and assess with clear eyes whether or not the progress has improved things. It's the treatment that will prove difficult. Can we allow the technological (and social) conditions to stand if they are indeed the root of our collective alienation? And if we cannot, what can we do to replace them?",2022-05-04 02:30:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1558420424,2,/r/lonely/comments/uhwhg8/diagnosing_the_roots_of_modern_alienation/,,0,0,Diagnosing the Roots of Modern Alienation

Is it really worth the bother?
There must be a better place
Where there is no greed and no race
Somewhere you can find some peace
Without worrying about your lease
A place you can just close your eyes
And never deal with scams and lies
No diseases,traffic or money
Just the joy of milk and honey
I really want to get there soon
I hope it's not as far as the moon
I dont want too much pain involved
But once I get there - PROBLEM SOLVED!",2022-05-04 02:35:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1535998609,3,/r/lonely/comments/uhwljf/whats_the_point_of_living/,,0,2,What's the point of living?

637,uhwvne,LuciferIsFallen,"I'm on my own, I have the freedom to do whatever I want, but the only thing I want to do is drugs and play games, which in the long term makes me miserable.


Enjoyment feels strange. It's like, contingent on suffering. Or not necessarily suffering but effort, strain, boredom. 


It's weird how differently the world looks based on your state of mind. Now it's dull and dreary, food doesn't taste, music doesn't sound. But once it did, I find it hard to reconcile the past with the present. 


I hate myself for the situation I've put myself in, but hating yourself is a typical no no thing to do so I don't allow myself to have those thoughts. They shine through sometimes, so the best thing to do is probably to forgive myself, but I don't know whether I'm worthy of that forgiveness. How would you know? It's in your best interest to forgive yourself, so there's a bias, but at the same time you're aware that the bias exists and should probably be able to adjust for it, but I don't know how to that. How to make an objective decision. It's also not lost on me that I'm using past mistakes as an excuse to not self-improve

This is the most rambly thing I've ever written, and I'm sober. Not sure if I'm just a terrible writer or actually starting to become crazy. I just realised this is the lonely sub, so I should probably mention loneliness. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Why oh why is it important to me to broadcast my thoughts. It's silly but I think I do it to leave an impact on the world, however small. A ""kilroy was here"".
Maybe someday an alien with my exact personality stumbles upon this text, and they can have a cool moment of relating.

I was forced to move or face a long legal battle with my ex. I returned home and fast forward a few months I start dating a what seemed to be an ok guy.

670,ui2g5n,VeryMentallyStable,"The only saving grace here is that it gets shorter each time. Used to be I’d sink almost a year with a person before reaching the point where I had to cut them off, now I don’t make it past a couple weeks. I told the most recent person I’d been talking to online that it was best if she stopped messaging me today. I know it was the smartest thing for both of us, I thought about it a lot, but it doesn’t stop me from getting that feeling of regret, knowing that once I’ve said something like that I’ve turned it all dramatic and I can’t go back and change my mind because of that. 

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I don’t have anyone in my life at all, never had friends, only member of my family I liked is dead and I don’t talk to the rest of them, I can’t have relationships because of my issues, so obviously I get lonely and when that gets really bad I cave in and let someone talk to me about shit. But I don’t know why I don’t learn, I’ve gone through this same loop so many times and it always plays out the same way.

Logically, there’s just no circumstance where it can work out. I can’t be lighthearted or carefree and take it as it comes at all anymore, it feels like an act so the longer I try to just be a “normal” person making jokes and having “fun” conversations, the more drained I feel talking to that person, so I avoid them. And it also feels like that’s not who I am anymore, so I’m betraying my personality and who I want to be by acting like that.

So I the only things I can talk about without feeling like I’m faking something is the serious shit that pertains to my traumatic history and mental issues. But I don’t want to talk about that stuff with anyone because it makes me uncomfortable and it always leaves me feeling alone and misunderstood even when they “get it”, so I’d rather just say nothing at all. So I know there’s nothing I can talk about without feeling drained or worse about everything, but I can’t think of any way to combat the loneliness than by trying to talk to people, knowing full well it’s fucked as soon as I open my mouth.

Just feels like I can’t win. I’m either stuck being alone and feeling lonely, or stuck going through this same cycle, having it turn out the exact same way every single time and somehow never fucking learning my lesson. It’s just so draining trying to maintain this type of shit, it’s a constant stressor and I do feel relieved once I get to drop people and don’t have to deal with navigating it anymore, but I also just end up feeling more and more nihilistic each time because it’s just more evidence on the pile that this shit doesn’t get better, and that despite the years of therapy and countless medications or whatever, that it’s an issue that only gets worse as time goes on and I have to push more and more people away and cut them off.",2022-05-04 09:11:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582906064,3,/r/lonely/comments/ui2g5n/im_stuck_in_a_constant_cycle_of_loneliness_and/,,0,0,I’m stuck in a constant cycle of loneliness and pushing people away and I don’t know what to do about it

675,ui3oaa,AngryRacco0n,"In this post, I'm a little lazy to think about writing, so Google Translator will do it. He always helps me, but here he translates 100%

You can't call me lonely, except for those who stay at home forever. Since I play games I have a few internet acquaintances, it's hard to call them friends. I had someone to throw memes, sometimes I even had a lot of communication (for me it's 3-5 people with whom you can correspond almost every day). And when I lost that opportunity, people left me for a variety of reasons. I began to feel the same ""loneliness."" So I still have a good friend and a couple of cool internet ""friends"". But there are no more messages ""Good morning"", ""How are you? What happened, what are you not writing?"". And here I think: Am I sick because I'm alone? No, it's not true? Because I have no one to confront? I have someone to talk to, 5 more chats in the Telegram on various topics. Because most of the time I sit at home I read, listen or play something. I don't communicate much in reality, but I chose it myself.

Is that why I'm lonely? No, probably but I feel something like that. Does anyone have such feelings? While writing this he came up with an interesting idea for writing a mini-work. I write a little prose, but most likely I will not teach here because I write in Ukrainian, Google translator I doubt that I can handle this

P.S. If you briefly write a description of this feeling. I walk alone in the city / field / forests. There are so many examples around, there are many of them. It's like real people, but as soon as you try to approach or touch, if you can get close, it will dissolve in the air and will not be left behind. It is necessary to find a real person among thousands of ghosts, it can take even a lifetime)",2022-05-04 10:41:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622477875,2,/r/lonely/comments/ui3oaa/what_does_it_mean_to_be_alone_philosophical_no/,,0,2,What does it mean to be alone?

691,ui8e22,TiredFawx,"(25M for those who may wonder.) 

Hi. As the title may make it obvious, I pretty much have no friends. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone but I went to a different school growing up and the people who live here now are nothing like me (A lot of people do drugs here pretty much as a way to fit in and socialise and I am not into that at all). I do have an amazing gf which I live with but I cannot help but feel the need for my own friends like she has, I have always been quite quiet and I do suffer from anxiety so making friends hasn't been easy. I have always kind of described myself as a social chameleon, I can fit in anywhere but I will inevitably usually fade into the background. I do like the idea of having friends from other places around the world and at the risk of sounding rude I wouldn't mind not feeling the pressure of having to meet up in person a lot due to my anxiety as this can be kinda stressful for me at times. 

I do enjoy playing games and I have been part of a few Discord servers in my time but they always seem to have already established friend-groups within the server so it deters me from trying sometimes as I feel like I'm just butting in..

Basically I am wondering if anyone else relates and has any words of wisdom to an outsider like me or would like to chat or play some games together, anything would be appreciated! Thanks for taking time out to read this if you have, hope y'all have a nice day/night wherever you are. :)",2022-05-04 14:52:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651570804,5,/r/lonely/comments/ui8e22/friendless/,,0,2,Friendless

694,ui8x6r,DeanFrog,"My ex, god I hate calling them that, and I live together. We can’t really do no contact because I can’t afford to live anywhere else. We broke up because we grew apart. We’ve both been dealing with the break up fine and we’ve been extremely civil. The only time there’s ever strain in the relationship is whenever she has this guy over. This guy is what made us realize that we grew apart, because she found out that what we had wasn’t what she was looking for anymore. She knew wanted to work on herself and didn’t want to be in a romantic relationship anymore. Perfectly fine and I want her to find herself and be happy. 

She doesn’t want to be with the new guy and she’s declined any of his advances. They don’t have sex or anything, but they still do intimate things. Like the other day they watched a show and fell asleep on each other’s shoulders. Tonight they’re doing it again. Now obviously I want what’s best for her, but I’m upset because I feel this void caused by this lack of intimacy. She says she misses me everyday, but she has a means of coping through that feeling of loss. I don’t.

She likes to say that it’s the same thing as when I hang out with my friends, but it really isn’t. You’re hanging out with someone, one on one, and cuddling/holding each other. I don’t give a shit if he is just a friend, that’s still intimate as hell. I don’t get any way of dealing with that crippling feeling of loss of intimacy. I want to hold someone, I want to cuddle, I want to share a show with someone, but I can’t. What makes it worse is that I’m demisexual, so if it takes me several weeks of getting to know someone to be able to do intimate things with them (otherwise I’d be repulsed by their touch.)

So in short, she’s using this guy as a way to cope with the loss of intimacy and I’m stuck, with a feeling I can only be describe as, slowly withering into oblivion as the lack of intimacy crushes my fucking soul. I’m trying so hard to be strong because I don’t want her to feel guilty for trying to cope.

706,uib51j,ThrowawayJ10112,"I lashed out at a friend again. I felt hurt and abandoned yet again as they and a small ‘clique’ of other people in my online gaming community went off to do their own adventure together. 

The 4 of them went off and there was room for a 5th person and instead of asking me or anyone in the larger community-group to come along, they found some random person instead. It sounds insignificant when I write it out, but it’s a continuous pattern of this friend only involving their ‘clique’ and no one else, unless it’s convenient for them.

I told him off because it feels like me and everyone else outside of this clique are just on the sidelines, and they rarely involve other people outside of their group. Because I know that if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t think twice about trying to get a friend in for that 5th spot. But this friend didn’t, nor did any of the other 3 in the clique.

What hurts a lot is that it makes me think ‘Why am I not good enough?’ I could be a great friend. But they don’t try to involve me. They don’t talk to me. They talk to each other so how do you even get a foot in the door? 

It’s like I’m trying to prove I’m not a horrible person, astonishingly, and they don’t even give me an opener to try.

But, I lashed out again (not the first time) and told this friend it feels terrible to be looking in from the outside and see them have fun without me.

708,uibhn5,throwaway0183701,"Super cute girl in my chem class actually fuckin talked to me. I don’t get it.

Me and my lab partner were prepping for our lab final, just in public near a public computer. She walked up and asked for help with doing hers. And that was fucking terrifying, I can barely keep my shit together with my lab partner. I was psyched up and ready to do stuff with him cuz we scheduled it ahead of time, so it wasn’t as bad. But then she shows up, and I’m at first flustered cuz she’s cute, but then I’m just freaking tf out in my head cuz this is a new person I’ve never talked to, and if I’m gonna help her then I have to put forth ideas that might be wrong and might embarrass me. I know I looked like a fuckin beaten puppy, I just hope I didn’t do anything stupid aside from being an anxious pos.

But yeah, that I chalked up to my lab partner. He’s confident and personable, and he’s helped people before. The thought didn’t even really cross my mind that I was what she wanted to talk to, I was just an impediment. But today, I was waiting on another class, and she and her partner happened to be working on their prep outside the room I was waiting on. And she walked over and asked for help again. My lab partner wasn’t there, I was just alone and listening to music trying to pretend I didn’t notice they were there, but she still asked for my help. So it wasn’t just my lab partner. I guess it could still be that I was just the best option they had, not that I was a good option. But this girl is pretty bold about asking questions in class, and she’s asked plenty of stuff to the professor after class. I’m sure she could’ve asked him.

Idk. I’m confused. I’m not good at this, I just pretend to be. Why would she ask for my help? She’s smarter than me, I’m sure, and her lab partner is, too. Is it possible they really could actually use my help? It seems ridiculous. But the only alternative is that she *wanted* my help, which seems even more ridiculous. As bad as I am at school, I’m so, **SO** much worse at life and being social.

I guess with either option, I should feel a boost to my self-esteem. Either I’m academically valuable to her, or I’m socially valuable. But I just feel more self-hatred, mainly cuz of how much I wish I could be socially valuable to her. And especially because I have a crush on her now. I hate myself so much for that. I don’t deserve to even imagine that she might care about me, I’m just a worthless failure of a person. She’s super cute and has actual aspirations, I’m trash that’s just here cuz I don’t know where else to be. Not only do I feel I’m not worthy to even imagine such a situation, I feel gross for it. I’m sure if she knew I wished for that, she’d be disgusted. Declarations of affection are only compliments when they come from attractive lips, they’re insults if someone like me speaks them. They don’t make the person feel happy and warm and fuzzy, they make the person feel gross and exposed and sick.

And I feel that bad just for having these fucking feelings. I don’t want to feel like this, I want to be able to just see this as either her normally having a question, or normally wanting to be friendly. But instead, my fucked up head can’t stop wishing that it was some romantic gesture. I *know* it’s not, I’d have to be clinically insane to genuinely think that asking for help on a problem is romantic. But it still *feels* like it is, because my stupid love-starved mind is so desperate that it lunges at scraps.

I’m so mad. If I was someone else, if I was someone *better*, I could’ve offered her my number in case she needed more help, or I could’ve asked more social questions and participated in small tap that indicated that I enjoyed her company instead of only focusing on the problem. But no, no, what I did was look like a mouse in the claws of a cat, stick perfectly to the problem, and dart away as soon as I could. The best I managed was to squeak “good luck tomorrow” on my way out. Fucking idiot.

763,uiklxo,ILoveSadBoys,"I'm 32, female, from Texas. I'm in the hospital again. :(
I have an aneurysm and have severe head pain and they're worried it might rupture. I'm alone at the hospital and well, lonely. 

Here is what I look like:
https://imgur.com/a/NBXMaIL

Was hoping to find a male to talk to on the phone or something to pass my time. 

About me: I read a lot. JG Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, Bret Easton Ellis and stuff like that. My favorite book is Infinite Jest or Crash. 

I really like, idk what to call it, indie music maybe? 
Elliott Smith is my favorite musician, followed closely by Conor Oberst/Bright Eyes. I also love Wilco, Tom Waits, The Shins, Elvis Costello and stuff like that. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for mid 2000's emo as well. I know the words to every Fall Out Boy song, that's not a brag really, more of a confession. Lmao. 

I used to write about film and television for a living and am heavily opinionated on this matter. My favorite film is Punch-Drunk Love, not because I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan or anything, my love is more for Paul Thomas Anderson and the film speaks to me in some way. Other films I love include: A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Royal Tenenbaums, Escape from New York, The Warriors, A Cure for Wellness, Ghost World, Alien and Aliens, Naked Lunch, Dead Ringers, Flatliners, The Machinist, I could probably go on forever with this list. 
I am not really into anything Marvel or many super hero movies or shows. I love comics and have about 150 long boxes full of them. My favorite superhero is The Flash, but I can't stand the TV show, minus Tom Cavanagh, yeah, he's hot. Haha. 

I am sorry I'm rambling so much. I'm on a lot of medication and bored and trying to fill my time in some way more meaningful than watching hospital television. 

If you want to chat message me and maybe we can chat on the phone to fill some time?",2022-05-05 00:18:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647620418,8,/r/lonely/comments/uiklxo/32f_im_stuck_in_the_hospital_does_anyone_want_to/,,0,4,32F. I'm stuck in the hospital. Does anyone want to talk on the phone.

You can also just send me memes and I’ll send you some back, or I can rate your homemade memes before you post them (I hope they’re good).

810,uio9y3,Dangerous-Walk-845,"I'm a young male, still in High School, i'm, admittedly, a little stupid too. Almost 4 years ago I meet a very important person on Discord. She was around the same age as me and because of her I was introduced to so many other people that meant so much to me. I had never been in a friend group like this or have so many people care about me before. Over the years I never planned to be apart of a relationship with this individual. My feelings said otherwise. At the time I had already come out of a pretty important and admittedly short relationship with someone. So she and I started a dynamic. She previously stated that she was ""love sick"" because she herself have never been in a relationship, and I happened to have a lot of traits that she liked. We started the whole thing in roughly early October of 2021. It meant everything to me. I realized that this was the woman I loved. She was irreplaceable. We had ups and downs but we both appeared to enjoy each other's company a lot. My infatuation with her got in my way with being a good person. I focused so much of my energy on her and that dynamic that I feel like I just became a worse person because of it. Mind you she's extremely important to a lot of others that I used to consider my friends as well. It was in mid March that she put an end of the dynamic. At first I tried to be mature about it and just simply move on. That's what would of happened if I wasn't so codependent on her affection to help me. I felt alone again and it tore me apart. I let it get in the way of my mood and I constantly brought it up in conversations just between the two of us as some stupid and unknowing way of guilt tripping. One night she just had enough. And left me. Alone. The next day she said she just needed a break from me but that doesn't feel like the case anymore. I last spoke to her back on April 1st and she just seemed so angry at me and didn't appear to want any sort of friendship back. She only went with the whole dynamic as a way of helping me cope because she knew how much it hurt me. It was nothing more to her than that. I haven't spoken to her, or anyone else in that friend group since then. I've fucked up so badly and I just want to fix it. I cant go a single day without thinking about it and i've isolated myself from so many things that I used to enjoy. I let my infatuation with her get in my way so now i'm further away from her as I was even close to them. I cant cope

826,uiptog,Whosnextbythewho,"

foremost i know internet is not a safe haven and people will judge you no matter what all are you passin through, but i can't help.
iam so lonely, i intensely wish if there someone who i can say this all, could just make me happy. but by fate, i have'nt anyone.

lookin at my story, it was yeah, kinda normal middle class stuffs. born poor, grew up poor.. everything i have experienced back in my life was poverty
and my family was always broke. so it would be pretty evident for you that i haen'nt any privileges growing up like going for a amazing vacation, pretty clothes etc...
still tho my parents had hope in us( i have 3 siblings, glad i remembered it now lol) and admitted us into an english medium school(thats how you call it in India/ great pride if you're in one).
about my parents, mom is an homemaker and dad is in abroad. all the money they saved was thrown into our education. guess their decision was'nt bad eventhough, atleast i can write in english right?( i believe).
and then i just passed my high schools with a good grade(yeah ngl) , got admitted into an engineering college( what did you think an indian boy would choose otherwise lol).sophomore was not good enough, made some freinds ... and all of a sudden this pandemic got us and just had to move to home.

this part of my life; this part is called *happyness

yeah, that sentence is a minimum, i was so happy. i fell in love with this girl (not mentioning her name becuase i still love her , but i wont get here from this day( 4th may|her wedding)),
i was so happy that days( god! i'm gonna cry) , we talked like 6 hours a day(for 3 years,can you imagine?). we shared everything. we were new into these relationship scenarios we havent dated anyone before. we loved each other unconditionally. i had never made her felt desperated, and she did always mention shes so happy safe with me.
i dont know i felt so in love, i couldnt even survive a more than 4-5 hours without her. i just needed to know where is she and is she safe(please dont think im toxic, i've never demanded anything from her, i just request and she would inform me where she is). we were so cute each other , we even cried each other. i play with her, ask if shes fine always and she also does the same to me. i dont know if y'all believe this but we had only 3 real dates during these 3 years(1 for 1 lol).
but we didnt need that cos we were transparent to each other and knew everything bout each other.

new season of my life:
i dont know how to say this, iam gonna shed tears if i try to explain what i've been through, what all previously happened. in a contrary, in all of a sudden her father fixed her marriage on may 4th(for those who wonder, i just knew about this a month ago(april i guess)). i was in utter pain, didnt know what to do. already mentioned i dont have much freinds, so i just thought myself and decided to call her father.hands were shakin, my heart was just gonna rip out of my ribcage when he took the phone and say hello. that was the most heaviest hello i've ever heard. but i need to save my relation right. i just put up some nerves and responed.
we talked and i somehow said things to hime( i mentioned iam her boyfreind, but in a subtle manner). he didnt agree and threatened me he would meet my parents.i didnt afraid, bc all i had in my mind was her.
he cut the call, but after sometime just called me back and said shes crying bc of you. i have to speak with your parents about this.
and..
i knew he wouldnt agree bc she was so rich and iam, pathetically poor. who would marry his girl into a poor home. so he became mean to me and said this is'nt gonna happen. i was so broken, thought this world is gonna end now( atleast mine).


i dont know if i could complete this, maybe this is why because nobody wants to hear me. im so sad rn, hey internet people: this is my story so far.

ps: last week i got a notice about my 25k college fee due( aapproximately 300$), if i paid it in a month, i would not get mu graduation. asked many for help, tried to lend. no one helped. asked in my home, my mom just literally cried, how i could even ask her again.
if i cant pay that fee, i wont be graduated this year. so it means , i would have to go a daily wage income for a year and can get graduated in the next year( only i've 25k and i'm alive to expereience that all). i dont know if anyone gonna help me.just watch everything i had in my life drowning away. some often i think about suicide, i know its terrible but i cant help. please god!.

As why I'm ranting, I just recently got a phone number from a girl I thought was really sweet, beautiful, and overall a good person. So here I go, making myself look like an idiot and try to talk to her and try to put effort into getting to know her thinking I was doing alright, only to lead to again failure. When I tried talking to her, she genuinely seemed happy to talk and was overall kind. So when I told her she had a nice smile as a compliment to her without expecting much in return then to just compliment her, I was alright with leaving empty handed and just move on. Then she makes the daring move to offer her phone number which I felt so much joy and excitement from the offer, which I did take. 

Anyways, next day I try to text her with no response which I thought was reasonable. Next day I try again with again no luck. I wait another two days without trying then finally I try one more time today but this time to be more daring and decide to call her. However when I did, I was greeted to a slightly annoyed and confused person on the other end (which is reasonable since I've been texting to their number like two or three times already). I obviously tell them I have the wrong number and I hang up. That was when I realized she gave me a fake number to me. She could have left me alone or just ignored me but no, she wanted to rub salt in the wond by giving me false hope in giving me  a fake number only to be made an idiot as a result. I don't understand why she did that but I feel like absolute shit and overall feel like I've lost hope in just finding a relationship. I feel like an ugly person with no chance of being with anyone special. I think after this incident, I just confirmed my fear. I think I'm just not going to even bother anymore. I'm sick of trying only to be ghosted or made a fool in the process. In a way, I've lost hope in people and just lost confidence in myself as a result. 

Anyways that's my rant/situation. I give up. I'm done. No more opening up to people like that anymore.",2022-05-05 07:24:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1568677153,23,/r/lonely/comments/uiryz3/why_do_people_like_to_pretend_to_be_interested/,,0,9,Why do people like to pretend to be interested?

852,uisvjt,Invisibleman021183,"That was told to me 15 years ago. They were lying but they wanted to be nice. I would rather be told a harsh truth than a comforting lie. I should have focused on myself and realized, it was never going to happen so I might as well improve the quality of my life. Instead I let my obsession with finding her consume my life. I'm far worse than I was 15 years ago. At least then I had optimism and let people convince me I was just a little behind other people in meeting girls. The truth was, due to the combination of autism, height, attractiveness, and lack of financial stability, I never really had a chance. I'm not calling girls shallow because it's not their fault. It's me who is at fault. Now every day is miserable and I wish I could end my existence but I can't. The touch starvation I face from never having a gf, and no IRL friends has caused me to become a wreck who would cry if a girl hugged me but that's natural.

Just a weird question for those experts on ghosting(😁), why can't they just say bye or explain? Literally a ghost move. You message that person probably because you want to comfort/help her/him and you become close, but you will be also one of the reason why she/he will feel more alone and lonely because you leave her/him again.

I’ve been feeling pretty lonely and craving human contact the last 2 weeks, because I haven’t actually met up with anyone in months. So when I feel like that, I obsessively go on dating apps/websites. 

Like I’ll spend hours per day looking at profiles and messaging people, every time weirdly hoping that my soulmate is just. right. there. 

And every time I see a profile I really like, I’ll spend a few minutes imagining dating them. And I’m happy, nervous, excited for a few seconds when sending the first message. But they never respond ofc, so my perfectly crafted message was for nothing.

Anyways, I don’t actually have the courage to meet up even if I did find someone. How would I explain why I want to take things reaaaaaal slow because I’m a virgin in her late 20s?

I started talking with a girl 7-8 months ago. He didn't knew about this for 80% of the time. He eventually found out. I don't know how but he did.

&amp;#x200B;

1.

I turned 40 and discovered I was lonely. Not cripplingly lonely. Not yet. But I felt, really felt the kind of loneliness a young-ish male, having left school and entered the workforce, now expects is his lot in life. You know: the kind of loneliness that has the potential to become crippling loneliness in his 50s or 60s, if he isn’t careful. The sort of thing on which a person wants to keep a weather eye. And, for the first time in my life, I am worried.

I grew up an introvert surrounded by other people. I was born into a family of Dutch immigrants who came to Canada in the starving years after WWII. They came to make a new life for themselves. My progenitors hired themselves out as farm labourers or bought farms right in the middle of Southwestern Ontario. They started churches. Later they built elementary schools; and still later, a high school, a college, and a graduate school. I climbed this educational ladder out of the immigrant community that raised me; and, being an introvert, lacked the wherewithal to replace it with something else. 

I have a distant memory of being nine or ten and forcing tears to express the frustration I felt at not being able to connect with other kids at school. The frustration was genuine, the tears were not, which produced more frustration and more false tears. Eventually something snapped inside me, and I learned to live with my introversion. But I was in a safe space in which to be an introvert. The crowd in which I was alone included parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents of other children at church, and teachers who were parents of still more children at school. I felt alone, but I really wasn’t.

The frustration returned in high school. But I was a little older, and a little wiser, and the world had grown just a little bigger. There were more people around, more opportunities for friendship, even if these weren’t always satisfactory. And then, in the 11th grade, I suffered what doctors described as a catastrophic head injury. It left me in a coma for two days, relearning basic motor function over five or six months, and regaining control of my emotions and mental functions over the next few years. For better or worse, this put me at the center of a lot of people’s personal and professional attention. I have rarely been happier.

Then I graduated from high school and went off in the year 2000 to the Dutch college my immigrant community had built for its young adults. By my second year, introversion caught up with me again, my grades fell, and I slipped into a sort of mild depression. Nothing so serious that I required psychiatric intervention. Nothing other people would have perceived. I could maintain a cheerful exterior because I was more or less at peace with myself. But too much social interaction exhausted me, and I was equally happy to take refuge in the library bookstacks.

This story continues. High points and low points. Big changes, then relapses into introversion and minor bouts with depression. I won’t try to narrate the ups and downs here. I want simply to present my street cred. I know myself to be an introvert, someone who presents well enough in a crowd of people, who is friendly and can even be gregarious when the need arises, but is nonetheless an introvert.

I understand an introvert’s experience of loneliness. I know the powerlessness one feels to effect a change in one’s mood in all too familiar places. I understand the impulse to start over, somewhere else, somewhere entirely different, because this is the only way you can wrap your head around forging connections with people.

I am now 40, and I am supposed to have made something of myself, be in the process of building a life, enacting a well thought out plan. But that’s not where I am these days.

I climbed the educational ladder out of immigrant community that raised me, pursued a couple of Masters degrees, enrolled in a PhD program; I got married and followed my wife to Washington, DC, where she got a law degree and a good job with the federal government. At no point along this climb did I think I should make an effort find new communities. Various professional frustrations along the way, most notably the failure to complete the PhD program, drove me out of communities which had embraced me—out of embarrassment more than anything else. I had my beautiful wife, my carefully curated collection of history, philosophy, and theology books, my intellectual pursuits, and a non-profit job that gave me enough responsibility to feel like I was doing something productive but also enough headspace to let my mind wander through human history. I was set. For life. Or so I thought.

Then COVID happened, and my beautiful wife did some soul-searching, and she concluded all was not well in our little world, that her heart is not in it anymore, at least not in the way that it was in past.

That last strut of communal support got pulled away. For the first time in a good number of years, I discover again that I am lonely. And for the first time ever, it scares the shit out of me.

2.

I won’t introduce my wife. If this series of personal reflections ever appears in a forum where others can read it, she would be furious to discover her dirty laundry aired in public. I will refer to her as S. and refer to her actions and/or motivations as circumspectly as possible. Since she is an integral part in this story, it would be impossible to avoid reference to her entirely. That’s probably her preference. But ten years of marriage must rule that out.

My rude awakening to the fact all was not well in our little world came after a disappointing attempt at love-making. She announced we were done having sex. I said: What? She said: No more. I asked: For how long? A month? She paused before replying in a very frustrated tone of voice something to the effect of the following: I don’t know, forever. I said: What? What do you mean, forever?

I don’t remember where the conversation proceeded from this point. I do remember being profoundly confused. Such things just don’t happen. We are both young, capable, and all that. Well, I was feeling a little under the weather and also in need of physical exercise, but that’s besides the point. These were mechanical concerns which could be remedied. S. hinted at something much deeper than mere physical incapacity.

I spent the next two and a half to three months trying to understand what provoked this response. I will not pretend my efforts in this regard were either mature or well-thought out. The shock of such a categorical denial does strange things to a person’s brain. It makes them act in unpredictable ways. I switched hard into “caring husband” mode and became as attentive and concerned as I possibly could. I had to get to the bottom of things because spouses just do not, not have sex.

I would only discover much later that she spent the same time trying to understand what she was feeling. But she was certain about one thing: our sex life had officially come to an end.

I was 40, she was turning 32.

FUUUUUUCK.

S. and I met in university. She finished her undergraduate degree and I gradually fell out of the PhD program in which I was enrolled at the time.

We were an unlikely match. Neither of us expected to get married. Professional success had consistently eluded me in ways that made me doubt my long-term financial success and made me doubt my fitness for the institution.

Her reasons were slightly different: she wanted to become a spy. I was her mark. She “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her. In a fairly short order, I suggested marriage. (My idea, not hers, this time.) I proposed on a cold winter’s night in Quebec City, QC and we were married on the beach on a hot summer’s day in the Caribbean.

She passed the LSAT with flying colours, and I followed her to Washington, DC, where she attended law school, graduated, and went to work for the federal government. I was set. A beautiful, successful wife with a good-paying, stable job. I was making a marginal, financial contribution, but I was everywhere present to support her in the other ways that I could.

Somewhere along the way this idyllic picture no longer fit with S.’s picture of herself. She would tell me, I helped her become the best version of herself, just not the truest version of herself. She still had a deep-seated need to become a spy, do spy things, blow shit up, etc. A comfortable life in the suburbs with me held questionable appeal.

And the sex got boring. News to me, but that doesn’t mean it was untrue for her.

After almost 10 years of marriage, 11 years of being together, that’s I discovered again that I was lonely. S. pointed out my social group had narrowed down to exactly one person: her. That worried her, and she thought it should worry me.

What to do about it? After a few months of stewing, I went to the one place I could count on making a personal connection, even if only with someone who was professionally obligate to care; to the one place I knew I wouldn’t be turned away or treated as an uncomfortably needy irritant. I went back to church after nearly 15 years of being away.

3.

The educational ladder I climbed up and out of my Dutch immigrant community was raised by a network of Dutch churches spread across Canada and the United States. The specific church congregation I grew up in was started by great-grandparents on my father’s side of the family. I was probably related to 10 – 15% of the congregation of 500+ members. Maternal and paternal sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, great-aunts and great-uncles, cousins, second-cousins, and presumably third-cousins, though the higher the increment, the more meaningless these the degrees of consanguinity become.

It was a perfect place for an introvert to grow up. I wasn’t actually alone. I may have suffered the usual things that introverts suffer at church or at school, with family and with friends: constant emotional bruising that comes with not quite comprehending how to navigate social situations, continually stepping back to let others take the lead because I didn’t know how. That’s all true. But I wasn’t actually alone. There were always people around looking out for me. Not just for me, but for me all the same.

So I climbed, more or less insulated my own introverted proclivities. I climbed from the local Dutch Christian elementary school to the public high school where I encountered my first real taste of a wider world. I climbed from the public high school to Dutch Christian undergraduate institution, only very recently accredited as a university, after the catastrophic head injury I referred to earlier. This was a good first step for me because I was still putting my head back together. The small tight-knit community let me do that.

I climbed from the undergraduate institution to a graduate program in History the nearby public university. Once again I got a taste for that wider world, which I realized for the first time was a far more anonymous, lonelier than I had before. I climbed from the graduate program in History to a graduate program in Philosophy at the Dutch Christian graduate institution where I spent two years pursuing my own intellectual problems, not necessarily thinking about career options. And finally, after the graduate degree in philosophy and an aimless 10 months spent at home on the farm slopping hogs and milking cows, I climbed into a PhD program in Humanities at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I got a taste of that wider world again. The taste was slightly more sour than it had been before. But I was hopeful. I was doing something with myself.

On every rung of this educational ladder, I found myself thrown together people of all different backgrounds, and the higher I climbed, the more diverse was the group of people. This was convenient. Educational institutions drew people together for one reason or another, and you met people in the process. No pressure to do so; it just sort of happened.

I met people in classes and in the library, in my capacity as teaching assistant and later as instructor. I met people at a coffee shop down the road from the Faculty of Religious Studies at the corner of Milton and Parc, where I could be regularly be found reading, smoking, talking, etc. I met my wife there—or she saw me, and then “encouraged” me to introduce myself to her, which I did.

The final couple of years at McGill saw me take a step back from all these opportunities for social interaction to focus on reading, research, and writing. It’s what graduate students did, so no red flags were raised. Plus my wife and I were busy exploring the city, new love, and new possibilities.

Dissatisfied with dead-end jobs after she finished her undergraduate degree, S. buckled down and passed the LSAT. About the same time, I came to realize I had lost the mental focus to complete my PhD program. The option to follow S. to Washington, D.C. and take some time to figure out exactly what had gone wrong made implicit sense at the time. I made that final, fateful step off the top rung of the educational ladder and stepped out into wide open air.

I still didn’t see it as a problem, because I was with S.

4.

The story I must tell about church differs from the one I tell about school. In the Dutch immigrant community that raised me, church, (extended) family, and school formed a compact, three-legged social stool. I was born to sitting atop this stool. The newspaper, magazine, books, television, and radio put me in touch with a wider world. I was never prevented from accessing informational material. I was encouraged to absorb as much as possible with frequent trips to the local library. But the world of my immediate experience was circumscribed by the stool.

Until the age of 19 the convictions of the immigrant community who came from Holland during the starving years after WWII meant very little to me. This is really not all that surprising. The intellectual ethos a person imbibes, unless that it speaks to the heart, is ever an alien form imposed on an ambivalent or rebellious matter. This was my situation through most of high school. I recall, having come from the Dutch Christian elementary school, repeating an argument against the existence of God on the basis of the existence of moral evil in human life. If the loving God is all-powerful, how is it possible that evil exists? Ergo the loving God is either not all-powerful or he does not exist. Point to the atheists.

Indeed, I had absorbed most of the stories in the Bible and could recall some downright obscure details from memory. But I had absorbed the stories as information, not as occasions for a matured, moral self-reflection. I did not steal, not because I had a firm idea of myself as someone who did right by his fellows, but because I was scared of being caught. I did not lie for similar reason: doing so made me feel uncomfortable with myself. I did not commit adultery, I suppose, because I was scared of girls (and I have to think that I was unlikely to be successful committing this particular sin). But how did Absalom die? Or where was Moses buried? (And who buried him?) Or what did Tamar ask of her father-in-law Judah?  (And why?) I had those answers down cold

Then, a year after my head injury, having seen and been seen my numerous specialists and other persons concerned about my well-being, finding myself out of immediate danger, I found myself once more alone with my introverted self, feeling profoundly empty. I had what at the time I would have described as a conversion experience. In retrospect, I will say that for the first time I reached inside of myself to find the moral resources to take ownership of myself. At one point S. commented that the intense poignancy of the experience was probably a consequence of the head injury or part of the recovery process. I think she meant to say that I was loopy. That’s fair and true, to a point. It doesn’t discredit my subjective experience of being “led” to take ownership of myself by the circumstances of my situation. What I reached for was the thing that was already mine, though only in a superficial sense: my parent’s faith.

I am too distant from the event to be able to convey the particulars of the experience. What I have is a generic sense best expressed in a novel I have read, re-read, pondered, and re-pondered every couple of years. Walter M. Miller’s *A Canticle for Leibowitz* begins with a young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast searching his heart for evidence of a vocation with the monastic order: “a clean parchment of the spirit whereon the words of a summons might be written in his solitude—if that other Immensurable Loneliness which was God stretched forth Its hand to touch his only tiny human loneliness and to mark his vocation there.” The anthropomorphic language in the quotations misses what is true about quotation, or at least what is true for me, so it’s best not to be distracted by it. The immensity of existence, which hitherto presented itself as impassive, unmoving, and utterly detached, seemed to “wake up” take an interest in me. Either that or I “woke up” and took an interest in it.

The trouble with this sort of “waking” is that its “object” is absolutely incommensurate with everything else. So it was natural I went looking for a much more mundane language in which to dress up the experience in order to make sense of it. My parent’s faith had a solution to the problem of incommensurability: divine incarnation. It also had a more than 2500-year old tradition of text and commentary reflecting on the problem and told a story about the Incommensurate willingly submitting itself to the horrors and indignities suffered by a people it called its own. That story spoke to me. It made sense what emotion distress I was feeling, and it dignified my introversion. The curious result of internalizing this narrative was that I found it very easy to sympathize with most other people, even people I had never met before. It became almost second nature to imagine myself in their shoes.

Something else happened too: the loneliness borne of my introversion became almost comfortable.

Unlike the young novice in the desert on a Lenten fast, I didn’t “receive” a vocation; I went looking for one. I went looking for a vocation knowing that I might not find one, but nonetheless believing that the search itself was valuable. But church attendance became more and more difficult as I climbed the educational ladder higher. I didn’t see this at first. I think I chalked it up to a sort of lay-about laziness. Who wants to drag themselves out of bed on Sunday morning? Not me. But I noticed in the churches either attended or tried out a much more assertive conservative politics and/or had a strange attachment to bowdlerized biblical interpretations like six-day creationism or pre-millennial dispensationalism than I was able to comfortably ignore. Bed looked more and more attractive as the months and years passed by.

The handful of attempts I made to find a church during my PhD program in Montreal met with uniform failure of precisely this sort. A pastor or an elder saw that I was a new face. They learned I was a PhD student attending McGill. Then they took it upon themselves to challenge me on this or that pet point of biblical interpretation or critique of secular society. I grew frustrated and despised them for it. Not wanting to do so, I didn’t return; and, in a fairly short order, I stopped looking.

It was around this time I met S. Life became much easier; decisions, more obvious. When I ran into difficulties completing the PhD program, the decision to follow S. to Washington, D.C. where she attended law school was almost a foregone conclusion.

I tried a couple of churches in the first year we spent in D.C. The experience was much worse than in Canada. The American version of Evangelicalism caused such feelings of revulsion that I was happy to content myself with my own thoughts. Recognizing that I found a certain intellectual satisfaction in my parent’s faith, S. encouraged it as a quasi-academic pursuit.

Which is where things remained until S. discovered that things were not well in our little world.

5.

I want to differentiate between the cause of something and an occasion for something. For example, if a building burns down, the cause of its having burned down will be found in whatever or whoever started the fire. However, if a student learns a solution to a mathematical problem, the teacher is an occasion for the student having learned the solution, not the cause. The student is the cause for themselves having learned the solution. The teacher merely provides the opportunity and the material for the student to reflect upon.

This, as I conceive of it, is the lot of intelligent beings like ourselves, who are neither inanimate, merely nor passive to external stimuli. So, when I say that S. is not the cause of all my misery and woe, I mean exactly that. I am not an innocent bystander who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Allow me to elaborate. When S. announced we were done with physical intimacy, I lacked the emotional resources to deal with myself in this suddenly altered state of affairs. That’s obvious in retrospect, even if it wasn’t at the time. I had allowed my social world to narrow down and focus on a single person. The consequence was that I was unable to see S. was also in a state of emotional distress. All I saw was a unilateral move to change the nature of our marriage…for some unknown reason. Had I done something wrong? Was she unhappy with marriage? Was she seeing somebody else? My mind reeled at the possibilities. How did I misunderstand or misconstrue things so badly?

The only certainty I had in the moment was that if she said no, that meant no, and there was very little I could do about it. We might talk it out, but the harder I pushed on the issue, the more likely it was that I would disrespect her or disrespect myself. Which meant I had to accept things *fiat accompli* as they now stood.

FUUUUUCK

For a couple of months, as I mentioned before, I switched hard into “caring husband” mode, trying and more often than not failing to get to the bottom things. It was at this point that S. thought to bring up the fact that my social world had narrowed down to a single person: her. That was a problem, not just for her, but much more for me. It wasn’t fair to her, but I was also depriving myself of a needed outlet outside the home.

I had to get out.

Have I mentioned I am introvert? I may present well-enough in a groups, there is a non-zero chance I am accumulating small emotional bruises, which in time will add up to a need to withdrawal somewhere private to find an emotional footing. Tiny things like questions that pop up in my head and ask whether I handled that situation right over and over again.

I still had to get out.

Church is a natural fit in these circumstances. As I explained it to S., who won’t go to church and has no feel for the religion things, church was a place to go without any explicit intention of meeting people, but you would still meet people. Much like an office environment, where you go to work, but you end up meeting people and making friends in the process.

So I returned to church after 15 years of being away, comforted by the prospect of once more being alone in a crowd. I met people. I had conversations. Things that I had tucked away in my head once more were allowed out into the open air. Nothing especially deep or profound, you understand; but it was familiar.

That’s it for now. I am not sure how this story ends, whether it ends well or poorly. The story is true, or true enough for me. As I tap this line out on the keyboard, the narrative arrives at the present moment.

I can report, since returning to church, loneliness has become ever so slightly more comfortable.

1002,ujdpz0,willowsbabymama,I’m doing terrible right now. It’s my junior year and I was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that negatively impacted my grades. I have always been a straight A student but this year I’ve witnessed a drop in my grades due to my poor health. I really wanna get iron transfusions but my mom is doing everything she can so that I don’t because she believes the best medicine is a change in diet. I’ve been on a specific diet for a while now and I feel little to no change. The school year is almost over and I can’t get over the feeling how I failed to reach any of my goals. I’m trying to be kind to myself but I just keep comparing myself to others and how they did better than me and beat myself up constantly for how bad I’ve done without taking into account the state of my health. It’s so unfair how this had to happen to me now of all times. With my dreams of attending a prestigious university my hopes and dreams have been dashed due to my performance junior year and I constantly feel its my fault that I’m sick and that I should stop being so lazy and work but I physically can’t due to severe lethargy I experience in a daily basis with the deficiency. Its so frustrating because everyone else is doing way better than me at such a crucial time for people my age and I constantly ask myself why I can’t be normal and why this had to happen to me when my academic performance mattered most. Sometimes I pray that I don’t wake up at night because I can’t deal with the fact that I’ve failed. Sometimes I pray I get hit by a car on my way to school. I keep beating my self up for circumstances and it hurts so much cause life can be so unfair. I just wish I can be normal again and go back in time to re-do junior year so that I even stand a chance to the colleges I want to attend but now that’s impossible and I’ll forever live with this feeling of a sort of “uncontrollable failure”.,2022-05-06 02:47:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624830358,1,/r/lonely/comments/ujdpz0/failure/,,0,1,Failure.

1005,ujdxw4,throwaway0183701,"Why are people talking to me? I don't get it. I mean, each time they talked to me, it was just to ask me a question about the chemistry lab final we were prepping for. But do i really look like I have answers? I just got a 61 on a test, mostly cuz depression was eating at my mind more than usual. If they knew that, would they still have talked to me?

But I did know how to do the lab, I think. And it felt good to be helpful.

But then my mind goes too far. Instead of just stopping at ""either you were useful to them, or they were being friendly, it jumps to ""but what if they \*were\* interested in you, tho????"" and it drives me insane. I know they can't be, and I fell so gross for even considering it. But it doesn't stop me from wanting it to be true.

Today, this morning, girl in my calc class came and asked me a question. Tbh I can't even remember what she asked, I was so nervous that none of the details got remembered. But I think i was helpful. Oh, wait, I just remembered that she said something to the effect of ""you looked like you knew what you were doing"" . So that was it. I don't understand. Y'all don't even know, dude, I look like an abused puppy in public. I am so fucking scared of everyone. I'm the opposite of confident. How did she come to the idea that I'm smart or confident academically? She's wrong, I'm barely making it through. Maybe she lied. I was the only fellow chem student in that calc class, maybe she thought I was the only person she could ask in time? Idk, I'm so confused.

And she has a boyfriend (because of course I'm a facebook stalking perv) , so I extra know she doesn't like me. But I still like her, and I can't stop it. It's so fucked up.

Earlier in the week though there was a girl and her lab partner who caught me in the hallway waiting for another class of mine. She came over and asked me to help her and her friend. she didn't say why, but I think it must've been convenience, too. They just happened to see me, it was probably easier  and quicker to ask me while they were there working on it than to go and try to catch the professor.

But she was she is so fucking cute, and that's like all that was in my head. I just wanted to be useful to her, I wanted so desperately to be something she valued, even if just pragmatically.

And she was one of the last one's out of the lab today. Me and my usual lab group, girl #2, and actually girl #1 too were the last one's in there. I really wanted to go casually ask girl #2 how she thought she did, and to ask what answer she got in her calculations (cuz my numbers felt weirdly big, and I'm really scared that I fucked up) . But I don't know how to be casual, all I would've been is creepy. She'd see right through me and know that I liked her, she'd be disgusted, and she'd get away as soon as she could.

I hate that helping her made me feel so happy cuz it made me feel useful. You know the most pathetic part? I'm pretty sure me and her are gonna be in o-chem in fall together, and I've been fantasizing about her asking to do homework together. Because homework is so fucking hard for me to force my broken ass brain to do, but I know that if I was doing with her then it'd be easy. Not even just cuz it's her, but cuz I genuinely enjoy doing schoolwork with people, it's so much fun. So it's not even like necessarily romantic fantasies. Idk, that just feels so stupid for some reason. Are my hopes really so low now that I can't even fantasize about her valuing me as anything more than a living Google? she's way fuckin out my league tho fr, ain't one motherfucker in the school in her league. Swear to god she looks like a fucking model. Guess that's why it scared me so much when she asked for my help, her noticing I exist was terrifying.

I can't help but notice how juvenile this sounds. This ""i cant talk to gurls"" is shit people outgrow in high school. I'm almost 20 fucking 3. And I wonder if this is because I never went to a real high school. I was homeschooled from 6th grade on. Maybe if I had grown up normal instead, I would've had the fucking balls to talk to her. But nah, nah, I'll just bitch about it on reddit instead. God, I'm a fucking loser. Hope to god she ain't into me, cuz can you imagine the disappointment finding that your man does \*this?\*

I started having delusions at 19, and was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Without weed and with medications I’m pretty normal (except for mood swings) but I relapsed on weed multiple times which made me psychotic again. People that witnessed me acting psychotic have distanced themselves from me over the years. This and other things have drove me to attempt suicide in the past.

I mostly just work out, play video games, and watch anime these days. I live in paralyzing fear of running into people who have seen me in my psychotic state so I spend most of my time alone.

When I’m feeling good, I don’t mind solitude. I’m quite introverted after all. But when I’m feeling bad, when I need someone the most, I can’t seem to bring myself to interact with anyone. The loneliness and sadness that come up are just too intense for me to function socially. I waste most of my time on my phone. Sometimes I’ll push through it and end up feeling better after socializing but it’s always a crapshoot and many times it just makes me feel worse.

Sometimes I’ll spend time swiping on Tinder or Grindr, because I feel the need for some intimacy. But even if I can manage to find someone capable of having a conversation, I rarely end up meeting up because I feel a deep need to be comforted and know I won’t be able to function socially until that need is met, but I know they can’t fill the hole my lonely childhood devoid of acceptance left in me.

1032,ujgg48,violetsunflowerz,"I’m a 32-year old female and I have never had a real relationship. I am in a wheelchair and most men, usually run the opposite direction. The only “relationships” I’ve had have been long-distance or I’ve had men interested in nothing more than sexual stuff. Some of them friendzoned me even if I showed true feelings. 

I am educated, I work, I have a simple and humble life, I have a great sense of humor and I have a big heart and love to give, I’m not that bad looking, but I have serious physical muscle weaknesses due to my muscular dystrophy disability… it doesn’t matter what I do, it seems it’s not enough. I do love myself, but I just wish someone else would too. I haven’t had a hug in more than 10 years, my last kiss was in fact over 10 years. The last person I showed interest to, was a person who definitely was not going to commit because he lived in a different state, but dragged me along for three years hoping that it would work, but of course, it did not. I have not had sex ever, I don’t think at this point I’ll even have children and as a woman, it’s killing me.

My loneliness is so brutal, that it physically hurts and it’s not my medical condition. 

The first man I ever fell for that friendzoned me, told me that he had a daughter with someone that even cheated on him, but he didn’t chose me back then. My old friends, all married, with families and life partners. I just wonder what’s wrong with me. Some people have said “oh don’t you worry, the one will come” and I was in my early 20s back then when they said that. I doubt it will happen now… my “train” is leaving and no one seems interested in me. It’s extremely sad.

I know someone who is pretty kind, but I can’t stand her. She’s there but she makes every conversation about herself and makes fun of me if I don’t know something. She once asked me if Nissan and Volkswagen were the same thing and I simply said no, but when I ask a question she makes a big deal by laughing at me before answering. We were at a Mexican restaurant and I mispronounced a word, she laughed hysterically, and started making fun of me to the waiter. Luckily the waiter just looked at me and told me how to say the word. 

Anywho , I feel like this is the dynamic with most my “friends”. They treat me like I’m dumb, and I hate it. I try to tell myself it doesn’t matter what they think , but it annoys me when I’m saying something factual and they simply disregard me. I see how they give others respect and I can’t keep wondering why it’s lost on me.

I've spent 1 year and a half locked in my house, not going out, not even for groceries. I've sought professional help many times but it didn't help at all and my last relationship left me deeply wounded.

4 years with an abusive man and I can't find myself back after what he did. He's been in and out of my life since the last year as he's pretty good at drawing my attention. I don't want him in my life anymore. Today I've decided to go no contact but I don't think I'll make it alone. I tried several times before but I always failed even though I know he's a terrible human.

I can't seem to do anything correctly, especially when it comes to relationships. Recently my bf left me, which really amplifies these feelings, and I feel so bad about it. He says that it's just bc he fell in love with someone else, and that I didn't do anything wrong and what not. But if we're in a relationship together and you end up falling in love with someone else while we're still together, then evidently I was doing something wrong and I'd appreciate not being lied to about it. I just want to know what I'm doing that drove him away. 

I just feel so worthless, why am I always everyone's second choice, why am I unable to form a meaningful bond with someone that goes beyond just being friends.

1080,ujq4qd,[deleted],"My mums been suicidal &amp; an alcoholic all her life. My dad wasn’t in my life until recently, I didn’t even know he’s my biological dad until he contacted her, I thought one of the other guys that she introduced me to was. She’s had multiple boyfriends while I was younger, and she’d make me call them “dad” but then they’d all leave. We were living with my grandparents at the time as they were the ones raising me whilst she was out drinking &amp; partying. She would come home everyday and beat me with sticks, shoes, hangers, and anything that was in sight. Once she tried to drown me. She never attended any of my school events &amp; I felt so so alone watching other kids have dads that are present . On Father’s &amp; mothers Day my school organised events for kids and their parents to do fun activities together. I would always be sitting in the library and it was so hurtful.  After a while she had had enough &amp; abandoned me at a boarding school for months. Then she left me at my aunts for years.  

Once my biological dad was back in our life, things had been better and smooth. But her alcoholism &amp; narcissism still remains the same. I used to be a huge extrovert with an outgoing personality but now I’m just a shell of that person. She never let me have any fun as she always barged at places I was and humiliated me by causing a scene while she was drunk. 
I’ve become really anti social now and never leave the house at all. And all of this is her fault. I’m diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, sleep paralysis and adhd. A lot of these things are because of childhood trauma too. I was also sexually assaulted as a child but I haven’t told anyone in my family about it. I’m in therapy and medicated but living with her is so tiring. I was having a conversation with her as we are supposed to go out in a few hours &amp; I was reminding her that I have my doctors appointment in the morning too, and during this conversation she started drinking and I tried stopping her saying we have to go out in a few hours please stop drinking. We got into a physical altercation, she doesn’t hit me anymore as I’m taller and stronger than her but she still was trying hard for 30 mins. I kept trying to snatch the drinks away from her to go and dispose them but she kept yelling like a maniac telling me the usual things “I wish I aborted you” “I wish you were never born” . She’s said these things on all of my birthdays too. Never had a good birthday till date in my life. 
Finally I got a hold of her drinks and went to dispose them and she grabbed my hair and pulled me back to hit me but I pushed her away fortunately. I’ve to always be on guard as she has tried to attempt sûïcïdé many times and all the blame comes on to me. My dad lives out of the country &amp; my family is sick and tired of her, they’ve given up ages ago . She gets into car accidents often &amp; injuries herself here and there due to her alcoholism. I am so tired. I really wish I had a normal family or childhood. My relationships have also been horrible. I don’t have any in real life friends at all, I only have online friends. I’ve really wanted a best friend for long but can’t ever make one as almost everyone has a best friend now.

Recently I tried Uber and it didn't go horribly wrong, so as a person who can't drive, I don't feel quite as locked in my house. It made it possible for me to imagine actually going out with her, I didn't have to pathetically squeak ""I'm a worthless nondriving piece of shit, so if you want the pleasure of my company, you'll have to drive me around like a goddamned chauffeur"" .

But yeah, she said yes, and we exchanged numbers to talk about where to go. Ended up going to the aquarium (one of my favorite spots) , and it was awesome. She didn't hate me, and I didn't feel like trash.

But the problem is it was just a dream. Now I have this memory that's so much better than reality, but it isn't even real. And I'm fixating on it, it's all that's in my head. I'll see if video games can help get it out, or at least let me have a break from it.

This is why I hate having good dreams. Sure, they're pleasant as long as your unconscious, but then reality pulls you away from your happy place to be tortured again. It sucks, it's not worth the momentary pleasure of it.

God, I wish it was real. I was actually happy. I wasn't having to fake it to hope I end up believing it, I wasn't having to focus only on the positive and ignore the negative.

Because I have noone. I really have 0 friends! I am a 26 year old woman. I'd never dare to go to any party all alone! The second thing is I hate the people here!

I was massively bullied in secondary school. And people spread nasty rumours about me in the neighborhood. I feel like I have become just a clown for everyone. They all laugh at me and i feel like everybody hates me here. Since that time (being 10 years old) I have absolutely no friends! I also never had a boyfriend.16 years of being completely alone! Because i was scared of these people at school and also didn't like them for obvious reasons, i isolated myself more and more over the years. So here we are now. I don't know anybody anymore and I have absolutely no friends. I want to move out of my parents house this year. Somewhere far away from all those idiots who ruined my life. But the thing is I wouldn't go to any sort of party alone, especially as a woman. I don't even want to be at the Maifest, I don't even have a desire to drink and do what ever shit they do. But still it makes me jealous. If I had friends who would want to go there with me I would do it. I feel like I miss so many parts of my life. They all live their life, and I stare at my Pc all day long. I just wish I had friends. But I probably never will have friends. I never learned how to find some.

1209,uk69as,Atoledeguayaba,"mmm hello I haven't posted anything on this subreddit yet, until now. I'm sure most of you don't even care, but I've seen a lot of people share their problems here. so here I go. 
I'm 20 years old, almost 21, and I've never had a girlfriend, or anything related, I've always been alone, before I didn't care much, but since I entered university I started to feel very bad. Some years ago I tried to have a thing with some girls but it didn't work out, after all that I got tired of trying to have a thing with someone but now that I'm back in school that feeling came back to me.
 I feel very lonely walking around school, seeing so many people being happy with their partners, and I've never had that. 
Everyone tells me that I have to wait, that at some point someone will come for me, but honestly I'm tired of waiting and I think that's just a lie they tell to make me feel better, and it doesn't work anymore.
 My happiness does not depend on having a partner or not, since as I said, before I did not care much and I feel good doing other things, but that feeling of wanting that kind of affection is inevitable. 
I have come to think that having a partner is simply not for me, and I have already resigned myself to the fact that I will never have someone with me. I hope that changes one day. anyway, sorry for the bible, and for the bad english xd",2022-05-07 05:19:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596473932,11,/r/lonely/comments/uk69as/mmm_hi/,,0,1,"Mmm, hi?"

1219,uk73sy,PixelBits_49,"The dream started with me in some kind of class. We were doing some work, and I was sitting besides this girl that I instantly recognized as one of my classmates during secondary school. The weird thing is that I've barely spoke with her in real life and we didn't know each other at all, for me she was just another random classmate. But apparently in this dream I was close friends with her, and we talked about some work stuff without feeling weird or anxious like I usually do when interacting with other people. In fact, I actually felt relaxed talking to her, the conversations went smoothly (obviously since I'm tecnically talking to myself in a dream) and I was being myself basically.

After that, the dream cuts in to a different scene. I was in the backseat of a car with her, and someone else was driving us home during midnight, after the class. We were both quite tired so we didn't talk much, but I still felt good around her. I was distracted looking at something through the window, when suddenly she laid her head on my lap and fell asleep. This really took me by surprise obviously, but at the same time, it made me feel... fuzzy. I've never received any kind of physical affection from anyone other than my parents, so what happened in this dream made me feel actually happy and deserving of love. I started caressing and playing with her hair, and at some point my vision started to blur and I also fell asleep...

Then, my dream completely changes into something unrelated that I don't remember, and that's when I realize that everything was made up. I woke up feeling both sad and confused. Knowing that all that comfort and wholesomeness was just a product of my imagination made me feel quite pathetic to be honest.

TW: Mention of suicide

I’m so tired of moving from school to school.  I just want stability in my life.  My parents have moved many times and I’ve been through several different schools.  I’m tired of trying to make friends; I think Ive forgot how to.  Having no friends will give you such a miserable outlook on the world, you begin to despise everyone around you, leading you down an even more isolating road.  I remember getting back home from middle school and having to watch my 4 younger siblings after a draining day of school.  It was the most miserable time of my life, I felt so misunderstood and lonely.  I nearly killed my self.

However, I’m going to a new High School at the end of summer and I’m doing a lot of mental preparation.  I’m going to really try to make friends this year, I’m hoping high school will be memorable for me.  Staying positive; there’s no time to waste. 💞

(Please don’t say I have a victim complex, moving a lot can have serious mental effects on a child.)",2022-05-07 07:11:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638762484,7,/r/lonely/comments/uk7ux5/when_being_lonely_makes_you_hate_everyone_and_you/,,0,3,When being lonely makes you hate everyone and you become 10x more isolated

Well, a girl I had a crush on is now dating someone. That caused me quite a bit of emotional pain. I guess I just got overwhelmed by envy. Realistically, we could've never been partners anyways.

Honestly, I don't like to see happy couples. Every time I do, I'm reminded of what I don't and might not ever have in my life. Romance triggers me. I wish I was happy. Or better yet, content. Seeing them do PDA when I've literally felt invisible to the opposite gender my entire life, I almost have to invert my eyes elsewhere, lol. It's as if even a drop of romance in any media causes me to become detached from the couple in question. I immediately feel alienated and don't want to look at them.

1235,uk8vwm,GlitteryGhost1,"It's official, my mind is broken. Every day now I have all these negative memories flood through my mind, all of these unanswered questions, the disbelief and heartbreak. 

I'm now in a place where I'm so uncomfortable in my skin, nothing can shake me out of my trance long enough to be happy. Whenever I try to pursue a hobby, I can't stop remembering the people who left. I question that if I was more interesting, maybe they wouldn't have left. So the hobbies I have are wrong and bland... 

Then it can be simple stuff like feeling good about myself, but if I was such a brilliant and comforting person like I used to describe myself as, why would people discard me like nothing and leave me with bruises? I must've been so boring, pitiful and wasteful...

Then stuff like making jokes. You think you're funny? Well, nobody can remember that personality trait of yours. They all left. You're disposable. 

And it's been tormenting me daily... be warned long post. You don't have to read if you don't want to, it's okay. :') 

I've had people enter my family home, sit down with us at dinner (special times) and say with a heartfelt smile that ""I've never felt so welcome at someone's place before!"" only to eventually declare that we're awful pieces of garbage and leave. Only to try robbing money from us, and leave. 

We had someone else come in, try to make out that she was going to be a long lasting family friend, only to become hateful towards us in the end. 

I had a therapist who was trying to help me regain my confidence, I never went outside much. She asked if I had any friends living in this town and I had one. We didn't speak for a year, but I remember how we used to sit together during college break, went for long night walks, hung out at the park for a laugh, he helped me walk to my first job because we got lost, I visited his place and would watch stupid videos. We were STILL in college! 

So I was brave and reached out, when we began talking it was like nothing changed. I wrongfully thought maybe there was a chance. So I invited him out for a drink (just a coke) and he could've said no, he had every right to say no, but he agreed. 

During out meet up the one thing he comes out with is how ""weird"" it is. He looks at me as if I've done the most batshit insane thing. ""It's weird how you invited me out"". 

He then goes on to talk about how he was a bad person and that there was a girl called Chloe, that he briefly dated but kept ignoring her until midnight and would avoid seeing her etc. It sounded just like how he treated me... I didn't know if he forgot... or if there was some girl called Chloe who he did the same to... 

When we left, I texted him on Facebook and thanked him for meeting up, but I was also curious. Why did it take until now to see each other? His response, ""fuck off, I already met up with you isn't that enough?!"" 

Then I had another friend, well... I hadn't seen her for years but she was one of my best friends in school. I had so many awesome childhood memories. Just imagine how shocked I was when she added me on Facebook and told me she wanted to reconnect. She remembered that I loved to draw so asked whether I'd like to hang out at hers and maybe help decorate her room too. 

She was always so nice to me back then so I didn't expect anything bad. Well, when I tried asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime, she told me ""no offense but our friendship sail years ago. No offense, but I don't like you anymore!"" 

When I asked if she used me to paint her room, she just said something along the lines of ""LOL, that's right"". 

...crushed. 

Another person I got in touch with, I had a crush on. He discovered this and weirdly we became FWBs. We never saw one another in person though. He kept on telling me that he could see us being together someday, etc. He also kept mentioning how he was loyal, genuine and would never hurt anyone. 

Well, one day we arrange to hang out and I'm looking forward to it. The day passes and he tells me that I can't come over, because he has to take an ID photo... even though we were planning to visit town together. Afterwards he then bluntly tells me that I can't ring him anymore, even though before he said I was welcome to anytime. 

Eventually he does this thing where he on and off puts me on ignore, while I'm wondering what I did wrong. After this we chat over the phone, I'm in tears and he tells me to stop being dramatic...

He tried contacting me this year, asking if we could ""talk please x""
I never answered. 

Then there was another friend who a speech and language therapist recommended, she was in this group I joined so it was a good idea. I really related so well to her, she was the kind of person to be so down to Earth about everything, she was a fan of being open and communicating properly with friends. In fact, she had tons of friends, who got on with her because of her openness. 

Well, at the time I was going through severe anhedonia. She knew this and told me I was free to vent whenever, because she'll listen. Nobody should have to see a therapist just to talk, she said. 

I did... and eventually she told me that I was seeking so much validation, it was toxic in her eyes. So I stopped bringing anything up. Afterwards I remember a conversation where she told me that I can't just judge someone for what they've done wrong (correct!) because everyone has good in them (okay!) 

Yes, even my neighbour that threatened to kill my dogs when I was a child, even the neighbour who bashed my fence in while violently yelling at us, even the neighbour that attempted to crash my dad's car by cutting the belt (the belt to control the car). Even the neighbour who spread rumours about us. 

Because they're human too, she said. And if I got to know them, they might be different. 

Then I had another friend,.who didn't really do anything serious but it still kind of hurt, as I wish she would've just been honest. I asked if I could hang out with her, she said yes. So before the day I get there she tells me that she doesn't want to hang out, because it might rain. It doesn't rain. Then when I ask why she changed her mind. She said, ""wow the weather was sure bad, huh?"" 

Then the biggest one of all. In 2016, I had finally overcome my depression. It was a huge step for me to be able to go out into public, with a massive smile on my face and not be afraid. I was able to catch buses anywhere, whereas before I was frightened. I started cutting out caffiene, took care of my body more than I've ever done (dental hygiene, vitamins, eating, etc). I was on top of the world! 

Well, a friend at the time, was happy for me. He was someone I met in school, he knew all about the dark thoughts as he would sit down with me during break and hear me out, things we're so rough with my neighbours back then and the bullying. But he wanted to be there, and I appreciated it a lot. 

One day, he mentions to me about dating and how great it is. At the time I wasn't interested and only wanted to focus on me. In the end, I was brainwashed into getting together with him. I fell for him in the past, so I didn't turn him down. Well, whenever I wanted to visit his place, he'd often tell me that his mum didn't like strangers visiting. 

Which at the time was a massive lie, as my dad collected him from his house once so me and him could go to a theme park. His mum said hello to me and was kind. 

But I didn't see this and one day he lets me over, his mum isn't there, he uses me for favours. I'm used, discarded, and he turns our mutual friends against me. When he broke up with me, he was shocked when I didn't want to remain friends... he had no expression when I cried and hid his laptop screen from his mum when she entered the room... 

Then another friend! This guy I met online and I was still dealing with anhedonia (2020). He read some of my posts on Reddit and felt bad for me, and asked if I needed someone to chat with. When we began chatting, it became an every day thing. We would share memes, talk about life, etc. One day he decides to stop and ignore me. I asked why, he didn't respond. So I said, ""I thought we were friends?"" He told me, ""why label it"". So cold... 

Then another friend, this one was an LGBT rep at the college. She was known as very friendly and supportive, in fact the student counselor thought it would be great if I got to know her. Well I did, and one day she invites me to an LGBT bowling night she sets up. For each ticket we got a burger, fries and drink. 

At the time, we used to talk a lot on Messenger. Whenever she reached a low, I'd support her and lift her spirits. We spoke about meeting up in person. She was awesome! 

So the last thing I expected was for everyone to finish the burger and fries without saving me a plate... the last thing I expected was for her to ignore me the whole time, as I'm sat in the corner not knowing anyone (and having situational mutism didn't help, as I couldn't physically speak, so it was hard to introduce myself to anyone even when I desperately wanted to. My voice box refused to work!) 

I didn't expect her not to notice when I left early. 

And when I brought up how I felt during that night, I didn't expect her to tell me that she did her best so it wasn't HER fault that I missed out. 

Our friendship ceased. LGBT rep... 

So many things at once, and I just don't know why... I wish these people could've not bothered. I wish they could've kept me at a distance, instead of saying we're friends. I wish we never met. 

I really just want to die. Imagine questioning your entire personality and being so distraught and ashamed about it.",2022-05-07 08:28:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651563323,2,/r/lonely/comments/uk8vwm/it_hurts_it_just_hurts/,,0,1,It hurts... it just hurts...

That noone cares. That no friend of mine has ever cared about our friendship the way I did. That I was never a first choice. That I was never a person they'd call to share good news , to celebrate etc. That I was always just a part of the group , that one friend you occasionally meet when you are going on a trip or on thier birthday party or something. And then the heaviness in my chest returns and just resides there , twisting and turning itself painfully. 

I heard my friend talk to her bff on the phone once and the way they talk...you can just tell they care about each other UK...I've never had that and it's hard to accept that I never will.

It's even more isolating to think that iam probably the only 19F who doesn't have a single genuine friendship (just the hi bye , lunchbox friends). Like God!!!

1254,ukcdng,Keyoism,"Sup, never wrote one of these before. So I’ll be direct about it. I feel like a waste of space. I wanna die, so badly. Nothing I do or have done has meant anything. I come from a broken home you know the usual trivial shit. My step father treated me like shit and destroyed my self confidence of ever becoming anything with words that just won’t leave me alone till this day. Things he said and did to me still haunting me every fucking day.

I’m a black dude, I’m 27 and will be 28 in a few more weeks. Currently trying to get certificates so I can get a job troubleshooting somewhere — but other than that I’ve had nothing but dead end job after dead end job. My mother when she and my step father left each other ( this occurred on my 17th birthday - after years of abusing me and my siblings but mostly me almost specifically me actually — he’d decided that he was tired of looking at me. And that I needed to go because I was the reason why him and my mother couldn’t work or so he says. He has been there since I was 5. And has hated me since day 1. He never treated my brother like that but that’s because my brother's father was still in his life and would get him regularly , he had protection from him. Once I graduated that year we left. But my mother found out he was cheating - or so she told me. So that’s why things really ended but he used me as the excuse. Something that occurred for years and years prior. )

My mother, not liking the ultimatum, decided we’d leave together. Me, her, my little brother , and the child her and my step father had just made 3 years prior. Of course he'll dump her out with a baby. Despite being there for his original two kids who grew up with us , and he treated as if they could do no wrong. 

My mother grew resentful of me once we moved away however , blaming me for the fall of her relationship despite reassuring  me prior that it wasn’t cause of me — all I wanted was to go to college but she forced me to get a real job and make money to help out. I did this until I was fed up with it and we got into another heated fight that year about school before she ended up kicking me out as well. 

And that’s when everything goes to shit. I get a decent job but I end up letting years go by. Love is lost over and over. I become a toxic person but mostly because it’s how I’ve had to survive up until that point. I look back on all the things I’ve done and I realize that a lot of my hardships are because of me, and only me. And now as I get older and I am currently without a job again after holding one finally for 2 years after moving to Florida from South Carolina where I lived my whole life -  currently living with my girlfriends partners and trying to get by. They say they’ll let me finish my classes but everyone has said they’d help me before and they turned their backs on me so I don’t believe them. I feel like I’ll let them down with the opportunity they’ve given me. And that the easiest thing to do in all of this. 

Is to just die. Why go through this, put someone through dealing with a no good piece of shit who can’t hold work and has no skills to get proper work. I’m nothing and shouldn’t have been born , I can tell , nothing I do goes right. I suffer from depression and anxiety on the severe scale. But I don’t take medication. I also have severe ADD and it makes it hard to stay focused. I feel as though sometimes with all the shit that’s wrong with me that ending it would be easier on everyone. 

Off topic but my little brother ended up getting into a horrible accident 2 years ago that left him a cripple - kid was huge to you know. Big and strong , and was only 21. Now his mind is broken due to the accident and all I could do was feel sorry that I wasn’t there enough before the accident and how I’m a shitty brother - I’d just seen him the night before after not seeing him in months prior, and then bam. Life changing accident. My luck must’ve attached  on to him. My mother takes care of him with families help. I once stayed there to help, was the first one to at that. But me and my mother didn’t see eye to eye and she ended up telling me to leave. It’s deeper than that but that’s as far as I’ll go. 

Now In Florida I’m desperately putting the pieces of my self together and have come to the conclusion that for a waste of space like me that maybe just dying would be easier on everyone who has to deal with me. I’m tired of being so negative in my head , hating myself for loves lost. And how I’m a colossal failure as a man and a son. I hate myself. I’m a fat waste of space. And I honestly just wanna die. 

I only typed this here because I felt like it would make me feel better if I got it out. But honestly it didn’t.",2022-05-07 12:35:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1524803413,14,/r/lonely/comments/ukcdng/whats_the_point_of_it_all_talking_about/,,0,10,What’s the point of it all.

1278,ukfxyd,EERMA,"It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

I miss the warmth of a father but I don’t miss the man that watched me as her wife physically and mentally abused me all because he “can’t control her”. All the whilst her abuse made me submit to her control.

These are the only things that drove me to leave and stopped me from going back. But goddamn don’t I feel lonely. I feel empt like all my love and life has been sucked out of me—like I have nothing left to offer to the world and the new people I will meet.

I still have no confidence in myself and my partner she does pretty much all that talking for me as she knows i struggle,

I was just 30 and everyone older told me 30 to 40 are the best years in life. So I was confident that the breakup is a new beginning. I tried online dating and also I meet girls while being out with some friends or coworkers. With one girl I got really close, in only a short  time, but all of a sudden she wasn't sure about it anymore and ended it.  Everyone else I meet was either definitely not wife material (from crazy too wanted by the police) or they just weren't interested in me at all. (Or just wanted to have some free drinks.) Whatever, since covid and some other radical shit that happened I needed to through out some toxic people in my life. So my bubble got pretty lonely and its even harder to go out. I got more and more isolated and work got my only  social place. Which sucks! Now I dont even know how to socialize anymore and I dont even need to try to look at a woman. Cause they can sense how needy I'm. But that's a vicious circle. I can't cut my mind from almost 7 years without any intimacy. So I'm trapped with my loneliness and all those emotions I cant share, act out or even feel anymore. It only gets darker and colder inside my head. Cause the only things I remember are those times I got cheated on, rejected, betrayed or heartbroken in some way. So my turtle shell only gets stronger and my intention coming out of it are getting very rare. I´´  m already an misanthropic humanist. People are great, but only in theory. (or fantasy?)

Someday you find that person, even if you didn't meet in real life, you kinda feel it's that person you were looking your entire life for. 

Everything goes good, you connect on all levels, there isn't a thing you don't talk, laugh or do with eachother. 
She does everything for you and otherway around. Helping eachother with all life problems.

She learns your language in a year, so she can move to you when she is done with school. you are divorcing and searching a appartement near her so you can meet on regular base. 

And then she meets someone near her, and cause she is a better version off herself then she was before you, she leaves you, making promises to never abandon you, support you and will come back. 

And then she completely blockes, delete you out off her life and tells you, you did never good for me and he is sweet and I fallen for him. Goodbye, have a good life

1341,ukog4x,Fabulous-Advantage,"22 m. Never had a girlfriend or kiss, I felt like I tried but I know you can *always do more: you can always try harder, join more groups, etc.* Tried getting on dating apps but didn't have any friends for the pictures and was tired of it just being me, me, me and me. I've tried putting myself out there, volunteering, chatting up strangers, but each time maybe we had a good talk, but there was never any lasting interest that brought you back. It was a chore, ""Ok I gotta try to meet people now,"" I wasn't having fun with them, but I didn't really do anything fun that I enjoyed. This was because I try to be productive most days because otherwise I'd feel like since I'm not having fun with others, I might as well work. And when I take time to watch a show or something, I start to feel empty and feel like I have to be productive again. so it was my way to feel hopeful. 

I Joined the gym, try to talk to people but then they look away and I stop, because *I don't trust that they will respect me*. Here I am putting effort into normal people, when I've put effort into people over and over again and no one stayed. I always keep my hope up but sometimes *I forget* that I've tried making friends since I started college, now graduated. Therapists weren't able to help me apart from helping me correct some of my negative thinking patterns. Eventually one did say that some people don't have friends because they're too focused on things and productive and smart trying to do things in life. And the disappointing thing was the more I tried to not be that guy, the more I felt that was the path for me. I never wanted to be different.

At the very least, I'm still occasionally trying to meet people, still trying to find out what I like and what I want in a friend, but the same patterns keep repeating. Using dating apps, if I ask a question, they answer but don't ask back, now I don't even want to try a second time because I can tell they don't care. So I used to try again but then you feel like you've overextended and then it's fuck people man, the only thing I have is the consistent work I put into myself. I don't get the same pleasure as grabbing a meal or shooting the breeze as others do, because you don't act like them, so they stop talking to you and you realize you're not like them and then you work harder and it increases the distance.",2022-05-07 22:50:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579061274,0,/r/lonely/comments/ukog4x/tired_of_being_lonely/,,0,0,Tired of being lonely

I'm not 100% sure she'd think I was a disgusting loser for not being able to drive now that I know how to use Uber, I could at least meet her places without having to ask her to pick me up every time.

But I'm still a worthless piece of shit even with Uber. I'm depressed and have now pretty bad anxiety, especially social, so I'm barely functional as a human. I don't see what I could ever add to her life. My therapist says I see relationships as transactional and implies that's the wrong way to look at it, but what other way is there? Either I'm useful to her, or I'm not, and she either values me or she doesn't depending on the answer.

But I mean, I guess I could still try. But I only ever see her at school. I've already missed the times when she came up to me asking for help on chem stuff, she's not gonna do that again, so I'd have to make my own opportunity. But wtf would I even do? Accost her right as class ends? In plain view of everyone, so they can all watch me trip over my tongue and get rejected and laughed at, or called creepy? That sounds like an unbearable experience, I don't think I'd come out of my room for months.

And she would just call me creepy, she wouldn't be interested in me. How could she be? She's the most beautiful girl in the school. The only reason I'm even typing this shit out instead of dismissing the very idea as abject lunacy is because that stupid dream infected my mind with hope, and got my head in the clouds. But I know if  I tried to actually do anything, my wings would melt and I'd come crashing back to reality. I don't know if I'd survive that, if I'm being completely honest.

Oof, wtf triggered my pretentious side to come out? Eww

Yeah, idk. The thought's great and all, and I'd be really and truly happy with her. God, the idea of getting to do homework with her every week in fall is so tantalizing. But that's all it is; tantalizing. Perfect and beautiful, but forever out of reach. She probably already has a boyfriend because who tf has ever seen her and not felt what I'm feeling? Surely somebody better than me has already been here, and succeeded. But even if she was single, she's better off without me. I'm just a detriment, me wanting her to like me is pure selfishness.

1358,ukpks4,singingsn4kes,"TW: mention of suicidal ideation at the end 

It was my birthday yesterday, I turned 23 and spent the whole day alone. I cried so much my eyes swelled shut. This is the 5th consecutive birthday that I’ve spent by myself. 

My birthday has always sucked but this year was especially hard. I moved a few months ago to a whole new country where I have no friends (not that i had any real ones back home either) and a few family members that i’m not close to. 

The person I thought was my best/only friend had promised me for months that she’d come visit me for my birthday but she cancelled the trip last minute so she could spend the money&amp;time on her boyfriend instead then lied and blamed me for it. That really hurt because I was counting on her to actually care and not let me down. We’ve spoken before about why I hate my bday and I thought she was different. I let her get my hopes up, not that I wanted or expected a big extravagant birthday, but at least a brief chance at companionship and to be celebrated. 

Maybe I can’t blame her because pretty much everyone else forgot it was birthday too, including all my friends back home and my family I live literally next door to now.

This isn’t the first and probably not the last time I’ve been forgotten, my whole life has been like this. I looked through my old diaries yesterday and every bday entry since I was a child has been me wondering why i’m so unlovable. What makes some people worthy of recognition and celebration while I struggle through every year invisible. Im not important or valued by anyone in my life. I’m kept just close enough to be useful when needed but when it comes to my own needs and wants, everyone conveniently assumes I have some other closer group of people elsewhere that will actually care.

I feel so stupid thinking back to how excited I was just a few weeks ago. I even though that my bday falling on friday meant I might have a whole weekend of celebrations. How amazing it must be to have people willing to celebrate u for a whole weekend. Im so jealous of those girls who every year will have a bday party and a dinner, get their makeup done and dress up in special outfits, have people bring them balloons and a cake with candles to blow out. I can’t remember the last time I had a birthday wish. 

I feel like i’m kind of rambling so sorry about that. My mind has just been spiralling these past few days thinking about it all. My birthday feels like my yearly reminder of how unimportant, disposable and unloved I am. A confirmation that i’m truly alone. It reignites thoughts of unaliving myself because it’s so hard to argue i’d be missed by anyone when they clearly have no interest in my life. I’m supposed to move back to my old country soon but honestly I don’t see the point going back. I just want to escape forever.",2022-05-07 23:52:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617927485,3,/r/lonely/comments/ukpks4/birthday_blues/,,0,3,birthday blues

1360,ukpppf,bikersquid333,"Friendships, dating, work relationships, it's all been absolutely hopeless for me and they've all had knock-on effects to each other. I have struggled immensely in making, but most importantly keeping friends my whole life. Eventually at some point I figured that it's pretty much hopeless and I should just focus on finding a partner/girlfriend which would fulfil my social needs while also being potentially easier to find since it's just the one person I'd be looking for.

Unfortunately the dating game has been hopeless for me. While at uni I didn't make any friends (as per usual) and so I pretty much never went out and found myself in situations to meet new people.  That left me to try my luck on dating apps which as most guys know is wholly useless and self-esteem destroying. I changed up my profile so many times, tried different apps, swiping tactics, you name it but I never got a single match and only maybe 6 or 7 likes total (over 4 years). I am not a bad-looking guy and I have (from an objective) perspective, a lot of things going for me but for whatever reason I have not had any luck.

I think many romantic relationships are formed and found through friendship groups which I just don't have. It's like, I just need SOMETHING to start with. A base level energy to work forward and upward from, but when you're starting from zero or even below zero which is what it feels like for me, it's almost impossible to make any progress.

As a result of all this, my overall mood and demeanour has obviously taken a massive hit and it's continuing to get worse. As a result, I think this comes across to colleagues at work who then avoid me or make fun of me or take advantage of me. My last boss downright abused me for absolutely no reason if I'm perfectly honest. Well.the only reason I can put it down to is the fact that I was fairly quiet, soft-spoken, timid and so he figured he could treat me like a doormat. The other reason is probably and most likely racism. I've dealt with that kind of behaviour/person before and It's always been the same treatment.

Bottomline is I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't. It's an endless cycle of misery, confusion, self-doubt, anxiety, hopelessness, emptiness, anger, etc.

I've written a couple posts like this already to which I've got almost zero response whereas there are posts which the OP simply states 'I'm very lonely and I feel horrible' and it gets so many comments and offers from people to talk. I wish even someone on here would care enough to offer their listening ear and maybe even some advice! I really hope so, but I won't be surprised if this post goes away completely ignored into the history of this subreddit.

Thank you if you read all of that",2022-05-08 00:00:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646857214,3,/r/lonely/comments/ukpppf/no_matter_how_hard_i_try_socially_i_cant_seem_to/,,0,3,"No matter how hard I try socially, I can't seem to make even the tiniest dent..."

1364,ukq7pg,CheekyCzechChungus,"Hi everyone, 
my story is a weird one (as am I) but kinda normal.
There was a girl, we saw each other daily for years, friendship developed, we talked a lot texted a lot, I grew to love her so much, she was the only bright thing I my days. But the love was one sided, it was devastating, but what could I do, give up the only light I have in my life? So we were friends, it was killing me and keeping me happy at the same time, I couldn't think of anything else or anyone else. In the morning and during the day I would be so happy and (other words describing ""happy"" I can't think of) and in the afternoon and evening I would cry like an idiot because I knew she was my one. 
This went on for years, but hey emotionally net positive for me, so I was ""happy"".

One day I fucked up, and I fucked up big time.
I tried to repair it but the damage was severe. 

And she was gone. Cut off all possible way of contact. And I was alone. So alone in the darkness, floating trying to paddle through stuff.
I can't talk to girls, I can't go to public really, when I see a pair of people talking, I start to fall apart. When I see someone kissing or holding hands, I feel so alone. Just alone and empty. 

I would give anything to just talk to her one more time. Just talk, about anything, weather, I don't care just talk. I looked around for help but I don't trust anyone and professionals are way too expensive to be viable. So I'm just sitting in the darkness alone and empty, without any emotion on the outside and all the bad emotions on the inside. I haven't been happy one single day since.

It will be 7 years tomorrow. And all I can hope is.. maybe tomorrow?",2022-05-08 00:29:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649964837,1,/r/lonely/comments/ukq7pg/emptiness/,,0,0,Emptiness

We met up last night and we were sharing about our lives and he said he was going out tonight. I asked if it would be ok for me to join and he said sure. I was so excited honestly. I thought this weekend would just be another one alone so this made me feel so excited with possibilities. Then the whole of today he’s ignored me. Finally he sent me a location so I tentatively joined thinking he might have just been too busy to message before but I might still be welcome. He practically ignored me when I arrived. He was so unkind it breaks my heart. He didn’t even look in my direction. I don’t know what I did wrong. I left after a few minutes as I didn’t seem welcome. I wish he had just told me not to join. I spent so long just waiting for him to message and I feel 100% times worse than before. This was the first time I’ve put myself out there in so long and I wish I hadn’t. I really don’t know what I did wrong. I didn’t message too much, I gave him plenty of outs to uninvite me or tell me not tonight. We used to be good friends so I thought it would be ok.

You can also just send me memes and I’ll send you some back, or I can rate your homemade memes before you post them (I hope they’re good).

Sometimes I just wonder what actually happened. What went wrong, why did people stop talking to me, what is it about me that makes people avoid me. Ever since I left school I’ve been pretty lonely, my ex cheated on me and I was messed about by another girl. I wake up to find no messages, no new adds, no nothing. Just a few streaks on Snapchat. In my head, I am a confident person. I used to struggle with social anxiety, that’s no longer a bother. But why is it hard to make friends with new people? I’m not like the rest of the crowd who do drugs and drink etc. Not into hookups either. Relationships are worrisome for me cause I wouldn’t want to be hurt again, neither do I think I could fully trust someone again. The ‘friends’ I do have only usually want me when they want something, or when they’re bored. Any other time, like now, I’m in my bedroom on my phone scrolling away for hours. Even though I don’t want to. I see others out with their friends and old friends having fun and doing things, and I just ask myself, why can’t I do that? It’s been like this ever since I left school and all throughout college. I kind of accepted that this is how it is but at times like this, all I’m wanting is for someone to message me",2022-05-08 02:04:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602073609,3,/r/lonely/comments/ukrsud/what_happened/,,0,1,What happened…

Despite not worrying about college (working independently on various skills to eventually develop portfolio) or romantic relationships, I still I have felt shamed from family for not being in a relationship and not attending college. Many of my friends are in college, with relationships (some even married), making enough to live outside of their parent's, and all are about my age or even younger.

1416,ukvq9z,Sammy_da_Money,"So just to make a long story short... my best friend (who I've known now for a couple years) just broke up with his girlfriend/baby mama of 5 years which in my opinion and what I saw plus heard from herself  has been  real toxic from time to time... 
 My part is I've been staying with them shortly before the break up ( about over a month) but have been real close with the both of them...all i focus on is just helping around the house and with the kids and just been trying to figure out my own shit...
we made up a joke about taking a vote on if me and her should get  together after a couple of our friends ( a couple of them are our friends and a couple is just mine and her ex [my best friend]) and we  have decided to ask here just to see your opinions or thoughts 
 
I do wanna had some key details  though that 
•he has multiple times brought up having 3 ways with me him and her throughout our friendship 
• has multiple times told me I can have her anytime 
• has multiple times let me know he's down for me anytime
• he has given me permission to stay here after he moved out even after me asking multiple times if he feels comfortable with me staying 

You know how things go  curiosity killed the cat 🐈 
So thanks in advance
Edit: we are currently at 5 votes for us getting together and I guess if we reach 100 then who knows 😉

Edit 2 right now our feeling are mutual... it's not like we are sitting around talking about getting together and just using a source 

And just because I feel like I didn't add enough detale on each of them I'll list both good traits about each of them
Will mark her down as F and he will be M
F: • for sure has the most spirit boosting energy everywhere she goes that can lift any mood right side up
• she's got one of the biggest hearts god has given... will literally share the clothes off her back and open her home... as she has for me currently and to another mother and her daughter 
• she's fucking brave on a different level... with a strong mind and a leveled thinking
• she can be too nice at times... you do need a shirt on your own back 
•she mind of makes up her mind on situations alil to quick or jump to conclusions 
• she does get over whelmed at moments or just let's frustration take over

M: he's my guy... had helped me and held my hand through some of the hardest moments in life
•he's literally a huge reason why I still have alotta confidence in myself and my looks ( I couldn't go a day without him hitting on me or low-key tryna get me into the bed)
 He gave me some extra purpose. I had his back and he had mine supporting each other 
• and he's just funny asf 🤣 
• he's really hot headed with pretty much everyone but me... almost everyone in the house pretty much walked on egg shells just not to piss him off or set him off but me... kids included
• dude got no money management skills for the life of him
• he kind of does mooches off others... our friendship started off with him asking for alotta money at times or for favors and for a while I was feeling used... but later timed paid off at the end... but it's just not me
• he really doesn't think of others much unless it involves something with him... it would be a surprise if he went out of his way for someone else at times 
• he's just fucking dumb

 And she wanted me to add that he just left... decided just to up and pack tell everyone bye and just left like that",2022-05-08 06:26:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642355435,1,/r/lonely/comments/ukvq9z/totally_need_an_opinion_or_your_thoughts/,,0,2,Totally need an opinion or your thoughts

1419,ukw1ry,pizzabutcher404,"I am a person who doesn't mind loneliness that much. Being an introvert, sometimes being alone is comfortable and gives me time to focus on things I have to do or like. But every time I come back to college I feel very crushed. I see people having a good time together going out to party or eat every day and having a group of friends to hang out with. Its not that I don't have friends.....they are mutually exclusive a lot of the time and have their own groups to hang out with as well....and hence I get to interact with them one on one but I don't have a group for myself. So at the end of the day...I end up not going anywhere ever, never going out for movies, not going to eat out and not being able to enjoy and being holed up and studying and wasting time on the internet. 

On top of that I don't even have a boyfriend and I see couples all around me and at one point its starts bothering me. Everyone I know has someone in their life and it makes me feel lonelier than ever. 

On top of that if I ever mistakenly mention to someone that oh I spend time alone or anything people start saying ""oh that's so sad""....does being alone have to be a sad thing? I know I shouldn't care about what people say but when three or four people say the same thing it makes me start questioning myself.

I am trying to put my efforts into studying and all but it doesn't pay off either. I am in constant fear of bringing bad grades and fucking up my gpa. I dont have an internship till now when almost everyone around me has. I am trying my best here but I have no idea why nothing is working out.

I talked with the man and it was a bit awkward. He sounded tired and stressed out from the day. Already made me feel guilty and want to leave but I stayed. He asked me basic info ab my situation and relationships. He kept asking questions and I felt better bc he cared enough to keep asking. It was like he was waiting to get to a point to make. Then 27 minutes passed - nothing. He basically thanked me for my time and ended the conversation right at the 30 minute mark... It was like he was reading a script (which I’m sure he was).

Accept the loneliness. Accept you have noone. Wear it. Don't give anyone any love for free. It is so painful. It hurts. But we can't just spread love for free to except it to return back even more. Like everthing else in life, the things you gain without pain, are going to hurt more in the long run... This is how shitty this life works. So feel the pain of loneliness. Pay the price. Wait patiently. Keep your energy to yourself. Even though it can be so painful, you don't need love to live your life. We need to love ourselves first. Be a bit selfish.

-They all hate you anyway
-You know you still love her, and you'll never get to tell her

I live the lifestyle of a natural philosopher, never involved myself with humans personally except family. But 4 years ago the sacred geometry of chance played the dice and threw a person at me, I accepted the person and started to discover the human side of things, not that I didn't knew but felt for the first time. She was the most sensible person that I'd met ever. I was never a person to chat with someone for hours but I started doing it not realizing how addicted I was becoming to it. And for a person like me its a divine bond or friendship. But at this very crucial event of my life while everything is crashing and there seems to be no point of doing anything, nature took that person away from me. The person's alive and left me. Nature gave me a taste of company and took it away in a snap of a finger. We were separated due to subjectivity. And the horrors that I never felt before has dawned upon me. I don't see a point in writing this out to a community page due to subjectivity but everything else has failed since the past month. I'm just dis-functional and all alone.

My mother died when I was nine. She was my world. I was forced to live with a step family that openly hated me. And never included me in their family.

 No family. Or none that want to associate with me. I have a few friends but not that they will ever understand me. And this lockdown isolated me even more. I don't know if those friends are still there.  I never had a girlfriend. Sex was for getting off and not for intimacy, whatever that is. 

Now I'm in my forties and I went from being alone to lonely. It's somewhat crippling when I stop and let those thoughts become intrusive. For those that are young.

Ive grieved for my children growing up so quickly and all the drama that has happened. I’ve been lost in depression and grief and I always go back to it, I beat myself up inside and blame myself for so much and every bad choice my children make.

1499,ul8u4j,Longjumping_Total958,"Hi 

I've written on here before seeking advice/help. Please see my post history for more background. 

I'm turned 30 on 7th May. Looking back I've nothing to show for these 29 years. I grew up waiting and expecting life to happen and it just didn't. Not for me anyway. I've never had a girlfriend and struggle in most social situations. I'm really lonely. The only people I speak to are my family and people at/involving work. 

The worst thing is I try to go out of my way to help people. If I know someone is going though a difficult period, I try to make them smile and laugh. Sometimes at my own expense.

I did follow up on some of the advice I was given. I joined a gym. Lost over 2 stone in 6 weeks but no one talks to anyone. Everyone stays in their own little groups of friends or just stick their headphones on. 

I signed up to online dating. Haven't had anything yet. Don't even know where to start with this really. 

I'm half and half about online therapy. Probably too late for me at my time of life. 

I'm starting to realise that I'm never going to have the life I dreamed of or a family of own that I yearn for. 

You can probably imagine how I'm feeling now if you haven't already guessed. Lost is one and the overall feeling of defeat. 

Anybody have any further advice or hope to offer? 

Thank you for your time.",2022-05-08 19:11:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641163313,7,/r/lonely/comments/ul8u4j/losing_hope/,,0,3,losing hope

1504,ul9jqw,CrazyNeighborhood200,"What would be enough. I’m not hard working, I’m barely about working smart. I’m lazy as fuck, my definition of success is accomplishing a task with minimal effort and care. If it were possible I’d not do anything ever. I realize I can’t think along these lines or at least I shouldn’t since I have nothing right now. I’m nowhere close to where I’d wanna be neither I haven’t figured out where I’d wanna be. I’m lost in the sauce. I’d wanna be a fighter, just train and fight and compete but it yet again seems like an extremely unreasonable goal. My ambitions are far too great and my work ethic is non existent. The student in me died a good few years ago, I’m not saying I don’t have the ability to learn anymore but I definitely don’t have the ability or willpower to right my academic accords. I think I’d be able to graduate considering barely any coding heavy courses are left and it’s mostly earth science, math and physics which are relatively a pushover for me, but yet again I find that sentiment so troubling. Math and science shouldn’t be thought of as a pushover but should instead ignite feelings of curiosity. Maybe it’s because most things don’t faze me anymore. Maybe I’ve felt everything I’ll ever feel and so I’ll never feel again. Maybe I’m being cynical towards my own mind and my own feelings. I wish I knew what it really is. Maybe I’m not supposed to know or that maybe figuring out is the real answer. Even writing this feels pointless especially if nobody will ever read this. Since, it feels so pointless coz nobody would be able to really understand and I’d instead get the ignorant “hey, it’s not that deep” or “that’s pretty gay bro”, which is still better than the fake “omg that’s so relatable” or the absurd sympathy. How can one offer sympathy when you can’t even fathom the struggle. Life isn’t exactly high stakes and I’m not losing either, the struggle is with feeling this weird ineffable feeling that even I can’t really understand and you’d offer sympathy when even the sufferer can’t fathom his own situation? That’s fake. I don’t know, perhaps I’m being ignorant.

I've never had that 'close' group of friends and sometimes I find that really lonely. Sometimes I feel like no one really knows me. As I was in relationships from the age of 17 (almost 10 years with maybe a year gap) I always had someone who I felt knew me and I didn't have to perform for at all. But I've been single now for around two years and I do struggle with that feeling of being alone even though I do have some close friends. Does anyone else relate? I also find it difficult to balance my energy, sometimes I can feel really drained just by being around people and have to then rest and recharge.

1538,uld1hw,Shadowdragon409,"I've recently realized that if you're lonely, curing it is nearly impossible. When you meet new people, not only do you have to vet them, but they are also vetting you. If you're feeling sad, or you come across as desperate, they won't want anything to do with you. Let's be real. Most people who are lonely are sad and desperate. These qualities are seen as toxic and undesirable. You have to fake happiness and cheeriness to get people to talk to you and like you, and while you're doing that, you feel like you can't be your true self around them. You're giving them a facade and you're not making a true connection. It's a lose lose situation which only worsens the problem. It makes you feel like giving up and asking ""What's the point?"" This makes it less likely for you to reach out to people and try to make a connection, and each rejection makes you question whether it's truly worth it. Eventually you think ""Oh, I guess I'll be alone. I'm ok with this."" Until you get desperate to reach out again and start the process over.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it isn't any body else's fault. Why shouldn't they want someone cheery and fun to be around? Would you want to be with someone that ruins your mood? 

So what's the solution? Honestly, I don't know. Something needs to change, but that's easier said than done. The only thing we can do is keep trying and hope our efforts are rewarded.",2022-05-08 22:36:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1489848802,2,/r/lonely/comments/uld1hw/loneliness_is_a_vicious_cycle_that_almost_nobody/,,0,1,Loneliness is a Vicious cycle that almost nobody will help you escape.

1542,ulda00,piscesalone,"I have nothing. Never been close to siblings, had ""friends"" in HS who ditched me the moment it was done. Never been an asshole, but always been the shy quiet one. 

Most of the time, didn't really care about being alone. I hear all the time about how Jonah has all these problems, Lauren talks crap, and Ronnie stabbing people in the back, so I figured I'm better off alone. No drama, no new problems or worries, no having to feel bad about not being able to help people. 

This happened every so often where I would feel lonely, but it's hitting like a truck. I'm getting older and I figured by now i'd have made a friend but I have nothing. I have a job, I talk to people, but it's nothing conversations. Work safe BS. I don't have anyone I can connect to on a human level. I have siblings and never had any connection to them. Everyone feels like they're on different planes of reality. It doesn't help that I have borderline personality disorder either, along with autism, and just abandonment issues in general. So I mean, all that combining into me just makes me very untrusting, and worried about any kind of connection, for the thought of it being severed. 

I don't know what to do at all. I've tried going it alone, and it hurts. And for the love of everything you believe in, please, I'm begging you. Don't just leave a stupid comment saying ""it gets better"", or something like that. I'm 29, almost 30, and I have never had anyone I could truly trust or be myself around.

I walked by this one place where this couple was showing PDA and even though I'm used to seeing it, today it was too much that made me go off internally. I got home before it got the best of me but when I got home, I kept thinking about seeing them looking at each other in a loving way, then him touching her on the shoulder as they laughed at something. This feeling of panic with me thinking, why can't that ever be me became so loud I ended up breaking down for a while. It wasn't about them but what they represented. He was good looking, and so was she. Obviously I know why it will never be me, but just seeing them was too much for me. I know someone will say you can't let that get to you and focus on yourself.

I had dreams only a couple of years ago but took a wrong turn and was afraid of judgement. I don't know what to do. More therapy? I can't afford a good therapist, though I know which one and I can't seem to forgive my parents and ask for their help. I want them to see me in pain and know how they fucked up my life by being emotionally neglectful. That ultimately their sacrifices were for nothing. Yeah it's kinda pitiful to still be this angry at your parents in your 30s, but I can't seem to let this resentment go. I pushed my friends away because I cant trust them. I had a somewhat stressful childhood and lacked support and a few traumatic experiences but nothing too out of the ordinary. Mostly its short of providing the basics of food I felt that nobody had any space to care and I was supposed to be the mature one at my age and not ask the because even then I recognized how overwhelmed they were. Now I'm older and moved back home to see if I could use it to gain some ground in employment but couldn't. I can't stand the thought of my parents seeing me happy after the shit I've gone through. Now that they are emotional and needy and society wants me to take care of them and they are playing the same guilt games. Why not just kill myself and have them see it or wait until they pass away without closure and move on with my life after that. Fucking people want to control my life until the very end.

So with all that my self esteem was inexistent and I didn’t believe I could be love.

In the other hand, G was never bullied about almost anything, only her brows what she could easily fix and she was always complimented about her physics and how beautiful she was.

M was always complimented too, she’s the pretty older sister that everybody likes.

Making plans, starting and maintaining conversations - all done by me. It honestly feels like no one really likes me but feels pressured to be my friend through my persistence alone.

And now I’m losing even that. I’ve pretty much stopped looking at my phone now. I never have any messages or contact from others. Where are those ‘checking up on a depressed friend’ and ‘adopting an introvert’ people that seemingly exist somewhere.

Ever since I could remember, my father has been taking care of me. I wish I could have a mother just for mothers day so I wouldn't be left out. I feel left out, seeing kids bonding with their mothers. 

I see my own mother as the equivalent of Satan. She is homophobic, narcissistic, anti-vax, racist, sexist, you name it. She says she'll disown me if I get a girlfriend. She disowns me because she read my diary and found out I'm trans. She says hurtful things like ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a gay kid."" 

People tell me to forgive her. I won't because we're like 2 raging, charging bulls fighting, neither giving up or backing down. She doesn't deserve forgiveness. She's had *way* too many chances to change. She won't. She is very attention-seeking. 

She always babies me. I'm 14. I have zero freedoms when I'm with her. She signed me up for weight loss stuff because ""I'd rather have a dead kid than a fat kid."" I'm very skinny for my age. I'm severely underweight. 

She says she'd ""rather have a dead kid than an unhealthy kid."" She's very fat and overweight, made zero effort in losing it. Blames it on me because ""you made a deal with the devil to make me fat."" 

I only used an Ouija board *once* because I was peer pressured by my friends, who were very popular, when I was 11. I was very naive and stupid, I always wanted to be in the popular crowd. I played the *whole* way through. Not once did I mention my mother. The only things I said were ""Is anyone there?"" and ""Thank you so much for speaking to us, we really appreciate it, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye."" I was a sweet kid. Didn't even know what an Ouija Board was. Didn't touch one since. Yes, they did claim they were a good spirit named Zoey.

Anyways, she claimed that I was making deals with the devil and cursing her. She's insane. She thinks the world revolves around her. She is very entitled. 

My parents are separated and she once just strolled into my house while I was home alone as if she owned it. Her name is on the deed but still. I told her to (not too kindly) get the fuck out of my house or I'll call the police. She tried to call my bluff. They said that they couldn't do anything as ""well, she owns it too so she can do that."" I was pissed.

When my parents went to court, the court said that I must see her *every freaking Sunday until I'm 16 and can decide* I also have to call her every night, no choice until I'm 16. I'm ashamed of her.

If you're a genuinely good parent, with kids, I'd love an online parent. I really need someone. I'd prefer Discord but whatever works. I'd love to be friends with your kids if they're around my age as well. I'm really lonely. I'd love to celebrate mother's day with a mother figure. I'm in Massachusetts so timezones may be an issue.

1568,ulfsqa,selfharmthrowaway19,"I had a bittersweet day I guess. I saw a movie with my brother and his friends, like I said, *his* friends, I don't have any of my own.

I already hadn't slept last night whatsoever, so I already felt/feel pretty bad, the lack of sleep also contributed to the anxiety I've had all day, it did distract me during a good chunk of the movie, but I still definitely enjoyed it and had a good time overall. 

Also, in this group of people was a girl I have a crush on for some reason, even though I don't know her at all, and vice versa. We've never actually spoken one on one  before, outside of extremely hand-waved interactions over the years. 

Today was no different, not that I expected or felt like I deserved anything, but every time I know I'm gonna be around her, in the back of my mind I think ""Wow, what if this is the time where we end up interacting and something crazy happens, like we continue to interact via social media or something outside of this occasion?"".

Anyway, on the way out of the theater, we're all walking through the hallway that leads to the exit.

My brother, whom I pathetically follow around like a lost puppy whenever I'm involved in one of his get-togethers, goes into the bathroom. 

After this, I'm just standing by myself in front of the rest of the group, his friends, they don't notice me because they're all talking about the movie and or looking at their phones, but in that moment I realized that I was staring at a bunch of strangers. They aren't *my* friends, and the idea of mingling with them there was terrifying. After I realized this in a matter of seconds, I just went straight into the bathroom to avoid it. I did also have to go to the bathroom, but that moment was what really motivated me to go in.

1569,ulfxmn,Street_Interaction84,"People of Reddit, I’m pretty sure a lot of people aren’t going to see this post but yesterday over a 4 hour call with my best friend who’s in New York, I finally told her how strongly I felt for a guy, let’s call him X. A little background on me is that, I’ve been in love before or At least I thought it to be love. I can quite honestly say that throughout those 4 years of my life I had been nothing but honest, loyal and trusting but he at the same time used to gaslight me, cheat on me multiple times and keep on calling me psycho for calling him out on his shit. One day I had enough and I left, I left the relationship which once had meant the world to me. After a year of blocking my ex and no contact I started talking to X who just happened to reply on one of my Instagram stories. We talked and talked and it felt unreal, I had never believed that I’d ever be truly in love after the whole situation with my ex, but this guy kept on coming in my life breaking thru all the walls I had put up. I never believed in love meant for you at the right time, but after this guy came into my life I realised that was true because I studied with X for two years in the same space and social circle and subjects before I moved to london for uni. What was kind of unbelievable is that I had never even thought about this guy romantically until after I left and was 3000 miles away from him. After almost 2 months of texting back and forth, he came to London. He was visiting his grandparents in london along with his mother and he was here for almost a month. Out of 30 days we hanged out for 20ish days. I had been the happiest I ever was with him and the memories I made I still cherish. After he went back home I couldn’t control the feeling I felt for him. Even though I tried to repress it, hide it or just run away from it. I couldn’t because I had truly fallen head over heels for this guy. This wasn’t the normal definition of love, I didn’t love him because he was mine or he was with me. I loved him because it was simply him, in a way he helped me reconnect with god, not by being religious or even talking about religion but just by existing and being such a beautiful human. When I pray to God I do not ask God to give me this person, I ask God to keep X happy no matter what, I ask God to make place for me in his heart and that if he is meant for me, make it easier for me to accept it, to accept him. It’s hard for me come to terms with the fact that what I feel for him is something I’ve never felt before, I’ve never been so helpless when it comes to love. I’ve always got the person I wanted in a matter of days. But for X it’s like I don’t want to rush things in fear of them being ruined, I’m afraid to loose him even though I don’t really have him. Him existing in my life is important, and maybe I don’t want to be in a relationship with him because I think so much of him that the day he breaks my heart I won’t be able to take it. That would be a heart break that would end up consuming my soul. Loving him from afar would be much easier than having him commit to me only to break me later on :(

1573,ulgeuq,throwaway457836,"I went through a short term relationship last year but I’m still hurting very badly. 

We met on a dating app and after 4 dates he expressed his interest in me. He told me he liked me and wanted to take things further. I told him that I do have some concerns such as both of us being very busy with work. But he told me to reconsider and also said that work is always here to stay and both of us could have work dates together.

Sensing that he was sincere, I stayed on and he also tried to hold my hand on a few occasions when we were out so I assumed that he really was into me and wanted to pursue a r/s with me. Then I asked him to define the r/s. 

However, shortly after getting together, he was constantly not being able to keep to his promises and would overpromise but turn out to be flakey. He was also talking about long term plans and marriage initially, which pressurised me as well. It made me very anxious and insecure. 

He would also seem off when we were out together. And when I asked him if he was angry or unhappy, he would just say no. I thought I was being too sensitive.

I recall there was this one day when he ignored my messages for a whole day which made me anxious and I called him 4 times only for him to reply in the evening saying that his mum and sis had a big fight and he just didn’t had the mood for anything. Thinking back now, I felt so so silly for calling him 4 times out of fear and anxiousness. I wanted to be there for him but he didn’t want to talk about it.

Since then we spoke and I expressed that it’ll be good for him to just communicate and let me know if he needs space. He also mentioned that he felt that we were spending too much time together (I was seeing him on zoom 2-3 times on weekdays for a short while and once on weekends in person). So I compromised to once on weekends and once on zoom on weekdays just to catch up with each other(we don’t call each other nor have any common texting time where we are both online chatting). We also compromised to just texting once(a few messages exchanges) in a day. He even told me that he has a lot on his plate namely his mum, sis, manager and boss and my first thought was “then what about me”. But instead I told him I was there to just care and get to know him. 

It was really hurting my heart that he couldn’t even take some time out for me and I was constantly waiting for him to get back to me. I also had to hold back my feelings and wanting to see him at his convenience. 

A few weeks later, he ended things through text message saying that he’s too busy with work and can’t give me the attention I need/expect and he’s too tired to maintain a r/s right now. I was also denied a phone call to talk it out. I was really hurt and sad that he didn’t communicate anything and blindsided me. I saw his profile on OKC weeks after the breakup. 

I’ve been thinking about it and felt like I’ve done my best in the relationship and put in all my effort too. I trusted him so much. That was my pure and genuine heart. 

I’m not perfect but tried to do everything right. But the way he didn’t want to spend time/pushed me away got me constantly questioning myself if I’m way too needy and if I am supposed to withhold my feelings and my need to see/spend time with them because of their busy schedule.  

Almost 10 months later, I’m still hurting but I do think he left unscathed and is already seeing someone else. He even created a Spotify playlist for her. Did nothing of this sort when he was seeing me. I can’t seem to stop this hurt. I really can’t",2022-05-09 01:45:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651370409,8,/r/lonely/comments/ulgeuq/end_of_this_short_term_relationship_makes_me_feel/,,0,4,End of this short term relationship makes me feel suicidal.

1576,ulgmgr,notanothersloth,"I have two online friendships. Both of these individuals have always been candid about their struggles with mental health. I've always tried to be there for both of them. I respond quickly to their text messages, express interest in their lives, and feel like I would do anything to help them if they needed it. 

Lately, however, it has been me who has been struggling. My anxiety, my depression, my feelings of worthlessness have all been to such an extreme that it has been impacting my day to day life. I've lost 7 pounds in just 5 days from not eating. I can't find a psychiatrist or a doctor willing to take me until at least three months from now, so medication is not an option. I've been extremely candid with both of these ""friends"" about how alone I feel right now. However, neither one of them seem to actually care. Sometimes I have to wait more than 24 hours just for a response to a text message. They claim I can call anytime, however they know my anxiety won't allow it. Isn't it easier to respond to text messages when you have a moment rather than to take a long call? 

Yesterday was the most traumatic day of my life for reasons I won't go into. When I shared what had happened with ""friend"" #1 all I received was a one text message response: ""that's how it goes."" I shared it with the other one and they simply said: ""how are you feeling now?"" I intentionally sent a response that was open-ended to get a follow-up reply and they have yet to respond. Yet, they've managed to find the time to send multiple group chat messages and pictures since then. 

I don't understand how these people can be so cold and cruel to me. Maybe I'm just being irrational. Maybe I'm expecting way too much. Maybe I'm allowing my standards to fall so low because without these two ""friends"" I literally have no one else. Is it so hard to find a reciprocal friendship? Someone who cares as much about you as you care about them?

Sorry for the rant but I'm feeling so down that I just have to get it out or otherwise it will just crush me even further.",2022-05-09 01:57:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652059158,4,/r/lonely/comments/ulgmgr/my_online_friends_know_im_struggling_but_dont/,,0,1,"My online ""friends"" know I'm struggling but don't seem to care"

All my childhood friends don’t even remember me, my middle school friends cut contact with me, and my high school friends all did the same. It seems once people aren’t forced to spend time with me anymore they choose not to. And these are people I considered to be my best friends.

If only I had shot my shot... I'd have known whether it could've been. But I gave myself the idea that she was out of my league and that she wouldn't be interested in me. I don't remember how old I was when I was really into her, I was likely 12 or 13.

I then had another crush at 16 and I asked if she'd have me at the valentines ball, she said yes. I was happy at the time and after school hours were over I went back home to shower and got into my nice clothes and went to the ball. We went in together and the hosts played us a song to dance to... What I experienced was not that of love towards her in thar moment... She smelled like she just got from soccer practice, the dancing felt awkward and I just wanted to get out of there. But I stayed, I mustered through the stink of a sweaty soccer jersey and... then the ball was over. I must say I was relieved it was over as I was not sure whether I was gonna make it thru the entire thing or not. Nothing more came of between us, she didn't ask for me and nor did I for her.

All of the people I consider as my priority, as my brother, doesn't see me the way I see them. 
They would never do the things that I would do for them. Especially the one I live with at the moment. 
Facing this truth made me see what an absolute asshole this dude is and I am still trying to process this disgust. 
I never want to see him, talk to him and if possible not breathing the same fucking air in the 100km radius. 
Which makes living in the same house truly exhausting for me. 
I never felt this alone in my life tbh. A feeling of loneliness that I have actually never felt before.

However I've also noticed alot lately he seems to make fun of me or laugh at me when I'm just being myself I'm also pretty sure he talks bad about me to other people when I'm not around based off people bringing up embarrassing stories about me that only he could've told them.  I kind of had the same thing happen with my friend group in high school I realized I was more of a jester for them to laugh at more than a friend on equal footing I was always the center of alot of their jokes and I have alot of deformitys on my body that they'd tease me about constantly and send pics of me to other people to laugh at me without my knowledge. I cut them off sadly way too late high school was practically over by the time I really figured out they definitely werent real friends as I also discovered that some completely baseless and untrue rumors about me that had been going around the school for years came from them and these rumors greatly affected how I was viewed by everyone. My last friend I am talking about was apart of that friend group and has been my best friend since the 4th grade I thought at the time he was different and although I dont think he had anything to do with the rumors he certainly never helped my situation.

I'm socially confident enough to talk with strangers with no issues (socializing with people is literally part of my job). I get along well with coworkers and I have a close group of friends. I go to meetups and social events with the goal of getting to know people. I try to make sure people I'm with at least enjoy themselves when we go out and don't feel excluded. 

But I still feel completely alone and socially isolated. I alway have to be the one reaching out. I don't get invited by other people to hangout. When I try reach out to new people I meet they always flake or don't even respond. I get that everyone is busy and I don't deserve anything from other people but hells don't tell me your open to hanging out but then disappear.

i’ve noticed that loneliness and fear of contamination overwhelm me and drive me away from going to school. i live in a city where my commute is a little over an hour long trains love being delayed too! time moves so unusually too, that i prioritize just rushing to get back home and make the most out of a few hours following a shower i take everyday after coming home. by that time it’s maybe already 5pm and i hope i can sleep at 10 latest, and ideally 8. i hate it. but what i hate a lot more is the fact that people take the same trains as me, yet i still spent the year taking the trains on my own, crying into my sleeves on the way home whenever i had to take a bus since i couldnt be picked up and brought home as soon as possible.

i hate showing up to school, engaging in small talk and knowing i don’t truly matter to those i speak to. i go to an arts school, and i thought that because i struggle with socializing snd so do many other artist, this would be my chance to socialize more with people just like me. nope. they’re all city kids with lives and established friend groups. i hate going to school knowing i dont matter and that ill go straight home after havig wasted a day— i hate staying home because i miss out and still spend the same amount of hours struggling to focus on work. 

and fun fact? i was the only brown girl in my elementary school, the only one that couldnt take a walk or bus to and from home with friends in middle school, and maybe now the only one not so devoted to their art in my arts high school. i havent even gone to a single concert or art show yet everyone talks about them

it’s 2 am, i’ve gotta leave the house at 6:30 to get to school by 8…. i hate that i feel miserable enough to call off a 4th day of school in a row. i feel like a disappointment to my mom who desperately wants me to go and to my teachers who’ve either called me out on this not because of how IM doing but because my absences interfere with the fairness of test taking since im absent for tests. i dont think my teachers really care about me, and yet i wanna show up to leave a good impression as a student and a person, toshow that im struggling but trying. i guess im also worried about these impressions for letters of recommendation. i have no clue what im doing i just really dont wanna go :’)",2022-05-09 06:10:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1631388904,2,/r/lonely/comments/ulkoe2/my_lowest_attendance_as_of_yet/,,0,6,my lowest attendance as of yet

My heart is heavy today,  as I am becoming more and more isolated. As I go about my day,  I have difficulty connecting with people,  particularly women.

1632,ull07g,Minister_of_Joy,"Hello friends,

Sometimes when I'm feeling very down and lonely, I listen to sad music and it really helps me a lot. It makes me feel like I'm not alone with this pain.

Here are a few songs about loneliness I enjoy a lot:

- [**Solitary Man**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5rVmXyZP5s) by Johnny Cash. Sometimes I play this song when I'm in the shower and I love to sing along to it! I find Cash's voice really soothing, especially in his older age. There are a lot of musicians who sing sad songs but are actually very happy people. When I listen to this and other sad songs by Johnny Cash, the pain in his voice sounds so genuine and authentic. Makes me feel understood.

- [**Streets of London**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWomXklfv8) by Ralph McTell

- [**Eleanor Rigby**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y) by the Beatles. Most Beatles songs are cheerful but this one is actually quite melancholic in my opinion.

- [**The Partisan**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs5hOhI4pEE) by Leonard Cohen. This is technically a song about war but it's also a song about losing everyone that's dear to you.

- [**The Letter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L13fYjKuFG0) by Digger Barnes. I love this song because it starts out sounding like a happy dream or fantasy, until you realize it's actually a memory and therefore quite sad and melancholic. I have recently been left by the love of my life. We've been married and the pain of losing her (very undeservedly) hurts so much. When I listen to this song, it really hits home.

- [**People Are Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Mz_IqpZX8) by the Doors. I often listen to the Doors during episodes of acute depression because like no other band, they managed to express this feeling of being disconnected and estranged from the world. Reality becomes like a bad acid trip because you're all by yourself and the rest of the world just doesn't make any sense to you anymore. This song is a great example of this.

- [**Yokohama**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH70UQSXkrw) by Hako Yamasaki. This is a Japanese song that serves as a confession of love towards the city of Yokohama. It's a deeply melancholic song, though, because the narrator also feels very lonely there. In the song it's raining and the narrator has given up on trying to connect with other people around her. Hako Yamasaki is one of my absolute favorite artists. She was active in the 1970s and early 1980s, which was also the golden age in post-war Japanese history. When I listen to her music, I often have to think of a rainy November evening in Tokyo of 1975 or 1980, a small bar with some live music, neon lights that flicker in the rain, a few lonely people on the street who can't decide whether they should go inside or go home...

Anyways, tell me your favorite songs about loneliness, the kind of songs that make you feel understood and comforted!",2022-05-09 06:34:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622276562,13,/r/lonely/comments/ull07g/what_are_some_songs_about_loneliness_or_being/,,0,11,What are some songs about loneliness or being left by people that you love and that make you feel better?

He’s the first person I’ve ever loved. And I’m still incredibly heartbroken. I know time heals all wounds, and right now, I just wish time would speed up. We dated for over a year, which is also the longest relationship I’ve been in.

In procrastinating for finals, I’ve been watching a bunch of movies that I know will just make me miserable. And each time I watch any of these movies, I cry for two reasons: I miss my ex and I want to fall in love with someone in the super cheesy Hollywood way they do. My heart hurts but I know that my ex and I broke up for the better.

If he’s moved on, good for him. I’m happy for him because I know I couldn’t make him happy, but it hurts thinking that he might have moved on so quickly. I miss the feeling of safety that came with being in his arms. I miss the feeling of knowing that someone loved me.

1653,ulomgf,Unknown-14,"Hi y’all. I thought I’d express some thoughts that have been plaguing me for a while, so here goes.

I’m my own worst enemy and my environment is not the problem.

For some clarity, I was born abroad so that makes me a third culture kid. 

Country A, my birthplace, for the most part was miserable growing up in. I was bullied, ridiculed and forgot completely what it meant to be happy. Most of my friends had moved on with their lives and I was ultimately left alone and lonely.

The time came when I could leave Country A and so I moved to Country B. I thought hey, this it! I can finally be happy for once and not feel lonely again.

I was able to make friends and have fun for once in life. However, down the line I sank back into the feelings of sadness and loneliness. Perhaps it had to do with my low academic performance and it added to my overall negativity.

My friends were there and were supportive, but I couldn’t help but sink further in my negativity.

Eventually I had to say bye to these wonderful people and I moved to Country C - the home of my parents.

Having to experience a new culture again, I took my time to learn how things worked and eventually made friends again. I had more freedom here and was genuinely happier than ever. 

Oh but get this, I got sad and lonely again. Thing is I don’t why I do this to myself.

I have all these loving family and friends and have had a relatively good life and yet I succumb to my neuroticism.

So if it’s not my environment or people, it’s definitely me.

I have some issue or problem within me and I’m tired of being sad and lonely all the time.

I think it’s time I seek counseling or therapy.",2022-05-09 10:59:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1506408613,2,/r/lonely/comments/ulomgf/i_think_i_need_therapy/,,0,2,I think I need therapy

We would have lunch together, go to the movies, text each other on all the socials, talk about everything.. but she was in a relationship so I didn't think too much of it. But then she started hinting that she wasn't feeling appreciated in her relationship... Now I'm really thinking about her everyday, waiting for an opportunity... It never came though because a few months later she started becoming distant. 
I eventually found out that she was scared she was getting too attached to me and felt she had to stick to the commitment she made.. she would also later tell me that the fact that I'm a bald headed light-skinned didn't help. It was hard for her to feel sexually attracted to me because I wasn't physically her type ( and she knows it sounds pretty).
Anyway, I tried but couldn't force her to see the potential. We still work together and it was awkward for a bit, but we're cool now.. almost back to how close we were before but I can tell she's set boundaries and let me in as much anymore.
The thing is, I still really like her. I've never met anyone like her before and I'm kind of reserved so I don't meet people that often anyway. I'm still coming to work and seeing her and sitting next to her every week which isn't helping me move on. I don't even know if I want to move on. Part of me still thinks there's a chance.

1660,ulql2e,iDislikeSn0w,"I'm 21 now (22 in a few months) and I must've been 15 or so when I started seriously chasing girls I was interested with. I had a few 'girlfriends' but eventually it didn't last very long or only lead to a whole lot of nothing.

From 2019 until 2021 I gave online dating a serious go. I met up with a few girls, hell even one from Discord but no one felt a spark, ghosted me or started things back up again with their ex.

After my last date in the spring of 2021 I decided this shit wasn't worth it anymore and deleted every single profile on every single app and my dating life has been dryer since the sahara since. Nothing.

So, what did I learn from the girls who I did date and had a relationship with? That a lot of them saw me as their personal therapist, ghosted me when they got their fix and that interest is often faked for goals relating to themselves. Hell I had one girl straight up tell me who I was together with for nearly a year she wasn't really in love with me, she just 'felt very safe with me and I brought her great companionship during that difficult time of her life'.

Sure, I guessed I‘ve liked being alone to an extent but being in complete solitary is painful and it’s ruining my psyche.

I may end it all, I may not. My mind’s a blank on this matter and I can’t fully decide (though I may just play the best of both worlds and end it in 2 years). If you see this, it’s just a rant.

1699,uly44f,Throwaway_acct22,"I (23m) have never been good at making friends or relationships. I have made a few friends in recent years but they all now have partners that they spend most of their time with. I’ve always tried to push myself out of my comfort zone to meet new people but it’s always ends the same. I’ve done stuff that I am really not comfortable with just to try to make people like me.

I feel like I’m being left behind. It’s probably a stupid mind set but I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle that i always end up alone. I’ve tried dating but no matter what I do, I always get ghosted. It’s led to me being really closed off about my feelings and just makes me scared to open up to people cause of all the times before I know I’m going to get hurt.

For some reason I always let myself hope that things will be different every time I meet someone but it’s just hurts more when they leave. I don’t know if I’m doing anything wrong. It always makes me think that there’s something wrong with me. A lot of girls brush me off because of my lack of experience. 

I’ve had a bad past that still effects me to this day but I’ve worked on myself to get to the point I am now and I’m happy with how things are but I can’t shake the feeling of loneliness. Everyone I know goes home to someone who loves them and I’m just at home alone.

I just want someone who cares about me, Someone I can have my own family with and not be alone anymore. Someone who gets me and I get them. That we would be best friends and not just a couple.

1700,ulya5e,New_Literature42,"Dear God am I going to regret this, but I feel like I need to do this right now.

I tell people I don't have any friends, that I am completely alone and that no one wants to be my friend. The truth is that I have ""friends"". I interact with them, talk with them, laugh with them and tell them they are my friends. Yet I don't feel like they are.

If you were to ask one of them if they are friends with me they'd say yes. On the other hand, I still say I am alone, I still feel alone. I can't look them in the eyes and tell them. ""You are my friend"" cause that is not how I see them.

I am completely alone, completely isolated, and completely without one person to talk to. Not because I have to, but because I choose to. I can't trust someone enough to feel like they are my friend. I am scared that they are lying, scared that if I get too close I might get hurt.

I am angry that I can never be myself. That I have to take on a mask every time I meet someone. That my relationships never go deeper than the surface and that I have never told anyone ever how I feel.

I desperately try to escape my life as ""lonely"". I try to talk to people and find it enjoyable for a while, but as soon as I have to keep that going it's no longer what I want. I talk to someone face to face and think to myself ""this is a person, who wishes me no harm"". But as I leave the room they become abstract. I grow scared of that person and feel like they are a hassle. Someone who was my potential friend becomes my enemy, someone who might hurt me in the future.

I want to tell people how I feel, I want to talk to someone, but ultimately I have no one. I can't utter the words I want to say, I can't speak up because I feel like shit, like I just left a vulnerable piece of myself for someone else to stab every time I speak to someone about my issues. 

I am so tired of being lonely, so tired of not having anyone to speak to, so tired of never being able to be myself. 

But in the end, I know that all of that is my fault, that it stems from my inability to trust anyone. And that is what hurts the most.


I am scared for my life that I might never meet someone I can trust.

1719,um0k25,TitanXZ48,"Throughout my life I’ve always felt like something’s missing. And now that I’ve found myself in solitude, I know more than ever that I need a partner in my life. Though I’m only eighteen and people would call me too young for this, I feel like I’ve grown up too fast and too soon. I’ve seen the world and I’ve come to know exactly what I want. Problem is, it’s too hard to find. But before I give up, I’ll post this as a last attempt since online dating apps got me nowhere and dating in real life is impossible for someone my age due to where I live. I don’t see myself living past my twenties so here we are. I’ve always felt this strange yet familiar loneliness deep within me. The feeling that no one truly understands me, and that I have no true connections in my life. Though I’m surrounded by people, none of them match me as much as I’d want. Nobody cares for me except for my family and a few friends, obviously. But I want someone other than family to care. My ideal partner is someone who would have the key factors in common with me. A lonely, nihilistic, carefree, laidback soul, simply looking for someone the same as them to share their life with. I’ve never fallen for the false image of a happy family with children, in fact I despise anything that even remotely resembles such an idiotic image. I’m an anti-natalist meaning that I’ll never want to have children, and I’m not interested in adopting either. In fact I’m planning on getting a vasectomy as well. My partner has to feel the same way. So sure that they’d be willing to get their tubes tied up. I’m also an atheist and am anti-religion, spirituality, theism, cultural rules, family rules, strict morality or anything that takes away my full freedom to do absolutely anything I want as a human being. You’d have to be the exact same way, otherwise we wouldn’t workout. I view sexual activities as acts for pure pleasure and I like my sexual life to be separated from my romantic life. That means I don’t expect monogamy and will not be monogamous of any sort. My sexual life is my business and yours is yours. If you’re the type to feel jealous, stop reading. I’m open minded and kinda kinky. Other than gas, defecation and acts that are harmful in anyway such as cutting, choking, et cetera, I’m willing to tryout all sorts of sexual activities as long as we’re both comfortable with it. I’m not one to put up with bullshit so you’d have to be emotionally stable and as laidback as I am if not more. On the other hand you wouldn’t have to put up with any bullshit on my side either. I tend to never make big deals out of any problems as I believe that the best way to solve problems is with calmness and logical thinking. I try my best to never let anything get to me and I expect the same from a partner. I will not accept any form of toxicity in my relationship and will break up immediately as I’ve done many times before if I feel like I’m not enjoying myself. I will also do the same if I feel like you aren’t enjoying my company because I expect you to be honest and feel comfortable and happy around me. I’d never force anyone into anything so if you force yourself, I’m out. I’m not strict about age but if you’re older than me, I will not tolerate getting looked down upon in anyway. Just because I’m “young” to society’s standards does not mean I’m immature. If you disagree, stop wasting your time. I don’t claim to be perfect as I don’t believe in perfection overall, but I know my self worth and I demand respect and kindness. I treat people the same way they treat me. I like my relationship to be fully double-sided at all times. A relationship made of ever growing pure love, trust and acceptance from both sides until death do us apart. If you like and accept what you’ve read, chances are, I’ll like and accept you. So don’t be shy. Send me a message and we’ll see how it goes.

1747,um52t6,STRNGERDNA,"I (18) starting seeing my ex (k) in the summer before this school year. We met through mutual friends and quickly became friends ourselves. The more we know each other, the more we became closer. We became super comfortable with each other and eventually we would do things people in relationships do. We would see each other everyday and always be together. We held hands, we took naps together, we bought each other food, showed each other music , we kissed. Months into this I turned 18 and wanted to do something I could do that I couldn’t before, I downloaded tinder. I didn’t think this was a big deal it’s not like I actually would meet anyone I matched up with. I starting texting someone I matched with and we just innocently texted, it never crossed any boundaries, all we would do is talk. I tell K about this and he becomes angry, we stayed up until 2 am talking about it, I tried to explain it wasn’t serious and that I would never go against him. I realize now that I was an idiot for not caring how he would have felt about. Eventually though, he gets over it and we continue things as we do. A few months later I have an insane depressive episode, which is not uncommon for me, and one of the things I do during these episodes is push people away from me. I invite him over and tell him I don’t feel the same anymore. It shocked me how much I didn’t feel about it. Coming out of the episode, I think I wanted to convince myself what I said was true. I tried to move on. Fast forward I think about K daily, i miss him. I realize how selfish it sounds, but I know I’ll never have him like I did again and it makes me sad. I met someone else (V) and things went well, we went on a couple dates, he was nice and romantic. I really began to like V and could start seeing myself with him, we even began talking about the future. Not too long ago V begins being dry over text and noticeably not putting effort like he would. I knew what was coming but I liked him so much I didn’t want it to be true, i wanted to hold on to what he we had for a little longer. Shortly after though, he began to not respond at all and then, over text, he tells me that he doesn’t feel ready for a relationship but he thanks me for being in his life.

Life is going by fast but it’s being looped.

Made plenty of posts detailing what i have been through.

I’m a 18M and i’m near the end of high school, and 3 years have passed by i still feel like i’m 15.

I’ve never had friends or a girlfriend, my personality is the same as it was when i was 13-15, i’m very childish and immature, I’m considered annoying to people. This isn’t the reason I have any friends though, as i’m terribly scared of talking to people.

I’m incredibly insecure of my body and who i am, i have terrible acne that doesn’t want to go away, and many other things such as my height.

I’ve became so much better mentally from what i was in the past, and now i’m solely focusing myself in trying to improve myself, but it’s really hard because i feel like it won’t matter.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts alot.

I have plenty of medical conditions that are ruining me but i can’t get a doctor.

I have no social life other than my 15yo cousin that lives in a different city, and i get bullied by him(all jokes).

Going to school for me is completely useless as i do not have any social life, It feels like the same shit everyday. 

Getting a girlfriend is almost impossible as no girl has ever showed attention towards me. Even if they did, I can’t get a girlfriend at the school as everyone in my classes are 16-17 (i have failed multiple times.)

I feel like i have plenty of undiagnosed mental illnesses as i cannot socialize properly, if one person shows interest, i try to message them everyday which ends up in them blocking me. I’m also seen as a loser and annoying in social circles, i can’t be the “chill guy.” 

Also, i’m saying this like i get any socialization, i am completely devoid of any socialization other than my cousin, who i feel is only making things worse because of my insecurities and he has a different mindset.

This is incredibly cringey to say but i do not have anything to live for.

I’m not just lying down and rotting, i’m actually working on myself and trying to change my life but i feel like this is useless.

1763,um62wc,kerohp257,"So...I was something of an extrovert kid of myself back then when I was 5 and I remember being really talkative with the entire class and my ""shy"" cousin who sat beside me would always be quiet...then the downhill started since actual school started and left the kindergarten

I was shocked by the sheer number of people there compared to the kindergarten which was like a lot lesser than school and that made me feel scared and tried to find a seat and see what does the future holds for me there...

I got into class picked one of the rear seats and we were 3 classes where 2 would get science and maths and 1 which took them too but in another language (arabic the local language)

Most people were quiet and friendships were already formed there because that same school allowed kids from 3 up to 17 to join the school and my parents chose the kindergarten instead because it was nearby to home

Break starts I go and make my first friend and having fun then I try to find another one but most of them wouldn't appear or be shy or just introverts so I couldn't really make another friend that day...and unlike our class (which I will name B) the other class A had mostly extroverted people but I didn't make friendships with them cause they were another class blah blah stupid 6 yr old me tried to come up with reasons for his shyness or fear of people...

2 years ahead I found that I had 2 relatives there 1 of them was in the same class which I was glad for and we talked me and him and the old one until one day... The popular kids decided to play games together and were inviting most people so they got my 2 only friends so I thought ""well I must play too"" and went there just to be faced with a ""no"" from this annoying girl and that planted inside me the fear of rejection 
So every day I would do my best to keep my friends with me
And if a new kid joins the school I would try to be his friend before they steal him and I would do my best

And since I mentioned that those friends were introverted/shy they wouldn't take any activities in summer (there is nothing wrong with being introverted but when you are affected by behaviours you are not used to your true self starts to disappear

2018 me decides to buy a new pc and dad told him that he would buy it from an old friend so we went there bought the pc and waited for the games to install (early 2000's games that everyone played but it was still ok)
Dad leaves to pick up mom
His friend leaves his son to supervise the pc 

So I talked to kill the awkwardness and he was responding to me (wow I was excited for a stranger to respond to me) and started talking about the private courses and things we shared and didn't know (and luckily this time he was from class A the extroverted kids) and by the time we reached a close friendship level and being able to talk to people easily (specially girls since the first one made me avoid talking to a girl at all costs) I start to realize...

""i feel like i was like this before..."" ""why did I not be friends with anyone from A... I'm the kid who cared only about games now and not do any activities...""

I really felt steps behind when I learned that everyone could swim now...(maybe useless to you but for me and the trips that the school does? It meant much)

I was the one begging my old friends to stop our laziness and go learn swimming in 2016 

And when the relative made a dumb choice to block all our female colleagues I followed him too even though most of them was nice but because he thought all of them were bad he did this (now me and him undid this of course but why we did it in the first place)

Now remember the extroverted friend?

He used to tell me about stories in the courses he had and the people in them and oh boy i was acting like ""oh that's really cool"" while inside me I was in pain knowing that I wasted years worth of joy I could have had 

Don't get me wrong my introverted old friends are not the ones to blame here but it's their nature that ruined me and I can't change their nature 

I guess I was dragged down due to wrong match of friends... 

But im still 14 wahoo i can try and fix these things right? 

Well no.
The damages has been done and everyone is now having their own friend group so making a friend now feels really late and that if you manage to get one...

But I got out with a life lesson
And that is I shouldn't wait on someone to do something I also want and unfortunately I learned that the hard way

Edit: the old first friend actually was shy because he was also used to different people from his hometown so when the came to school in 2019 he basically forgot about me and other people he made friends with but luckily for me I had already known the extroverted friend and 2 other really good people and he also helped with my self-confidence but I'm not anywhere like him but I'm trying my best

My oldest friend blocked me on everything and I’ve been rejected 3 times by different people in 6months and I knew these people but I’m just bad at reading signals. I can’t hold a conversation there’s nothing interesting about me and so no wonder they left but sometimes I wonder why they didn’t stick with me. I’m not doing great but I thought that’s when your friends were supposed to stick by you.

As far as the eye can see there's not a star in sight, the myth that is love itself is much the same as stars, you can see them from a distance every now and then, but no matter how beautiful they look you'll never be able to reach them. On dark starless nights such as this im reminded of just how truly alone I am and always will be. I want someone to give my love to, someone to give ME to, but much like the stars, I'll never have that. You hear people say ""All the stars in the night sky are already long dead"" I don't know if that's true or not but it's sums up what I'm saying quite perfectly. Love just doesn't seem real anymore, something you see all around you everyday but you'll never have it and it's probably long dead. I just wish I could join the stars in the cosmos, release my consciousness from this mortal coil that I'm in, from this hell that I live on.

To be frank, I’ve always had difficulties connecting with other people. They always seem to just drift away, throw me away like an old toy. I never understood why people did this to me, and I still don’t. The “friends” I have in high school ignore me, ostracize me, and keep information from me. I always ask if anyone wants to hang out, but they are “busy”. They’re not really friends at all. And really, I’ve never really had people there for me in my life other than my mom. 

It is common knowledge among my peers that I am an abnormal individual. Maybe it’s the way I talk, my fascination with “creepy” animals, or active imagination. I am a freak in everyone’s eyes. At least beetles and spiders don’t judge you for being yourself.

I helped her get through that by giving her all my love and affection and attention . Was there for her whenever she needed me. I always wanted to be her friend because we lived in two different states and it would have been hard to maintain a long distance relationship but she insisted on being one and I eventually agreed because she really needed someone good in her life after the mess she had been through and I kinda fell for her by trying to be there for her. A year later she says it's hard for her and she doesn't think she deserves me and she's not a good person and she's having conflicting thoughts which basically means she wants to screw with her abusive ex and she wants to end our relationship. I am heartbroken and clueless because when no one was there for her I stood by her picked her up got her on her feet and now because she's horny she doesn't want me anymore and rather go and be with her abusive ex. I'm so depressed I can't get her out of my head no matter what I do and it seems like she left me the way I found her and I feel helpless and I just want the pain to stop.

It's like the universe intentionally shows me people who aren't lonely and have people in their life who care about and love them and treat them like they matter to make me feel worse and hate myself even more.

I'm a trans woman and I always see other trans people with families, who love them and support them and friends who actually care about them and want to be around them and romantic partners who treat them with so much kindness and respect it hurts knowing I'll never experience any of that.

My family always treated my siblings better I was always invisible, my friend group treats me like I'm less than and not good enough like I'm a charity case they were hired to be friends with and I don't even try to date because that's just a fairytale I'm unlovable no human is capable or has the ability to love someone as worthless as me. I'm literally nothing how can anybody love nothing.

I'm so jealous and I hate myself for it but how can I not be jealous when I have no one and I see people everyday who have what I always wanted.

I sit in my apartment alone everyday wondering why am I here. I had a lung infection in 2021 and I was so sick and could barely breathe I wish I would have died. That would of been the best thing to ever happen to me in my whole life.

I have a few co-workers that I have tried to make an effort with to be closer as friends outside of work, but I am normally ignored (on text) and canceled on when plans are made. I understand that perhaps they may have anxiety themselves which may make them hesitant to hangout in person but it just feels like I am avoided. I always try to make people happy by doing little things like giving small gifts on bdays or special occasions and bringing treats to work, but once my bday came everyone forgot, I dont even care to get anything but even a text would have made me feel visible.

1833,umec1d,BigRatSkins,"I’m so lonely, I imagine what having friends is like. Sometimes when I’m out by myself I’ll watch a group of friends and pretend like I’m a part of the group. I reply in my head to whatever I’m seeing, sometimes it helps me feel better, other times it makes me cry and I have to leave or dissociate for a bit. 

It’s been around 10 years now that I’ve had a genuine friendship. And I’ve forgotten what people do together. Sometimes I find myself surprised when I see or read about friends and their interactions. 
  
Now I’m not saying that these things I’m going to list are universal for every friendship, it’s just some stuff that surprised me a bit. 

Did you know people will get together at one house to watch a movie/show together? Or stream it and watch together?  
They’ll throw things like house parties, themed parties, just-because-parties. 
They’ll sleep in the same bed platonically, cuddle platonically, get changed in front of one another without issue. 
They’ll help each other pick out outfits, lend each other clothes/shoes, give advice on fashion, even coordinate outfits.
If one friend is really struggling mentally and their home is turning into a depression pit they’ll lend a hand and expect nothing in return, they just want their friend to feel a bit better. 
Speaking of cleaning , they’ll get on FaceTime or a phone call just to have their friends presence while doing boring life stuff. 
They make group chats and seemingly have endless things to talk about amongst each other.
They’ll be excited to try a new recipe and want them to be a part of it, inviting their friends for dinner or even making the food at their friends place instead. 
They’ll go camping together or river floating, activities like that.
They’ll talk and listen to each other, paying attention and remembering the things that have been said. 

They share a portion of their life together and enjoy it, even the mundane things are better with their friends involved it would seem. 

I just wish one day to make even one true genuine friend but I know I offer nothing of value. And when I finally get the courage to speak with someone I vibe with I feel like I’m walking a tightrope between being my genuine self and trying my best to not scare/annoy them away or say the wrong thing.

Bonus confessions: Once after hours of playing Destiny and trying to find some people to play with I came across another girl gamer. I got so excited I forgot I sound like a 12 year old boy over chat and that, paired with my overzealous enthusiasm, caused her to ghost me before our first mission. I don’t blame her btw it was just a good reminder that even online I am incapable of cultivating friendships.

Once I was so lonely I started thinking about what other kind of people are as lonely as I am too. So I started working at a homeless shelter. I never found a true friend but it made me happy to help others and be a listening ear. 
And before Covid I was going to start volunteering at nursing homes because I figured there was (more than likely) people with no family or friends living at those sorts of places and maybe I’d be lucky enough to bond with someone else like me.",2022-05-10 09:01:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650864159,21,/r/lonely/comments/umec1d/im_pathetic_and_ive_come_to_terms_with_it/,,1,14,I’m pathetic and I’ve come to terms with it

I'm really feeling the loneliness tonight, or maybe just this past week. My bday came and went, I took the day off from work and nothing really happened. I bought my mom a gift that she liked for mothers day so I'm pretty proud of that. I end up going to my room and just be on my phone and pc for the rest of the night. Not talking to anyone or doing anything that I was planning on doing. I feel like I'm in depression again, something that I've been struggling with for a majority of my life. Once I turned everything off and lay in bed, that's when it hits me. I want someone to hug. Idk if it's me wanting to hug them in order to comfort them or them hugging me in order to comfort me, but I want to feel someone's warmth and hear their quiet breaths as they feel safe in my arms.
I don't know why there's shame in to feeling lonely, people making throwaway accounts or making up lies in order to hide our loneliness. I do it to some degree. I don't really use this account so I feel more comfortable to just post here.
I have a hard time maintaining my friendships cause I end up just wanting to curl up into a ball and lay on my bed for the night, holding onto my pillow like if it was someone to hug.
I realized how lonely I was when I got fired from my previous job. I was just roaming around with my car, with no goal in mind. I would just roam malls and fast foods while I just watch everyone pass by me with a friend to accompany them.

Here are some questions, if you could just answer some of them and make some comments it will be really helpful. Also, you could have a chat with me anytime to talk about your experience or feelings or whatever. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

1. When you feel lonely, how do you ease the loneliness?
2. What is the main reason you feel lonely? Or what specific moment?
3. When do you feel least lonely?
4. How much time do you typically spend on social media each day? (Share screen time?)
5. When do you usually use social media? (After getting off work? At night? When feeling lonely?)
6. Which social media do you use the most? what do you use it for? (For example?) Does using social media help you with your loneliness? Are you using social media to get over it? how?
7. Will try to meet friends using social media/software? (Why don't you use social software to meet friends, think it's unsafe, unreliable, or shy?)
8. How do you think technology (social media, etc.) is affecting your life today? (Have more friends? Stronger bonds with your old friends? Lonely? More anxious?)
9. Are you trying to meet new people in real life? In what way? What was your last experience?
10. What do you think is the biggest difference between online and offline social networking?
11. Do you think the quality or quantity of social interactions is more important to you? Why?
12. What does your ideal high-quality social relationship look like? (in a few words to describe)
13. Do you think you can build such high-quality social relationships through social media (other technologies)? Why? If so, under what circumstances is it possible?",2022-05-10 14:22:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648475117,4,/r/lonely/comments/umjvgq/a_school_project_about_helping_people_release/,,0,6,A school project about helping people release loneliness

1873,ummprl,throwaway0183701,"She wasn't in class today. So even if I wasn't the world's biggest pussy, I still couldn't have asked her out, or even asked to be friends or something. No asking how her lab final went, no asking if she wanted to study for the lecture final together. Last actual class day I'll see her (unless she has ochem in fall, in which case last class day for like 3 months) , and it's just... gone.

Idk, I know I wouldn't have done anything anyway. I could barely manage to speak to my teacher about school stuff (which I feel I have a right to talk to him about) , no way I could talk to her about non-school stuff (which I feel I have no right to talk to her about) . But it still hurts more than I thought it would. It already hurt knowing that I was gonna throw any possibility of a chance away, but actually throwing it away made it hurt all over again.

This is all so fucking stupid, though. If there is any justice in the universe, she already has a partner. There's no way someone as beautiful, smart, and put-together as her is alone against her will. The only way she's alone is if she wants to be, and I'm certainly not good enough to sway her decision on that.

It's fucking stupid that I have to feel this way about a girl I know next to nothing about. I barely know her name, I only know how to say her first name, and that only because the teacher has said it in class. I don't know the first goddamn thing about her, but my stupid fucking ape brain is fixating on her to the point that I'm crying and extra depressed because she doesn't care about me. I don't need this, I have finals to study for. Hell, I have video games I want to enjoy. I have better shit to do than wish I was dead just so I wouldn't feel sad anymore.  I don't want to feel like this. Why don't I get a fucking choice in how I feel? Why do I have to just be a powerless leaf blown on deterministic winds, going wherever and feeling whatever circumstance dictates I must? If I accept the illusion of free will as useful (and I do) , that at best guarantees that I have control over my response to stimuli, but nothing more. I don't get to choose if and how my brain attacks my mind whenever I see her or think about how happy I'd be with her and how sad I am without her. I know I said earlier ""if there's any justice in the universe..."" , but clearly there isn't. If there were any justice here, then I wouldn't feel as bad as I do. I'd recognize that the chances of someone wanting me and caring about me are slim to none, and I'd choose to stop caring about romance as a result. And I'd be happy. But that isn't what happens, instead reality seems intent on torturing me. I thought I'd gotten rid of the concept of hell when I left christianity, but apparently it followed me out, cuz I'm in it. This is eternal conscious torment.",2022-05-10 16:30:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606960124,2,/r/lonely/comments/ummprl/stupid_bitch_journal_5/,,0,3,Stupid Bitch Journal (5)
1874,ummw3g,Jurez1313,"Bit of background: I'm a 30 year old white male. Obese, otherwise below-average appearance (*maybe* a 4/10 in a perfect outfit, at a healthy weight). Socially anxious to the point of basically being an agoraphobe. Live with my parents. No IRL friends. No significant other. 2 siblings and 1 ""faux"" sibling. No other close family. Dead end job that pays OK but in this economy, not enough to move out. Decent car. Get along OK with co-workers but none are more than acquaintances.  

Only hobbies are gaming and hiring women to sleep with me, if you can call either of those things hobbies. If I had friends, I'd watch movies/TV shows, go out to eat, play board games, go mini golfing, bowling or even to amusement parks, but without friends none of those things are appealing, or sometimes even possible. Finally, I have a very ""avoidant"" and sometimes even ""grating"" personality. I'm easily irritable, and quick to correct people on semantic shit or finish their sentences if they're taking too long to do so themselves. My short temper and otherwise bland mannerisms basically make me the exact opposite of a good or interesting person/friend.  

So, I know what you're gonna say: ""All of those things are changeable."" And I agree completely. But I also know myself. I know there is no possible way that I'm ever going to figure out how to motivate myself to take the necessary steps required to fix any of these things. Something as simple as ""eat less food, idiot"" has been a stumbling block since I was a child. Every time I hit the smallest bit of resistance, I immediately quit. That's just how I am. I know that, I've accepted that. But it means that changing all of the things that are preventing me from finding friends is impossible for me. That's just how it is.  

So how am I supposed to cope with never having friends to hang out with? To never have a shoulder to cry on when I've had a rough week? To never have someone next to me in the theater that I can whisper theories to, or enjoy a fantastic meal with, or take in a great view in each other's company? Any tips on figuring that out would be very helpful. I'm getting a cat in a week or two so after that I won't really be able to rely on suicidal ideation to help me cope, because I won't be able to end my life while I'm directly responsible for another life, which was my coping method in the past.",2022-05-10 16:38:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,12,/r/lonely/comments/ummw3g/how_do_you_cope_with_being_alone_the_rest_of_your/,,0,42,How do you cope with being alone the rest of your life?

Ive been single for 6 years now and im also tired of that. Im an only child so naturally im home alone a lot either way. Dont get me wrong, i enjoy some time for myself to mess around, but it gets lonely fast.

I'm only 16 so that might explain a bit.

I have been getting feelings for a girl in my class lately and I'm twisted inside. I don't know if I am developing feelings for her or not. I would like to get to know her better since we haven't really talked to eachother that much but I have the feeling that she would be creeped out if I ask her out because it would be a little out of the blue.
So far she seems super nice/friendly and I don't want to make it awkward between us in the future. I'm not really scared to be turned down but that she would feel weirded out and awkward.",2022-05-10 20:38:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650754990,4,/r/lonely/comments/ums5yy/hi_i_need_some_advice/,,0,4,"Hi, I need some advice"
1908,ums8pu,Gamanic_,"I'm lucky to be surrounded by family, friends and friendly coworkers (partially) and I know that it's a blessing as some people dont have these relations but even though I have all these people around me, it feels like I'm a ghost who just exists and is mentioned from time to time.

I try to strike up conversation with family sometimes and its met with ""cool, cool anyways"" but if my siblings or cousins or other relations were to talk to the same people I do it would turn into a fulfilling conversation for them.

I'm definitely shy but by no means a bystander in conversations I try to get involved but I usually get shut out. Back in school I'd hear my group of friends chatting and try talking and get ignored, I only had 3 or 4 people who actually listened to me and those conversations were always fulfilling, wacky but genuine.

I had a conversation with my boss today, he thinks I'm a slacker who doesnt work when his eye isnt on me, didnt bother listening to my words, he just made an assumption because of his arrogance and ignorance. Truthfully, I finish my work in about 2 hours and try to be helpful doing random bits here and there but I'm usually wandering for the better part of 1 and a half hours trying to figure out what I can do. It really sucks and of course since I'm new no blame can go to anyone else, people who told me to do one thing and now I get told another. 

I used to suffer from serious temper tantrums but I got a grasp on that and its one of my proudest moments but today I almost snapped, I was on the verge of hitting something and had to really feel myself back in to not explode, later on I was chatting to my parent and pretty much got flamed for believing in a right to privacy online, instead of listening they just went on a tirade about why privacy online is dumb, I informed about being in the final stages of preparation for my driving test and once again ignored, second my sibling opens up about eventually doing their test, a conversation starts.

I hate these people and everyday I seek a lifeline to get me out of here, I'm at the point where I just pray on a dream to win millions in the lotto or become some overnight sensation with music but I know in a failure, an outcast, a ghost and i know that if i died it would be crocodile tears and a month of mourning till my name is forgotten.

I'm not depressed or suicidal, I think at least but it genuinely concerns me that my only options at this point, to escape my current life is bad actions, death or to continue my life for another 20 years till I finally have enough money to buy a shitty shack in the middle of nowhere.

I probably wont be listened to here and honestly this is just me getting heavy shit off my chest. It's the only way I can express how I feel knowing the only thing that can be judged is my words and my tag. The only emotions I seem to be feeling is sadness and anger now, happiness comes in isolation but I never smile, I cant smile. 

If you got this far, listen to those close to you, they may be more grateful for your ears than you might think, don't block them out.",2022-05-10 20:42:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651006689,8,/r/lonely/comments/ums8pu/nobody_listens/,,0,1,Nobody listens

The last one I got lucky with and the moment I talked to her she gave off the vibe of caring that caused me to be at ease. Her empathy made it easier to talk to and when I talked about my loneliness, she said I don't understand what it's like to never have a sig. other but I will do everything I can to help you with your depression that comes from loneliness. She started complimenting me and then I prompty developed a crush on her haha. She left so I've been without a therapist and have been doing poorly but they offered me a new one. I talked to her on the phone and I got a very different vibe from her. One of almost hostility. Maybe she will be different than I assume but I'm worried she will go back to the playbook of, you need to get out there. 

Have you ever talked to a professional about your loneliness and what was the result? Most of them can't relate or don't understand so they give the same advice they give everyone. Write your feelings down, stop negative self-talking, and go out more. My last therapist avoided doing that. If we had been together for a few more months, I could have begun to turn things around. Now it seems to back to the routine of cliche advice that is told because they don't understand or care about my situation. I know some of you posted about your experiences with hotlines and I had similar experiences but what about with professionals? Before someone says it, the other therapists didn't fail because I didn't want to change and if I had been lucky enough to keep my old therapist, I would have begun to change. She made me feel so good and I miss her every day. They never understood or cared. Has loneliness been a taboo topic to bring up with professionals?

1938,umv15p,sadkins2244,"Hey there, 

I'm an actor and student in the Columbus, Ohio, area, and I go to a community college in this area. It was primarily great throughout this first year, especially the last semester. (I moved here from a small town. now I live with an Uncle.)  I made some decent friends, got a well-paying job, found a mentor, and have taken on some training and projects in my field. On paper, things are/were going well. 

Well, about a month ago, I made a mistake that cost me my friends. I go to classes but sit alone while they have a good time; I'm no longer invited to things, and just overall lonely. 

On the contrary, at a university, I have friends (from my hometown before I moved) who cherish and miss me and have actively wanted me to go to school there with them. I told them probably after I got my associate's degree unless something bigger came up. Regardless, I love and miss them, and I love and miss the love they give me. 

Well, situation arose; my birth mom is homeless, and we're looking to live together. She is content with living anywhere. 

anywhere.

The college I'm interested in, starting a year lease while I finish my associate's degree, up to my hometown, Cleveland. Anywhere. 

So, I'm extremely lonely, and my heart longs for my best buds back, but I should PROBABLY stay here for another year where I essentially go to college for free, yeah? 


do I follow my brain or my heart? is my brain even correct in staying? they have good theatre programs there too. 

for further note. My best friend's partner (who goes to the school and enjoys my company during discord calls and stuff) asked to do a reading (tarot) on the situation. She pretty clearly read that going there would enact better and healthier self-growth. Of course, this could be wish fulfillment and not mean anything, but man, if the universe wants it... 

(I could also likely afford a one bedroom apartment if my mom decides to move elsewhere) 


tl;dr

 do I follow my brain or my heart? Do I move?",2022-05-10 22:48:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601611629,2,/r/lonely/comments/umv15p/transferring_colleges/,,0,0,Transferring Colleges

Loneliness is having no one to love you when you feel down, no one to support you when you're struggling, no one to help you up when you fall, and no one to encourage you when you feel discouraged. Loneliness is feeling completely and totally useless and unlovable because you are alone when near everyone else is surrounded by people who care for them.

Loneliness is not the main problem, it's merely a consequence of other underlying issues. Loneliness feels like you're lacking something: a touch, a hug, a conversation, a kiss, you name it. But ask yourself, why are you lacking that? Is it really because the world is an unfair place and nobody cares about you? Well, sort of, but not really. You feel lonely because you don't get what you want and what you need. Ask yourself why don't you get that? The answer to that will direct you to the real problem. Maybe it's because you're shy and don't hang out with a lot of people, or maybe there's something you say or do that sets others off to look away. Whatever the case, identifying it and working on solving it will bring you good fortune. It will allow you to show yourself better to others and tell them what you need, so that they can finally see you and be with together you.

So I go to them for advice on any romantic partners. My romantic life has been nothing but bread-crumbing since I was 17. Prom dates bailed before it happened. Went to college and got breadcrumbed all 4.5 years it took me to graduate. And even after with the girl I though was the one turned out to be a fun 2 year breadcrumb. I’ve asked their advice CONSTANTLY! About if these girls had actual interest (they assured me they did), what my situation was, and why they bread-crumbed me. I give them every detail and how it fell apart and they always determine that the girl was a horrible person and that I didn’t deserve to be treated that way and I did everything I could and more. 

Now I have a good career, I’m making money, I’ve got sone friends including them, I don’t think I’m bad looking, I exercise and try to eat right. Whenever I ask these two friends what’s wrong with me or what I can do to change and they always tell not to change and that it’s just the situation with todays girls or todays society treating me like crap. I’ve got two people who anybody would be lucky to go on a date with telling me this and it’s just like… really? If I’m such a great guy and have all these qualities then how come it’s always like this? Maybe I should just ask them out as a ruse and get them to fess up why they wouldn’t because seriously after 7 years of constant bs, All that talk has done is lower my opinion on dating; I’m literally thinking in my head anymore “ok… we hit it off real good, I’ll keep at it and hopefully this is the one but honestly wonder how long this one will breadcrumb me for?”",2022-05-11 00:35:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1635275337,7,/r/lonely/comments/umx61p/anybody_else_have_female_friends_that_do_this/,,0,37,Anybody else have female friends that do this?

I'll make small talk with people in class occasionally, and I'll joke around in class with people. But that's really about it. There's only two people who consider me to be their friend and who I ever hang out with outside of school. I'm good friends with them but to be honest it doesn't feel like I have stuff in common with them. Like we're friends by default. And for some reason it feels harder to make friends with those in the more advanced classes I take.

Back when I was a kid I made friends really easily.  I don't know how I did it. But ever since I was 10 something changed. I think I've lost about 6 friends from 2015- present because we simply drifted apart.

I'm not a weird kid. Like I don't feel like I'm off
putting to anybody. I think part of the reason is that I have a ton of social anxiety and I rarely talk to others. But even if I didn't have the anxiety I still don't know what I would talk about.

I tried to forget about the pain through fiction, but newer tragedies felt tame and pointless due to my familiarity with the darkness of ordinary people (who do bad things and get away with it due to hiding behind popularity though sarcasm and wit), and witty, snarky comedies felt even more pointless because I learned that most people joke about problems instead of fighting them head on.

I was in the dark for a very long time, but I stumbled upon Kingdom Hearts on PC and it somehow brought the light back into my life.

Through a combination of sympathetic characters, an ordinary, kind-hearted protagonist that anyone could to relate to, and a series of situations so absurd that there was no reason to not take them at face value...

So I'm not really sure how to describe my social life. I have a small group of actual friends, like 4 or 5 people, but have quite a few people I'm more like associates with? Idk how to explain it. But recently, as in last Friday, had a falling out with one of my actual friends. There was a lot of drama and it hurt but I'm not one to drag shit out and there a few years younger so it's for the best anyways I think. The issue is they act normal with my other friends, the ones they're friends with at least, and leave when I'm around(which is mostly aggravating just bc they're the one that caused the falling out I just accepted that they didn't want to be friends anymore). Because I don't want the falling out to effect my other friends, I just stay away completely and let the 3 or 4 hang out while I do my own thing. I've essentially just allowed the falling out with one friend, that wasn't my fault, to make it to where I can't hang out with my other friends. I haven't explained the drama to the other friends, just felt it was the best, and am probably just gonna slowly lose those friends as the year ends.

1986,un0yt7,DueDragonfruit2025,"TL;DR: Wake up, snooze. Wake up, go to work. Pay taxes, pay rent. Count pennies, stare at screens to escape reality. Cry on Reddit because you have nobody else, go to sleep. Repeat.

I don't even know why I'm writing this tbh. Was looking for painless ways to die and came across this subreddit, figured I might as well rant here since I have nobody I can really openly talk to about this topic.

I'll be graduating college soon in August after I finish out my minor. Only 3 years +2 summers for everything, with a full ride scholarship. It just makes me that much more ungrateful for even having thoughts about ending everything immediately after.

I have no direction from here. I spent the past half year trying to develop a business to provide some benefit to the world, but turns out the startup cost was way too high to really take the extreme risk. But fuck everything is more expensive these days. I spend my days working as a cog for Amazon, and with the hours they've been giving me, everything goes to rent gas and whatever other necessities.

My lease is up soon and new management will be increasing rent by $50 a month if I stay. Yay. More things I can't afford. The apartment isn't even that good, 550 sq feet and a studio apartment pretending to be a 1 bedroom. People yelling and ambulances going by every day. I'm just selling my soul to whatever work place so I can barely scrape by and live in a place I hate. 

The only thing I enjoy is playing games, escaping reality, but the more I play the more time is wasted and the more things pile up on the to do list. All I ever do is the to do list. I hate going out, my anxiety makes almost any social experience unenjoyable even if I put on a good outward experience. Combine that with no energy to ever do anything, it feels like I'm just dragging this chain and ball so that I can feed into the tax and corporate machines.

Hell, when I was exploring ways to die painlessly I was getting targeted ads for it. ""Need something to lift your spirits?"" Buy our product/service now! Hilarious.

The only time I've ever felt truly happy was on MDMA. Maybe occasionally on psychedelics too, but those are a wild card. I haven't done anything in a while because of time constraints and drug testing, but fuck for years the only thing I looked forward to was my semiannual Molly roll. 

I moved to the city I'm in now from a rural area for college, but I really made no friends in college. A few acquaintances, but nothing like I expected. Never got invited to any parties. Though I've learned to just blame the pandemic for that, even though it's definitely not the entire reason.

Of course, like anyone ever, I'd love to share real love with someone. Every relationship I've had I have had fleeting feelings, I always grew to find my partner more annoying. Maybe it's the people I was with, maybe it's me. 

I hate being a man sometimes, what I would give to have someone - anyone show interest first. If I even want a shot at feeling that way with someone, I have to initiate the idea. That means being rejected time and time again, and it's not like I'm unattractive, I've just always been the odd one and I think people pick up on that.

I think the only reason I'm still alive now is because of the unbearable pain my death would have on my mom. Everyone else would get over it eventually, but not her. Why does it seem that the only way I can find peace is by hurting who loves me most? You also can't shake the thought that you'll go to hell just for trying to escape it. Wouldn't that be funny if I left and ended up right back here.

Don't know what I'm expecting for posting this, but if you're reading this then thank you. It makes me feel like I exist, even if only through some text on a screen.",2022-05-11 04:01:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647243134,5,/r/lonely/comments/un0yt7/idek/,,0,3,idek

I'm so lonely and I don't know a lot of people in the city, plus my roomate seems so happy with her boyfriend. He really is an angel. Dating in the new city has been really hard as well. Well, dating since my breakup has been hard, I seem to get so stiff and rigid when I meet new boys and I feel like the lack of any emotional anchor in the new city has pulled me back to texting my ex boyfriend.

over  the years any irl friends i have had have naturally drifted apart due  to me not growing up and staying inside. For many years i had internet  friends who were part of my life even tho i didnt see them i'd  occasional chat to them which kinda felt like small version of a social  life. But slowly in the last few years ive ended up with none mainly due  to me burrowing into a hole and not responding for weeks or months.

Also  in the past few years ive lost both my grandparents making my family  smaller. i dont see my siblings due to them living far away and having  actual lives with a family .only family member i see routinely is my mum  (my dad died when i was 19 and i havent seen my dads side of the family  since 2010)

Now alot of that  stuff i've typed i had become kinda numb too. the losing both irl and  internet friends, family members dying, not havin a life etc. But coming  off my meds have made all those years of life problems come crashing  down to the point that i realise i have no future and any hope ive had  ive let fade away.

my mum wont be  here forever and i have no independence. I havent made my own family  like my siblings have so when my mum dies i'm on my own and i wont be  able to cope. I feel hopeless, lonely and keep crying thinking about my  life and how much ive wasted and ruined. I'm not sure if i could kill  myself but if anything happened to my mum (shes not ill but anyone can  die suddenly in their mid 50's)  especially with how my life is now  i'd  be on my own and i think that would be the end of me 100%.

2041,unai74,LightningPhoenixx,"So i dont know where to start. I just haven't had luck with anything, especially dating... It just always ends up in rejection or in the rare few cases I had with someone (years ago) just ends plain wrong... With people who cheat on me, or if it's online, ditching me before we meet, or they won't send get too close and allresdy have someone and just never intended to be with me except a short fling,but won't say so until it's too late, etc. I wonder what the hell is wrong with me. Am I that damn ugly? That boring? That stupid?

Everyone just tells me I'm fine, but to stop looking for someone and to just focus on myself and to just go and keep going to a psychotherapist, and that's fine, I suppose I do need help, but I just feeel incredibly lonely and I'm so damn tired that I just can't have someone that likes me.

And I stopped looking for a long while. I tried focusing on myself, it seemed to get better, I actually found someone I really liked, by chance, online. 

We just hanged out etc, played games online most of the days etc, and she's lonely too, but she does not wanna start a relationship more than friendship cause of the distance. I understand, it can hurt and just be awful to not be able to be close. But my heart is just tired.. The one person I click with, and that is genuinely nice and honest, is unreachable, and I can't get a chance. I'm just losing it, I just give up at this point. 

I know I might be unreasonable, but I just feel purely like shit, like noone likes me more than friends, sometimes I just wish I wasn't born as a guy,feeling so undesired, or just born period. Life just feels so pointless, the hobbies I got are gaming and cars, gaming is getting boring, and fun cars I like are just too expensive... And they get more expensive. And everthing else does too, making saving for one so hard..I just go to work and hoping for things will never happen.....life seems like repeat and just pointless and lonely.Especially when noone wants to actually be with me. 

At this point I am desperate for something shallow even, with any girl, just to feel wanted and to fill that hole in my heart a little...and I know that is probably wrong way to think... But I just don't know how to feel anymore, I just want some love, or excitement I guess. And I feeel like it makes me a bad person. But I can't shake it off either. I'm just tired.

2062,unfqke,ThatMysteriousDude2,"I'm a 23 yr old and it's been 7 years of loneliness for me and here are the reasons that caused it:
1. I listened to society and thought that money was everything.
2. Because of point 1 I stopped socialising much and focused on how to get rich.
3. Realised that it wasn't in my fate because all the ways I kept trying went against me. Incurred losses.
4. Above points made me more of a pessimist and anti-social. People found me to be uninteresting.
5. Now I want to change, but I have lost the ability to make conversation and I'm socially awkward.

Changes observed:
1. Initially it was comfortable and peaceful when I was full of hope. When all plans were shattered, I became depressed.
2. Cried myself to sleep for maybe 3 years straight.
3. Motivated myself to try and change. Tried socialising but I had already lost the skill. Nobody found me interesting, nobody wanted to hangout with me.
4. Back to crying myself to sleep for an entire year.
5. The phase of acceptance. I don't have a proper mood anymore. I put on a poker face at all situations now whether it's the boss making a joke or watching an emotional movie, etc. I don't remember the last time I laughed my heart out. Nothing seems funny anymore, nothing seems sad as well. Thoughts about looking after myself all alone in old age keep coming in my head.
6. I had one crush in school, to whom I never confessed my feelings. Since then I haven't felt the same towards any other person although I keep passing by a ton of them everyday at work and in the gym. Looks like I have become completely desensitised. A living stone.",2022-05-11 17:54:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652195163,4,/r/lonely/comments/unfqke/7_years_of_loneliness/,,0,0,7 years of loneliness.
2063,unfzev,lilylealin,"Loneliness is horrifying. It is one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced. When I'm lonely I feel like the world resents me. Like I have no worth to other people and no inherent worth as well. The fact that I (feel like I) am worthless makes me afraid. I fear spending the rest of my life alone. I fear what my worthlessness might mean for my life; that no one will ever love me and that I will always be unhappy like this. At the same time, I believe that I don't deserve more than that anyway. I hate the person I am, I feel unlovable, like I'm a human black hole that is unable to offer anything to others, which gives them no reason to love me or appreciate me. 

I often resent myself for feeling lonely and being where I am relationship-wise. I percieve it as a weakness, a sign that I'm incompetent, pathetic, stupid, cringe. I'm a grown ass woman. How the fuck have I not learned to manage my relationship yet? What the fuck am I doing with my life? I'm furious at myself. 

I've been feeling like that for a long time. I spiral. It gets bad. I've tried to change, I've tried so many things. For years. The loneliness - most of the time it didn't go away. But over time there's been some progress. I have days when I'm doing better and I put myself out there more. I small-talk with strangers and it feels pleasant. I initiate a conversation with a coworker or say hi to someone that I usually wouldn't. I still feel lonely frequently and I feel unhappy with the relationships (or the lack of them) in my life. But on good days I believe there is hope. Hope that there is a time in the future where things are different. Where I am different and the people I surround myself with are different. 

I'm know I'm not the only one feeling this way and I know I'm not the only one trying to climb out of this state of isolation or loneliness. I've been reading posts on this subbredit for years. And I see that we share the struggle. We all hurt, feel angry or resentful towards others or ourselves, sometimes we feel optimistic and willing to try different things, and sometimes we feel empty and hopeless. We have a lot in common. I know your pain and you know mine.

Although I regret there is so many people that feel the way I do, maybe something good could come out of this.  Because the fact that we all share this profound experience can mean that we can understand each other on a profound level, in a way that other people who haven't walked in our shoes don't. I've have suffered in silence and dealt with this on my own for a long time and I know many of you have as well.  And many of you also know that living alone with a pain no one can understand and without anyone to confide in can make a lonely person feel even more lonely.  

Which is why I am starting a loneliness support group. I want to create a place where we can talk about the loneliness and truly be heard, where we don't get patronising advice from people that think they know us and know how we feel (but actually don't), a place where your experience isn't invalidated and your pain isn't downplayed, a place where we can simply be who we are, feel what we feel, be angry what we're angry about, or sad about what we're sad about.

If this post resonates with you and you're interested in joining the group (currently there's 3-4 of us), please message me privately.

As the Mental Health Week of this year has the loneliness theme I thought it would be nice to make a post on this subreddit, just to lay out some information and websites' links that may be helpful. 


&gt; “Being vulnerable is actually a strength and not a weakness — that’s why more and more mental health is such an important thing to talk about. It’s the same as being physically sick. And when you keep all those things inside, when you bottle them up, it makes you ill.”
– Cara Delevingne


&gt; “You are the one thing in this world, above all other things, that you must never give up on. When I was in middle school, I was struggling with severe anxiety and depression and the help and support I received from my family and a therapist saved my life. Asking for help is the first step. You are more precious to this world than you’ll ever know.”
– Lili Reinhart


&gt; “I found that with depression, one of the most important things you can realize is that you’re not alone. You’re not the first to go through it, you’re not gonna be the last to go through it.”
– Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson

&gt; #**How to cope with loneliness**

1. Try to do some enjoyable things that will keep you busy 

One way of trying to manage loneliness is by keeping busy and doing things we enjoy. This might be a hobby such as a bit of gardening, going to the gym or even sorting out your kitchen cupboards, jigsaws, puzzles or knitting. Small activities can give you energy and positive feelings. It’s important these things are fun or fulfilling.
Be careful about working too hard or watching TV shows simply as a distraction. These will only delay or suppress your feelings and could actually make your mental health worse.

2. Try to do things that stimulate your mind 

Activities that occupy your mind can help with loneliness. This can include the  benefits of taking courses or listening to podcasts on topics from comedy to fitness. This can be stimulating and something as simple as listening to the familiar voice of someone you like can help you feel less lonely.

3. Think about doing a physical activity 

Physical exercise can help with loneliness. It can be as simple as having a walk in the park when you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. Alternatively, you could listen to music and do a bit of dancing around your living room. (Be aware of your neighbours though!) 

4. Try to engage with the people you meet in your daily life. 

It can be hard to talk to others when you’re feeling lonely. However, trying to connect with the people you meet as you go about your day can be helpful. Even catching someone’s eye and saying “hi” as you walk along can make you feel better. Or it could be about saying hello to the postwomen or postman or going to the shops and talking to the person at the checkout. By sharing a polite greeting – you might find you give someone else a positive lift too.

5. Find people that ‘get you’ 

It can be hard to connect with others when you’re feeling lonely. But there are great benefits in finding people who have been through similar experiences to you. Interacting with others that ‘get’ you can give you a sense of belonging that may be missing. People who have been there have found connections in local groups or social media.

6. Spend time with pets 

If you are lucky enough to have a pet, it can be a great way of managing loneliness. Not only do animals provide us with unconditional love and support, but they also help to give structure to our days and even encourage us to get out and connect with others. Interaction with pets is also shown to help reduce stress levels.

7. Try to use social media in a positive way 

Social media can help your mental health. But it can also affect it negatively. The key is to use it in a positive way. Finding digital  communities, you share interests and passions with can help. Most importantly be aware of how you feel when you use social media and focus on topics and activities that work best for you.

8. Talking therapies can help 

Talking through your feelings with a counsellor or therapist can help you cope with your feelings of loneliness. Talking therapy can be hard to get – but if you can find a professional, it can really be of benefit. It’ll provide you with a safe space to work through your feelings and thoughts without judgement. 




&gt; #**How to support other people who are feeling lonely**

1. Don’t judge or stigmatise

It’s important not to judge or stigmatise people who feel lonely. Stigma around loneliness is a huge barrier to the kind of open and genuine conversations that can help. It’s more important to be aware of just how common loneliness is. It’s a normal feeling that all of us are likely to experience at some time in our lives. Telling other people that their poor mental health is the reason why they are feeling lonely is really not helpful.

2. Try to make groups welcoming to other people

It can be difficult for people who are feeling lonely to join a group like a club. This might be because people are shy or feel nervous about existing relationships in the group which they don’t feel part of. It’s important to be aware of this and try to make groups be as welcoming as possible to newcomers. Flexibility around things like how often people attend is also important.

3. Try to listen and show understanding

A great way to help a friend or family member is simply to listen. People who have experienced loneliness relate how they valued friends who really considered what they might enjoy and were even willing to join them in some shared activities. Having an understanding and compassionate approach, and not ignoring the person’s experience, will help them to feel heard and understood.

If you want to see more of these advices there's more here: https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week


I found this site below quite helpful as well, you can see loads of more information and even support:
https://www.mind.org.uk/get-involved/mental-health-awareness-week/#info

There's a suicidal training I've done in class today that gives us more insight and information about how we can help and support these people.
That's the link:
https://zsa.frank-cdn.uk/scorm/full-training/story.html

If I learnt something I'd say it's that you don't need to keep all to yourself, open up about your feelings.
You'll feel more relieved and less overwhelmed after doing so.

If you ever spot on someone that has been showing concerning signs, no need to beat around the bush out of fear of saying the word 'suicide'. 
Simply ask ""Are you feeling suicidal?""
According to the training once you say it directly you show that you're open minded enough not to judge this person, thus making them open up more.

Well, there's a lot more actually....
If you're interested, take part in the short training by clicking on the last link I've typed. 

Hope y'all have a lovely week and that these links may be useful for someone. :)",2022-05-11 21:23:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647209681,2,/r/lonely/comments/unke2x/mental_health_awareness_week_2022_theme_loneliness/,,0,0,Mental Health Awareness Week 2022 - Theme: Loneliness
2089,unkevv,No_body7,"I am so lonely in school. I have no friends. I have no one that wants to talk to me. Of course it doesn't help that I am quiet and socially awkward, but when I do try and socialise I get the vibe that the other person doesn't want to talk to me, and they think I am weird, so I just give up socialising. 

Sometimes there are successful interactions, but then other days those people act like I don't exist or they switch up and completely ignore me when their other friends show up, and I just become the third wheel. Sometimes at lunch I would just hang out and wait in the bathroom stalls, just because I have no one to talk to. I know its sad. Its not like anyone really texts me and hangs out with me outside of school either, I have no social life, I only know these people and talk to them because I happen to be in their classes.

I don't know, the loneliness has just been hitting me hard lately, I just needed to vent on reddit, cause I have no one in real life to properly talk to. Most people will probably ignore this post anyway, I don't blame you. I am used to being ignored and forgotten about, by my friends and classmates, teachers, even family sometimes. I know part of that is my fault, cause who is gonna wanna talk to the guy that never talks? Nobody likes me, but I don't think anybody hates me either, I am just there, a background character, an NPC. Sometimes I am jealous of those people who have friends, who are loud and confident and have all the attention on them, but at the same time it makes me hate them and myself even more, I know its a very toxic mindset. 

Some of my 'friends' have joked that I am depressed cause I have become more and more withdrawn over the past few months, and I always have a gloomy look on my face. I sometimes entertain the 'joke', but I won't self diagnose myself with anything, all I know is that I am lonely, and I have really low self esteem, and that makes me feel down a lot of the time.

It doesn't matter anymore anyway, school literally finishes for me in under 2 months, and I won't ever see any of these people again. Nothing I do will change my position now, so I will just see it out, besides why should I care about people that don't care about me?",2022-05-11 21:24:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623357986,16,/r/lonely/comments/unkevv/school_is_a_very_lonely_place/,,0,6,School is a very lonely place

2098,unmgln,No-Philosophy9670,"EDIT: it’s easy to find someone to talk to online but I want a deep face to face friendship 

I’m from and live in London. I’m 28F. Since 18 I’ve been trying to make friends and failed. I have one person who talks with me occasionally but that’s the closest to a friend I have. I constantly go out and meet new people hoping I click with someone. I rarely reach out to people because I felt we didn’t click but also I noticed no one has ever reached out to me. I have tried to reach out to a few in the past and been ghosted, or been rejected when offering to meet/do something 

I wonder if it is to do with my lack of interests/anxiety. When I got anxiety at 18 I lost interest in all my hobbies. I can still do things now and get some joy but there is nothing I’m passionate about like how I used to be back when I had friends. I also don’t have experience with men so wonder if that makes women less likely to identify with me 

I get so lonely constantly checking my phone for messages. All I have are messages from the group chats I’m in which are for friendships. The only way I can socialise is meeting some new for the first time. Because then neither of us know each other but after the first meet they wont  reach out to me again so I can only rely on meeting new people to have a social life and it’s very lonely .

i just turned 18 a bit ago and i feel like a loser. i can’t keep any friends no matter how hard i try. people have been avoiding me and ignoring me constantly. if i’m not being ignored, i’m being made fun of. after 7 full years of being treated like shit, i looked for ways to cope. i’ve been cutting myself since fifth grade just to make myself feel something. but recently i’ve been feeling too much. so 4 months ago i turned to weed and alcohol instead of cutting myself. i’ve been forcing myself to feel nothing at all. i hate being sober. i can’t go to school without smoking or drinking first. i have to use that to motivate me to keep going.  

i hoped it would help me forget bad memories, but that’s the one thing it hasn’t done. i feel numb but then i remember everything. i have to live in this fucking house with the man that’s been abusing me for years while my mom turns a blind eye. but you have to live the life of your dreams at some price, right? i guess her price was me. because while i’m smoking and drinking all the time to make myself forget what he’s doing almost every day, she’s shopping for herself and my siblings and pretending i dont exist. i feel like they think i’m a figment of their imagination. i’m not real to them. to her, i’m cash in her pocket and to him i’m just someone he can use when moms not home. i don’t want to die but i don’t want to be here and i don’t know how to get away",2022-05-11 23:10:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651375447,2,/r/lonely/comments/unmnxx/im_not_real_to_them/,,0,5,i’m not real to them

2111,unoy3i,TrashBeastAfterDark,"This is gonna be a long one but I just need to vent a bit. I have been feeling lonely since I gave birth almost 5 months and a half ago.The delivery busted me up and due to a misunderstandings and events that happened during my stay at the hospital, the staff called youth protection on me and took my baby away from me before I even leaved the hospital thinking I am a “risk of neglect” to my son instead of sitting down with me and help me with the killer migraines and give me services as a first time single parent.I have been fighting to get him back but the judge never heard my testimony and placed my son in foster care until August so that I can work on my parenting skills,support network and anxiety. Since then, my parenting skills have improved, my support network has been pretty solid enough and I am seeing a therapist and take anxiety pills. I lost a ton of weight to the point where I am skinnier then I was before I got pregnant and felt great about myself. I have been feeling lonely and I wanted to come out of my shell and wanted to meet people maybe a friends with benefits sorta thing but most of my conversations online has came up empty.I either get ghosted,we don’t vibe or I get red flags by some. Im not ugly,I am aware that it is an acquired taste for someone to have attraction to a transman and being a single parent doesn’t help.I knew what I signed up for when I first transitioned 10 years ago and having a child.I don’t expect anyone to parent or care for my son. I tried to distract myself during my parental leave with projects like renovations and gardening etc. But on the days where I can relax and get high, I get horny and lonely.Im not ugly at least to me,I have a large house and my dream cars etc but I have no one to share that with.My “maternal instincts” are kicking me in the ass and have no one to care for to fill that void in my heart that youth protection did to me.My mother is in Ontario taking care of my grandma, my son is in foster care 54km away from my house until August hopefully and my friend I used to spend a lot of time before my pregnancy has recently been diagnosed with a genetic muscle dystrophy disease that prevent him from coming over to my place due to stairs and they are so busy with appointments. I want companionship, heck if things would work out I willing to let whoever live with me if things go well.

College started at age 17 to 19, lost 90% of my friends in high school but still had most of my close friends.

Got to university at 19 where I am now 20 years old losing all my friends, havent made any new friend.

I didnt lose these people because of disputes or anything like that, they all just went their own way  whilst I left my self on this lonely path. 

I dont known what I've done wrong in my life but opportunities that people have that promote friendships, I feel like I just don't get. 1st year of university was mid covid, so lost out on a key time to make friends. 2nd year I'm in a cycle of requiring friends to get friends. I hate parties and thats what feels like everyone want to do but I see 0 enjoyment out of it. A small group of close friends is prefect for me but I can get their without friends themselves.

2130,unrlkg,LilBeaverMaster,"Being lonely obviously takes a hefty mental toll on people, but damn even expecting the emotions doesn't help and the physical loss is just as bad as the mental trouble. Often I feel like I imagine fake scenarios and think too much into stuff just to make myself feel better. There's a girl in my 6th period and she's nice and pretty cute, but even if I asked her out it would be kinda pointless for a couple reasons, like how she's graduating and I'm not. Although I'm pretty sure she likes me, just based on how often I catch her staring and stuff, and even today she went completely out of her way just to talk to me for a minute and she had to sprint off for class. But I think being lonely might be causing me to look too far into it and see things that aren't there and that she's probably just being nice and friendly and that I'm just desperate. 

Am I dumb? Am I overthinking about my overthinking? Does she like me? Idk more of a rant about how tired and confused I am and about how loneliness is effecting my mental health and physical friendships. Any advice on how to overcome this or even any answers to my other questions would be appreciated.",2022-05-12 03:25:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1559465843,2,/r/lonely/comments/unrlkg/driving_myself_nuts/,,0,1,Driving myself nuts

I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2-3 months now and he works late night jobs. It didn’t seem to be a problem when we first started talking, in fact I would wake up to him saying good morning and stuff. But lately, he’s been so quiet, will even go days without saying hey. I get it, I’m 22, I work too. I stress about money and bills too. I don’t blame him for that. I just know that you can take even a second out of your day to say what’s up and let the other person you’ll be busy. I told him that this makes me feel forgotten about and I’ve talked to so many guys who have done the same before him and everything just fizzled out. I am so tired of this happening, getting invested and then ditched. Due to my bad track record with dating guys I’ve learned to talk to a person but sorta be standoffish until I’m sure we’re gonna move to the next step. I told him so much about me and he made me feel happy again. I just hate that this is how my love life goes… even when I take measures not to dive heart first into situations, I still hurt In the end. He sent me a text telling me “if you have faith in us you would get used to me not being around that much”. This sounds like a red flag to me…. I guess I know I should just cut all contact but I don’t want to be alone again… there’s no feeling I hate more. Either way: with or without I feel crummy.

Deep down I knew I wasnt worthy of anything and no people would like to have me around, so wearing a mask and make them happy was a good way to be accepted, and it worked alot.

When I grew older, I started facing constant cheating from all sides: girls, friends, almost everyone. My closest of friends told me I have to be myself, and after so long I started being me.

Today I dont know if it was a good idea, since now I have less than 5 people to talk with, and the last relationship I had was about 5 years ago, when I tried to be the more honest.

It was exactly as I thought it would be: being myself would make me lonely. There were weeks that I dont trade one meaningful word with someone.

I realise looking at 90’s or 2000s videos and while it’s not a complete representation, people seem to be much happier. Reading articles, families had stronger bonds, people had more friends, a better social life, just overall happier. 

I wonder how did this happen, tech that connected all of us, now suddenly threw us into this dark abyss where you have billions of acquaintances but 0 friends. 

It’s partially my fault as I am not the type to seek out friendships or even maintain them, but hell realising I am 25 and I only have 1 friend that doesn’t even live in the same country as I do is depressing and makes you feel isolated. 

It’s also the people around seem to just go about their day like robots and there is very little interaction to go around to build a connection. I heard people used to have conversations on bus rides. Why are we like this now? I wish I lived in the older times so I at least built the social skills needed to be able to connect easily in person.

Is it that in the old times it was so hard you had to build these connections as it was important for survival and building your social status, and we always wanted to be alone but not lonely in the first place?

2174,unz9p5,Ok-Assistant169,"Hi all,

Sorry for the long and ranty post. Summer is around the corner, and although I (35m) have got a full-time job and a girlfriend, I am starting to feel lonely. In a way, I am even feeling guilty for feeling lonely. My fully remote job does not bring many interactions, and my girlfriend always seems busy. Her schedule is always full, and she is often working extra hours. For some reason, new things keep popping up, and she has to resolve those issues. I have got to give it to her, she is in a leadership role, so I guess being involved is fair. It is just that I feel like the household tasks are left for me to resolve, and this contributes to my loneliness. We should be a team, and I am also working a full-time job. I am not in the office, but that does not make my job less important. She says she is sorry for leaving all the tasks up to me, but her apologies feel empty. If you are truly sorry, you will try to make things better.

Another annoyance is that I'm always working from the sofa. We own a pretty small home, and my girlfriend claimed our home office. She needs a professional and quiet place for all the (private) videoconferences she has to make. Even when she is in the office, I will be on the sofa to care for our pets. I do the daily walks with the dog. I watch our chickens and make sure they do not fall prey.

Furthermore, I realized I was lonely when we went to throw a party, and I did not know whom to invite. My girlfriend had invited 30+ people, and I only invited my brother. I've had some high school friends up to 15-years ago, but they are no longer friends due to mental health problems. I'm not very confident, and chatting with strangers is not my idea of fun, and I am not even sure I am capable of it. Also, I'm an introvert with (I believe) a big heart, but maintaining relationships is not one of my strong points. Of course, there is a want, but I have no clue where and how to meet new people (friends).

I know I should probably snap out of this victim role and take control of my life instead of having things happen to me. The problem is that I don't know how and where to start. The post is probably more a rant than allowing myself to receive help, but I just wanted to get this off my heart.

Thank you for reading my post :)",2022-05-12 11:51:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652355369,9,/r/lonely/comments/unz9p5/everything_seems_good_from_the_outside/,,0,2,Everything seems good from the outside

I’m still gonna be the same pussy ass bitch I’ve always been, she’s gonna be the same beautiful girl who’s so far above me that she can’t even see me. Nothing changes. And I mean nothing, because I’m even still gonna be pining over her so much that it aggravates my depression same as I am now, and it’s gonna make me less productive academically same as it’s done this semester. I’ll still be wishing that she’d either want me too or that I could stop wanting her, cuz the asymmetry is unbearable.

This is so stupid. This is all so utterly absurd. The fact that I can feel _this_ bad over a girl I don’t even fucking know is insane. I hate this so fucking much.

but then when i actually am alone it's sad, i hate it and i just spend time trying to avoid thinking. i guess i get what i deserve tho. on the one hand my deepest desire is to have even a single meaningful connection, on the other it seems i can't stand anyone, especially those who are closer to me.

2215,uo7zjp,delicoban33,"Warning: If you are in an emotional state, dont read. This post might make you even more upset.

We either have to keep our self respect rules strict and show zero weakness to anyone and feel lonely inside,

Or we try to interact with people, show all our love to people maybe we will receive love, maybe not.

Showing someone attention is a risky investment. If your investment fails, you will lose some of your capital (self respect).
Keeping your self respect rules strict is not that easy. You will get respect from people. It will take time. You will witness people that will invest in you for your attention. They will talk to you. It will be up to you to respond to these investments. But you need to be patient and emotionally strong until you start getting attention.

Other option sounds easy, but it is like spending your savings. People can smell neediness so easily. Trading your credits for some smile until it depletes. When you don't have anymore credits people will ignore you. Your social status decreases. 

Conclusion
I know this sounds so materialistic. But these are my observations. We can't beat loneliness by trying to find new friends. We need to change how we interact with people. We need to spend time with ourselves for some time. Percieved social status has so much importance and it is all connected with loneliness.",2022-05-12 18:43:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1515850303,6,/r/lonely/comments/uo7zjp/loneliness_is_the_price_we_pay_for_respect/,,0,2,Loneliness is the price we pay for respect.

Everyone was really intimidating and I couldn’t see myself fitting in at all with anyone, only just 1-2 people, and even then, I don’t know. I saw my therapist yesterday and she recommended I actually make an account and give it a shot.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. One day I’ll be head over heels for someone and then the next I forget why I even liked them in the first place. I’m not used to people liking me back and I think I get too scared and just flip a switch in my brain to run. I push people away so fast and it’s terrible.

And. I don’t have any fucking experience. It’s so humiliating. My longest relationship was maybe a week or two at most. I haven’t even kissed anyone, and I’m 21. I’m so fucking scared to admit this to anyone, because I’m not interesting, I’m barely keeping myself alive, and I’m so fucked up by anxiety and depression that I don’t even know if I’d be good or fair to them. I don’t want someone to like me and, even as much as I would want to, I couldn’t give them that in return. 

But the longer I keep waiting the worse it gets. But I’ve already waited so long that it’s nearly impossible.

I don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out. My therapist didn’t say I had to, obviously, but I just don’t know if anything will come out of this. I feel like I’m just going to hurt other people in an effort to fix myself. I don’t think that’s fair. Maybe I’m just doomed to be alone.

Another thing is I move around too much. I’ll be across the country for months at a time, but never a full year. I want something long lasting and I can’t do distance. But I can’t keep waiting longer. I’m losing my mind. It’s so fucking hard and I hate that my life is in this situation. I wish I wasn’t here.

Then, I spend days and even months without talking to anyone and when I have to, I almost have panick attacks. Some days ago, I had to talk to a client to make sure I understood the job he needed me to do, and I spent almost three hours writing an email because I was failing to find the right words for it. 

Some weeks ago, I had to talk to a supermarket employee and I kept making eye contact with him, not knowing if it was appropriate or not, but I just couldn't stop looking into his eyes. I also didn't know how to keep a good posture, so I kept moving my legs and touching my face all the time while I talked to him. I guess he noticed because I felt he was a little uncomfortable. I had zero interested in him, I just didn't know how to act while I talked to him.

Besides, I lately have been avoiding listening to music that has lyrics. I just can't stand people talking near me anymore, not even if they are singing, so I just listen to instrumental music.

2295,uoi2eg,SimpleHuge,"Throughout my life I have been extremely codependent on others to help me through what I have recently discovered is an abnormally high anxiety. I have a solid understanding of myself. I know that my codependence was escapism from facing myself. I no longer hate myself and on most fronts forgive myself for who I have been. I finally had healthy and open communication with girls I had an awkward history with this past month (after a 7 and 1/2 year relationship with extremely poor communication. One that led to self hatred). I don't use any substances or alcohol.

I have been moving forward as tenaciously as possible. I have changed the kind of music I listen to to be upbeat and instead of imagining myself to be some pittiable decrepit mass atop an ocean of regret I imagine that I am dancing with all of the people in my life (yes these are actually the visuals I use to imagine myself).

I am doing everything in my power to do what I can for myself without relying on that same codependence that led to destroying my relationships with the people in my life I cared about. I overcame my bitter feelings and became friends with my exes new boyfriend (we are coworkers) and accepted that he's genuinely a good dude. I listen to my roomate laughing and talking with the girl who rejected me every day because the walls are thin and I think that's just been reminding me of how lonely I am. I don't put myself out there and I work a graveyard shift. Anchorage, Alaska sucks for meeting people.

During my last relationship I had the realization that if she left I would be totally alone....and that's where I am now. I have my dog, I chat with strangers at the dog park. I'm 1,300 miles from where my family is. I go to work, I come home, I take my dog out a few times, I get to my couch and do it all over again every day.

I do go out occasionally but I'm so terrible at anything outside of meaningless small talk. Sitting at home nightly alone is taking it's toll. The thing is, before my last relationship I was very happy being alone. Now that she left; the girl that made me realize I was missing something in life that she filled in; all I can do is notice the empty feeling from the lack of companionship.

When I was 24 I was quite content with my life as a single guy, never having had a lovelife before, I'd been infatuated, just never had an actual partner. Then I met this girl, who fell for me. I wasn't really interested to a start and kind of wanted to save her from who I was. After a few months I took her out on a date, got to know her over a while, and fell hard. In the end the pandemic happened and things went sideways for us. She awoke something in me, taught me what I truly wanted. A partner in life, someone to share all my daily struggles or wins with, holidays and vacations, start a family, build a dream with.   


Now its been almost a year since. And I cant shake this feeling of crippling loneliness. I cant even find a date and I cant either stop thinking that I wont find happiness in someone else, that I must learn to be content by myself, but I dont know how to feel like that anymore.

2336,uolsmy,Queasy-Jury366,"26M.So I'm sorry bout the long post that's gonna follow but I just need to tell some1 my story and since I got none in my life that's actually gives a fuck Imah just tell you guys instead.Never had any problem socializing being around ppl havin convos etc. Always was kind and compassionate to every1 would always extend my hand to help to pretty much about any.Was taught to love and see the good in people and doing the best I can for my friends or partners.But sadly people won't have the same mindset as you do or your pure intentions.Long story short since I was 17 till now Ilevery simply put me on sidelines for one reason or another went to college to army did my masters still nobody relevant came to my life or stayed had life a gf some kind of frie ds but nothing really that stocked through. Just the friends you have to get ur time by nothing with actually meaning.The result of ppl taking advantage of me being kind and naive also combined with the other struggles I've had from work uni etc put me in severe depression, anxiety, stress to the point of loosing my sleep the last 3 years barely 5hrs a day always feeling tired legs shaking.Draging my self throughout the day overthinking at night. Maybe I'm at fault maybe it's just not meant to be.Shit has taken a huge toll on my mental health a d physical one I barely eat or drink water just smoking all day and it have a big impact on my job I'm an engineer almost losing it cause I just can't get focused. Too much shit too think and worry bout and nobody to share with.People just wont stick up with me appera tly even though I show care and love always Idk I just can't hate any or not care if I see some1 struggling.Puting the fake smile and the I'm fine suit but nobody really asks how ur day was had ppl telling me im cool funny and shit and my looks are decent just can't find any1.The pain and struggle lately became so hard to the point I just couldnt stay home walls were suffocating me.Also being in love with some1 that you know it ain't gonna happen just makes it twice harder that it already is.Just hoping it will get better.So to any1 that made it here thank you so much and sorry for the long post but I just had to share my erratic thoughts.Only show love ppl and if you see some1 struggling help em don't em alone.Big hugs to everyone that may need em",2022-05-13 06:51:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642156693,2,/r/lonely/comments/uolsmy/a_storybeing_on_the_brink_rn_long_post/,,0,0,A story.Being on the brink rn long post

I wish I went out more or at least I wish I had the confidence to go out. They invited to cool places and I would always make up some excuse. Even with my close friends that I’ve know for years. I feel like I can never be fully close with someone because of my lack of confidence. I can never overcome it no matter how fun the trip is. 

My mom hates me for that. She’s always asking me why I don’t go out with her or why I just don’t go out with the family. She thinks it’s because I wanna stay home and play video games, but I couldn’t care less about that. I can’t keep living like this.

If any of you who is trying to make friends with me wants an ongoing better conversation with me, you’d have to at least have a very big interest in video games. Not saying I can’t be friends with anyone who does not play video games but it helps the conversation better. I play different video games and if any of you are interested in getting to know me more/want to have a conversation with me, send me a private message and I’ll try to get back to any of you who sends me a message whenever I get the chance to.

You don’t talk one on one, you mostly talk when in a group with other people.

Stage 2:
You now start talking one on one, start complimenting eachother, and just being kind to one another.

Stage 3:
You now start to mock and criticise eachother a lot, and saying things like “i dont give a fuck” (I saw a post here about someone achieving a lot on Mario Kart 8 and his friends not caring). Also, that kindness starts to dissapear.

This is how most of my friendships played out. It has always felt difficult to transition from stage 2 to stage 3.

2361,uopxgo,Just_Breezy_132,"I, 18F with autism, ptsd, anxiety and depression, don’t think I no longer feel comfortable with the group I’m currently with. Perhaps I could’ve caused all this or it’s just tough luck for me since my history seems to be repeating itself, I just wish I was a senior so I can leave school. It’s been going on for too long I just don’t think my group is worth fighting for anymore.

-I’ll start with the recent person who’s just screwing up my life, let’s call him Nick. So Nick has always taken things too personally even when nobody had bad intentions. So Idk where it started but whenever anyone mentions Nick being single, he takes it way too personally. Not just that but one time a close friend called him Kiddo and he got offended because “he hated kids” or something like that. So one time we went to the extra mile, me and four others, including Nick and another person I’ll talk about here. So we went to get some Pizza Hut and I just goofed around and jokingly tell Nick that he looked hungry, I said that like three or four times but on the last time, he kept calling me a bitch even when I asked him not to and he said that he wished me and my (now ex) bf would break up, then right after he’s saying that I should defend myself but like why should I, he’s throwing all these insults at me and in the meantime, let’s call him Julius, was just sitting there doing nothing. Before that he was actually trying to bodyshame me but that never really got to me because I didn’t really care much about how my body is, but now I do. So I was at an urge of a panic attack so I had to leave, My two other friends were out of earshot so they never heard what he said. So there was this google doc us friends shared with each other and Nick was telling me to defend myself. So after that weekend we went to a teacher’s class in the morning and another friend said “if anyone needs me to kill anyone let me know” (we’re like a group of “band kids” who like a bit of dark humor) and Nick just straight up said “Kill Breezy for me” then that triggered a really bad panic and my other friend came to comfort me. So I replied to the google docs, and then he starts apologizing, saying he isn’t aware of what he says, then a week later I eventually forgived him after Julius invited him to help out at our work for something without thinking of what would happen. So like we have the same 6th period and it was probably shortly after we made up and then everything seemed fine then he was looking at some drawings through his Twitter account and there was this one drawing a two girls kissing this one dude and I thought it was his drawing and I was going to ask him something but I said that it was probably best I didn’t ask him because I had a feeling it would probably hurt him, then he starts insisting that I should ask him anyways and I told him no and he told me to do it. All I asked was “Are you lonely?” And idk what he said after but he was like you don’t know what’s it like to be single or something like that, he seemed pretty fine with it. So next morning, he started acting upset especially at me, my ex went to go talk to him, then at lunch my ex went up to me and said I told Nick something and that I should think before I speak, I DID, then he told me to apologize to him and I did through email. Honestly at this point I have a feeling this could be why he broke up with me, I’ve mentioned this in a post in another subreddit. Alright so maybe a couple days later, Nick replied exactly “…Just… Leave me… Alone…” and that’s where I see that this one friend who moved away was right, he’s an “anime protagonist” so I told him I will, and he replied say “then do it” I’ve always respected his space and all, then a week later, this dude has the audacity to send me the same email twice saying “btw, congratulations on becoming single, that’s karma. P.s. I still hate you.” Like I don’t get it, I’ve always respected him and gave him space, and this is what I get in return, it’s so ridiculous and immature, I ignored him anyway. Then week later at game club, he was there and I did my best not to cross paths with him but we were playing smash. Then after one of the rounds ended he said that I deserved death and that caused another panic attack and Eli had to comfort me. So I told the counselors about all this that has been happening. So nowadays this dude had the audacity to act like he never did anything wrong and acts all innocent, he avoids the group because I’m with them but I’ve been drifting away and then suddenly he comes back to them like he’s “stealing them” from me. Like it’s freaking redonculous, two of my friends seems to agree with me when I told them about this. And like he also said that he would leave me alone, he doesn’t respect my space even though I’ve respected his.

-another friend, Julius, I no longer feel comfortable getting close to or talking to because he put me in a choke hold once though he said “he forgot” and touched me a couple of times, not any private parts though. One time when my ex and I are dating, he told Julius that if I accidentally touched his man boobs, he has permission to touch mine as “an eye for an eye”. He attempted to steal me from my ex. He makes decisions without thinking, like this one time he shared my google doc with someone who hated my guts, and Julius said that he did it because “he drank too much chocolate milk” as an excuse. And then there the whole situation with Nick and he just sat there as he was insulting me and he was aware of it. He would also tell my ex everything if I ever vent to him about my relationship. Not only that but he’s distracting during our work meetings “because of me” and I always have to look out for him and stop him from embarrassing not only himself but me as well, but that’s on me since I told him about this job in the first place. 

- I’ll keep this one brief, there was this one dude who manipulated me and guilt trips me and acts like a victim and innocent, but he isn’t around that much anymore so that wouldn’t be much of a reason

-I don’t want to be rude to my group in any way but I have to bring it up to tell my story. So I would vent to them about these guys but they seem to treat them like nothing happened, like they never did anything to me. But that’s probably on me because I been burdening them with my problems from my past relationship and maybe they got tired of it. I mean I know they love me sure but I just feel like a burden being around. So I’ve decided to leave the group, I’ll keep in touch with most of them but I don’t think I belong there anymore.",2022-05-13 11:48:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650866158,2,/r/lonely/comments/uopxgo/idk_if_im_making_the_right_choice/,,0,1,Idk if I’m making the right choice

2397,uowvuv,Asmodeux_,"I was pretty normal last year, everything is quite alright, I'm the same old me, your typical dude, not good looking kinda tall (5'11) with a proper physique and a big nerd/introvert. I'm surrounded with small circle of friends that I sometimes talk with, and I am also part of our community choir, I sing and play the guitar. This happen back in  July 2020, I've been into biking back then and one of the girls in the choir I am part of took a liking on it too, so I let her join me sometimes. We were never really close but we know each other I was not really paying attention to her and I know she just wanted to join my routine. 

Our first ride was nearby, a seminary with chapels and everything. It was actually fun even though it was pretty hard since the road is pretty steep. This thing happened several times, biking with her alone, talking and stuff, then others join us, I even created a vlog because the place was pretty. That was the only time we had friends? join us. Things are now going smoothly, it's been 3 or 5 months already  and when I'm with her, everything is so peaceful, and time goes by without me noticing it. We are now exchanging chats online, and we also watched anime movies together in Discord, and she was interested in this game I was playing called ""Valorant""  so she downloaded it too. I taught her the basics and I guess she was enjoying it.

We exchange rants in life, things we love, hate, we have in common, and other things that can't be explained in words, it was pure and wholesome, I've never felt something like that in my whole life. Then summer happened, April 2022 she was leaving for vacation for days, and she said that there will be no connection or signal there. So for days we didn't have a chance to talk, I was thinking about her for no reason, I don't know why.. then she came back after 4 days, she said she didn't enjoy her vacation and it was only exhausting, I asked her what happened and we talked about it, but I think she enjoyed it. 

The next day she asked me out to bike, chill ride within the village. We stopped in a nearby playground and sit in the swing, It's like every time I'm with her there is this feeling of happiness? or some sort of joy that I can't explain, we talked about our differences, and our pasts, then suddenly she says that she will be in a vacation again but this time it'll be for weeks, I say well enjoy and have fun. She left, and I felt loneliness, I don't know what to do, then she chat me, receiving gave me a light of hope, we talked for hours until we fell asleep, the same thing happened the other day. Then she stopped. I thought she was just busy, but 5 days has passed and I didn't receive any, so I contacted her and we talked, but.. it was empty, It's not the same vibe I feel when I'm talking to her so I asked if she's okay.. she said yes.  
She came back after 2 weeks of her vacation, we didn't talk, nor play games anymore. I don't know what to do.. I'm left with emptiness and I felt incomplete for some reason. Then I asked one of my friends, ""what am I feeling right now?"" he then says ""It's love for sure"". He says that the only way for me to get rid of this feelings is to confess. So I did, she was online  and I send her a long message pertaining to the feelings I'm having for her, she just ignored it. After 3 days she didn't even seen the message even if she's online, and I'm sure she already read it, so I unsend the long message and just leave it at that.

I left. The community choir where I met her, the game, I ignored every single people in my chat, I left everything behind, I felt various emotions to the point another me is talking in my head. It was chaotic, outside I was smiling but inside I was dead, because of that single encounter with a certain person. People can't see it, I was smiling like there's nothing wrong, I was questioning myself. Am I me? Who's the real me? Right now, all I feel is hollowness, a void.

2409,uoz0vu,EERMA,"It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",2022-05-13 19:12:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602891040,1,/r/lonely/comments/uoz0vu/bothered_by_unhelpful_thoughts/,,0,0,Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?

2411,uoz8m6,Cataclyps,"I know it's hard. It's hard on everyone. The problems don't end with loneliness sadly, they often begin with it, or is being caused by other problems. It's hard on everyone. On dudes, on girls. Some might think that dealing with loneliness is easier for women, because they have options and are less likely to get rejected all the time, but its equally hard on every end. 

Sadly loneliness cannot be solved, that desperate need for connection with someone, that desire to be loved, understood, desired and cared for.... Everyone wants that. Everyone wants something real deep down. 

You're also lonely, not because you're ugly, fat, shy etc... You're lonely, because you haven't got the courage to approach people. What if I told you something that you already know, that most people you pass by on the street are feeling the same way as you are. A couple of words could change both of your lifes. All it takes is a little courage, of course you'll be anxious, but tell yourself its excitment. 

It's much easier to talk to people than to sit alone in a dark room as you are coming closer and closer to the conclusion that you just want to end it. Because loneliness is at times unbearable. Combine it will everything else and it is literally too much to handle. So a breakdown is inevitable and if its one breakdown too many you might do something people around you will regret. 

Your life is precious. Sure its hard, but if you persist and try it wont be hard forever. You have to try.

I send a “care package” with some perfumed clothing/home goods that you can place around your home… genuinely it helps so much to have a physical object near you when you’re feeling down and alone.

I can't hang out with my family every weekend. So, I usually just say ""Just relaxing"". But in reality here are my lonely plans:

**Friday night:**


-Eat a grilled cheese with a beer. If my week was super stressful, I might take a bath as a healthy outlet for my stress.


**Saturday Morning:**


-Wake up early and work out


-Drink tea and catch up on a TV show


-Clean my apartment


**Saturday Afternoon:**


-Watch YT videos, masturbate, nap


**Saturday Night:**


-Order some food and watch a movie


**Sunday Morning:**


-Wake up early and work out. If it's nice out, go for a walk/hike, otherwise head home. 


-Make coffee and read my book/watch TV


-Get groceries


**Sunday Afternoon:**


-If I'm not depressed, meal prep for the week. If I am, lay in bed, watch YT videos, masturbate, and nap.


**Sunday Night:**


-Watch TV

In a couple of weeks time I'll be turning 29 and since I was 19, I haven't had any social circles whatsoever and I haven't been able to make any new friends outside of work.

I volunteer on a regular basis with my local cadet group and on the nearby heritage steam railway so I am friends with the guys I'm volunteering alongside.

But outside of those, no friends whatsoever. I rarely get invited out to anything by those that I know and I accept that they've got their own lives, friends and families to go through.

This person made me feel worse. I tried to explain about loneliness and she didn't care. She said, we can only do one thing at a time while they are all connected. Loneliness is tied to depression. She even cut it short and said, lets talk more next week. That would be fine but all I got from her eyes and voice was not what I got from the last girl. This was no empathy, no caring, and a very cold demeanor. Her eyes told me she hated me for some reason. It felt very wrong. Instead of comfort I feel worse and I miss the last girl even more. You can't talk about loneliness with therapists. They either don't care, don't understand, or dislike you for some reason. You try to reach out to people or groups who claim to be there for you but you find out loneliness doesn't exist to them. They don't care. In fact, sometimes they judge you and shame you. I really can't take it anymore and all that will happen is someone will lecture me for negative self-talk or not wanting to improve. I wish I could not exist and stop this loneliness.

2476,up6k5i,Amazing-Dust-3917,"So a couple of weeks back, me and my once assumed close knit circle of friends had a major confrontation. All insecurities were spilled and all problems pitted against each other which were piled since the pandemic

Here's the deal: most of the problems were inadvertently caused by me without my knowledge which led them to cause intense feelings against me. My problem was that I stepped on their boundaries and came off as rude and insensitive, which when I reflect over, was wrong of me. I understand and I'm definitely trying to be a better person for them and others. 

On the other hand: hurt. So. Much. Hurt. Hurt over the fact that they chose to hide it from me for so long. Hurt that they broke my trust. Hurt that they went behind my back and spoke about me. Hurt that I'll never be able to be myself again. Hurt that I cannot trust anyone. Hurt that I hate myself. Hurt that I may never be able to make friends again. Ashamed of myself to a degree where I struggle to look in the mirror.

I have always been there for my family and friends but it feels like lately I am alone and in some way that’s my fault but it still hurts. I live at home and still help out with my family as much as I can with cleaning/cooking and helping with my younger brother.

2486,up7nh0,PsalmoftheSad,"Man, it's been a whole month since I've posted to this subreddit. I guess that means, for a while there, I was doing good. Or I was just on a roll with shoving my feelings down... Which seems more likely of the two options right now



I uh.. I haven't posted about this girl lately and I'd like to just for a moment. She was special to me. Not in the same way the love of my life was, though -- because this girl brought a message with her. For some backstory for those who care, I spent a year of my life talking to this girl that I met through a video game. Stupid, I know, but the girls that live around me won't give me the time of day because... Well, I can only assume it's my height. I mean shit I can't even get a word in without being judged. Either way, that's neither here nor there in regards to the story I'm telling. 


I met her through a game, and we seemed to hit it off really well. We talked every other day and it quickly turned into a daily basis. I'd call her during my break at work (and I'd make it a point to take a 30 minute break for JUST that reason) and we'd play games together on my days off. She was the first, last and only girl I ever told my folks about... But she had a lot (and I mean A LOT) of fuckin baggage to unpack. I was more than willing to stick it out with her but she wasn't. There were times where she'd let me in, but there was always something she'd hold back. Granted I understand I only knew her for a year, but there were times I'd almost be on the brink of tears trying to explain to her that I'm not there to hurt her and wanted nothing more than to make her as happy as she made me... And I guess that's a lost cause if she didn't want to put in the work. 



Long story short, after she found out I had feelings for her the dynamic shifted almost immediately. She started putting her other friends above me, started to suddenly not want to call... It was the beginning of the end. Couple that with the fights we'd have on a near daily basis that only got worse, it wasn't a good match. She said she never wanted to date, which I thought was funny because almost all the fights were started by her, and they were all something that couples would fight about. She'd send me letters in the mail and I'd send them back, although last time we fought she called me just to shred them... I still kept hers. Matter of fact, it still smells like the perfume she put on it all those months ago. 



**TL;DR** : I guess the point I'm trying to make by telling you this story is that she brought a message with her. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much effort I put into somebody, it always comes back the same : She doesn't want to date me. I'm not deserving of love. And somehow that's supposed to be liberating.

2489,up842c,Watermelon-star,"

Today I went to a local library because I felt I needed to go outside because I just keep working at home every day. 

But as soon as I walked into one of the library's room, a girl approached me. She was hosting a vinyl exhibition. 

At first, I was paying attention to what she was saying, but as soon as I saw the vynils I started talking about my own collection of CDs and she got very interested in it. But then I kept changing the subject and she kept interacting so at the end we talked about a bunch of stuff, not even related to vynils nor music. 

She seemed to understand everything I was saying and talking to her was like talking to an old friend or something because we agreed on everything.

We talked so much that a library employee interrupted our convo to say the library was shutting down. Then, I told her that I intended to go back and that I would visit her exhibition again soon. She said she would be there for months so I was invited to comeback. 

I felt like asking her number or something but I was hesitant due to a lot of things. First, I am very introverted and socially awkward. Secondly, I've been very focused on work in order to be financially independent since I live with my mother. Also, I am very ashamed of living with my mother because I am an adult and I feel that I should be living on my own already. 

Now I don't know if I should go back to see this girl or not. To clarify, I am a bisexual girl and the girl seemed to be interested in girls (my gaydar is very good) so I think there would be a chance I could be more than friends with this girl, which makes me even more afraid to make a move. First because of these problems I mentioned and because my mother is homophobic and I am in the closet.",2022-05-14 03:05:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650889622,23,/r/lonely/comments/up842c/i_talked_to_a_girl_today/,,0,5,I talked to a girl today

It says (with proper credible research  
in psychology and examples) that our brains are capable of synthesising happiness and they are already doing it subconsciously but there are things we can do to speed it up or slow it down, it means that our brains have a tendency of seeing a silver lining in negetive experiences as a way of making peace with things we want but do not get. I also brought the book by this same speaker and started reading it, i researched it a bit more and i try to remind myself of it. You need to shift your perspective (its hard but better than suffering alone with no hope) and let your mind do its job. It also said that we tend to overestimate things we dont get.

2504,up91wa,dakbailey,"I'm 21, and I turned 21 in late March. I am a male, and I identify in accordance with my assigned gender.

I admit, rather shamefully so, that I get attached to people way too quickly. It is indeed my biggest failing. I listen to cheesy love songs, write love poems, play the guitar with more happier sounds. The person who has my attention during these times is on the forefront of my mind. I daydream about their touch (non seggsually), I think of their voice, pretending in my head that they're telling me all sorts of sweet nothings. I fantasize a future. I go off on little tirades about how much they mean to me.

I can become this way in as little time as 3 weeks.

My sense of love, and my conveyance of such emotion is broken. I'm starved for that connection so much that even the slightest notion towards the idea that someone has feelings for me makes me excited.

My parents split when I was younger, when I was 7, I think. My mother became very dejected towards me. Since I was her only son, I reminded her so much about her ex husband, and was projecting feelings she had toward him, to me. My dad wasn't much better. From the time I was 10-15, my dad was more or less physically abusive. Was I a shit child that probably had it coming to me once or twice, sure. But I'm okay now.

I genuinely don't have a father figure anymore. My mother's trying to be better, but she'll never be the same. I long for a romantic connection that I can just dead rely on. I want to work and toil for someone who would appreciate my efforts. I may not be giving my 100% every day, but my emotions would remain the same. I want to make someone proud, both romantically, but also in a maternal sense too. The motherly ""I'm so proud of you"" that I've been missing all my life. 

I also recognize too that my head is in the clouds. I know that I will never have that kind of connection in my life. At least, never again. I work tirelessly on the grind called my life. I play old video games on my Wii, and try to pretend I'm a kid again, but with a decent childhood.

Knowing that I will never have this connection will pain me to the very, very end. But I will always hope.

2510,up9d05,Weepingghost00,"I'm just not confortable with myself, whenever I look at myself in a mirror, I just want to smash it into pieces, not only because I'm a joke for male's beautiness, but also I hate myself as a person since my qualities aren't enough to tell me i'm a likeable dude.

Now, I apologize to any woman in this sub since this may sound sexist, but here i come:

For the last 3 years I've been faking a persona online, one persona who just represents my ideal me, the person i wish i was yet i will never be: Seeing myself as a cute likeable girl.

The point is I just hate my identity as a male, I wish I could get rid of my manliness and turn into a female, I can't stand being related to sexism and all of those femicide cases (in my country, is one of the main problems), yeah, I know not all men are bad, I know I'm not one of them and I know there are also women who aren't angels, but the media keeps remarking me reasons to want to dispose of my d\*ck and whatever identifies me as a male, even those memes where they mock toxic feminism (or should i say hembrism as I hate to generalize)

Another reason I want to dispose of my masculinity is that (here is the reason I made an apologize two parragraphs ago) by the time i've been faking being a girl I found out how easy women have it when it comes to get affection or find confort and how they aren't judged because of showing weakness and sadness, while men are either made fun of or ignored while doing the same, even by fellow men.  I repeat, my apologies if this sounds sexist. 

However, I have no plans on becoming a trans, because my economical status doesn't allow me that and because I come from a christian family, so despite I have nothing against LGBT community, I feel like the values i was raised in makes me feel like I don't want to make such a drastic change on my body, which just puts me on a crisis, like, I want to stop being a male yet I know I can't change gender by magic or something.",2022-05-14 04:22:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619314155,7,/r/lonely/comments/up9d05/i_wish_i_could_stop_being_me/,,0,1,I wish i could stop being me

2546,updp9e,Emotional-impaired,"After almost 15 years of marriage my wife got fed up of my bad behavior, anxiety, depression and emotional baggage and decided she was done. No love left. I had been living in denial, never followed her to the couselor for marriage therapy, and now that I finally see it all, and am seeking the help I need it is too late. I was blinded by my own issues and arrogance...and now I can see it all.
The difficult part, I still love her like we just met, as in the first year of marriage. I need help, I feel lonely and scared. Just miss her touch, but now all I get are cold hugs, the touch a therapist would give a patient. She wants to be friends, mainly for the sake of the kids, I want my life and family back. 
She gave me enough hints, more like direct talks, saying she was unhappy, that she hated me (and I never seen she saying she hated anyone all these years), and in hindsight I can now see how she had been unhappy for a long time. I was not there emotionally, affectivelly, empathetically, and even physically. We had sex, but was something mechanic, without joy. I was blind and did not see, living in denial...then all of a sudden....I saw! Upon seing her face of aversion when she said it was over, and her relief, happines afterwards, her attitude as if a curse had lifted from her shoulders. And I was that curse.
I now have a long road for recovery for all my issues, if anything, at least to have a good relationship with my children, the be the best dad in the world and the dad I fell short of being so far. But now I must do it alone. If it would have been tough with my wife and my kids at home, supporting me, by my side, I can only fear doing it all by myself, in the silence of an empty house. 
I am a grown up, middle age man that is feeling like a five year old left alone at the train station, abandoned. I have very few friends, and they are all married, busy with work, kids, not much left for someone like me. That was me and I could not see how happy and complete I was.
For everyone here, If you love your family, go to therapy if your spouse says you need it. I don't want anyone to go through my pain. Dont let depression, anxiety, and anger, fueled by any undiagnosed desease like ADHD  Bipolar, or any other, get in the way of a life, a family. I did. 
I will recover, I will rebuild myself for my children. But we can make pills for the brain, we can find solace in our children and even in the arms of another. But there are no pills for the heart, for the pain and the forever saddness of the lost true love, the loss of the one who still gives me butterflies. And for no fault other than my own.

2548,upeo2y,SkippyinLA,"So it’s Friday night. I did nothing as usual. I stayed up late doing the dishes from 2 days ago so when the housekeeper comes in the morning she won’t be overwhelmed and judge me for being lazier than I know I am. 

So it hit me: Life is torture. Plain and simple. I was thinking about it as I brushed my teeth. Here I am, getting ready for bed, each night, then having to get up the next day to do the whole awake thing over again… working, eating, watching oneself deteriorate physically (getting older, thinning hair, and getting rounder), watching stupid TV shows, going to bed and then repeating the cycle over and over again with no idea what’s next, no plans, no goals, no aspirations and no prospects. Life is just one dull, dreary cycle of sad events. Like a slow, boring foreign film with no plot, no dialogue and no guest stars or cameos. Just me, going through the motions of this thing called a life. What’s the point? 

Sadly, I have no one to talk to about any of this or how much I wish I could just stop the pain. My parents didn’t love me, they didn’t want me, they stopped talking to me because I’m gay and not a conservative Trump supporter. Fine. Check. Don’t need them. My baby sis sides with my parents. Fine. Check. Don’t need her. 

But everyone else I’ve met over the years had turned away too and I don’t know what to do or say. I tried for years to keep setting up outings. Inviting everyone over for dinners, game night, movie night, taking time to remember everyone’s birthdays and sending cards and being mindful to call, text or visit for each special occasion. I was the friend I wanted others to be to me. The same with relationships. Both of my ex bf said as they were dumping me that I was “the kindest, sweetest, most caring and loving, thoughtful and kindest person they had ever met.” Both. Verbatim. I could not make this up. Yet. They both met someone younger and hotter and well… I was out. 16 and 5 years respectively, flushed down the toilet. Liars and thieves. That’s what guys are. 

So despite all my efforts, my phone never rang back. No texts or emails came. When I fell on hard times, after I was laid off, I heard from no one and saw no one. Then I get back on my feet and no matter how many times I ask to meet up, catch up, grab a bite or drink, it’s always, “sure! Yes! Let’s do it!” And years go by and nothing. 

So I am left with no friends. No family. No children since my selfish exes decided they didn’t want to adopt even though they originally were open to it. So now I’m 52, stuck in and endless cycle of work, eat and sleep with nothing else to live for but to pay my rent and buy groceries. 

Is this really how the next 40-50 years are going to be? Fuck me. Life is torture. 

And it will only get worse as I won’t be able to get clients or work when I’m 75, I’ll be even in more pain than I’m in already thanks to my ruptured disc. 

How does everyone else do this life thing alone? It suuucks… and not in a good way.

Hi, I'm Michael and I'm looking to make some new friends here! This is a backup account created solely for this purpose. The guys work with know my other account and that, coupled with my slight fear of clowns and the option to send pictures within chats now, would undoubtedly not go unexploited, I know new accounts are suspicious here and think what you will but will go out of my way to avoid a clown. I suppose I should say something that makes me stand out from the crowd a bit. Not really sure how to do that as I'm not one that ordinarily stands out from the crowd. I'm actually quite good at blending in. A skill learned from working all these years. Lol. I'm just a regular everyday average sort of guy. There's nothing really remarkably different about me. I enjoy what most people enjoy. like laughing with friends and having a good time. I do have a soft spot for Pink Floyd. Piper At The Gates Of Dawn anyone? I'm brand new to this as this is my first time looking for friends. Online fiends, I mean, I'm easy-going and it isn't too hard for me to strike up a conversation with just about anyone. Doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. If an average guy in his mid thirties gets your attention and that's something you're looking for, by all means, shoot me a message! tend to get along better with people closer to my own age so please be close to 30. No minors. Admittedly, spend a little too much time here on Reddit. So many subs, so little time. As an icebreaker, perhaps you can tell me about a sub here you enjoy I may not have discovered yet. I'm always open to something new.

2562,upi359,Iloveddlg,"I think I wake up feeling the urge to put a bullet in my mouth every other day. I've gotten pretty good at fighting off the feeling throughout the day, but I can feel it wearing me down slowly. My situation is a weird one, and I'm mostly just writing this down for my own purposes. In case you don't wanna read all of that, I just wanted to ask who else struggles with this also?


Ok, now onto the reasons I feel this way. As I said, it's a long one. So, I've been pretty suicidal since I was around 13 or so. I was a loner in school and essentially watched everyone around me make friends, get into relationships, etc. As a teenager, I grew quite resentful of that and became a sort of lone wolf, bitter at the world for rejecting me the way it did. 

Fast forward to when I'm 16. I just moved to a new town, and found myself in my first relationship with X. X was (is) bipolar and our relationship was a rocky one. She ended up cheating on me and leaving me when I was about 21. It was an incredibly bad break up. The kind that leaves you feeling scarred and betrayed, not least because the only girl in the world who'd ever accepted me, let alone loved me, trampled all over my heart like it was nothing. She shacked up with the guy a few days later, fell hardcore into drugs with him, and just generally became someone I didn't recognize anymore. 

After a brief, mostly LDR due to covid with my second girlfriend, let's call her Y, she ended up breaking it off for seemingly no reason after showering me in love and affection for months, then slowly exiting my life. She now ignores me whenever I talk amongst our mutual friend group, as if I don't exist. I don't understand it, and I don't understand her. Yet another senseless ripping out of my heart as far as I'm concerned. 

So anyway, since that happened I've been single for around 3 years, mostly floating from one casual thing to the next. I've learned that showing vulnerability, or any sense of humanity beyond pretending like nothing bothers me and I have 0 problems, leads to a potential love interest losing interest for good. I've learned that, to most people, I'm not a human being with thoughts, feelings, interests, etc. I'm a human doing, as in, my only value is how useful I am to the person in question. How much moral and emotional support do I provide? Am I rich? Am I willing to buy them things or host them at my house to distract them from their problems? Beyond these questions, I don't exist to most people. No one asks how I'm doing, checks up on me, or anything. It's apparently the expectation that I do that for them, but god forbid they return the favor. 

During this time, my ex X called me. We ended up hooking up several times and keep in semi-regular contack behind her boyfriend's back. However, she's very keen on keeping us a secret from as many people as possible. She'll talk sweetly to me, tell me she loves me, misses me, all that. But she doesn't want anyone to know what's happening here. She doesn't want ""her life that she's built"" to be destroyed. So, in essence, I'm just her side piece. There to serve her when she needs me to but otherwise our relationship is non existent. The sad thing is that it's the most intimacy I've gotten from another human being in years. At least she pretends to care, to love, and everything. I've gone years without so much as that, despite my best efforts to try to make friends. It's not an exaggeration to say that everyone I've come into contact with has used me in one way or another. 

The way things are now, with me being a side piece to my former girlfriend and otherwise only being acknowledged by anyone for my usefulness to them has made me pretty suicidal. I have a history of it, but it's worse now than it's been in awhile. My friends are getting married to genuinely great people, and I'm here alone, unwanted and certainly unloved no matter what I do. Sometimes I just want to end everything, it doesn't really seem worth it most of the time",2022-05-14 14:12:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627055044,13,/r/lonely/comments/upi359/waking_up_suicidal_most_days/,,1,3,Waking up suicidal most days

&gt;Looking for happiness externally is only getting temporary highs, finding that inner happiness within one's self is challenging, yet most rewarding

It couldn't get me any harder. I'm a good student. I'm also an undergrad teaching assistant, which considers being ""cool"". I recently landed an internship at a top well-known tech company, with great pay as well. My family, friends, and teacher/mentor are all happy for me. I appreciate them so much, especially my mentor who has been helping me through this process. They think I'll have a bright future, make lots of money, and finally be happy. I feel empty. I feel nothing. I was high for a moment after the offer, but I realized ""is that all?"". I have no connection to my friends or my family. Most of the time I'm just be there. I can't even connect to myself. My life is a mess.  I'm lonely most of the time, most of the day and most of the night. I've been so lonely for years. I look at my non-college friends, who think they are ""not as successful as me"", but they have their life together, they have close friends, they have significant others, they're full of life, full of love, and always happy and positive. Those are much greater successes to me. I'm so jealous of them. I'm not a financially ambitious person, but it's the only thing I can aim for because I have nothing else besides it. I don't want to make bags of money and be unhappy. People have different goals, and I'm sure being financially successful is one of them.

Being alone is a blessing. Being lonely and alone is different of course, but unfortunately, they go hand in hand together with me. Still, as long as I'm alone, I'm the happiest person alive. After all the extensive abuse and torture I've been through and all the bullying I had to withstand, I love being alone. It puts no responsibility on you, it forces no meaning on you. There's no one there to hug you, no one there to help you, no one there to tell you things will be alright, no one there to tell you that you'll make it. But I've been isolated my whole life, I don't understand what that is. These words and actions make me feel anxious, and bring me pain. These concepts are alien to me. And it often feels to me that these lonely reddit people only ask for love, they don't know how to give. I don't know it either, I can't give love, I don't even know if I can feel it. Being lonely is a salvation from all the mental torment I've been subjected to. No more judging every movement, no more insults, no more controlling, no more dictating, no more beating or manipulating. I don't have any love to give. I'm broken and no one in the world can fix it. Being alone is the only moment I feel truly free and I feel nothing but disdain for humanity as a whole. I have no memory, no history, I don't understand living or feeling, I'm so detached from it all. I raised myself, alone, in my little room, and I'm a mess. I'm a mess broken beyond repair. But the one thing that brings me happiness, is when I'm left alone. I don't need love, I know i can't handle it.",2022-05-14 18:29:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606215404,0,/r/lonely/comments/upnaxn/a_bit_of_different_take/,,0,3,A bit of different take

But I know in the beginning I was the one that hurt her because I was narcissistic and selfish and controlling 14 years later to late to understand the love she had for me.

I'll just put myself out there and be myself without any need to focus on what I'm saying etc etc. so it's not even a facáde or a self-esteem problem like one would think. And then it would go exactly the way I had imagined.

Until I blow it the very next day or month and just become an antisocial piece of sh\*t. For no reason. I just can't keep friends or anything for a long time for that matter. I'm guessing it's got to do a lot with lack of routine. Or complete indifference to wanting one. Gotta be one of those things fo sure.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't have any friends of acquaintances but they are distant as hell. I even have a 4 yr relationship but we just treat eachother like business partners.

I would just completely avoid people whom I would literally talk to a day ago for no goddamn reason. We would really click and then I just go and blow it without any sense of why I did that. There's no plan or reason. And I make tons of plans and reasons but never put them to action (once again possible lack of routine on my part)

and then for the sake of adhering to the fictional social hierarchy I have created, I will act that way for the entire remainder of my time with that person, if there even is any to begin with. Then get problems with envy and actively resent said person. Sucks.

If I, for some strange reason, cancel this entire mental charade I am still met with avoidance from people sooner or later because they get bored of me I think. So not exactly a win win situation. But there definitely would be if I decided to stick with what I'm doing for once in my life and abandoned short-lived spontaneity. Many thanks for reading this if you have you're a real one.

I mean more a perspective of ""I am alone, and yes it hurts but is not the end of the world either"".

Single people think getting a relationship or marrying would heal their loneliness I've seen that the ones that are miserable before marrying are -sometimes even more- miserable when they marry.

Friendships? Making plans for the weekend? Then what? You get home afterward and you feel the same as before, and maybe you start getting anxious about doing something again soon. 

I've felt lonely for many years and I've decided to really look into it, and the more I look I realize it is fixed from within.

The first thing is accepting it; yea I did not get invited to that place, yea I do not get many texts, yea I am not the popular person. So what?

When I was a kid I used to play alone and really had a blast, sometimes I just turned off the TV and daydreamed about stuff and really enjoyed it. Or sat down to play a videogame by myself and had a blast, I even remember enjoying cleaning my room and listening to music. 

Today friendships is more about ego and numbers than creating actual connections with people.

What will I do? What can I do?

I don't know yet. But I am not gonna stress over it anymore. 

I won't become bitter that's sure; I am and have always been a kind and warm person. Won't become cold just cuz my relationships haven't work as I wanted? Was my fault? Not 100%, at the end people do whatever they want. I won't put my happiness on their hands.",2022-05-14 21:56:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626939994,1,/r/lonely/comments/uprcra/accepting_it_is_good/,,0,0,Accepting it is good.

2637,uprvg4,Justice20,"I’m 24 years old and got in my first relationship and moved away when I was 18 years old. I had to escape the situation with my mom because I was not doing good. You see growing up she was addicted to pills and was always high and I always had to take care of her. I remember one of the times it was my 16th birthday and I came home and she was passed out on the floor so I had to drag her to the bed and tuck her in and make sure she was alright. This happened all the time so I grew used to it like it was just a part of life. She married seven times and we moved around all over Texas. I went to so many schools and never stayed in one place for more than a month or two. I had no friends, I was always the new kid. My mom separated me from my family when I was really young so I really wasn’t close to them because they didn’t like her (for obvious reasons) and I was very protective over her because she was my mom. She sheltered me pretty bad never really let me go out and do anything so I pretty much grew up in my rooms. Never went to a friends house or anything. Eventually when I was 18 I had enough so I gave her an ultimatum, either get sober or I’m done, I’m cutting ties. I’ve tried so hard for all these years to get her to change and nothing happened so I was just done. She didn’t change. She didn’t listen to me. So I left. Moved in with my girlfriend I just met because I needed to get out of the situation. And then she died because her heart and liver was all messed up from the drugs. I feel so much guilt because the last time saw her was a big fight. Thing is, my girlfriend was just the same. Didn’t really let me do anything and kept me sheltered. But for 6 years I took it because I was used to it and was terrified of being alone. Now I’m 24 about to be 25 and it kills me that I’ve wasted so much time of my life. Something has got to change but I’m too scared of being alone. Feels like I’m still a kid.

2655,uptrpu,mind_ablaze,"I'm going to be 22 on Wednesday. I guess I'll just start from the beginning, as cliche as it sounds to say that.

I've never fit in. I moved to where I currently live when I was in third grade and suffered really terrible bullying at the hands of a lot of the school up until early high school. I had people who I guess I could consider friends but only a couple who I really consider FRIENDS. I only have three people I can think of off the top of my head who I would consider myself still friends with from high school, and honestly only four who I would say I was friends with in any real capacity anyway. Out of the three I still talk to, one constantly flakes on me and every plan we ever make and the other one moved continents. The third I'll talk about later.  


I lost my entire online friend group of four years this past year and very, very few of them speak to me anymore. I don't really want to talk about the details of the whole situation surrounding it - it's messy and exhausting to even think about. It's really shaken a lot of my faith in my self, really shattered all of my confidence socially - I never expected them to just cut me off completely, which the majority of them did. A lot of them assured me they wouldn't when I was worried about losing them as friends and still did.   


My best friend from high school moved away for school and I'm proud as hell of him because that man will be my brother until the day I die. He has been there for me in situations where I had no one else. He knows things about me that literally no one else does.   


I miss seeing my best friend every day at school. We stay in contact - play video games together, sometimes we just FaceTime each other and talk. But he's not *here* anymore. I don't interact with him daily online like I did with my old friend group, and I don't expect him to be available to me like that - he has his own life and I respect and admire that in him. He has a group of friends where he lives who he hangs out with regularly - roommates and friends from work and school.   


While I am glad for my friend and his situation, I can't help but envy it deeply and constantly. He went away to school - I stayed in the town that both of us despise and went to community college. He got all those opportunities that I just keep wishing I had the guts to apply to school and get. I was too scared.  I decided to stay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Four years later, I'm not even close to finishing an associates degree and I have no idea where my life is going. To my credit, I've had a job (recently two) the entire time that I've really enjoyed, but it's pretty much consumed my entire life at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

The community college I go to is really terrible at cultivating the community part - my days are spent during the school year by getting up, going to class, going to work, coming home, repeat. I've had very few social interactions outside of the classroom. Friends who I thought I'd made will either just not contact me or only contact me if they think I'll let them use something of mine. I have no friend circle. No one really contacts me. The only people who I get texting me are my sister, my parents, or my boss. I have some online friends now but none of them are really all that close to me. I think that some of them believe themselves to be much larger parts of my life than they are. That's not to say that's anything wrong with our friendships or them - they just don't live anywhere near me so we can never actually physically hang out and also have other relationships that take priority over the friendship they have with me - which is also normal and fine. It's just reality. I don't expect them to make extra time for me or put their other relationships on hold for me. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no real way to meet people. My line of work isn't one that lends itself to meeting too many people - I stick around the same bunch of them, and not too many are people I'd want to hang out with outside of work anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm not at work I'm just in my room. Alone, usually. I just...I feel so isolated. So alone in this sea of other people who have partners and friends and people to go do things with and I'm just sitting here, unable to work up the courage or fight off the anxiety to talk to people I don't know in the real world. I just...I wish someone cared about me. I wish someone would let me care about them.

2676,upvj79,Nuggetswithsauce,"Idk how to say what I really feel these days but it’s something like when you are in a room full of people you know and love but you feel so lonely and alone. I’m in my university year now and I have no friends at my school. My friends from highschool are at different school so I often meet them during weekends. I get excited to meet them cause it’s really sad when there are 147 people in one class but you are just…alone. So I get out of school whenever I can to meet them ( my school is around 30 minutes from where most of them live). But at the same time I didn’t want to bother them to pick me up cause it’s a real hassle with all the traffic and stuff. I don’t own a car so it’s hard for me to even go to campus as I have to take a 20 minutes walk. 

Being in school really fucked up my mental health and I’m not happy with my life. It got worse. I live at my friend’s house for the weekend (not all weekend) when I got out of school so he can send me back before Monday if I have offline classes. Recently, I feel like I don’t belong to that group anymore. Idk if it’s because most of them are males but I feel so lonely plus he told me sometimes he didn’t want to have me but just because he pitied me. That hit me hard.

But the main reason I didn't go was because I was going to be alone. I just sold my ticket last minute to someone because the last person who was supposed to go with me, also got a date. My best friend is hanging out with another friend group who doesn't like me, so it's not like I could hang out with her. My other close friend has a boyfriend now.

I try to ignore it and be as calm as possible about it: usually it works, with the great exception of weekends and holidays, when my time just seems wasted. Almost everytime I go outside I get sad because people are mostly happy but I just can't be as them.
  Friendships look very complicated to me, and I may be a loner that prefers having only really deep love instead of multiple and shallow relationships. Unfortunately, I've seen no one with these same interests, and everytime I try to interact I see that someone looks more important to me than I am for them. This lack of reciprocity makes me think about how unirrelevant could I be. 
  Maybe, no one really cares about my literal and internal pains, since most of time I need someone, I have nobody. Adding this to those bad things that naturally happen during life really makes me wonder if life is worth-it and why shouldn't I give up all of this, whatever it means.

There’s a few people I’d say I’m close with, but over the years I learned I’ve been wholeheartedly open about everything in my life with strangers. I’m not really close with my family either, the amount of manipulation and trauma from them is sickening. I am most content and safe being myself, or at least have tricked myself into believing that. I always felt like I didn’t fit in-with family, friends, peers at school or colleagues at work. Nobody ever understood me or even tried to. I battle with that thought thousands of times daily, knowing that I’m simply not a person who leaves long lasting impressions on people. Most days I wake up sad because I just want to die, and put myself out of agony pretending I love life when in fact I don’t...I put so much positive energy into people when I don’t have enough for myself. It’s too exhausting. Gave it my best shot, with everyone, with everything. I try to be the good human being with morals and pureness that the world needs. I can’t afford the basic lifestyle I have and trying to strive for more often leaves me in disappointment and tears. I’ve become numb to it after so many fumbles. I am tired.

I met someone online today who texted like her and all the emotions just came rushing back it's so horrible. I thought I would be done by now. I made a last ditch effort to reach out and be friends again but it seems she doesn't want that. It's so hard to accept it's over, I feel like I'll never like someone as much as I liked her again. 

Life has been really drab since then, like all the colour in the world left with her. We didn't even have a fight or anything, she just didn't want to talk to me anymore. It feels so wrong, especially since she took a lot of my firsts. 

The first time I was out late with a friend, my first outing with someone with just us two. My first time taking photos with a friend, my first time someone fell asleep on me.

It all feels so weird that it's all over and it's never going to be back.

I can't help but compare everyone I meet to her, and no matter what people always fall short of the idealized version of her that I've crafted in my head. Idk it just sucks, I've never been this attached to someone before, I just really want to hear her voice again and it hurts knowing that it's never going to happen.

The person that I liked is probably gone as well. I mean it's been 2 years and some big life stuff happened to her. I can't help but day dream about going through it with her. I'm sure whatever drew her to me has also left me. If there was even anything like that at all considering how easy I was dropped.

I still write songs about her, draw outfits she would wear. Listen to songs we would listen to together. My happy place is the road we crossed at night when it was raining. I still think about the scenery a lot even though I'm sure the memory has left her mind.

I'm sure at this point I sound really creepy, that's if anyone even made it this far. It's not even like this intoxication I am displaying was mutual btw. After a 5 forgotten birthdays and a dozen messages left on read you get the impression that the other person just doesn't like you all that much. It's very depressing to like someone more than they like you, but I think that's something we can all relate to to a degree.

Idk I'm just rambling, if you scroll though my account I'm sure you'll find a lot of posts with the same general message because it seems this one fucking person has been haunting me for years.

2748,uq0792,Putin666,"We evolved to live in close knit groups of 50-100 people. Our brains evolved to feel good when we have some close friends. But the way we all probably grew up or spent our time, didn’t put us in situations where this could happen.

Anime and youtube and tv shows and video games.

How many check boxes does that fill for you? That’s how i spent my life this far. Wow what a surprise we didn’t make friends when we were alone at home the whole time lol.

The answer is simple. Let’s get more social lol. I made 2 real good friends this semester just by talking to people. Ask them if they want to do homework together. This is great because to make a good friend it takes about 100 hours of time spent together and it’s really easy to do that when ur chatting together about homework and then maybe hangout after homework too too.

Other ways to to make friends. Put yourself in situations where you will be seeing the same people consistently on a weekly basis. Time= friends. It’s a simple numbers games. the more people you interact with consistently the higher ur chance is of finding someone you bond with.

Socially awkward? Socializing is a skill that can be learned. Join a workout group or dance class or reading club. keep your options open and don’t stop. something like 50% of the population is unhappy socially and 25% is entirety lonely. You are normal. We are normal. You got this.

Also cool little trick to be less lonely is to help people. Helping peoples feels so good and maybe you’ll make a friend.

on top of that, this time of the year with everyone celebrating new accomplishments, i’m feeling a different kind of loneliness where  i feel everyone around me has been making such big progress in their long term goals while i am still stuck in the same spot and still figuring things out, or making such slow progress. i know i should stop comparing myself and just focus on my own journey, but it’s hard and i still have yet to fully internalize that. 

i will say though today i’m proud of myself for taking myself out on a date today- i dined alone somewhere i’ve been wanting to go for a while. i’ve been getting more comfortable eating alone in public. trying to move towards no more waiting for someone to do the things i‘be always wanted to do. i also combatted one of my episodes of negative lonely feelings today with exercise (running). i’m glad and hopeful that this could become a go-to healthy coping mechanism for me. for context i was never all that athletic throughout my life.

I've been talking to people online to try to stop being AS lonely, but I'm at rock bottom again, days without anyone talking to me, soon weeks I'm sure.

Everyone's gone, my trust is spent, and actual hope of any kind if meaningful friendship isn't even possible.

It's not that i don't have any friends to talk to, I don't have nice people around me, in spite of having everyone, i do feel that I am lonely at times. Or just sad, without any reason whatsoever.
I do lead a good healthy life,i earn well and i enjoy a good status in society, but at times I just have an episode of loneliness. It comes from no where and i feel sad.
Is this thing normal because I don't find any reason behind it.

Yesterday I also found out that the one I felt most comfortable chatting with, he blocked me in whatsapp out of nowhere, and the more I think about why would he do that, the more stupid ideas come across and I end up believing them

I might delete this post after.

For the longest time I’ve had anxiety, (ever since 6th grade) it just got worse over time to the point I worry about simple things like the way I walk, basically doing anything in daily life. I “overthink” things a lot but I just have this feeling where I know someone is judging me. From their looks or questions people ask me I just know. I’m the shy, quiet type of guy and usually keep to my self. I’ve been bottling these thoughts up for such a long time oh boy.

Honestly I’m tired. The past few weeks I’ve been waking up feeling like my head will explode, been really unmotivated, sad and stressed.

I don’t have friends. Pathetic right? 

I’m already 18 and I’ve never really experienced what it was like. I had a close group in elementary till 6th grade but they ended up cutting. me. off. just why? 
Yeah I know I “wasted a lot of time”, I already get an ear full from my shitty  older brother who just judges me and makes me feel like shit. I usually just distracted myself from this by playing games on my pc but I don’t enjoy it anymore. The people I met online were fake as shit too lmao, even the one online friend I’ve been with for 5 years switched up on me and revealed how and who he really was.
Since I’m 18 now my asian parents expect a lot from me.

I'm starting to feel like that is true. I don't want to die not having experienced really loving someone. Whether that be friends a partner or family. 

I do have some good friends, I feel like were growing more distant. It happens as time moves on and we all grow older things change. It still hurts seeing it fade though. 


I just spend so much time on my own, in my room. Sometimes I feel so broken to the point where I question my reality and my own feelings. Do I feel love. Does anyone even feel it or our we all on our own. 

Sometimes I just wish to find a person who wants to talk to me as much as I want to with them. Someone to share the good and the bad. To hug and be held. To do silly things like rolling down a hill like a sausage for example. Maybe one day it will happen maybe it won't. As I said I just don't want to die never having felt it. 

Enough with the venting. Moving on to something lighter here's a bit about me. If anyone is interested in getting in contact. You'll have to bare with me I am not used to reddit. No expectations though. I'll be happy if being open and sharing. Could help someone today to feel less alone. Anyhow...

Anyways I work at this big warehouse and I met a couple of cool people. I don't have a car, saving up for one, but I have my own apartment. Anyways, I get a ride from work everyday from my buddy and he lives right across the street. I work with this girl for a really, really long time and we got along really well. I worked and talked to her for over a year and a half. She moved to another area a couple of months ago. It devastated me. I see her once in a while because her other close friend, she works not far from me. A week before she went to her new area, she asked for my buddy's number because she is trying to buy pot, which is fine. I was cool with it and gave her his info. Anyways, I keep seeing her on Facebook all the time and when I use to post stuff on Facebook she used to always react to my posts. Now she is always reacting to my buddy's post. I can't help but overthink all the time that I was being used so she can get with my buddy. I'm overthinking, overreacting, can't seem to stop thinking about it because I do feel heartbroken and lonely. I can get along and talk to anybody about anything and everytime I get home to my apartment, I get triggered and feel miserable. I try smoking a lot of pot, taking way too many gummies, drinking and even abusing melatonin to take away the pain but I just don't like how it makes me feel. I don't enjoy anything anymore.

Ik those things are supposed to help people that need it but it just feels like I have been abandoned.

Atp I’m just waiting to go to university (if I even manage to get in that is) so I can make some friends there, because at my school there are almost no people that are the same race as me or like the same things as me so even at school I don’t fit in.

2817,uqa5j5,Radiant_Box4228,"I’ve pretty much gotten to a point where I’m torn between blaming myself or blaming those who weren’t healthy to be around in my past, but now I realize that nobody is to blame. It’s nobodies fault. I’m not an outcast or a lone wolf, in fact people enjoyed being around me or having me as a friend. I’ve been told that I’m a loyal and compassionate person, but i never saw my actions as selfless or “the right thing to do”. My thought process behind everything I do is “How would I want to be treated” or “How would I want this to play out if I were on the other side of this?” 

I wasn’t popular or some type of social butterfly, but I also wasn’t a shut-in or Neet. I grew up knowing people from all types of different circles, played some sports and skating helped me make friends, and I was regularly invited out. By the time I was 17, I started seeing the rapid change around me. People stopped calling, stopped inviting me or others I knew, and overall seemed like a massive layoff in the spectrum of friendship was taking place. It wasn’t some sort of catastrophe or huge drama level event, it was just puberty and maturity at certain points that took over and steered us all into certain directions. People who were very close to others I knew cut ties, relationships ended and it didn’t stop. 

It evolved into others essentially surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, which isn’t something to be upset about at all. If you truly care for one another, the people they choose to hangout or spend time with shouldn’t upset you. But when you see someone you’ve grown to care for or cherish surround themselves with those who share the same ideologies, opinions and world views, it breaks that sense of abnormality or “opposite” dynamic of a friendship or relationship. People disagree, they debate or argue, and eventually reconcile or come to some sort of common ground. It’s possible that you may not even agree or agree to disagree on certain topics or opinions, but it wouldn’t break your friendship. It’s just something you’ll disagree on. 

Some may see this as bad or wrong, but in life that’s the reality of it. It’s a part of a relationship that sort of strengthens the foundation of it all, and helps you in other parts of life where this same type of concept is applicable. Love life, workplace and college life and even family life will have you run into the same thing and dealing with it amongst your friends will help you understand this aspect of life. 

However when you take away the disagreements and differences, you’re left with more than just a like minded individual. When those people become a group of people, well, for lack of a better term, you end up with a self loving/loathing circle jerk. I’ve seen friends of mine move onto groups of “friends” that couldn’t be closer to the definition of toxicity. I’ve seen 3 of my friends, people I played football or smash bros on the 64 with, end their lives due to drug overdoses because they trusted the people they were so captivated by. One passed very Recently, so I reached out to their parents and sister who told me that they hadn’t seen him in months since he left off to Mammoth since October of Last year. 

I reached out to who they knew were in his immediate circle, his sister gave me the IG for a couple of his current friends. When I reached out, all I got were “WHO ARE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN HE WXYZ OR WENT THRU THIS OR THAT?” When in reality, I would’ve been happier talking to him despite knowing he was struggling. Although I know I’m not to blame I still felt a sense of guilt. I did try, but I also didn’t push it either because that’s just who I am. Couldn’t force anyone to try and talk to me. I came to find out that he started using Herobrine (misspelled on purpose, you get the idea though) when he met a girl on that trip to mammoth which ended up becoming a semi-permanent move. I come from an area where a lot of people are wealthy mixed with lower to middle class aka Los Angeles, so he had his parents to support him, regardless of knowing where he was. 


My point is this: I’m very friggin lonely, and people have drifted away from each other and found themselves in groups of people who are too much like them, to the point where it’s almost unhealthy to be around. Don’t let your differences cloud your relationships with those that you love. Differences mean nothing when the bond you have between one another outweighs any differing opinions. However it’s not something you can stop on everyone’s end. Only yours. The sooner we come to realize this, the less lonely we’ll feel. It’s not a quick fix or maybe the answer we want, but I see myself as a very indifferent person when it comes to the common left or right side of things. I don’t take sides or choose who to be loyal to or fight for. Humans need to start putting themselves in the middle every now and then to take in the full picture of things. 

Maybe it’s not an answer, but it’s a start. And to the young ones on here who may not be feeling like they have people who care or who are concerned with how they feel, just know that there are people on this planet who genuinely care about our progression as a species and as a race. We care about you, we love you and we want nothing but the best for everyone at the end of the day.",2022-05-15 16:50:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611041242,10,/r/lonely/comments/uqa5j5/its_nobodies_fault/,,0,2,it’s nobodies fault.

2821,uqb0a6,Becca19951,"Hi, 

I’ve never really posted on Reddit but I have been feeling so awful and came across this sub that just spoke to me. 

I am a 26 yo female, I feel like on paper I have done pretty okay for myself. I went to university, got a first class degree in engineering, have a good job with impressive pay. Bought a house with my boyfriend, I have a nice car that I love. As I said, on paper everything looks good. 

However, aside from my boyfriend and family, I have absolutely zero meaningful friendships. In fact, I do not have any friends. I’ve had friends at uni, and school and work etc but as soon as I’m not actively in someone’s life they tend to forget about me or stop making an effort with me. It’s always me who tries to talk to them and make plans and keep the friendship alive but after countless times being let down or ignored I tend to just recluse into self defence mode and give up. 

I don’t know what I do wrong, I feel like I’m a personable character. When with me, people seem to enjoy my company but that’s as far as it goes. I’m the girl who gets spoken over or doesn’t get heard in a crowd. As my boyfriend likes to say, I’m an NPC. And it’s lonely. So fucking lonely. It makes me feel so rubbish about myself and I often get very down about it. 

To make matters worse, my boyfriend has so many fiends. I know he feels bad about going out to see them, when I don’t have anyone I can make plans with. I don’t wish him to feel that way but at the same time I do often end up feeling left very often. 

Not expecting any advice or feedback. I just wanted to vent. Thank you.",2022-05-15 17:31:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1565604305,7,/r/lonely/comments/uqb0a6/i_am_an_npc_in_life/,,0,5,I am an NPC in life.
2822,uqb0sr,International-Sir315,"Alright so I (20f) am a college student but I’ve really struggled to make connections in college since my first year was mostly online. My bf (20m) and I met in high school and my roommate(19f) also met me in high school. So my roommate has found a group of church friends for herself but I’m not exactly the religious type, however she has invited me to maybe two of their group activities and I went however everyone already felt really close and they knew each other so I just felt really uncomfortable and unwanted. 

Then the other night my bf went out with some friends including my roommate’s bf. And my bf told me that my roommate’s bf basically said my roommate and her friends thought I was super standoffish and didn’t want to talk to them so they gave up trying to include me. 

It just really hurt I guess, because I wasn’t trying to be rude or anything I just felt like an outsider, but this just made me feel like it’s all my fault that I don’t connect with people. And then another guy my bf was hanging out with basically said that I never talked to him much in a class we had together.

I don’t know why, I just was bawling my eyes out about this because it feels like everyone just thinks I’m standoffish and weird and mean when really I’m just really anxious to talk to people because I don’t think they want to talk to me. I always think that everyone thinks I’m weird and is annoyed by me, but this situation made it feel like that sinking feeling is completely correct.",2022-05-15 17:31:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604295313,3,/r/lonely/comments/uqb0sr/worst_fears_actualized/,,0,1,Worst fears actualized
2823,uqb2gu,sweetseptember9,"Let's call him Jake. Jake and I used to be really close in high school, I'd say he was maybe part of my top 5 friends. After graduation, we went to different universities, but i remember he still tried to keep in contact with me and vice versa. Eventually he rose in popularity, which i expected him to since he was such a cool person. I on the other hand changed from an outgoing extrovert to a recluse introvert. We both had our own lives, but after graduating university, I felt like I'm the one who always reached out. We never had a conversation unless I would talk to him first, though our conversations were ok, like nothing had changed. 

I recently went through a terrible break up, and I'm sure Jake knows about it because we have very similar circle of friends. It hurt me because he never reached out to ask how i was doing. Even though i continued to initiate conversation with him after my break up, he still never asked, and i never brought it up either. I just feel like with his new friends and life, he's forgotten all about me and doesn't really care.

I'm feeling extra lonely and abandoned these days, so I've been wondering if i should hit him up one last time to have a drink and tell him how much i miss having him as a friend, even though i might not have a place in his life anymore. I'm struggling though because it hurts my pride to have to initiate the nth conversation with him.

2838,uqcyhh,THQaway,"I woke up today feeling even more lonely than ever before. My exwife graduated yesterday. Today she is going off with her girlfriend on the vacation that we had always dreamed of. And I'm paying for it.

 Last month, I found an old letter my wife gave me the night before our wedding, she said ""when you wake up tomorrow, you'll never have to be lonely again."" And it was true, I have never been happier or more safe than when I was married to her and had my own family and life. I remember it at the time being so comforting, especially since she knew about my life with an abusive family and how I woke up everday full of anxiety and dread and loneliness. For her to promise to be there for me felt like a second chance at life.

But after 5 years of marriage, she came out to me as gay. For a couple of months we tried to make it work, and I was hopeful, and she was too. But one day she left out of the blue, skipped our couples counseling, and filed for divorce 5 days later. All I got was a letter from her attorney. Then I got sued. Then she told everyone I was so abusive she feared for her life. I got kicked out of her family, not even a word to try and understand what was going on. The inlaws I had loved me more than my own family. I still dont understand. I lost over half my friends, got kicked out of my church, lost my job. I am destroyed financially, emotionally, and socially. Years and thousands of dollars of therapy with multiple counselors, doctors, etc. have told me I am not abusive. It is so painful and embarassing as an introvert to share every single intimate and private moment, every letter, every conversation I had with her, with strangers and have them scrutinize you. I loved her so much I believed her accusations. It's a small bit of vindication, but how can I be proud of myself. Even if I was a good husband, the best moments of my life were torture for her. The love and safety and admiration I had, it was all just a chore for her. When she couldnt handle it anymore during COVID, she dropped me like trash. Her loving family tossed me away without a second look or word. They all blocked me, told me to never talk to them again. But they were happy to take all the money, assets, and alimoney. The kicker is she isn't even out yet. both of our families and most friends have no idea the truth. They all think I'm the scum of the earth.  


I still love my ex wife. I have her picture on my desk. I cant sleep without her sweater. I've had other relationships since then, but my exwife I vowed to love for life. Even if its not romantic anymore, I just don't see myself making out of this any better, let alone alive. She is with her girlfriend now, in their apartment, with her master's degree, going on a dream vacation, all of which I paid for with the money we were saving for our married lives together. I saw all of this because even though she blocked me, her girlfriend got recommended on social media because of all the ""content"" they post together now. I am happy she is happy. It's my only solace. But I just can't live with this loneliness anymore. I clutched her sweater and even put back on my wedding ring just for a moment to pretend I was there with her. But I am sick to my stomach, knowing all the while she is happy and better off without me, celebrating with folks who hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

Just needed to vent, I know everything I need to do for self care and mental well being. I'm just surprised to be even more lonely now than I was. You always think you are at rock bottom then you can just find a new rock bottom. The good news is I have my will and life insurance ready to go. I have a chronic and degenerative nerve disease, so someday soon I can rest peacefully and she can get everything she ever wanted from me. And her words will once more become true:  I'll never have to be lonely again.",2022-05-15 19:02:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603745626,2,/r/lonely/comments/uqcyhh/loneliness_keeps_getting_worse_how_is_this_even/,,0,2,Loneliness keeps getting worse.

I just moved to the UK in January to pursue a master's degree. I have many physiological issues for which I'm currently taking therapy. I'm an introvert and I used to have social anxiety, still recovering. I had okay social skills. But English is not my first language so it's been really hard for me to make connections here. Online classes are not helping either. I spend most of the time in my room just existing. I have no one you really really talk to other than my therapist. I very much long for some physical intimacy but I have no one to turn to. I had 2 friends who I thought were my best friends and one of them told me to forget about my old friends and make new ones. And with the other, I had asked to call to talk. Call never came. I currently have no one to have deep conversations with, which is important for me as an introvert, no source of affection. I tried bumble and tinder with no luck. I lost interest in both after I started losing self-esteem. Therapy is the only thing keeping me sane. But once a week is too less for me at this point. I have no idea what to do. I see people around me living their best lives.

I find that the people around me have a much easier time of being a half-decent human being without actively *trying* to be a half-decent human being. I try to be a good person, I do. I try to think about the lives of others. I am genuinely curious and interested in how my friends are doing and supporting them through their hardships. I always try to remember my friend's favourite restaurants and gift items because I genuinely *care* about them. Yet, there is not a single friend of mine I have not disappointed or treated poorly. 

I try to be a good person - I do. Yet, I feel like I am constantly failing. It makes me *not* want to talk to people. It sucks when someone hurts you. But, let me tell you, the pain of hurting someone else you genuinely give ten-thousand shits about is almost unrivalled. Maybe I am a good person because my misdeeds scar my conscious. Yet, I always find that I end up hurting people. What the worst thing is - I never do things *intending* to hurt people. If I knew the ramifications of my actions I obviously would not do them. I am not even impulsive. I try to reflect on how my words will influence others or the consequences of my actions. Yet, I seem to misfire *every* time 

I don't have a hard time making friends. Yet, I am pretty much opting in to loneliness. I am so paralysed by the prospect of being a villain in *another* narrative.

I got VERY attached to her. She would message me every day in the morning, before sleep, she would tell me that im pretty that she loves me etc... I never felt so happy.

I tried adding her again a few days later on ig and talking to her but she just told me that she doesnt care and blocked me.  I felt heartbroken however silly that might seem considering that we never met irl. Now since the day we broke up i have thought about her every day even tho i try not to. Sometimes i look at her ig or tiktok to see how shes doing and every time it ruins my day. I don't know but it makes me upset knowing that she is probably living her best life right now.

2868,uqgqxv,30hrstonull,"
I’ve been pretty isolated since I was 15, I was homeschooled. I’m 20 now, and not much has changed. I decided not to go to college, and a chronic injury is preventing me from working, so I stay home all day and time is feeling so slow recently. I’m lucky to have one friend that’s like a brother to me, but he’s like halfway across the country. He recently got into a relationship. Looking back at all of my old friends and it looks like they’re in relationships too, actually almost everyone I know is in one.
 I know it’s probably not healthy for me to linger on those thoughts, but now I’m spending more time by myself, and the person I used to talk to all the time isn’t there as much. 

It’s got me thinking about a girl, we don’t talk anymore, but I still think about her, and feeling this lonely has got me thinking about it even more, it’s unhealthy, obsession almost. I don’t really want anything to do with it anymore, but I have a feeling that until I start to enter the world like I should’ve years ago, things will change. At least I hope they will. 

Of course I’m pretty young, that almost makes me feel like my feelings are invalidated, but regardless I know I have time. It’s just that things are moving and I’m not keeping up to speed. seeing others graduate, getting into relationships, working. I had a few goals with art but I got another injury and now I’m uncertain if I’ll even be able to pursue art full time. I’ve got a couple hobbies but they’re only distracting for so long. Honestly i feel like a burden, I’m blessed to have a loving family that takes care of me, but it makes me feel bad that I’m not getting much done. I’m in limbo.

I know that all I can do is be patient, but it’s getting harder and harder, I don’t think I’d ever kill myself but some days got me thinking  what should I be living for. Sometimes I can see a future where  I finally have what I’ve been waiting for, but it looks like it’s so far, years, and even then I’ll still be young, and I’ll still have time, but I still have to go through the time until then, and it feels so long. 
Everybody has their own pace in life, I know comparing myself to others isn’t the healthy thing to do right now but I can’t help it. I just hope this waiting is worth it, I’m willing to put in the work for what I want but I can’t right now, that’s what hurts the most.

I think it’s because everyone I see are in established friend groups, which makes it easier for them to branch out into a new friend groups and I’m just stuck here alone. In high school I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t go to college and I started my current career fairly young which made me an outcast to the older people at my job. I just didn’t fit in there at the time but now that I am older I still don’t fit in because I didn’t establish myself back then. If that makes any sense whatsoever. 

This caused me to have many lonely Friday and Saturday nights watching Netflix and stuffing my face with comfort food alone. I crave human interaction I crave being included.

I in fact joined Reddit in a desperate attempt to make friends. How pathetic can one be.

You wouldn’t know it by this post but I’m actually a super positive person I just feel lotta this on the inside no one sees that.

Anybody else feel like they will never be part of anything because they don’t have an established base friend group?

I am single, never been in a relationship, kind of going through an identity crisis in my life for a while now. I have never had ""the boys' to hang out with or grab a drink with etc. I have a few girls that are friends from high school but honestly we never see each other. I work full time in retail and honestly its ok,  but I don't like it anymore. I put all my energy to working because I don't have any friends and now all I want is some friends. I specifically would find myself a little happier if I just had 1 guy friend i could call my best friend and who would hang out with me and chat etc. I suffer bad with anxiety and depression and they play off of each other quite a bit. I have spent the last 3 years of my life focused on my university career and my full time job, My social life has tanked and I am extremely socially awkward. I can't seem to keep myself entertained at all and constantly think about wanting to go out on hikes, weekend trips, go for drinks, or honestly even just chill at someone's house watching tv. 

I have always kind of been someone who feels comfort in being around people, and doing things by myself tends to make me feel a bit lonely. I try to not seem like such a pathetic loser but its hard sometimes. I don't want people to see me as really clingy or something like that. In reality I have been through many experiences where I have been made to feel like I am a bit of a loser and now whenever someone gives me a shred of attention, I get super attached and start thinking about everything i want to do meanwhile its just someone chatting online. 

I feel like being almost mid 20s it is so hard to find that kind of friendship.  A lot of people already have their friend groups or closer friends and I sometimes feel like I will never find me a friend like that. It is something I have always wanted. Is it that impossible?

I've read many advices, points of view from people on this topic on different sites. Some of them were useful like finding common interest, the rest was a total BS about loving yourself first.

I've lost 60 lbs, but that's with a meager 700 calorie a day diet, since I can't exercise. I had a stroke in April and figured out I have an aneurysm this month. I gravely injured myself when I was merely 14, leading to a shunt ultimately needing to be placed. Hydrocephalus is a bitch. I'm 220lbs currently and that's working as hard as I can to be conscious of my weight. I can't walk currently and do exercises in bed and restrict what I eat like a mad woman. 

Anyway, enough about weight. 

I come from the literal lowest socioeconomic background someone probably can in the US. I grew up with too many siblings and we didn't even eat everyday, didn't have the means. 

I busted ass and put myself through college and didn't ever recover enough(physically)to maintain a regular job schedule. I married a man who could take care of me, but this honestly caused me to be more alone. He pressured me enough to have a child and she barely made it, she's fine now though and, if I'm honest, my only friend, she's 8. 

I've had work from home jobs and writing jobs, whatever it takes to get it through the day, but I'm unable to do this now, for various reasons. Mostly medical. 
I've tried things to fill the day, hobbies, instruments, drawing, painting, it works for a while and then I grow bored of it and feel apathy.

2921,uqlqyf,DrinkingPotatoWater1,"this is kinda 2 post in one but fuck it. 

I feel like i have to put on a mask with most people. When people meet me I think they tend to like me. I'm smart, funny, I carry myself well. I'm not horrible looking despite caring a bit extra weight (which Im working off currently).  In fact I suspect that if any of the people I knew found out I was posting this they wouldn't believe it. How could I feel this way? I don't carry myself like someone who is desperate, I don't carry myself like someone who is lonely or is craving intimacy. I have friends that are women who I have no desire to date, like I am not the sterotypically lonely guy who falls in love with every woman he meets or is a incel or forever aloner or anything like that. 

when Im around other people though, I keep a TIGHT reign on my emotions. I express what I choose to express 99% of the time. I feel fucking nurotic sometimes. The slightest thing can make me feel deeply insecure or anxious, I can't imagine people wanting to be around me, Im hyper villigant about everything. I'm vulnerable, but not to vulnerable, kind but not a pushover, empathetic because I choose to be, understanding cause I choose to be. Living like this is exhausting and the result is that, I behave like the person I want to be but I don't feel like that person. I feel like Im putting on a performance for everyone the same way I use to put on the ""be polite to this asshole customer"" performance when I worked retail. I'm tired, I want to be myself with someone.

But truthfully I don't like myself, Im insecure, lonely, and borderline neurotic. I don't understand romantic relationships hardly at all, Im extraordinarily emotionally nerotic when it comes to sexuallity in any way/shape/form and even flirting makes me feel super uncomfortable. The other night I was out at a bar with friends and this girl I kinda know was kinda drunk and she grabbed my hands, and was like ""look at me, you are a very striking handsome man"" and I was like.....what the FUCK do you do in that situation lol. Another night there was this cute girl  who had sat down beside where I was at at the bar (I had just been in the bathroom) and she was cute (I had noticed her earlier) and normally thats no problem. I mean I just say hi and sit back down where I had been at. But when I sat down I was SUPER attracted to her and she smelled nice and my body did that warm flushed actually feel like I'm being pulled towards her type attraction thing and I froze up and couldn't even say hi, just sat there sipping on my beer. If she had been a guy (or ugly for that matter) I wouldn't have felt that way, but...yeah. I could type a lot more on that subject but I'm going to leave  it at that. 

so the second part of this post. I use to have a friend I would hang out with online, we would voice chat and just....chill. It was amazing we would watch tv shows together through discord or just share funny videos. She was really nice and we could just...be with each other. I didn't have to put on that performance with her. I could be completely and utterally open, which lead to talking about some stuff I never talk about with people. like the fact I get embarrassed when I'm attracted to a woman due to being teased so much anytime I showed interest in someone in highschool. It was nice to talk about my emotions with someone, especially the more negative ones which I have to bottle up all the time thanks to society telling us its wrong to be open about how we feel. Eventually we ended up flirting and that was nice to, cause I felt like I could with her, I felt like I could tell her I thought she was pretty without it giving me a borderline panic attack. There was some sexual stuff as well, which was truely suprising given the anxiety I normally have around it but she made me feel safe and it was nice. It was all online but, it was nice to feel known by someone and I miss it. She eventually faded away as all online friends do though she lasted longer than most at around 6 or 7 months.",2022-05-16 02:37:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652499145,2,/r/lonely/comments/uqlqyf/im_tired_of_being_professional_with_everyone_and/,,0,0,"I'm tired of being ""professional"" with everyone and I miss my friend I could just chill and be myself with."

2948,uqoxms,Rell-,"25M - I just have to get this off my chest. Everyone always tells me I’m doing very well in life… That at their age they wish they managed life the way I currently am. I always just smile and listen, trying to be as humble as I always am. 

I’m nothing special, I’m just like everyone else, I do what I have to in order to survive. I have a decent well paying job, a very nice car that I appreciate/work for, and an apartment. I’m literally always working but I guess it pays off.

I feel like I’ve been getting worser mentally every single day even though I’m getting better in other aspects of life. I’m just so so so so tired of being so lonely. So tired of engaging with so many people everyday whether it’s friends, family, or coworkers / putting on fake smiles or those that are exaggerated. So tired of feeling so empty and having to mask it with laughter and smiles. 

I used to at least play my video game or watch tv in my free time. Nowadays I can’t do any of that, it bores me. Everything feels like nothing to me. If I don’t have to work I go out… yeah no where in particular I just drive. I tried hanging with family more, going out getting involved with people socially more. There’s this lady I work with who’s starting to see me as part of her family even. She’s let me come over for family events with her family and at the time it’s very nice and helps me. Afterwards that loneliness creeps back up again. No one knows my pain, I keep it inside

Dating, doesn’t seem to work in this day and age. Everyone cold, brutal, selfish, disrespectful… I’ve been ghosted one too many times even. Everyone I know personally thinks I’m some sort of Playboy, which is the total opposite. I take care of myself, I seem to look great let other people tell it. BUT I DONT FEEL GREAT

Society had this standard where men should always be tuff, strong- ALL THE TIME. Today I had a good day, yet for whatever reason tonight after walking inside from work, this all just suddenly hit me. As if it’s been building up so long that it had to come out. I’ve immediately broke down, currently in tears as I type this.

But I guess now I gotta get myself together, shower away my emotional mess, and mask this back up all over again tomorrow?",2022-05-16 05:55:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1530080089,10,/r/lonely/comments/uqoxms/tonight_im_hurting/,,0,13,Tonight I’m hurting

I live in a shit country so psychiatrists and psychologysts here both bad and extremely expensive. I don't have ant friends since they all moved into another City.

2957,uqq858,DisastrouslyRuined,"If the phrase ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"" was a person then I am the literal living example of it. I absolutely hate confrontation, negative feelings, sadness, or emotional upset; so I try my best to just do, say, or help in any way that I can to avoid it. But most of the time it just gets me in trouble.... In the past if I got irked at something I would just RAWR about it to someone for a few min and then I would be ok.... but no one has time for me and my husband takes it as a personal attack or anger especially if it relates to any matters of our household. My (no-longer) friends decided it meant that even if I was happy that I definitely wasn't and took it upon themselves to make judgements and assumptions on my life that were 100% wrong. I am absolutely alone even in a room full of people and I feel completely unliked... If I make any type of friendly connection with someone I am like whoa now it wouldn't last no point. The last person I tried to be friends with just up and disappeared, not even a I'll keep in touch via text from them. I don't want to die but I hate my life.... 

fucking might have cancer - waiting for my appointment to get a biopsy done.... 

for the first time in my life I'm dealing with the emotional trauma of being an undiagnosed autistic child (b/c in my family -when my mom was alive-, Jesus says there's no such thing and everything can be healed through prayer) who was sexually abused by a brother who took advantage of my social/development inabilities. 

At this point at 34yrs old I feel like my identity and purpose has been stolen from me... I'm just a shell going through the motions...Below is a very short list of the negatives that live in my head at any given time.

1. So my family doesn't respect me or don't know how to understand me. 
2. My (no-longer) friends only like being friends with me when I could make them feel better about themselves by being what they considered less than perfect. 
3. No one wants to believe me or take my word when I try to improve something..... 
4. Its not ok for me to be anything but funny and easy going... 
5. I masked for so long so that I didn't upset anyone that when I finally start trying to take the walls down and just be a person that everyone said that I'm not acting normal and wouldn't believe me that everything was good... 
6. Everyone wants to think for me, when i have my own voice I'm told its wrong even if it's just me saying i'm happy.
7. Found out that I'm autistic.... so now i semi understand why every time I relax and just talk that I end up pissing people off with how I talk.... 
8. People come and go in my life so much that it's like I'm a revolving door.
9. I can't do anything right in anyone else’s mind or eyes.
10. I spend most of my time in my head b/c my husband gets offended if i curse and his kids or our daughter are around (cursing relaxes me if i'm anxious and I have taught my own older children they aren't to be used in anger at anyone but I'm one of those parents who don't care about cursing as long as they are respectful and well mannered when the situation requires it.)
   1. Also he takes issue with my relaxed parenting and if I try to parent my step sons my way then it will usually result in a fight. Or he assumes that my intentions are unfair or that I sound mean. He isn't a fan of my music and I can tell it annoys him even though he says its ok for me to play it. 
   2. I know we don't have much in common but I love him and he loves me and he would do absolutely anything for me, and I could absolutely not want for anything because he would get me anything if it meant that I would smile.... but I can't talk to him without sounding insensitive or condescending to him...",2022-05-16 07:24:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652681788,2,/r/lonely/comments/uqq858/absolute_isolation_to_avoid_emotional_distress/,,0,1,Absolute isolation to avoid emotional distress

2969,uqri02,[deleted],"TL;DR: my online friend deleted all of his socials without saying anything and unfriended me after two-years of friendship, and I don’t know what I should do.

———————————

Like the title states, my online friend of two-years just randomly deleted his Discord and instagram, and unfriended me on PlayStation.

To kind of explain our friendship—he reached out of me on one my YouTube videos about doing a possible collab. I said sure, and we kinda just became fast friends after that. We both played the same video game and created the same kind of content. 

We kept chatting and he started to open up about some problems he was experiencing and regularly asked for my advice. I was always happy to offer my two-cents and whenever he was feeling down, we’d play some games together and chat. 

He wanted to keep our friendship strictly online, which I fully respected and never tried to move the friendship to in-person meet up’s or whatever. 

The last conversation we had, he had told me someone had basically lead him on and he was feeling down. I offered to hop in a game with him, or something. He said no and that he was going to listen to some music. I said okay, and I told him I would check up on him the next day to see how he was doing. 

Well, I did. But he never responded, which wasn’t exactly unusual. But a week or so later—I tried to reach out to him again—his Discord was deleted, same as his instagram, and he had unfriended me on PlayStation. 

To say it hurt is a monumental understatement. I’m sure I didn’t do anything wrong, and I thought we were good friends. But… I guess not. I’ve tried to reach out to him on his YouTube channel by commenting on a video, and by messaging him through PlayStation, but… nothing. 

Any advice on what I should do now? Should I cut my losses? Or should I wait a little longer to see if he responds to me? I just found out, so I was planning on waiting until the end of the week to see if I heard back from him. But… I feel pretty blindsided, if I’m being honest.",2022-05-16 09:00:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/uqri02/my_online_friend_just_randomly_cut_me_out_of_his/,,0,9,"My online friend just randomly cut me out of his life, what should I do?"
2970,uqrmm2,TimeSwords,"I’m 20 M. For the past 2 years I have spent every day the same. Wake up 6:45 am to go to work. Get off at 4. Spend my first hour home laying in bed, maybe play some video games, back to bed on my phone scrolling through nothing pretty much, order door dash, do nothing, lay in bed some more thinking about my life and how i have accomplished nothing until 3 am. Go to sleep and repeat. I have zero social life or social skills. I have a driving job so I spend my time at work thinking and driving. Was in a relationship for 3 years until I got dumped for dragging the relationship on so long because I really didn’t want to be alone and she was all I had. Moved away that same year from what little friends I had left due to a blackout drunken suicide attemp that everyone knew about and I couldn’t deal with the shame. I have always felt invisible to everyone around me. Never have I been approached by anyone and every time I have approached someone it turned out bad or I felt like I’m being annoying. Tried having online friends but it’s not enough for me. I have no motivation to do anything. My mind is a constant stir of depression and schizophrenic episodes, and constantly having to deal with body and facial dysmorphia. My days are usually silent and I go some days with not having to say anything at all. I have no reassurance on any aspects of life from anyone. Have no texts or calls from anybody but spam calls. I don’t know what it feels like to be recognized by another human anymore. I don’t know what to do with myself or my life. I feel like quitting. The road ahead seems bleak. I don’t want to continue living like this anymore. I don’t know how to deal with this. I have nobody to help, guide, or support me through this.

I've always been lonely in my life, I literally had no-one and I was even bullied a lot.

Then I found that girl that seemed my soulmate. We both liked the same music, we both were into gaming and pop culture, we had the same humor, the same style, we liked to do the same things.

But In November 2021 we broke-up because I found her cheating and other problems.

Since then I started working more on myself. I have done A SHIT TON of self improvement, I reached for old friends and strengthened our relationships, started dating again and found a decent amount of girls that liked me, I've learned new things I always wanted to learn, I started songwriting and now I'm writing a full album with some friends, I got a gig and I'm playing guitar a lot. At university I'm studying CompSci (that I always LOVED), doing my best and I'm trying to raise my grades, and I'm actually accomplishing that.

My friends love me, male and female ones.

I have a friend that always tell me ""I want a girl that's exactly like you but girl"", another one that always calls me do to things together, others that always have fun with me, a female best friend that's always there for me.

I'm not alone at all, and I'm also doing a lot of activities I LOVE.

But I feel lonely. I feel a lot lonely. It's like nothing of that it's enough, even if I'm happy and grateful for all of that.

Loneliness is a bitch. It doesn't matter what you have, how many friends love you, how many girls or guys you can have, how many fulfilling activities you do in your life.

You can still feel lonely. And that's fine.

Everything is so expensive and people are less and less open to wanting to go out and just meet and socialize.
Making friends is harder than ever.

The loneliness is eating me alive and all I can do is workout, go to my IT position and play WoW. 
10 years ago I had so much more to do and everything was so much more available.

Tried online dating and it just keeps leading nowhere, I feel like a car in a parking lot (what packages does this model come with? And if it does not have what I want, screw it I don’t want it, even if it works and can become so much more.” 
Not sure if that analogy makes sense but it’s what best fits my current situation.

I just want a family, kids and something to work at, I want to be loved and cherish just as I would cherish to my hearts fullest extent someone else.
Hell, I can’t even find love or friends at church (Eastern Orthodox). The depression causes so much trouble that I am just totally unable to interact anymore.

3052,ur7bpn,Professional-Juice51,"Hi, 

Sorry to load here but wanted to just reach out. I’m 27 years old and I live in London. I recently went through a cancer battle, stage 3A metastatic testicular cancer, with secondary lung cancer. Went through chemo, surgeries and loads of other treatment but since February I’ve been in remission after 9 months of treatment. 

I’ve had other health issues since, from my immunosuppressive state - I.E - covid rn. 

The topic here though is loneliness. I have an estranged relationship with my family, who cut me off and chose not to be with me during my cancer treatment. I’ve been through quite a bit of childhood trauma, like sexual abuse and foster care as a child. The last four years beyond cancer have been tough too, as I’ve lost one of my best friends and been in abusive relationships and lost connections.

My life has been transformed by my cancer treatment, sexually, I still have no recovered from cancer treatment. I guess, cancer has made me really want to be loved in my life.

I am sitting alone, wondering if I will ever be loved, and I think now the answer is no. I do not believe that I will ever be loved. Now I think I was born to walk this earth alone and it pains me but I must just accept this fact. All I know about love in pain. I develop a crush and then heartbreak rice and repeat. I  do not know how much more of this I can take. 

I feel like I keep losing friends but I have a hard time making them. I do not know what to do anymore but become fake. Hide who I am so people will like like ""me"" but do they really like me if they don't really know me? I do not know anymore. I think that is what I will do. Kill the old me and replace it with something else. 

I don't know anymore. All I know is that this pain I feel is too much to bear. Somedays I wish I was never born or I was born as someone else. I do not like who I am, I think I am ugly and I guess a bad person.

Here are some songs that tell how I feel.

They talk to each other for hours, he comes over for dinners, and even when we were on a cruise out on the ocean with no service, he found a way to talk to her. I've never had that. And I get that it's my fault. I didn't try hard enough to get over my SM, I didn't reach out more, but it still hurts.

I'm struggling to understand WHY I can't maintain or hold onto friends especially with women 😪 
Hell I can't even succeed with a female as a friend how on earth am I meant to find my soul mate?;

I'll give you an example- 

I have an online friend who I have been friends with for 3 years and we have gotten closer lately.
She used to say how we would be good friends and how we should be friends but at the time I were reluctant and relayed id rather be casual friends and not close as I just had a toxic encounter with a women who used me for attention.

Skip ahead- Its mine and hr birthday around the same time so I said to her well why don't her and I do something nice and spend time together?
The plan was to go over with her and her kids and have few drinks together ❤ 💕 💗 

I understand shes also going through a lot lately and shes very depressed.
I did noticed she went over to a friends on her birthday.
Seems she has told me to postpone things as shes not in a good head space.

I have offered her support and told her I'd be more than happy to come over and help her out with the kids or whatever she needs. 

I guess I feel a but pushed away and I feel shes still seeing other friends but not me.

Another note- I dont want to sound petty or jelous but I noticed people like her and this other women who has poor mental health, seems to have soem female friends who are rlly lovely and buy them gifts and flowers and all here and there or in special occasions.

I feel hurt because I give my all to someone and I have never had flowers brought for me whje I'm down or even on my birthday!!

Losing her has knocked all color and will to live out of me, but i kept going for my family.

But they just act like they care, I honestly believe that none of them do.

I live in a hotel. Barely making it by. Little food, little energy, plagued by depression and severe asthma, maybe lung disease, never finished testing, can't afford to go downtown to get tested because of arbitrary gas prices. Not one of my family will take me in. None of them have room for me.

Been through a crisis program specifically tailored for people in my situation. They then sent me to a psychiatrist, nothing they give me works, no matter what I do, the nightmares of being in place of my girlfriend as she died won't stop, nor will I ever not wake up to see the space beside me cold and empty.

People say it's wrong to end it. I am suffering, but even then I can't end it. I want it to end but I can't bring myself to do it.

3150,urn5rc,ZakjuDraudzene,"I've been excruciatingly lonely ever since my boyfriend essentially abandoned me last August, and ever since then I feel as if I'm on a never ending downward spiral. Every week is worse than the last one, and at this point I feel as if I'm just some kind of engine/machine, living and doing things for the sake of doing them, rather than because I enjoy them or get any sense of deeper meaning out of them.

For the entirety of April as well as the first few weeks of May (and maybe even March, I don't really remember), I haven't hung out with a single person (save for my best friend, who I visited in his hometown, as he lives in a different province nearly 350 km from where I live), and I have not even felt the drive to see *anyone* in the first place. Last weekend, an irl friend invited me to a concert at my university. Even though I enjoyed the music, I still felt really lonely and alienated, and had to go to the bathroom at one point because I was feeling like crying. By the time I was home, it was like nothing had ever happened, I felt exactly as lonely as I did before I went. Might as well not even have gone in the first place and I really don't know if it would have made *any* difference.

Everyone, both my best friend *and* my therapist, tell me that I can't be this way. It feels as if they think it's bad, that I can't let my life revolve around whether I'm with someone or not, but I just... can't. That really is just the way I am, it's almost a biological need for me. They say I need to push past these feelings and just meet people, hang out with others, and maybe love will come eventually, but what's the point? If nothing ever fills the void, if everything I do leaves me feeling empty, what do I do? Do I just curl up into a ball and wait until I die?

It seems like love is the only biological need that people have a sort of inherent callousness for. It doesn't matter to people how painful it is, you just have to wait an abstract amount of time for things to ""get better"" (with zero evidence besides blind faith that this will happen). If you can't do this, then you're a crybaby, and if you pass this ""time limit"" that people seem to have, if you don't recover in a timespan that they deem appropriate, then you can be sure that they'll care even less.

I appreciate whoever reads this whole thing. I don't really have anybody to share this with, since I only talk about these things either with my bff or my therapist, and as I've already mentioned, neither is particularly helpful about it (No hate to either though, they've been great in many other areas of my life. Just not this one).

EDIT: I really didn't mention him much, but I really do miss my boyfriend a lot. He was my life, the first person I've felt genuine romantic love for. I would have done anything for him, literally anything, and the fact that he abandoned me like he did hurts like hell, like a giant thorn on my heart. This is a big part of the problem here. How can I move on? How can I ever love anyone else? Everyone comes just short of being him.",2022-05-17 14:02:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639582414,7,/r/lonely/comments/urn5rc/i_dont_really_want_to_talk_or_hang_out_with/,,0,3,I don't really want to talk or hang out with anyone anymore.

3153,urn987,LucidDreamerPrime,"It's so weird to write this. I feel like a lot of positive things have been happening within my life that have needed to happen. But the one thing I can't work through is this empty feeling every time I get into bed to sleep and every time I wake up.

The days are a repeat because, of course, when I feel lonely I start browsing through Reddit trying to either get off or find a local person just for a brief connection. I find myself searching for someone who might be going through the same but between the ghosting people, and the empty accounts, I grow discouraged. What's upsetting is, while I do have the friends I've made, I still feel alone because I don't have my person yet.

I've also started losing more weight in these good times and people have shown a little interest. But none of them fully and it just leaves me thinking that I can't even just have a conversation. The very thing I know that would make a person want to actually take time with me. There are days where I'm starting to feel like I'm going to grow into one of those old men whose heart just dwindled away before even getting to see the beauty of the world through another person's eyes. I'm literally on the edge of paying someone to spend time with me. I don't want to be that close because thinking on it hurts.

I know this may just seem impatient but, I haven't received that type of happiness yet. I haven't felt like I could find someone for myself that's willing to drive to see me when I'm going through all of this. I haven't physically met a person that makes me feel like I want to stop everything to make sure they're okay. Well the DM can help, it really can only scratch the surface. I always try to check on other people, but there are times where I feel like there's no one to come physically check on me.

Text can mean only so much and sometimes just reading words on the screen can't convey the exact feeling. Sadly this might be one of those situations even as a write this. I know I have people that love me, but not being able to hold someone whether I'm going to sleep, or waking up, is truly breaking me down both when the day ends; and when the day begins.",2022-05-17 14:07:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1569865553,6,/r/lonely/comments/urn987/finally_just_hitting_a_point/,,0,0,Finally just hitting a point

3169,urqav7,pluvi_pine,"TLDR at the bottom. If you don't want to read it, even just giving me some advice on socializing would be great. 

BG info: I(16) went to the same school for 10 years -grade 1 to 10, and recently I moved to another country so obviously I had to go to a new school. Now I'm already very socially awkward to start with, but I've been in the same friend group at my old school since grade 6 and have basically never made friends ever since (I don't have friends outside of school). Also I probably have depression too, which makes it worse cuz I'm too tired to socialize all the time. Sometimes its to the point where it feels like I'm drunk - I can't form sentences properly, pause and stutter a lot while speaking, speak and think really slowly, can't think of how to respond to someone in a conversation, etc. If you have or had depression you probably know what I'm talking about. 

You can probably see where this is going. I basically don't know how to make friends anymore. And sometimes I talk to people but then I just don't feel the connection/can't vibe with them, partially because I don't know them that well as I have only known them for less than a year. I don't really consider them friends and more like acquaintances/somewhere in between friends and acquaintances. Basically I just can't open up to people who I've never met before. (it was way easier to make friends at my old school since everybody already knew each other for a really long time and it wouldn't be too weird if you started talking to people if that makes sense. You'd feel more familiar with them/don't consider them total strangers). 

I do sort of have a friend group at my new school, but its more for ""social stability"" so that I don't get bullied and have some people to hang around outside of class if that makes sense. I hang out with them at lunch, I talk to them outside of class (which isnt that much time, we have 10mins for break and 30mins for lunch, which doesnt help either) and all that, but again I don't feel emotionally connected to them. So I consider them kind of friends/ in between acquaintances and friends. I'm just really socially awkward/don't know social cues and don't know how to talk to people in general, and am a weird person, especially if you've just met me. Basically im the weird kid at school :/

I just can't seem to hold a conversation, which is probably why I cant seem to make friends. I've never really been able to start a conversation, which isn't a huge problem on its own, but I recently I realized that with new people, I can't seem to hold/carry a conversation. It just always ends up being really awkward and I'll just end up avoiding talking to people. 
There's this kid who's really nice, that I kinda of vibe with, and turns out she lives 5 minutes away from me. We bump into each other all the time in the morning, but because our convos always turn into awkward silence I now avoid her every morning by catching the earlier bus because its just way too overwhelming, it gets way too awkward and I get really anxious and I can't handle it anymore. (I'm pretty sure it's not social anxiety, I'm just a really shy person.)



TLDR: I (16) had the same friends (we all went to the same school) for 5 years, haven't made new friends since I met them. Already socially awkward and weird to start with, but since I haven't made friends in so long I basically don't know how to socialize anymore. Moved to new country, now I'm the quiet + weird kid at school. Have a friend group, but don't feel emotionally connected to them. I'm only going to be here for a total of 2 years (1 year left to go), so at this point it doesn't matter anymore. It takes me a long time to make friends and open up to people, 2 years is just enough. But once the 2 years is over we'll be off to uni and I probably will stop talking to them as we go our separate ways. Can't seem to hold convos, convos always end up being hella awkward and I just end up avoiding people. Sometimes I don't even try to talk to people anymore. Depression is also making it worse (I'm emotionally numb, never present in the moment, can't connect to people, feels like I'm drunk all the time, brain can't function properly).",2022-05-17 16:29:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587352598,5,/r/lonely/comments/urqav7/i_cant_hold_a_convert_nor_socialize_or_make/,,0,4,I can't hold a convert nor socialize or make friends. advice + rant.
3170,urqggy,ReplacementPasta," (I am 18M for context)

So i had extremely overprotective parents growing up and i was bullied for almost the entire duration of middleschool (ages 13-15 to people who dont live here) and only had like 1 really close friend and that's about it.

That changed, when i went to highschool and moved out from my parents house and kind of brute forced myself into getting rid of my social anxiety, but i didn't really manage to get any deep friendships and was focusing on showing that stuff is better than it actually is for me.

And then covid hit, we had distanced learning and i had pretty much nobody besides my now ex-girlfriend that i could talk to outside the internet and spend time with for the entirety of that 9 or so months and i was diagnosed with depression during that time and was working on that, though i have since managed to get over that by now.

Now i am just so terribly afraid of being alone while still having some issues with maintaining friendships due to my past, that i am constantly talking to new people just to not be alone but this is extremely exhausting to actively maintain tens of these ""aquintanceships"" and i feel like if i stopped putting in so much efford, they would quickly stop inviting me to parties and all that.

I still don't really have any meaningfull long term or trustworthy friend other than for my best friend that i oringinally met during the distanced learning period as she was hanging around at the empty school aswell.

And i am quite scared of how the summer will go as i can't keep doing what i have done during the school year at school, and i only really have 1 person that truly cares how it's going for me.

I am honestly quite lonely even though it doesnt look like that to people looking in from outside, so it's not like anyone will come to help me.",2022-05-17 16:36:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607551395,7,/r/lonely/comments/urqggy/i_honestly_feel_lonely_and_dont_really_know_how/,,0,1,I honestly feel lonely and don't really know how to change that

In the beginning, he made it seem like I was the only one he was talking to. He even said that he only has sex exclusively which is why I was so confused to find out that this wasn’t the case. 

This weekend I called him and told him to block my number if he was just going to keep ghosting me and bringing negativity into my life. He agreed, and I got off the phone, but then he called me back and said that he wanted to see me. I told him I didn’t want to if he was just going to ghost me again and that would lead to me being hurt emotionally. He assured me that it wouldn’t be the case, and he was acting strangely clingy and wanted me to come ASAP. So I went over. We had sex twice that night and even had some genuine laughing moments during it. We showered together that got a little steamy. We ate afterwards, and woke up just talking about random things. I left his place and realized later on that he’s blocked me 15 mins after I left. 

I called him on my other phone wanting an answer as to why. He said he would unblock me and that it was a misunderstanding, but we had both communicated to each other that me coming to have sex with him would result in this. Now, I just feel pathetic, used, and alone. I thought I knew him. He said our souls were drawn to each other and that he didnt want to start having sex with new people, but I guess it was all some cruel game to get in my pants.",2022-05-17 16:58:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628645870,6,/r/lonely/comments/urqxhi/he_blocked_me_after_five_months_of_sex_and_lies/,,0,4,He blocked me after five months of sex and lies that our souls were drawn to each other

3177,urrqvh,_sillysensitivegirl_,"If you have any input/ advice I would love to hear it 💕

I always figured I would just meet someone eventually, we would start talking and then end up in a relationship, but I guess it’s way more complicated than that. If I want a boyfriend I guess that’s not realistic, the problem now is that I don’t know what to do. 

I fall hard and fast for people so I’m very afraid of hurting myself. I’m very much craving sexual intimacy to the point where it’s frustrating, but I CANNOT just have sex to have sex, there has to be genuine love there or it will hurt very bad emotionally for me. I’ve fallen back into self harm because im afraid im unloveable. 

Sometimes I feel like maybe I can just hook up with someone, and I feel a bit hopeful, but then the truth comes back to me and I get depressed again. I can’t help but feel angry at myself. I just want to be loved but it’s feels hopeless, I feel so behind in life. 

Most people by my age have had sex, and I can’t help but feel ashamed that I haven’t yet, even though I know it would be a bad thing for me emotionally if I knew the other person didn’t genuinely love me and I didn’t love, know, or trust them intimately. Virginity is a social construct anyway so I feel stupid for giving in and feeling bad about it. Not to mention I’m still embarrassed and a bit ashamed to actually admit that romantic/sexual intimacy is something I want. I’ve never felt deserving. 

All I want is a loving relationship, but I think that’s too much to ask for, it’s never felt like an option I could have. But I’m trying to have hope💕 after all who knows what the future will bring

None of my old friends go where I go so it feels like I’m basically starting all over again. I do have some friends but I have high-functioning autism, ADHD and crippling social anxiety which makes it much harder for me to approach people and get to know them more.

I miss inside jokes, taking the piss out of each other and those times when we would make each other laugh so hard our lungs hurt. I miss the sense of belonging to a group that I felt like I could say anything in front of. I long to have that feeling every single day, and I feel like it will never happen again.

Sometimes I scroll through my old friends’ social media pages and see them having fun, laughing, meeting new people and socialising, and I just feel even worse about myself.

But, it had a only few lines of conversation before getting straight into seduction mode with zero prompts of hints that that was where I wanted to go. And, then once it got the tiny little bite it was looking for, it immediately sent a message to upgrade to a premium account, as if this is the entire purpose of the app.

I've read elsewhere (mainly from 2022 posts) that others are experiencing the same thing.

I find it difficult to be vulnerable - but I guess on here is a start... does anyone in their late 20's/early 30's feel lonely or isolated? I have a hx of depression and anxiety, which makes everything more difficult when feeling this way.

I have found a lot of my friends from my younger years have moved on - perhaps I feel a bit stoic about meeting people after that, after investing a lot of time and kindness in people who just do not think twice about you. I haven't felt so lost than I do now - even though I have stable employment, and regardless of those who I have left behind, a small but meaningful group of people who I love and care about. I am not married and do not have children, and I always feel like I do not have much to talk about with people my age (even though we are not that old!) I love my art, gaming, cosplay, meeting people at cons. That does make me happy. But when I turned 30, I felt so much pressure - and it has made my depression and anxiety worse. Does anyone else feel this way?

Sorry if this is such a mess, I am finding it difficult to even be vulnerable via just typing this out...",2022-05-17 23:51:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650833230,73,/r/lonely/comments/urzsiw/30f_does_anyone_else_feel_lonely_in_their_late/,,0,68,"30F - does anyone else feel lonely in their late 20's, early 30's?"

I ended up running into an old friend of mine and I was happy to see him. We exchanged numbers and I thought well hey I got friend again. A few weeks later, a co worker of mine told me he had a new training buddy. Turns out, his training buddy was an ex of mine when I was in high school. This guy was my first love and broke my heart but at the time I understood why we parted ways. I always assumed that he wasn’t ready for a long term relationship or to take things too seriously like I was. So, my co worker showed a me a picture of him.. and darn he got even more attractive and like an idiot I told him That i thought my ex was still attractive. Im Pretty sure my coworker told my ex something because my co worker asked if I can help my ex with some stuff related to my work. I freaked out and said no. And now I kinda hate that I looked at that picture and told him no...it seems like a whole bunch of feelings came rushing back in. The crazy part is that’s it’s  been years Since we have been together....so I know I shouldn’t feel this way. I find it hard to get my ex out of my head and my self esteem has been hurting a bit. I looked myself at the mirror the other day and I actually hated how I looked like. It’s  been pretty bad that I’ve actually been avoiding on seeing my other friend. At this point I’m not sure what I should do....I feel like I lost an opportunity to get to know my ex again and that I am hurting an old friend in the process.

From getting a new job, cutting people off, going to gym, it’s all the same. I’m still lonely, depressed, and suicidal. I’m just a walking time bomb, waiting to detonate at anytime. 

To give you some background, I’m m18, who is a college sophomore that graduated high school in January. I graduated high school forever holding a hatred towards it. Everyone there are slimy and fake as hell. I also have at least 1-2 friends as of today.  I either cut most of the people off or they turned their back against me.

Graduation is Thursday but I don’t plan on walking the stage. Idgaf at this point, I shouldn’t have to return to a school I absolutely despise. Plus I’ve already moved on with my life, leaving high school in the past. 

I just think my life keeps getting worse by the day. I constantly want to kill myself. I think I’m actually gonna do it this time, with no regrets. Nobody checks on me no more and I’ve done everything I can to end the pain/suffering.

I thought I would be happy little did I know regardless of how hard i try I cant make friends and I hate everyone im around. I dont understand how can i dislike people so much but want to be social so badly. I just want one, I want one friend who i can vent to and who comes over and paints my nails for once. Ive never had that im terrified i never will, i dont want to just vent to reddit for the rest of my life about how miserable i am hoping a stranger takes pity and  texts me and ill have some interaction in between the never ending dull. I have a boyfriend but my deprresison and anxiety get in the way of truly being happy and is ruining that too. im not bad looking im athletic i have a good personality i can attract guys but thats not what i want for some reason I cant make any friends.

3258,us4i8y,Kintra_,"TL;DR: Antisocial for 5 years, now in highschool. Only open up to old friends, they drifted apart into separate groups. Started to get comfortable and accept being antisocial/sad. Felt like this is really bad health wise, went to Reddit to get it off my chest and ask if anyone has felt this way and if they had any advice.

—

As a kid I was very extroverted, I was a “popular kid” mostly until 6th grade. This was when my mom passed away. I was really affected by it at the time and still deal with it today. Anyways, that’s why I started getting more antisocial and anxious. I eventually got over the anxiety and started becoming more social, until 2020. Quarantine really fucked me hard. I was still social with my friends over games and shit but I really started getting used to being alone. I talked less to my family, never talked on the breakout rooms in zoom, and got basically 0 social interactions for months. 

When it was time to go back to school in 8th grade I was so different, I wanted to talk to some old friends but I was actually so anxious.  That’s when I started only talking when spoken to, losing my personality, and never raising my hand in class. Fast forward to now, I’m a freshman in highschool. My old friends were the only people I really opened up to. After a while they all drifted apart into separate groups. The years almost done and I’ve only made 1 “friend”, we don’t talk much, he just sits with me sometimes for lunch and we have a class together. My homeroom made a class groupchat and forgot I was even in the class (Yes I was too scared to tell them they forgot, not like I would talk in the group chat anyways). Today, in that same homeroom class, when I was coming in late my teacher asked who sat in my chair to the class and no one answered until one guy said no one (yes, I was literally walking in). 

Obviously I can’t just tank this, my mental health has been low since 5 years ago and I feel it only goes lower. Lately I’ve started to get comfy. I feel that being alone is a lot better than fucking dying trying to socialize. I also feel like I accepted that this is how things are and after this acceptance I feel more ok with how I am. Ive also never told this to anyone. I’ve done a good job of acting happy for my family and old friends so they don’t question me. I’ve always been too scared to talk about this to my dad or anyone really, I thought about talking to my dad and asking for professional help but I saw it as a last resort. I know its probably really unhealthy to keep living like this so I went on Reddit to get it out of my chest and ask if anyone has also felt this way. If anyone has advice, help me out, I feel too ok with being sad.",2022-05-18 04:14:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1545716747,4,/r/lonely/comments/us4i8y/comfy_with_being_alonesad/,,0,2,comfy with being alone/sad

3260,us4oje,Thatssapphyre,"I almost don't feel real sometimes. Like nothing I say is taken seriously. Talking feels useless. I feel like I'm speaking to walls rather than people. I feel isolated even though I have friends and family. And when I do get a chance to speak I feel like I spill over. Like I can't stop. And I hate everything I say. The people I want to talk to the most talk to me the least. And I just feel like a burden to anyone I open up to anymore. I just don't want to speak some days. I'm so happy when it finally feels like someone cares or pays attention. But it's always so fleeting and I end up back here. Crying and bottling my feelings. Second guessing every word. Self harming. Fighting back panic attacks. And alone. 

I know people are there I could talk to. But I don't think anyone gets it. I feel dismissed constantly. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe it's me, I'm dramatic, sensitive, or just annoying. Maybe I'm desperate. Maybe no one really wants to be around me. Maybe it's all lies, every nice and encouraging thing. Or maybe I'm delusional.

I feel stupid for feeling hopeful or for caring so much. I feel stupid for even being sad about it. I wish I didn't care or value these interactions so much. I wish I could just shut this all down and walk away, just leave everything behind. It's like I can't be happy. Or that anyone can be happy with me. It doesn't feel like I'm deserving of the relationships I desire with friends or family. Like everyone in the world has value but I don't. I feel like some novelty item just being gawked at and lucky enough if I'm paid attention to. I feel used. I feel alone. And I want someone to understand. I'm afraid no one ever will. I'm scared I'm gonna be like this forever. I'm going to have to live with these feelings of neglect and abandonment. I wish I felt important. Or like I mattered. All my efforts to build relationships, to communicate, to open up... feels useless. I'll lose in the end no matter how hard I try. I feel like I mess everything up. And any attempt to make myself be seen in a positive light is just a lie. I'm a fraud. And I get scared the more someone gets to know me the more they realize I'm just no good. I'm just a burden.

It doesnt feel like anyone really wants to talk to me. And for that I just don't want to talk anymore.",2022-05-18 04:25:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1574417459,3,/r/lonely/comments/us4oje/i_feel_so_left_behind/,,0,6,I feel so left behind

Well thats the thing. The noz fucked me up and left me with 6 year quest to find a cure for my brain being stuck. I thought it was my mind, but its always going in a OCD way. Ive been thinking the same thoughts and looking for a solution to heal for over 6 years. But today I was just thinking and realized that there never will be a cure. And its my fault. My brain is fried and I see the world a lot differently now. I blame it also on the acid I took.

Work at a labor job or at a kitchen anything that requires to move fast I can keep up. I burn out easily. 

Also the maturity behind the jobs too. Im 28 and I havent been able to find a way to grow up more or become more mature because of my condition. Also, fear. But thats different. The only thing I got going on is security work that doesnt give me any skills to gain, and a possible gambling career.

3313,usdiyc,DominikArch,"TL;DR Want to date?

I'm 21 years old guy. I'm lonely. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to establish any relationship. 

I talk with colleagues and I'm ""friends"" with them but that's only work stuff. I never looked for friends anyway. It's not a thing I'm interested in. 

What I'm looking for in a relationship with a woman. Because of the nature of my job, I don't have many females colleagues and I honestly don't know where else to meet them. I'm introverted so all the social gatherings are out of possibilities for me.

I want to hug somebody and cuddle with somebody, kiss them. Spend time with them.

I was told I look alright. Some people even think I'm handsome. People I talk to (mostly on the internet) genuinely like my personality, they like my hobbies, and they find me interesting. I was even told I'm ""different"" (from the context I understood it as a compliment). 

Yet I'm unable to find a girl to be with. I never cared about where somebody is from. I talked with people around the world because I know if I will fall in love with somebody it doesn't have to be a person from the area I live in. 

Every time I chatted with someone they first seemed crazy into me but later always got what I would call only ""cold feet"" when I felt there could be a ""next move"" happening.

Yes, I never really dated so I have no idea what's the proper step by step method people use when getting to know somebody but I always communicated with them about what they think and that I want to talk about how we both feel and what the other person thinks is appropriate yet and what yet isn't.

At this point I'm here, I just want to ask, is there some girl, doesn't matter where she is from, who would like to chat with the possibility of dating if we like each other and maybe be together one day?",2022-05-18 13:56:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652880235,2,/r/lonely/comments/usdiyc/i_feel_like_there_are_no_other_options/,,0,3,I feel like there are no other options.

I knew 3 of my friends since i was 12(now 17) and we were really good friends but lately they are starting to hang out a lot without me and it just sucks. They live close to eachother so sometimes i couldnt come to hangout anyway but a lot of the times i was available and they dont even ask me anymore. I almost always have to put in the effort.

I think since august 2021 we made a new friend and started to hangout with her a lot like just as a group of 5. I really like her and think she is funny and nice but a week ago my other friends told me they find her annoying. 

They said they still want to hangout with her but that sometimes she is just a little annoying but its still fine. I just feel uncomfortable knowing how they think about her and i kinda think they dislike me too. 

I dont have any other friends ( they all have a lot of other friends) and i saw them as my bestfriends. It all just sucks. I feel like im just replaceable, lonely and nobody really cares. But i also dont know if im just being dramatic.

I would just like to have a bestfriend and dont feel replaceable and worthless.

We started chatting and talking, i started to believe that my long awaited pain and agony was over after meeting her.

The first time (happened 2 Saturdays ago) I asked a friend if he’d want to watch a movie and he said “yeah, we can go tomorrow”. 3 hours before the movie he canceled.

The second time (happened today): I was texting a girl on Saturday and out of the blue I asked her if she’d want to come watch that same movie that day (I admit that It was bad timing but I still don’t know why I asked). She said she already saw that movie but we could do another movie some other time.

I told her it’s fine and she doesn’t have to do it, then she texted me a paragraph on how she would love to see one with me, I was honestly surprised that she wanted to go so I said sure and I’d promise to let her know. Today we talked in person and I asked if Friday night was okay and she said she’s going to be busy for basically the entirety of this week and next week.

3351,usl9yd,LordSt4rki113r,"I feel like I have no real friends any more.  I used to think that I had a lot of friends, people that wanted to spend time around me.  But now I think that I've become like a broken instrument to the majority of my friends.  No one seems to want to talk to me, spend time with me, or go out and do things with me any more.  The majority of the time, I am the one reaching out first to people to even get them to text me, and most conversations don't last more than three or four text messages.  Usually they are short messages like ""yeah,"" ""okay,"" and ""nah.""  When people do reach out to me, they usually need me to do something for them but don't have time to talk about anything else than what they need.  When people make plans or have exciting news, I am typically the last person to find out, IF I find out at all.  Nobody seems to have an interest in how I'm doing or how I'm feeling.  I can't think of anything I have done that could possibly have offended any of my friends, let alone all of them at once.

I haven't ever been in a real romantic relationship, either.  I have a worse relationship attempt record than Family Guy's Death.  Any attempt that I've ever had at trying to get into a real relationship has died right in my palm.  No matter how long I've known a potential partner, whether it be 10 months or 10 years, it seems that as soon as I reveal my feelings for them, they're up and vanished like the morning dew on Mercury.  They quit talking to me, stop hanging out with me, and sometimes won't even look at me if they see me in passing.  It's like I am completely dead to them, like they don't even know I'm here any more.

I just don't understand why things are the way they are.  I'm an honest person who really cares for people.  I go out of my way to make sure that I don't offend anyone, and I'm too patient with others for my own good.  I'm not an angry person, and I wouldn't ever intentionally hurt someone.  If I ever hurt someone accidentally, I'm apologizing to them constantly until they've told me they're fine at least a million times.  Why do I feel so abandoned and alone, all of the time?

Then, she went to stay at her place for a month and we didn’t talk. Again, understandable. What i don’t understand is that when she came back, she cut me off.

Am working on a project that I adore and that is very fulfilling to me. My family, of course, doesn't understand what am trying to do or who am trying to be.

We aren’t bonded that well, I don’t feel secure in any type of friendship and I feel like in so many ways, everyone’s a stranger and vice versa. 

I get really sad when I see people who have had friends for many many years, or have a family that loves them, mainly because I know for a fact that there is 0 way to have that apart from building on a relationship/friendship from the ground up. I wish I could just wake up one day and have all of this already. 

I’m tired and I’m lonely from all these acquaintances and flimsy friendships. I barely have the energy to invest in developing friendships, especially when most of these people already have close friends and I feel like between us we’d never have that together because they have no need for it.

3384,usqsnq,Aligity,"All throughout my childhood, I only had maybe 1 or 2 friends and a best friend that didn't talk much. I realize now that I never really made any sort of connections with others then, still struggle to even now.  In short, I was the loner kid, the one people thought was weird, now I'm just invisible to everyone.  


I recently ended a 8 month relationship I was in with this girl I met last year, only now am I realizing that I have little to no connection with anyone else in my life. I can't make friends easily because the hobbies I enjoy are either too obscure or nobody else has the same interests. 

My daily routine would be to go to work, come home, and do nothing or play video games to distract myself. I feel my only real interest is my career which I'm still unsure about currently.

I guess it wouldn't matter if I tried to make a friend anyways since whenever I do have someone I could call a friend, I rarely if ever choose to hang out or socialize, I just stay at home and play video games. My parents always say they'll be here for me, but I know that wont be forever and it scares me that I might only have my parents until the day they die.  


Funny thing is, when I first met her, I was in a good place, actually trying to reconnect with people and make new friends. When we broke up, my best friend decided to hang out with her more often than with me (not relationship wise as he's already in one). It feels like everyone I've met almost forgets about me, I'm always the one making the plans with others if it even happens.  


I've been trying to see a counsellor about my issues, but I've been on a waiting list to see one for about a month.

I don't get messaged first, I have to always message them first which pains me at times because I wish it would be mutual and not one-sided. 
Funny thing is, everyone has habits and favorite people and people they don't like. I noticed that when anyone talks to me (as in texting) they just seem bored, uninterested, and/or annoyed. They always seem unhappy, and that's my fault. I see the exact same person talk to someone else and they seem very happy and glad to talk to them and would invest time to talk to them. They say nice things, seem eager to talk to them, always seem to know how to keep a conversation going and they apologize for things. For me? Well, nothing.

I planning on starting a family soon. She's not been respectful of some of the choices I've wanted to make with my kids and already stated she would ignore my rules (i.e gental parenting, not kiss my kids, ect) me and her got into an argument. She stated she didn't want her kids around my kids because of how I want to raise my kids (I don't really care if they swear and said I wouldn't punish them if they swore as long as they are respectful) I told her if she can't respect my parenting and how I want to raise my kids then she won't be in our lives. She said fine and we left it at that.

Maybe I should just call it what it is; I do not have a crush on anybody. It has probabyl been 8 years since I last had a crush on someone. I really liked this person and felt uncommonly comfortable around them. But they saw things differently so we drifted apart which makes me still sad. To be quite precise I do actually have some sort of a crush on someone but I have never spoken to them nor do I think that they know that I exist, I just saw them a few times from a far (we go to the same unibersity). So I am not really sure if it really is a crush since I had actually no interaction with them. However this feeling has been lingering for nearly three years now.

Looking for an emotional connection, I rarely post on subs to stay anonymous or whatever. In my experiences, people tend to run away from love/feelings due to the slight chance of it completely destroying you. Quite often spending their lives hiding from themselves, but I’m hoping you’ll let your guard down and send a message because I’m taking my chances.

Sometimes I (19F) feel wrong that I love my own life so much and I always choose me. I chose me yesterday and the other day when I told this guy who is very nice all around that I don’t wanna be in a relationship right now. 

I feel guilty for doing so because he likes me a lot, but i don’t know. I don’t need anyone, im very independent and I’m finding it difficult to want to share my life with someone else. I love to be by myself and enjoy my own company, although it’s nice to cuddle and have fun with a partner, right now I’d just rather not. 

I don’t think I should be feeling guilty for hurting his feelings because  I can’t help what i want and what i don’t want. I think it’s good that i know what i want, i have a good job and am saving up to move out. Ever since I can remember i’ve loved to be alone and i love my life just how it is.

Yet try explaining that I can't go due to social poverty and nobody gets it. I don't want to be the sad loner, at a table by himself. Listening to the groups of friends telling each other stories, laughing and having a good time. I don't want to the sad loner watching the happy couples getting closer and more intimate. 

That of course is the cache 22 of the loner. We don't want to enter the world alone, yet at the same time we long to be part of the world. How I got here? Probably similar to allot of you. I am naturally shy, an introvert. When I am social situations I struggle for interesting things to say, I can't make people laugh and enjoy my company.

3514,ut98p7,bruisedbrains,"A couple months ago, I was incredibly lonely. I spent majority of my days in my house and only left my house twice a week for a bit longer than 2 hours maybe each time. There’s a lot that happened but that’s not important.

I met a guy in one of my college classes. We got along pretty well but we are both quiet and a little awkward. I have a specific type, and so I didn’t want to let this opportunity get away from me. He just seemed too good to be true and its rare for me to like someone. I told him I liked him and we agreed to be friends and see what happens. Keep in mind, we’ve kissed and stuff so we for sure are a little more than friends. So far it’s been pretty good, we didn’t talk super often, but it still was nice. We haven’t talked since the class ended however.

I’m not sure if i’m in the wrong, but deep inside me, I really want someone to be a little obsessed with me. This man barely has any social media and through extensive searching I pulled 3 images off of the internet of him. I found out what video games and anime he liked. I literally searched through his graduation ceremony to watch him walk across the stage. I have a old video of him speaking so that I can hear his voice. I (unfortunately) found his (supposed?) ex girlfriend’s social media and she and I have similar interests and such and that made me insecure. And then I thought… would he do any of this towards me? Would he go through several pages on google trying to find stuff about me? Does he get jealous/ insecure over things? Does he even think about me as much as I think about him? 

I literally get intrusive thoughts about him. Keep in mind, I’m way more busy than I was before. I have a job and I’m doing school in a shorter semester so there’s a lot of assignments. He’s also very busy, much more than me. I can see that he hasn’t been active on steam in a short while and he only longs into snapchat like maybe 2 or 3 times a day? I understand being busy and exhausted, but it hurts that he can’t text me saying he’s thinking about me. I just want to know small things, it doesn’t have to be back and forth conversations all day long. Is this all too much to ask for? I don’t know if it is. I keep telling myself that he still likes me and his silence is just a different approach than the way I want and that’s ok. Am I being unreasonable since I’m lonely? Is what I’m doing on the internet endearing or overstepping boundaries? The thing is… I would find it very endearing if a guy told me he did all those things. Is this wrong? Is that too much to ask for?",2022-05-19 18:01:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602823461,15,/r/lonely/comments/ut98p7/is_it_wrong_to_crave_attention/,,0,14,Is it wrong to crave attention?

I've felt like this forever but recently it's just gotten to a level where I'm thinking of killing myself often. I've never been in a relationship. I work at a job that's not really exciting to me. It feels like nothing gives me any joy anymore. So I think I don't have anything to look forward to in life if it's gonna be like this. I do have friends but no-one I can 100% trust to be there for me whenever I may need him/her. It's always been like this with every relationship I've had with another person. I've been ghosted by almost every girl I tried talking to, so my self esteem is fucked. Despite all this I'm always nice to everyone around me and never show any hint of the shit that goes on inside to anyone. But now I'm tired of pretending I'm fine.

3526,utbb5k,[deleted],"My husband left me for someone else almost 2 years ago. I'm not even close to being over it. We were married 10 years. 

In addition to grad school and my full time job, I sometimes work part time doing customer service remotely by phone. I spoke with a customer a few times and we really clicked. He was close to my age, funny, nice, charismatic, complimentary and our conversations just flowed. It was the closest I've felt in a long time to having a ""crush"" on someone. We found out somehow that we lived pretty close to each other and he started regularly asking me out. I panicked. 

I had sent him one photo of my face. It's a nice photo but I believe he would have been disappointed in my appearance if we met up. I am chubby and am in the process of losing weight. The thought of seeing that familiar look of disappointment if we met terrified me. I kept avoiding the date invitations, but was determined to get in shape and look my best in the hopes we would, eventually, meet. This makes me so embarrassed. I'm 35 years old and stupidly trying to lose weight to impress a guy.  Honestly, though, I felt more motivated and hopeful about life than I have in a while. 

After avoiding a few invitations, he freaked out on me. Told me I wasn't living up to my potential, that I was acting like a ""little bitch"" and that I didn't know what it meant to struggle. I was so shocked as this was very out of character for him. We haven't spoken since, but I weirdly feel like I blew it. Even though he yelled at me. I feel like I have regressed to my adolescence and am just desperate for any attention at all.

I’ll even send pictures of myself to your pm for answers, because I can’t find the answer. I been depressed and filled with anxiety for a long time. A failure for a long time, but with a dream. Ever since middle school, I’ll admit I was a shy kid who was a b, let people say whatever to me, was afraid of talking to people, bad communication skills couldn’t talk to girls, annoying, was made fun of, few friends. once high school started, I started to become a little less shy and more confident, dressed better and acted better, yet still the same. 11th grade came and I was more confidence in myself, more friends, knew how to talk better with girls, dressed way better, looked better, acted better better self esteem and just more enjoyable to be around. I’ve always had “friends” , but they all ended up turning on me. The only friend I have still from my middle and high school days are my best friend. All the girls I liked rejected me, my ex in hs did me wrong, shi my ex 4 months ago was talking to her ex while we were together! And then got with her friend she told me not to worry about and not hates me! It’s funny how people consider me a good looking dude and handsome and cute but I have WAY more rejections then wins. I know that’s how the game works, but when people say your a solid 7/8, there has to be something wrong. Im still a virgin when it comes to actual sex, I only had oral sex with 2 different girls in my whole entire life when all my friends prob have 10+. I try to look at my personality and I am a pretty nice funny dude with an outgoing as well as quiet personality depending with who I am, and I have ambitions, as my dream is to make it as a youtuber, and I do put in the work. I currently have 15k on TikTok and 1,200 subs on yt. It ain’t much compared to what I need and want but I appreciate just a lot.

I come here because I’m so tired of it. I tried changing everything that I thought was wrong with me. My looks. My attire. My personality. How I walk. How I talk. How I act around people. My confidence. My game with girls. Me standing up for myself. Me respecting myself more. I changed ALL of it, but I guess not nearly as much as I needed too, or maybe that’s not the solution. It feels like nobody ever appreciated me because they all ended up doing some bs. It seems like my life an equation, like every 2/13 people see the potential in me, while the other 11 people want nothing to do with me or don’t give the same energy back to me. Maybe that’s the problem? Maybe I’m too much of a supporter, too much of an energy giver because I rock with anyone who rocks with me, but I guess I become annoying and they don’t understand my energy ? I can’t keep saying that. I can’t keep saying I’m meeting the wrong people, I can’t keep saying I’m just different, I can’t keep saying “ITS NOT MY TIME YET, ALL OF THIS IS FOR A REASON” ... no.

I feel so alone. I see all these people and even my friends get all the love, even they can be rude people or people who don’t care yet everyone likes them, all the girls go to them and give them attention, and stuff just plays out better for them. Feels like my life is cursed. My life seems so fake. Everyone either turned their back on me or never appreciate or don’t really appreciate me like I do to them. I always have to ask for people to hang out and that’s just one small example. I do have friends, but Ik all of them are gonna turn on me, like the past ones did. I lost 4 of my best friends last year. I failed so many times. Ima failure. I can name all the failures I have and you guys would say ima loser 100%. Maybe that’s why, subconsciously. Maybe subconsciously I think of myself as a loser and people see that? But how ? When even people on the INTERNET who can’t even see or feel my energy only seeing pics and vids of me not wanna mess with me, when I’m such this “good looking, cool dude” when even the PEOPLE who say that to me don’t rock with me as much as the hype they give me. I told myself I’m done tryna find out what’s wrong with me , and the only solution is  money and fame when I make it .

I’m crying out for help. To the point where this week I even asked people and my own friends what’s wrong with me. I want to ask my ex what’s wrong with me and I want her to roast me. I want the people who hate me and the ppl who did me wrong to tell me. I had lots of ppl in school who disliked me for No. Reason. All I do is support people, be chill, be a cool dude who just chases his dream while working a job and tryna figure out his living situation with getting a new car, while just being ME. I’m being me. Is me just a weirdo, is me just in actuality a disgusting person to like and annoying person to be around with? Am I just not a person to be liked as much as others even tho I tried fixing everything and have attributes of people who are very liked??  maybe I have to change who I am. I asked God for answers and I try to look into my soul and ask what’s wrong with me, I guess I just want everyone to love me, because my whole life I’ve never been appreciated. Please someone help me. And if it helps, I’ll send pictures and even videos of myself, and my voice to you guys for you guys to help me. I’m so tired of myself and I try to be positive and manifest but sometimes I can’t take myself anymore. I know we shouldn’t care what ppl think about u, but damn man. There’s sum wrong with me. I just want this to change, I just want to make it and be successful and happy and make my family proud and I do try and I do grind but man I gotta say I do hate myself man.

3541,utdyfa,Humble-Psychology137,"Hello, this would be my first post ever. I just felt the need to rant since I feel lonely. Who would’ve thought. Currently I’m out of the country I truly grew up in, and in a sense am back home. This trip was supposed to be a month max, but my case at immigration is prolonging more than expected. 

So I’m looking at another month or two here. I do have family in this country, but it’s not the same in comparison to the people I grew up with. So, I feel a bit lonely, and I’m heading to 2 months of being in this country. My family back at home is working and due to the different time zones and responsibilities everyone holds, communication is in essence minimal. And honestly doesn’t compare to being there in person. 

I’ve already been getting anxious to go back home, and I’ve tried to distract myself. But at this point, all the distractions feel like a worked out schedule and sometimes a chore. But, recently I had gotten the news that one of my family members I grew up with was coming to the country I’m in. I got excited and really hopeful, because well I was going to be accompanied by someone from home. I was riding on that high for a while, because it was just so exciting. 

Unfortunately, that “high” didn’t last too long, I got the news later on that the person wouldn’t be able to come. Their parents signed them up for some summer activities, and they have a annual vacation coming soon, which everyone else will be attending except me (due to my unexpected circumstance). And I didn’t expect the news to make me react so emotionally. I cried and just felt down before going to bed. Now it’s the next day, and the news still have me feeling like crap. I can’t seem to stop crying. And at the moment have lost the motivation and optimism I’ve been trying so hard to keep. A selfish part of me wants the person to come. But I know rationally speaking, it’s not happening. 

The excessive crying I’ve been doing, just sucks ass. And I feel so weak minded letting something like this affect me so badly. I hate that so many of the family where I’m at, have seen me crying. They feel sorry for me and the only thing they can offer is words of encouragement. And that seems to set me off to cry even harder. 

I feel my boyfriend, who’s been trying to keep optimistic throughout this whole sudden long distance, just wouldn’t understand. He’s a very optimistic guy, and also kind of blind towards certain things. I don’t think he’s noticed that quite frankly I feel like crap. He’s aware the news did sadden me, but not to what extent. I feel so homesick and lonely to the point I don’t want to communicate with him. My texts have been short and without any of my “happiness and optimism” and I’m tired of pretending I’m doing okay.

I’m basically stuck in a foreign country with no way to just freely go. And it’s getting to me. It’s saddening to have something affect me this badly. I just didn’t expect to end up feeling this lonely.

I want a relationship, affection and all that closeness, but can’t control when that’ll happen, so I’m stuck doing this try harder bit and getting no further away from loneliness.

“Recently, I’ve been looking at myself, environment, and relationships. I was secretly miserable around people I considered/consider friends and I couldn’t place why;I wasn’t living my truth around them. I’m often the sounding board for ideas, the reliable one for family, or ignoring some dig at my expense and those are roles I don’t want to define me. 

I want to be a better friend and create better bonds without the underlying negative feelings/drama. I want to solve conflict and let go of resentment. I want to stop questioning my value to people that I love and just accept that some people will never be for me. I understand this means I’ll lose friends , family and even parts of myself that I grew comfortable with, but I want more. 

I want emotionally intelligent friends who get me; people who allow me to see their authenticity. People that don’t ignore me when they have other options. People that are my friend whether I’m in the room or out. I don’t love loneliness, but I’m okay alone. 

When I’m alone .. I am the most beautiful person in the room. I will be kind to myself.  I will show love to myself . I will take classes , learn new skills,and travel. I’m my silence I will challenge myself to be better. 

I thank everyone that got me here and I’m sad that I can’t take you with me on my next chapter, but I’ll never forget our good times.

I planned on telling her in the final year of school, but then the pandemic happened. I couldn’t attend whatever parties she and my other friends went to for the fear of the virus. It is still something I regret: not spending more time with that awesome person.

I got to know after school from a friend that even she had feelings for me. But it was too late. She’s moved out of the country for good. It is something which aches my heart like a puncture needle repeatedly going in and out.

He was one of my closest friends. She is the girl of my dreams. I had a major crush on her and he dated her. Hearing about them made me wanna kill myself for the longest time, but I buried everything under fake smiles and feelings. I got her in the long run, she is the greatest thing to happen to me but I lost a ton of friends, I go days without talking to people. (Extrovert) I get made fun of occasionally but I can shake it off pretty easily. I'm  not sure I'll have any friends by the end of summer. My uncle recently passes away from an uncureable cancer (veteran of the Army and father of 2 kids, 13 and 11) he was young, my dad's baby brother. He was only 39 (not 100% sure). I loved him so much and never got the chance to say goodbye. Watching my father break down and cry during that speech he gave was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Then my great grandmother got diagnosed with breast cancer. I've days worth of sleep crying. I don't want to lose anyone else. I'd sell my soul to the devil just to say goodbye to my uncle. My great grandmother is fighting a losing battle and I don't know if I'll ever see her again. I hate life right now, and my Girlfriend is the only thing keeping me around. Sometimes I go to a spot in the woods by the creek and cry until I cant see anything through all the tears. Then I cry some more. I just need a shoulder to cry on and loving arms around me telling me it'll be ok, and that it's not my fault. But I don't know if I'll ever get that again.

3600,utlwk0,broberrybear99,"I missed graduation because I got covid. I knew it wouldn’t be enjoyable regardless because it would just be me super sweaty. I even saw some people passing out at my school because it took place outside and it was 80 degrees (I felt like that would be me if I was there). I think what was challenging was that my parents never showed up to school events that were about celebrating students. They probably felt uncomfortable the few times they did go since it’s hard for them to connect with other parents but it would’ve been nice to be supported. 

I cried to my mom about graduation and I told her I felt like something was being taken away from me. (Back story I’m a premed student and I basically spent most saturdays studying at the library. I didn’t really have much fun. I don’t really feel like I missed out because I know that most of my peers weren’t having amazing experiences they were just out getting drunk. But I worked really hard these last few years and im off to medical school in the fall). She said really sweet things about being proud of me and how far I’d come. 

I have a roommate that’s been an asshole the entire time we’ve lived together (I painstakingly tried to teach her boundaries. She understands her own now but not how to respect others’ boundaries) she’s a shitty human being in general with no integrity or sense of responsibility (describes herself as an empath but doesn’t actually know how to empathize?? I’ve never met someone with such little self awareness). Regardless, her entire family including some cousins showed up for her and brought her flowers and I just felt like crap. 

I try every single day to be a good person, to challenge myself to be better for my community. Why was it me that got covid and had to miss my family celebrating me?

3601,utm1zm,vilevampz,"My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be 20 and god I feel so lonely. I don’t have any friends in real life. I have a few online friends but I’m done being their friend because it’s not the same and I’ll never meet them. It makes me even more lonely to talk to them. I’ve never been asked out (I did but the person did it as a joke) in my entire life. It’s so pathetic to be almost 20 and have no friends and never have been in a relationship. Life would be better if I was dead. I got my first tattoo a few days ago and that made me happy but my life is meaningless. I’ve never had a job and I can’t get one bc of family drama. I am in college and plan on minoring in something(I’m majoring in creative writing rn). My goal is to be a professional and hopefully a famous author. I want to complete my goals but how can I when life is bleak. I wish I could go back to the past because if I never left the place that had tons of opportunities available for me, I wouldn’t be depressed. I would still have all my friends and be happy. But life happened and I moved and fucking died on the inside. I guess happy birthday to a shit fuck that is me…fucking hate life. 

I wished my life was better but I pushed through and hoped and hoped but it’s still not better. Wishing and hoping doesn’t do shit. I’ll be 20 and a pathetic loser. I wasted my teen years but I had really no friends in highschool. Never got to do fun stuff as a teen or fall in love. I was bullied a lot in school even abused by teachers. It’s funny how shitty my life is because it seems impossible to have this shitty of a life for years.

3602,utm502,gonewiththewend,"I’ve been sort of lonely since I moved for school two years ago, but for a little over a year, I’d (26F) been dating a guy (33M) who had PTSD, severe chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Despite all this, I fell for him; we always had a good time when we talked and hung out. Then around the six or seven month mark, he started talking about suicide more, saying he didn’t know how much longer he could wait, crying, asking if I would be there with him when he did it. He attempted a month ago, then I tried to distance myself. I told him it was all too much for me emotionally (it was). Then, he committed suicide last weekend.

Now I’m back home with family in another state, but I’m feeling more alone than ever. I’m regretting the things I didn’t say, feeling guilty, missing him, wishing I had someone to talk to (specifically him). I’m scared to go back where I live. I don’t want to be alone. He was the only person who got rid of my loneliness. Every other person I see or talk to does nothing or helps a very small amount. He was my friend, my best friend, really. I’ll probably attend suicide survivor groups when I get back, and I’m already in counseling. It just hurts. He was my favorite person to talk to, even with his issues. I’m sad I have to be alone now. It’s too hard being alone. I might have to get a cat. I keep checking my phone, but there’s nothing there. Occasionally a friend texts, but I only want to talk to him. 

Anyway, I’d take any advice or comforting thoughts or good wishes or anything that could possibly make me feel better about another shitty life event and the loss of my future and best friend.

I’ve been constantly molested and forced to do constant disgusted things to my brother when when I was 5 years old with my younger sister. It stopped when I was about 12. I was raped by my dad. I told my mom and she never believed me and shut me out. My younger sister was scared to speak up until 2 years ago. I’ve been in 2 very abusive relationships but I still felt like myself after my first one. Let’s call my first boyfriend Jake.. Jake used to stalk me, hit me, and blackmail me, but after I left I still felt somewhat like myself. About a year later I dated my high school crush and I’ll call him Tim. Tim emotional abuse me, cheat on me, steal my money, steel my roommates money and tell me I wasn’t good enough. One night I just wanted friends, Tim lived in my apartment rent free.. but the apartment in front of me there was a person that I knew there. I wanted to be able to feel like a human being for once and chill with friends. My roommate had some alcohol that he gave to me. I mixed gin with some sprite in those 16 oz bottle. I went up there and hung out with my friend. We were chatting and having a good time until a bunch of boys came In. I felt the vibe and wanted to go back home. My friend forced me to stay and I didn’t want to. At this point I was a bit tipsy. I was 19 years old at the time. Me rushing into the bathroom telling myself to go home, trying to build up the courage too because I’m a very shy person and was scared of my friend. I came back out telling her I should get back home but she insisted and overpowered me, forcing me back on the couch. She had my bottle of sprite with the gin in it, telling me to finish it and to loosen up. I grabbed the bottle trusting her, I took a sip out of it, making her happy. The boys wanted to play truth or dare, and I kept asking for truth, I didn’t want to any dares because I was scared. My friend picked dare at one point. But at the time my I felt sick and stuck at the same time. I had tunnel vision, all I remember was falling to the ground. It was like every time I opened my eyes I was being grouped. I remember being dragged into a room by a boy, him on top of me. I couldn’t move, scream, cry.. I remember waking up with no clothes on. Running home with just a dirty blanket I found in the room. I ran home crying to Tim. Telling him I was raped. He looked at me and said “no you weren’t, no one would rape you, look at you.” From there, I just knew I wasn’t worth anything. I don’t remember what the guy who raped me looks like everything was so dark. And then it broke me down so hard mentally. It’s been 4 years and I think about it every day. Im alone. I don’t feel like I’m good enough. Im always compared to my sisters, I’m always viewed as the crazy one. No one ever listens to me. I want to be fine but I’m not. Im not okay, I have no one, I gone through this all alone and I want to kill myself. I want to stand in front of a train and end it all. Everyone that I loved turned against me. After all I’ve done for them. I’ve tried talking to therapist but I can’t tell them how I actually feel because they sent me to inpatient hospitals and how is that helping someone.

A little later he sent me a private message and we both bonded over having no friends. It was very refreshing to open up to someone who had the same problems as myself. After just a few days, I grew attached to our friendship and I even apologized to him if I seemed clingy. He was kind enough to reassure me that it was okay and he was happy with our friendship. He did mention to me he was quite busy with work, so it wasn't his intention to reply late. I understood him completely so I didn't bother him when he did not reply to my messages after. Eagerly waiting for his reply, I was dismayed that he wasn't able to get back to me even after a full day had passed. The next day, I found out he blocked me.

3639,utrorw,ArcticArachnid,"For many years I've struggled with social anxiety, but it has recently become so much worse. 

It all started in January of 2016 when I was in 6th grade. School became too much for me, so I stopped going and did virtual learning instead. I continued to do this until the fall of 2019 when I finally felt confident enough to go back. The first couple of months were relatively good, but I still struggled a lot socially. I barely talked, was terrified of everyone, and I had no friends. Then a couple months later the pandemic started, which ruined everything completely. I did virtual for another year and a half, then attempted to go back to school again in the fall of 2021. It went horribly, and my anxiety got the best of me. I called home nearly everyday until I stopped going altogether. 

Now I have no confidence or self-esteem at all, and I'm too afraid to go anywhere in public. I've missed multiple appointments because I got too scared and chickened out. I'm 18 now, and the whole situation worries me because I can't do anything for myself. I don't know how to drive, I've never had a job, and it's been years since I've had friends. I'm also extremely self-conscious about my appearance. My family always makes it a point to tell me how handsome I am, but it never helps. More than anything, I'm afraid that I'll never have a girlfriend and that I'll die alone. The only thing I truly want to experience is being in love with another person. I just hate myself so much sometimes. It all feels so hopeless.

Something else I forgot to mention is that my dad abused me when I was a child, and I'm pretty sure a lot of what I'm going through has to do with that. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors, I know I'll probably feel self-conscious about that after posting.

I just want a friend who I can feel is truly my friend and I'm comfortable with. I'm always known as the gay person or the annoying guy and it's hard to find people who well... vibe. I feel extremely alone because of it. I'm so jealous of watching groups be so chill with each other and I want that. Badly.

For most of my life i (f 18) have never dated anyone. I’ve had a few encounters with boys when i was younger (early freshmen year/ middle school) where we were “talking” but nothing more then that.

3653,utusdl,SEENOWSEENOT,"Not only is it the alienation that has you outside the border of camaraderie and fellowship. That alone reduces you on the inside, especially when you’re away from home and don’t have the opportunity to build a home elsewhere. It’s also the constant rejection of never being invited into the topic, the conversation, the discussion that has everyone involved and contributing except you.

No one wants you to contribute because they don’t expect anything valuable from you. Your take on a situation is nothing more than a mildly annoying distraction. Like they feel obligated to acknowledge you when they really don’t want to. As if you’re wholly and inherently valueless. This is how they see you. And that’s why they don’t ask you to hangout with them.

And returning to the familiar isolation is the is your go-to refuge but you still hear them talk and laugh. They enjoy that they’re accompanied. They always belong and always linger to participate before leaving for their duties. But no one ever lingers for me. I hate when they walk in on me in the common kitchen to grab a snack or make coffee because I know that’s all they’re there for. They won’t make conversation with me. Only a greeting that is so insincere and unenthusiastic. And then they leave. And it burns that they see how alone I am and how unimportant or uninteresting of an opportunity it is to talk to me. They make their cup of coffee and leave - and return to their friends. I return to my office alone.

And your voice - your voice is so insignificant. You try to break through the chatter with inquiries and comments just so you can gauge if they actually care that you’re there, but most times they really don’t hear you. And the sentence you formed just evaporates. When they’re done with the topic at hand, you’re so desperate to be acknowledged that you take advantage of the momentary silence to make another comment. But they still don’t look at you, let alone reply.

No one understands how much pain I am in. If they really have disdain for my company and it’s not all in my head, it is certain that they don’t know I suffer. Suicidal ideation is triggered. Depression closes in on me. The hope to exist and live for things is diminished beyond clarity. I don’t want to be here but I don’t have a choice. I can’t leave and must bear this hell.

We told each other and felt that we were ""The One"" and we even talked about marriage and I got to meet her mum. Long story short, she broke up with me, because she's been going through depression for years now, on top of that she have a lot of family related stuff going on that kept piling on top of her already existing problems... she broke up saying that it wasn't me that she doesn't like, but everything that's going on, and doesn't know if she would ever get better... She would mentioned from time to time through the years we were together about how she would feel bad that she couldn't be there for me, because of her situations, but I reassure her that I would always be there for her even if she couldn't be there for me. Even when we couldn't have sex for years and yes you read that right, yearsss of no sex, that didn't bother me at all. I stayed loyal and faithful to her, because I truly love her with all my heart. Now my heart is in pain and I feel so lost... I don't resent her or blame her or anything... I only ever wanted for her was to be happy and that was the only thing I ever wanted from her. Just seeing her smile was enough for me. I stayed with her for 7 years through her depression and been friends even longer.

Now I feel lost and not sure what to do with the rest of my life... when you found ""The One"", then lost ""The One"" and know that nobody else in this life would be able to make your heart feel like that again... how are you able to live the rest of your life now and not decide to end it now, since you already know that nothing else in life will be better than what you already got to experience and lost?

Edit: I never had trouble meeting girls, it's just that she was the first and only one that I felt it in my heart. When you feel it in your heart you just know that they are the one. They don't need to do anything to make you happy and all you want is for them to be happy. When they are sad you are sad and when they are happy, you are happy. When you meet the one you don't need money or sex or any reason to want to be with them. I guess a good example is when you have kids and you love them, you just want to be there for them and see them happy, because their happiness is your happiness.

She was always saying stuff when we were out and about like “we should go try that place out sometime!”, which made me think things were going well and she enjoyed spending time with me. Since the last time we’ve hung out, I’ve asked her a couple times to do something (maybe once every week or two), and she always says something along the lines “I’m about to go to bed” or “I’m too tired”.

3682,uu2zrn,utopia9353,"I'm weird-looking due to a genetic disorder (get stared at/talked about. Sad thing: my parents and my sister are good looking. My dad has the mildest form, I have a more severe one. Chance of child getting it is 50%..... 75% of this half have a mild form. I have a more severe one. I am now into antinatalism (there's a sub on reddit/I'm not a mod though). 

My problem: weird facial structure and head shape due to hormonal imbalance and abnormal facial-bones growth, typical for disease. Surgery is too risky, and results are limited. Talked to 3 surgeons already. I have a strange voice that sometimes makes people laugh, and I have extreme difficulty in conversations, have been doing behavioral therapy for two years now, and even if I gave it my best, I'm not making progress. Due to my disorder, I can barely build up muscles. Whenever I try or go out, I get stared at or talked about. I'm also short, only 5'4... instead of 5'11 I would have been without the disorder. I'm 25 years old. Which also makes me really sad, I'm closer to 30 than to 20. Surgery is too risky and expensive, and results are limited because the parts that need surgery are practically impossible to improve with today's (+/- 10 years) technology. And now my mom says I have to leave home (I'm 25), because I'm always letting out my frustration on her (which is wrong obviously). I can't survive on my own, have nobody else. I begged her, but she said enough is enough.

An example (this makes me even sadder than I was before):

There's this 23-year old girl I'm following on Instagram – she's 3/4 Eastern European, and I think 1/4 Korean. She's the most beautiful woman I have ever ""seen"" – and she also seems genuinely nice in her videos when she's talking; she doesn't fake at all, like many other Instagram influencers/models etc. I will never get a girlfriend, let alone her. And this keeps me up at night, has been for the past 8 months. And I can't let things go, even with THERAPY and MEDS. I just can't. Things follow me around for YEARS – I'm studying online now but failed to get into the college I wanted to (this was four years ago). I'm working on it with therapy, but to no avail. But not being able to ""be hers"" makes me so sad. I cry at random times. I have finals in two weeks, can barely study. After my finals comes the summer break. I'll just not get out of bed. And hope not be ""sent"" to the psych ward by my mom. I am so so sad. I have no hope for my future. None.

**TLDR –** Am strange looking (Surgery is too risky) and only 5'4 due to genetic disorder. Bad social skills not improving despite therapy. I'm already 25, haven't had friends for 11 years (which is ok) and never will get (never had) a girlfriend. As I can't let go of things, despite therapy, what worsens my depression is that I'll never be the boyfriend of this 23-year old (same height) girl/model from Eastern-Europe I'm following. She's not fake as almost any other instagram model. So this will follow me around for years. I don't have the looks, nor the height, nor the social skills, nor am I in the right part of the world. This has worsened my depression.

In middle school, when I was being bullied for stuttering and having immigrant parents, I hoped high school at a new school would be different.

In high school, I was overweight and had parents who forced me to do swimming, I had no one to connect with. People ignored me and my parents said ""good, they're your competition anyway""

In college, I really put myself out there, trying to connect with as many people as I could, I got my heart broken, ignored, and stomped on. I brushed it off hoping that one day med school would be a place where I finally met the people who are going to be my friends

People who haven’t gotten to know me typically dislike me (at least that’s what I think). Anytime I try to be my authentic self, it always backfires and makes people dislike me even more. I hate pretending to be someone else or trying to be someone else, but I also hate being alone. I’ve tried to make myself appear more welcoming and speak in a softer tone because I assumed it was because I seem stand-offish. I’ve tried to socialize more and put myself out there, despite it not being my thing. I’ve put aside my own morals and values just so some people will stay in my life. I’ve changed so much about myself in hopes that I would finally be someone’s priority, that I wouldn’t be the 3rd friend on the side walk, that I wouldn’t be excluded from plans, or the friend who’s always ignored or left out. It just never works, and not only have I lost myself, I feel more alone than ever. I’m graduating from hs next week, and I know NONE of these people will reach out to me once we graduate. The main thing I’m trying to say is I feel like I have no authentic, loyal, and long term relationships… no matter what I do. Even times when I assumed I was the problem and did my best to work on my toxic traits, it still never worked. No amount of authenticity or fakeness has kept anyone in my life, and it’s never made them want to choose me first.

I particularly feel this way because my best friend of 13 years has started associating herself with people who have deeply hurt me and some who just don’t like me… And I’m not the type of person to tolerate mal-treatment from others, so if this continues, I don’t plan on staying friends with her… And it hurts. I feel like I’m losing the last person I had, and I don’t wanna put up with being treated poorly just because I’m afraid of being alone.

I try so hard to make people like me, while simultaneously pretending not to care. I’m not sure if it’s truly just me who’s the problem, and I can’t see it… and my mental health makes people dislike me and want speak negatively of me, or it’s simply just because I’m neurodivergent and suck at understanding social cues.

I can’t talk about this with my current friends, because like I said, I’m not a priority to them. If I try to talk to someone, it seems like they don’t care. It’s like my feelings are being dismissed. None of my current friends care enough to consider how I feel, check up on me, reach out to me, make plans with me, etc.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, but I just wanted to rant. I feel like all I really have is family, and despite them not being any better, I at least know they’ll always be there for me and be loyal. I feel so alone, and it hurts so bad. I just wish I could feel the same love and loyalty that others do. I'm starting to think I just don't deserve that.",2022-05-20 20:03:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615444119,1,/r/lonely/comments/uu6fu3/i_feel_so_alone_no_matter_what_i_do/,,0,0,I feel so alone no matter what I do

But I feel like he never gave me enough reassurance to know that he truly thought about me like how he lives rent free in my mind. I have OCD and while I was having a panic attack I literally had an image of him repeating in my head (this is a type of OCD thing if you didn’t know) and it was so upsetting to me. I wish he knew that I’ve cried over him. I wish he knew that I never told any of my close friends embarrassing or personal details about him because I respect his privacy, but that I do find myself saying his name just because so many things remind me of him. He’s special to me, and the interactions we’ve had feel new and exciting. I have no idea how special I am to him. I have no idea if me asking if he’s ok or if me saying that I’m always there for him means anything to him. If someone said that to me, I’d feel so special. But for him, it’s hard to read if he finds it endearing or if it was just strange about how much I cared about him just based off of me worrying about his mental health right off the bat. Our lives have some parallels, and I thought that was special. I thought us moving back home due to mental health issues and somehow meeting each other was special. I thought that us meeting before class and then ending up sitting across from each other and in the same group was special. He’s so hard to read, but I can’t stop feeling like there’s a strong possibility that I was special to him only in a way that I was a random girl who took interest in him quickly and that might not happen often with him. I wish he would communicate his feelings and intentions and opinions in a way that makes me understand his perspective on us more. We aren’t together, but we definitely like each other?

So I lay down on my bed imagining being on the 4th floor of the building. In my mind I jump. I don’t feel a tightness in my chest, a pain in my stomach. This feeling of sadness and loneliness. This feeling of helplessness. Like I’m never coming out of this. This disappointment. How I disappoint myself, how I never achieve anything I ever want to do. I fail regardless I put effort and if I don’t. But in my head, I don’t feel this disappointment. I don’t think I’m disappointing myself or my gf. She’s happy, I’m happy. I’m not failing this fucking engineering major. I’m not disappointing my parents. I’m not disappointing God with my failed spiritual life. I’m not disappointing anyone. I’m not feeling anything bad, I’m not feeling anything. The darkness. It’s calming at first. Then it’s dreadful. What if it’s just darkness. Forever. What if I could have done it and I’m just being lazy. I could just study more, I could just put more conscious effort to my time with God, I could just be smarter with how I spend money or use my time, I could be better with my partner. Am I being ungrateful? Hating a life some would dream to have. Kill to get this opportunities. There it is again. The pain, the dread, the hurt, the loneliness. To whoever reading this. I doubt it makes sense. If you can make it stop. Tell me how. I do imagine jumping but then after I jump, I always regret jumping. What if it changes, what if I get happy, and then what if I don’t? Each day is like this. I wake up and see reasons why I don’t want to go on anymore and then right at the end. It comes. The reasons I should stay. The hope. The possibilities. 
I don’t want to disappoint anyone anymore. I want it to stop
How can I be scared of death and want it at the same time?
Maybe I am crazy. Yet another crazy ungrateful Gen Z jumping on the suicide buzz, desperate for attention.

3713,uu7nqu,Low-Wind-986,"I always hate talking about myself because I feel like I’m so well, cringe, to put it in simple language, but today just sucked so I thought after 3 years maybe I should write like my teachers say. 

Yesterday I took off because we do nothing all day, and I mean from 8:10 to 2:55 I’m on my phone for over half of that wasting away, So I had an off day. Later that day my mom wanted to take me to see a band we both like, Royal Blood to be exact. I was pretty excited and I had a good time in the end, but for most of the show I felt very empty and lost. My mom spent the time talking to her work friends so I just kinda stood there for 3 hours in a constant state of anxiety while seeing all the laughing couples walk by, knowing I don’t have anyone to share my interests with.

Now we come to today, I really didn’t want to go to school again but I thought “I just bought a really cool Royal Blood t shirt from the concert, People will love my shirt” well wrong. I guess I was hoping to strike up a conversation with someone about the band as, well, I never talk to anyone in general. All I got today was the most sarcastic “woah that shirt is so fire, aren’t you burning up” from my A hole “ex friend” turned hype beast. His other friend asks where I got it, I said “oh it’s from a concert” but he was already talking to his boys and ignoring me, reinforcing the sarcasm of the whole interaction. Get this, he then comes back and asks for money, what a jerk. 

So today I went in hoping someone would find me tasteful enough with my Royal Blood shirt and music interests to want to talk, but instead I rotted away for another 6 hours doing nothing. 

I’m usually pretty confident but after today I just feel hurt, I went back to school so excited as online school meant I hadn’t had friends in 3 years almost (I lost all of mine before the quarantine) but I’m ending it with no one remembering my name.

Not sure why I wrote this but if you’re if there reading this, have a blessed day.",2022-05-20 21:02:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653078951,1,/r/lonely/comments/uu7nqu/loving_highschool_for_sure/,,0,8,Loving Highschool for sure :|

3719,uu8grj,WyldVanillaDad,"My wife left me a little over a year ago, and it's been a roller coaster. I've had moments of triumph and moments of despair, and everything in between. But the biggest struggle I've had is between wanting another relationship, another person to love, another person to love me and make me feel loved, and wanting to be alone, separate, independent, strong, and willful. 

I never thought of my marriage as limiting in any way, but since I've been on my own again, I can see and appreciate the benefits of solitude. I like listening to what I want to listen to, watching what I want to watch, being into whatever I want, without worrying about disappointing somebody else.

And I also miss sharing all of that with somebody else. But whenever I contemplate seeking another relationship, my fear and apprehension take over, and I retreat back to my comfortable routine. I can't decide whether I want a full romantic dating relationship, a ""fling,"" deep friendship, or chatting buddies. Then, the loneliness slowly creeps in again, and the pattern continues.

even though i do have friends in school and outside, i dont feel like we genuinely care for each other at all, its just a ""since we're in the same boat we should chat"" kinda relationship and they dont reply my msgs in the grp chats, when we talk, i dont feel like they care about what i want to say at all, its just ranting abt life and gossiping about others and talking about stuff we saw online, i mean thats pretty normal but i always get cut off and people forget about what i was saying, as if they only listened because they had nothing btr to do, and they only want to talk instead of listen

i dont feel like i have anyone to go to if im breaking down and im feeling hurt, ive tried to post about it sometimes, just to try to get some consoling words i guess, but nobody replied lol, and i just deleted after a few hours, knowing they saw my post and just decided to skip it

and even if i feel like we're pretty close at that moment, my delusion gets all shattered when i realise they have many other friends theyre closer to and im not really important to them, im just one of the ""friends from school"", disposable and insignificant

, i just felt really, like im in the background, im pretty bubbly and funny, but when i feel left out, when i see them take pictures and chit chat without anyone caring if im included or not, i feel so alienated, i feel like i dont belong, and i just sit in a corner and use my phone, nobody really realises either, i dont even wanna cry because no one will care and i can only depend on myself for my happiness",2022-05-21 00:47:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1633951101,3,/r/lonely/comments/uubxzz/i_feel_like_i_have_no_one_to_rely_on/,,0,2,i feel like i have no one to rely on

I don’t at all feel ready to go and start a ‘proper’ career because uni hasn’t done much to help with setting anything up for once we all leave.

I only ever managed to make like one ‘friend’ whilst at university, but even then, I don’t really like them that much. 

Im worried that once I leave uni then that’s me stuck without any friends forever now apart from the couple i’ve knows since high school who i very occasionally meet up with because they’ve largely moved on to other people and things with them being at different university’s.

When i try to talk to the old friends about things i’m passionate about or that’s just stuff that I find fun or amusing, i feel like nobody cares, i still message the old friends online in between the occasional meet ups but it mostly ends up with a few wed answers or the dreaded ‘ok’ when i send them something i’ve come across that i feel like sharing with somebody else or if i have something to just speak about with somebody

I just feel trapped in my own thoughts with no outlet to be able to freely speak with other about what i have on my mind and what they have on theirs.

I don’t feel like i’ve made use of my younger years, it feels like i still should have all of this time to have fun as a care free teenager when in reality i’m 21 and have to start think about how to start a lifelong career.

I’ve made a similar post before, so I won’t repeat myself, but I’ll talk about what’s bugged me recently: all the senior year stuff. I’m not going to any of these things. I’m not going to prom, the last day “field day” event, or any thing of that sort. I simply can’t. If I went I’d just be hanging out by myself awkwardly for a few hours cringing internally at myself for having the audacity to show up. So I’ve decided I will not attend a single school function. Now none of this bothered me before—I knew I couldn’t attend these things long in advance, but now that they’re upcoming, it stings me slightly. It reminds me that I leave this school with no memories, no friends, not even a fond distant feeling. It simply *was*—that has been my high school experience. My entire school experience, really.

Now I have college on the horizon, and I’m planning on turning myself around, but still I can’t help but be sad at how my life up until then has been like. Oh well.

3792,uufm67,Antique-Piccolo-6253,"I tried so long to get you to see what you were doing. Maybe you did or maybe you just didn’t care anymore and I was just a source. That last weekend we started off so well and you did one of the sweetest things you have done for me in the longest times. I still live in a state of confusion when I’m around you. I just want to hold you and I tried to take care of you. But you still just kept taking. You showed no respect for either of us. I know things are and have been hard on you. I know there is so much you miss in your heart. I’m trying to understand. But there has been so much that has happened. I’m trying to keep an open mind. I know I couldn’t give you what you wanted this last time and you went online to find. I just didn’t want you to leave with those guys. I wanted you to try and be faithful  to a man I was hearing you say I love you.  If he is even around anymore.  Then there is now a ghost. I think you prefer it that way. You don’t have to be held accountable for your actions. We still worry about you. It feels like you have just given up. I know that feeling I know that emptiness. It’s just easier to find comfort in a pipe or on top of somebody. We said a lot of things over the years. So many hurtful words that stab us a million times. They play over and over and the pain the disappointment still holds us in a vice that feels impossible to break. I can’t take back those words. I can’t take back how I made you feel. When I needed to listen,I yelled. When you needed to be held. I let my pride and anger push me away from you. When all I wanted was to hold you, to make love to you. To fuck you at time like a good fuckdoll. To show you some dominance. But I was to submissive to hurt and so emasculated by you cheating and by the other men I tried to share you with. Then in  my performance that my mind was so twisted the drugs hit me hard and I couldn’t give you the one thing that we both wanted so bad. We all fall from grace. We all become depressed then self destructive. Then it seemed with you malicious that.  You know what you did. Especially when the bag was dry. Yet I’m still trying to see that it doesn’t matter anymore. We are separated and while we may be with someone. It’s not the you it’s not me. So we use that artificial love that amped up sex to feel something and think in the back of it heads I wish things could of been different. You changed so much from the girl I knew. As I have changed as well. We bitch carry our scared on the inside as well as the outside.  It’s just to bad still want to play games. You still want to lurk outside the windows. You still want to be a different person. As if we are role playing. But I am always playing myself and you some girl or some guy. The countless photos you have on your phone. The many photos you still have of me. I have so many photos due to resets and deleted images. Just because some were to hard to look at. That it wasn’t me in that photo or video. But it is your life and your kinks while similar. We never got to really open our darkest fantasies. But you always were trying to tell me more show me more and give me more experiences. I was just to stupid ,selfish, and I guess insecure that it pushed you away.  I couldn’t meet to desires or appetite. As I found my confidence, my self value. Those things changed for me.  I’m still a fuck up ,Im still asshole. But I don’t have the anger I did. But our last encounter I know I showed my old ways. I’m sorry for that. You have been through so much violence so much control. I understand the want to tell everyone to go fuck themselves and just run to the next. So wherever you are try not to be a stranger or scared.

My friend invited me to what they marketed to me as, ""our bday"" party Sunday because our birthdays are so close to each other. I drove over an hour away and when I got there we didn't do what we had discussed, they changed it to something that was impossible with my executive function (adhd). So I couldn't even participate most of the time and didn't even feel included. On top of that when I first got there, my friends fiance had on a face mask. I asked if I should put one on and they claimed it must be congestion from allegies and ended up not wearing it 95% of the party. So essentially the party sucked and I drove home excited for my actual bday plans that would be taking place Thursday- on my bday. 

Wednesday I am out grocery shopping and once I get back in my car I noticed my friend messaged me and said her fiance tested positive for covid. Cool. I had some congestion that day too. So I got home and took a test. Positive. Great. So canceled my bday plans for Thursday. Spent the day miserable.

 Today I woke up even more miserable. I have felt terrible the entire day and had been in contact with my friend so she was aware. I had to call my doc for meds, it was over $300 and now I can't work either- love that for me. I was venting to my friend about the cost and she asked if there was something they could do. I said yes, please let me know next time one of you feels off so I can decide whether or not I want to still come over or not. I even said I am not blaming either of you, I should of worn a mask when I saw he had one on. I tried to shoulder most of the responsibility. She got mad at me for it anyways though. They even responded with an mmmk 👍 So I called because... surely she is like not reading my message in the correct tone.. I genuinely wasn't trying to place blame but I am going to be fearful from visiting if they can't be clear on their health status before I drive so far to visit. 

Well long story, trying to make it shorter. She told me I was blaming them and I got really upset at this point because she was making everything about her. I ended up screaming at her told her I was irrate that she started an argument with me knowing how horrible I was feeling and told her that maybe I should blame her. Her fiance said something and I ended the conversation by saying fuck you... not my best moment. I then blocked them on literally everything and don't plan on ever talking to her again. 

But yeah lonely and miserable just doesn't even cut it. It is not looking like a good year for me.",2022-05-21 05:03:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1457986880,4,/r/lonely/comments/uug4o6/just_had_my_bday_i_have_covid_and_now_my_friend/,,0,3,"Just had my bday, I have covid and now my friend and I are done."

Shoutout to you all here btw I hope only the best for ya'll, it's a sad sad world lmao..

I have no friends, my only friend I remained in contact with from HS we've drifted apart, they're engaged, working a nursing job, and is vacationing. I live isolated on my parents property in the middle of the bush (AUS, so it's like just trees and miles of farms) against my will. My dad has taught me that not only am I not good enough and don't deserve love, but that everyone will leave me eventually unless I have an iron grip on them. I displayed some of his shitty traits and ruined the best relationship I had with this guy.. I broke it off after seeing how toxic it got, we're still best friends, but there's this jarred wall between us he doesn't see.I was feeling really depressed the other night, and it was obvious, but I felt uncomfortable talking about it to him. He tried to get me to open up, and after I lied and said I was just tired, he kinda stopped and we just kept vibing, then out of nowhere asked for a hug because he ""needed it"". It broke me.. *he* wanted a hug because *he* was feeling upset that *I* was upset and didn't want to talk about it, putting how he felt above my feelings in the moment, something my dad does all the time. It gave me a sickening feeling.. I just accepted it and pretended to be there for him like I do with my dad, and I felt dizzy like I was going in circles emotionally with any relationship I have in my life. He says he's still in love with me but understands we need to improve ourselves before trying again, but the way he's been acting makes me think he's falling out of love with me.. and what's worse is I only *think* I love him back, because I have no fucking clue how human emotions and relationships work thanks to my fucking shitty parents. I'm not comfortable talking to him about anything serious anymore, but he rarely notices when I'm upset anyway. I can't win. It truly feels like anything I do will either hurt me or someone else.

I truly do want therapy to break myself of any toxic habits and work through my issues, but even if I could afford it I don't think I could even trust another therapist.. I've been ghosted many times by them. I had to move away from my first at 16, I was with another for a year then she stopped talking after telling me to get a job because it would ""give me purpose"" (which I did, got fired because I was quote ""too nervous and jumpy"" and ""not the confident girl in the interview"" which was nice), then councillor after councillor as I was transferred to different work agencies, once I had a single session with this guy and he told me in the most polite way that I was too fucked up for his skill level.

I don't drink often, I don't smoke, I've never done drugs, I'm now an adult and still a fucking virgin too, yet my whole family treats me like a drug addict with my mental health, burdensome and pointless to help. My aunty on my mum's side is literally the only family member I have a comfortable connection with.

I am a 17-year-old male. Since kindergarten, I have been in my current school and have had the same friends for that long. We were all great friends and used to hang out all the time, until the summer going into junior year. That is when the 'party' culture started, with house parties, clubbing, and whatever you can name. I went to one with them and really enjoyed it, but for the last 3 months I have never been invited and I do not know why!?  


I like to think I'm pretty outgoing and chill. I never annoy people, really, and I don't get into fights and people say they like me at school (they say I'm funny, chill, etc.) however, when I go home, I get NO messages, calls or anything. Weekends get really lonely too, I'm just sitting at home getting no messages except randoms on Discord. I used to think they aren't messaging me cause I'm not messaging them, but that's not true-- I used to go out of my way to message people and the conversation would be short and meaningless, I realized that ultimately no one will approach me first if I don't approach them first.  


Ever since my friends got into this party mode, I am never invited. Our friend group at school is 10 people, but 7 of these people have a group chat without 3 of us where they plan parties and meetups, and I do not know why my 2 friends and I are being completely neglected. I never impose myself upon others, I drink, smoke, you-name-it and I honestly don't know.  


If they don't like me, I get it, but why do they hang out with me at school then, compliment me, and do all that, if they simply do not bother outside school? I get that people have preferences of who they want to meet but after being friends for 10+ years it's absolutely gutting to just not feel like a part of the group anymore.  


I have been told to get new friends, but that is not an option, I don't think so. My grade is small, roughly 45 people and the people who are not part of this 'friend group' have completely conflicting personalities with me, I'd say I can only get along with 1 or 2 of them-- the rest are either too far right or too far left.   


What advice do you guys have? I don't want to confront them about it as that would make me lose all my self-esteem but I'm tired of just not being invited. We were all so tight, and all of a sudden I'm not one of them.",2022-05-21 07:10:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652502282,3,/r/lonely/comments/uuhw01/feeling_so_down/,,0,2,Feeling so down

3839,uujdtr,Quiriddeas,"For starters: I am blessed with a lovely family and nice colleagues. But that's where it ends. 

I don't have friends that seem to care about me. It's always me reaching out to them.  I don't have people who love me in a different way then my family does. 

I'm gay and I recently moved out. Whenever I come home now, there's nobody. Sometimes I'm too busy doing chores to even think about that. But especially in the weekends or on some nights I feel terrible. 

I started to watch the Netflix series Heartstopper this week. First evening I binged half the season. I loved it, I was so stoked on feeling that cute 'being in love' feeling, I was actually really happy I felt something like that again.

Then the day after, yesterday, I felt like the complete opposite. The series made me realise I have never had any romantic stuff with someone.

It made it look like it is 'necessary' to have had romantic interaction as a teenager. I made me feel like I missed out. Like I failed doing what was 'normal' at that age. I know the series is 100% made up, but it still made me feel that way.

I never held hands, never sat on the couch next to someone at home, never been looked at in that way or given a cute compliment. 

I'm in my mid twenties and I feel like I'm a failure missing all these things. I know not everybody explores there romances at early age, but it mostly feels like I'm the only one in my whole area of colleagues and family.

At the same time, I am honest when I say I genuinely think there is not someone that's made for me. I don't see how that'd happen. So the ""solution"" for me being lonely is known to me, but just completely out of reach. It's eating me up.

I'm not thinking about it constantly, luckily. But when I do, it's bad. I realise that I'm getting older every day: more and more days of me missing out on romantic stuff in my teenage years/early twenties. And more and more days of me feeling not being interesting anymore because I'm getting 'too old' to start exploring things. 

I needed to vent this because I've nobody to vent this too. I hope y'all are doing better than me right now. Peace :)",2022-05-21 09:09:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592595405,2,/r/lonely/comments/uujdtr/some_days_hurt_more_than_others/,,0,4,Some days hurt more than others

but really, i just want to hear everyone say it so i can at least know that i'm in someone's thoughts. my best friend never says it because he's with his girlfriend 24/7, so he doesn't really have to miss me if he has her. my mom never says it when i'm gone or she's gone. my sister who doesn't live with me never says it. just, nobody. i never feel missed by anybody and i never feel like someone NEEDS me to be there. this is so pathetic, but... can someone tell me that they miss me? even if it's just a random redditor?

Growing up I’ve always had horrible birthdays, people tend to forget about me. As a kid my father would forget every year. in middle school I threw a birthday party, no one showed. One year my mother spent it running a garage sale instead of spending time with me. This year I’m spending it alone in my room again crying to myself. 

I’ve come to realize I’ve never been a priority to people and will never be. 

I took a week off of work in hopes of spending time with my friends and family, well I haven’t. I don’t consider myself a selfish person but I wish I had at least one person reach out and offer to spend time with me. 

All my friends have recently gotten into relationships, I’m the last single friend of my group so now Ive been feeling like I’m behind in the dating world. I’ve never had a someone that’s wanted to be with me. I’m now 25 and haven’t had someone I can really call my boyfriend. I’ve never had the urge to be with someone romantically until I had met a guy last year. I’d figured he’d like me too since we’ve been hanging out for 8+ months and I thought we really clicked. I later ended up confessing to him. Turns out he “believes we wouldn’t be good together in a relationship” so that ended. Even when I think I have someone I could call ‘mine’ I never really do. 

Birthdays have now turn into a yearly reminder of how I have no one close to me. 

I’m not looking for advice or empathy. I just want a birthday card, a cake and someone to be around.",2022-05-21 16:07:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653146900,6,/r/lonely/comments/uuq7pa/spending_another_birthday_alone/,,0,12,Spending another birthday alone

I’m 23f. Trying to keep up with an epilepsy diagnosis at 18 and a hard law school, which I hate. The diagnosis definitely slowed me down and made me sadder but I never quit. Always went to school, always studied, working out etc. But all of my family somehow believes I quit.

Today my mum broke her nerves on me. All I asked her was to cook fish because it’s in my diet and when I asked for extra lemon she just went crazy! Screaming, venting, hitting things. I kept eating quietly but gutted. 

Feeling down, I cancelled my participation in yoga class and the teacher got annoyed too. “You should have informed earlier”, my participation or not changes literally nothing to her class tho, the class has already other clients. Besides I’ve never missed a single class and I always pay in advance.

And as if all these weren’t enough, my mum hit again. She decided by herself to take me to the yoga class, although I told her I prefer to go alone. She got dressed and knocked my door and when I told her I’m not going she went literally out of her mind. Screaming again, calling me bad things, ungrateful, bitch, authoritarian, jerk etc

Being unemployed, not financially stable to just leave this madness makes every judgment from my family a toll on my mental health.

The rest of the group had kinda splintered off while I was away. 

I kinda broke. 

I maintained myself the best I could but I think my demeanor rubbed off onto everybody else.

3948,uuwa1w,fatrudygay,"It was my 26th birthday today. I asked a couple friends if they were down to hangout. They all said okay, then they all cancelled at the last second.

One of them said he is studying for a test that he will take next December. Apparently he was so busy he couldn't spare a Saturday night. Yesterday one of said we could hang out at his place, now he is bragging about inviting over some girl he knew from high school. The other two have families, one of them even has a baby boy now, so I can't blame them for wanting to spend some time with their families instead of me. And let's not even talk about my family, who will never admit that they are the reason I still haven't graduated and moved out like everyone at my age did a while ago. I took care of them when they needed me, and I still do. But for reasons I do not know they still resent me for it. I have known my friends literally half my life, and as dysfunctional as they are my family is still my family. I love them, even if they make it really hard sometimes.

Real fun part of all this is that not even one of them knew it was my birthday. Though I rather they ditch me outright rather than hang out with me just because of it. What they do know is that I had the worst breakup of my life a month ago, and nothing felt the same ever since. She was a wonderful person that made me feel truly wanted and made me want to be a better person. I wish I got to tell her that before we drifted apart for reasons that were outside of our control. Even though I don't have the courage to call her and ask how she is doing, I hope she is fine.

So you see, I don't really care about my birthday at all. I have stopped caring since they started to feel like I was getting old instead of growing up. What I do care is that tonight, I realized how truly lonely I am. And all I can think about is that it wouldn't sting as much if I was actually alone. If nobody depended on me, if nobody called me only when they needed my help. As stupid as that sounds, maybe I wouldn't feel so abandoned. It's like I've given everyone a piece of myself, and I'm not sure what I've got left within me. But no matter what, I carry on somehow.

Isolation even living around and walking in a crowded area doesn't mean anything. My punishment ensures I will not connect with any person. Telling me to keep going out and talking to people is like telling a guy who is behind bars for life to keep running at the bars in his cell because one day they will break so he can escape. The crime is I don't know but it's something bad and the punishment is life in isolation.

 I went for a walk for coffee although it's iced in this heat, and it was so crowded because of an event going on. I literally had to walk through large groups of people to get to the coffee place.

3954,uuxem9,Asleep-Ad-7223,"Me a 21 f have never been in a relationship, and I'm not talking romantically, I mean any relationships out side of family (not like family is doing any batter), and I only started to notic it now.
For as long as I remember, I never had real friends, majorty were either using me or piting me, even when I manged to get some good friend, it was only surface level and would never last, and even now, when ever I would hang out with my ""friends"" ( a batter ways to describe my classmates), I can't help but feel lonely, or worst like an outsider trying to fit in.
As for romantically, it is somehow a lot worst, never kissed any body, never hugged anybody (romantically),never hold hand, and never even been asked out, I'm in my twenties and never went on a date.
I really didn't think much about any of this until recently, when I was talking with my classmates, and they were all talking about their relationship, how all of them been in one, or still in one, even the ones who are younger or more rilegest, I felt like I'm missing out on this.
I come from a religious house, been told my whole life not to talk to boy unless it's school related, and I think I took it to a whole new level, I never had any guy friends, and the first time I talked to a boy (out side of family) was in the end of sixth grade, hell I can't even talk to them properly because I become anxious.
Right now it is midnight, and I feel more lonely than ever, I don't want to be like this my whole life, I want friends to stay with me, I want a lover, to experience relationships, even if it once, I just want to try it.
But at this point it seems like I am the problem,  not like i am a bitch, not like I'm super bad looking, but I'm a shallow person, no interneting hoppies or internet, that get the joke last, and doesn't talk a lot, and usually when I do it is not interesting, and no one listens.
I feel like I can't change, and I fell like I'm gonna end up old and lonely, I even accepted the idea my little sisters would marry before I could make a friend, and it just so depressing sometimes, to think like I don't really belong somewhere not even home, so what am I to do?.

4014,uv1nlu,Suspicious_Elk1290,"Hello everyone,
So this maybe long but I am actually desperate for some advice. Thanks for being patient with me.

Now I am not a lonely person, even when I was lonely, I usually have many hobbies that are done alone (saxophone, game dev. etc) that I really like and hence cherished the times when people did not check on me. I was actually the one who left people on read (not intentionally, just that I had a lot of things going on in my life). But all of this changed around 7 months back.

I started my post graduation in a completely different country.
I was least bothered about loneliness, as in my eyes I would be the last person to feel that way. But I have realized that I never felt this way even when I did not contact others for days, it was because I knew inside that I have people that thought about me and wanted to be with me. I got invited to many places and was generally checked upon (I also checked upon my friends regulalry, hope you are getting the point).

The past seven months have been hell, there is literally nobody that I have to talk. In my program I was the only one that got admitted and hence everybody who got admitted to previous terms already had their own friend groups. 

There was this one other person who I contacted via SM, who was going for a different program from my hometown and I thought that well, atleast I have one person to hangout with. Generally if you can even make one friend, getting a group is easier. But somehow (won't go into details) we did not hangout much and now this person has a good friend circle, but I constantly have to force connections with them.

For 7 months I have had zero meaningful interaction with anybody ( I tried, but nobody seems to hangout with me). I tried figuring out that maybe I am being too clingy, but concluded I am not. I tried getting back to my hobbies but they also do not provide any comfort. I have not even laughed with somebody during this whole time and this is taking a toll.

At first I thought I should be strong and focus on my goals etc (insta and youtube motivators), but humans actually need some kind of social life to function properly. Not a big one, but a complete void of people to talk too is apparently dangerous as one of the symptoms is my sleep schedule is haywire.

I wanted to know if you have any ideas how to approach people, I am not shy, I have just been snubbed too many times to go with the regular approach and start a convo.

Should start inititating plans on my own (it feels clingy and desperate to always be the one approaching, that too when I have nobody to bring along and the whole burden is on the person I am talking).

Or anything else???

As context the only person I follow on insta in this new city is the one I talked about and whenever see their stories I get totally disheartened. That person is of the opposite gender, so I am wary of initiating too much without getting appropriate responses as that will look like I like them romantically (which I certainly do not).

I am really tensed how long I would be able to take this anymore.",2022-05-22 02:27:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629915782,1,/r/lonely/comments/uv1nlu/urgent_and_honest_advice_needed/,,0,0,Urgent and honest advice needed.

I think love is a dangerous feeling for me because when it goes wrong I immediately feel suicidal. In some ways it’s the only thing I ever wanted. And that’s also the truest and most complete lie. Love isn’t enough for me. Nobody survives a relationship or the future off love some because love now doesn’t necessarily mean love later, twenty years down the road.

As a society I think we have never developed a the skill to choose wisely. I hope I never trust my eyes again in love because some of the ugliest and most emotionally undesirable people I’ve met are externally average to attractive looking

Maybe finishing my own goals is what I need now
I want to be better at being my own best friend

Or the pain ended me, I don’t know.

My attempt was last week. This is my second time writing here. I’m not writing for attention. I’m writing to get it off my chest, and possibly motivate others to hold on tight to life. Your life’s story may change; although, mine didn’t and most likely won’t. 

I am not going to go into the details on how I did it, but I did lost consciousness. As I was falling under, I felt tranquility. I was not scared, my heart and mind were calm… I felt that for the first time it all was going to fix itself, everything… my disease, the lack of love, the feeling of being a burden to others, to society… I thought it would all end. Then, I woke up. 

Being in a wheelchair, of course, makes everything harder. So, my caregiver found me and called emergency services. 

This is an experience I can’t describe, but it didn’t make me realize that I love life or that I’m taking it for granted. This experience instill in me that not everyone is going to live with a partner, family or even friends, some of us, will be lonely. Even if I fight it, I need to accept there are things I’ll never be able to do, but the pain is still there, and it will not come to an end until I do. 

Solitude and the effects of lacking human connection is real. It destroys everything you once were and the person you’ll never get back. In my case, I’m far too gone now. 

When I was eight years old, and my muscular dystrophy started to progress severely, I started having issues walking, I would fall to the ground every time uncontrollably, and I eventually ended up wheelchair-bounded, and my teacher said: “I am so amazed by you, even with all the struggles you’ve kept your smile and positive energy. Please don’t ever change, I knew a man in a wheelchair who was very angry all the time and depressed, please don’t ever be like that”, but I did. I did become that angry, depressed, lonely, and empty-spirited person. 

After many, many years, I kept thinking of my teacher and what she said and I would think of it, over and over, wondering why did that man changed and what made him be that way. Now that I’m older, I get it. There’s very little I can say to explain why or how, until you have live through so much pain. There’s nothing left of me anymore, and all I wish now is if I could to tell my past child-self, to not go bitter and how beautiful she was, even if no one else did.

If you have someone that loves you and you know it, even if it is not a partner, embrace them tight. Go find love.",2022-05-22 06:57:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651291545,72,/r/lonely/comments/uv5jc1/my_suicide_attempt_go_find_love/,,0,11,My suicide attempt | Go find love

Two of them formed a new group, one formed a different group, and one joined his church group. I had two left who we were all mutually our closest friends. But one stopped talking much due to personal issues and now (my college freshman year just ended) the last one is in a phase where he prefers to not talk to friends. I still keep in touch with all of them (except the last, even though i try), but now I'm no one's main friend. That is, no one takes initiative to talk to me and even when i take initiative, they often take hours to respond. Im certain theres no hidden grudges, its just that they either have gifriends, ""better"" friends, or don't talk often in general. I basically only made one friend that wasnt through mutuals in college. This has left me feeling lonely (for quite a while now, even in high school), especially when I'm reminded that other people receive texts or calls they didn't initiate.

I've tried almost everything to get some cash but it's not working. I've tried to have my own business but they fail or they aren't affordable. I submitted my resume to several jobs but they just ""call me later"" (obviously, they never call). I even tried to get money by ""selling content"" (like nudes and hot calls) but I didn't get enough money and it made me feel ashamed. 

I  have a lot of problems at home so now I'm renting in another state because of college but it's more expensive than staying at home. But if I stay at home  my stress level will just increase and I'll feel worst.

By the way I've been coping with anxiety and depression since I was 15. I used to do self harm but I tried to be sober (it's been like 10, months or maybe a year since I last self harmed). I've been seeking like 5 therapist but now I'm tired and I don't want to have therapy anymore. Even though I had some progress, I feel like it's useless and it's always the same shit.

So I replaced self harm with another things like alcohol, marijuana and medicine. Don't worry, I don't do this often, just when I feel very bad  I tend to drink or get a little high. Unfortunately, this made me take bad decisions, like stealing my grandma's Clonazepam and taking the whole bottle. She doesn't know but now she need it and I feel so bad for it.

Sometimes I feel like I need to be intoxicated to forget about my problems and if I can't get intoxicated I just replace that with physical pleasure like having a lot of sex or masturbating just to feel relaxed.

By the way my social life is a mess. I don't have any friends at college, and my only three friends are miles away and they barely talk to me so I feel so fucking lonely. I have a boyfriend but I don't want to depend on him but I feel like I'm already codependent because he's the one who's always there for me and if he's not I feel sad.

This is kind of sad and if you can’t handle that right now move on from this post. My sibling has always been a favorite in my family (they are funny, quiet) but they also are the most troublesome. They act out and cause worry and many times my parents vent about it to me (I’m the younger sibling). They only ever seem to talk about my sibling and accept them for who they are. As I grew older my sibling became more depressed and angry. And with that came self harm and suicide attempts (or the threat of suicide). Each of these things becoming more frequent whenever something has built up with them over time. And with these attempts on their life, I’ve always had to be there to talk them out of it and give comfort because my parents are never able to properly do so. My parents call me or wake me up whenever their child has gone off into the night with a lack of communication (they ignore everyone’s calls or texts).  I love my sibling, but I sometimes stay up at night thinking how tired I am of this cycle. I feel selfish. I have my own struggles mentally and to carry on those as well really adds a load, but I can’t let my sibling drown in their own sorrow. And I certainly couldn’t handle it if they died and somehow it could have been prevented. At the same time though it puts me back in this mental state that no one really cares about how I feel about dealing with so much for years (of course there is worse stuff to deal with), but I feel like I had to grow up emotionally faster than most. I don’t know maybe I’m just being weird.

4082,uv6kn5,VikingDemon793,"Since like 5 years ago I came to the realization that I enjoy being on my own. Yes I have a few friends but most of them are more like acquaintances than friends.

I'm kind of a doomer, but not in the sense that I spent the night drinking myself to sleep and crying for her or the things that have happened to me. I just don't care too much anymore. 

Since I discovered my newfound love for my own company I've come a long way. I returned to college, got my degree and now I'm in law school. I enjoy it a lot. It isn't perfect but I can deal with it so far. But the thing is that my life is kinda boring. I think of people who hangout with their ""friends"" and for brief moments I say ""I kinda want that"".

Today before my D&amp;D session I(yes, I'm an old nerd) I went to grab the mail and the only thing there was a large envelope addressed to me.  It was from Amazon and I hadn't ordered anything.  The contents felt small through the envelope.  I asked my sister if she accidentally put my name on something she bought and she said no.  I opened it up and it was a brand new set of dice from one of my sisters friends who she knew waaaay back when I was first born.  It was so unexpected and the timing was almost eerie.

4110,uva204,threwaccmylife234,"I created this throwaway account to write here since my original account can be seen by my friends.

I'm just 20 and honestly, sometimes the burden of feelings becomes a bit too much. When I read some of the posts here I see people struggling with many kinds of problems be it physical or psychological. And I understand. I understand the pain and numbness people are experiencing; not because I particularly went through similar stuff but I just can. 

For the past 7-8 months, I've been feeling more numb everyday. I still think it is not depression but something is definitely off. I feel distant from my family and friends. I usually find myself thinking if I am meant to live all my life alone or not. The thing is, I am not the guy who gets too close with people. No matter how close I am with someone, I don't tell my problems most of the time. Ironically, I know I am not alone because sometimes I browse this subreddit and see people who are experiencing similar feelings. 

For the last few years, maybe to be more exact since I was 14, my life pretty much became monotonous. Even though right now I am in college, I just go to the classes and return home or I sit with one or two people for like an hour. I do not participate in any events, I do not join any student clubs. I return to home and do the assignments and sleep. In my personal life, sometimes I get invited to go out with my friends but even when I'm going I want to be home. I feel like I don't have the energy to talk and entertain people. I just want to sit down and stay like that for hours.

Recently, I wanted to break the cycle. I know its cliche but I met a girl and I liked her. I don't know what happened, I just know that some things had to change and I wanted to do something about it. Well, I know it was a mistake since no girl ever liked me before, I was always the platonic guy crushing over a girl for some time and get rejected after first try. Nevertheless, knowing the result from the beginning, I let myself to like her. I just wanted to feel something, care about something and feel alive. I wanted to escape from the monotonous life I've been living for the past few years. I wanted to hold a hand and feel my heartbeat rising up. I wanted to go beautiful places and just sit there in silence without being awkward. I wanted to do things and have fun and most of all, I just wanted to be hugged. 

If you read until here, you can obviously guess the result. She is not interested in me. Well, like I said, I was expecting this result and do not get me wrong, I am not angry to her or anything; I just feel sad and more numb than yesterday. I know that to break the cycle I can do other things such as trying to find a new hobby or starting to exercise etc. but I can not do most of them right now due to financial issues and mental exhaustion.

Honestly, I don't know what will happen to me. My country, socially and economically, is in shambles. I was in love with my major but since last year I hate it. I don't know if I can ever get a job. I am slowly distancing myself from my family and friends. I can't get in a relationship and commit myself to someone. I know you guys also sometimes feel like this. I just want to say you are not alone. Although this is a sub meant for lonely people and as I am writing these lines I feel very lonely, I know this post will at least reach some of you people and maybe they will say 'yeah, I also feel like that and I am not alone'.

4123,uvbbon,Expert_Carpenter3197,"My 29th birthday is this weekend. I always get sad around my birthday because I never do anything and I have no friends. It’s just me and my husband (and my parents obvi) and we have a terrible marriage. We both don’t want to be together, but he won’t leave because he needs me for a green card and I won’t leave because I’m not working right now because we have 2 dogs with special needs that prevent me from working so I stay because I can’t afford to leave. This birthday is kind of important to me because it’s my last one in my 20s. It makes me reflect on my life and how pathetic I am and what a loser I’ve continued to be because I have nothing to show for the past 29 years. 

My parents decided to take a week long vacation so I have to watch their 4 dogs and I’ll be stuck at home as usual so even if I had plans I would t be able to follow through. 29 years, no degree, no money, no job, no kids (I wanted kids), shitty marriage, no friends. I’ve also recently become a functioning alcoholic; I drink every day usually start at 11 am because why not? If I’m gonna be depressed and alone might as well drink and make myself feel a little better. 

I’ve also suffered from mental health issues my whole life. When I was in high school I always thought about when I was 18 I’d finally get the help I needed because my parents didn’t believe that mental health was real and always refused to take me to see someone. But when I was 18 they removed me from their health insurance and I didn’t have the means to go get help. When I was 21 I finally got insurance and went to see someone. They diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and loaded me up with pills until a month later they stopped accepting my insurance and visits alone were $200 every other week and at the time I couldn’t afford it so I stopped going. Looking back I think I was misdiagnosed anyway because if I truly was bipolar and not on meds I’d probably be psychotic. 


Just wanted somewhere to vent because I again I don’t have friends or any kind of emotional support system. I know I’m the only one who can change my life and I’m sitting here having a pitty party instead of doing something about it, but it’s been 29 years of this and I just don’t see the point in doing anything about it now. For what? Through all of my life’s relationships I’ve never felt a real connection with anyone (friends or boyfriends) I just didn’t want to be alone. Sometimes I think maybe there something wrong with me like maybe I’m not capable of having real deep connections.",2022-05-22 13:47:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608003893,8,/r/lonely/comments/uvbbon/im_sad/,,0,9,I’m sad

4130,uvcu4l,Narashia,"I've been utterly bothered by this and I can't share it

A friend said they went through things and needed space because of it. I said it's fine, hoped for the best and only sent them one message throughout hoping for the best. Week later they removed me as a friend, reason being they still needs space and did not want to talk and then blocked me a bit later, they kept me elsewhere.

month later I decided to hit up a friend of them about my friend because i was just really worried about my friend and all, let's say that's B, my friend is A. I did hit up my friend but I can't tell if they saw it or not. I knew B a bit from a server back then.

B said they weren't so close with A as they used to be, they had a relationship until few months ago which went dirty according to her, yet they stayed friends. But they still at least talked. But as our conversation went on, when I explained my situation and why I hit her up, I felt B was kinda unhappy about the friendship with A. B felt A changed, and they also didn't really see each other in person anymore. But B was happy though for A. I guess B never was able to talk about this since she kept saying stuff related to their friendship.

Point is, suddenly B said they blocked A. Asking why, they didn't feel any friendship between them anymore. I said at least to talk it out to A but B saw no point. A heard we talked and became mad at me, presumably I ruined that friendship and/or for reaching out, basically. Even though it's a misunderstanding and miscommunication as well. My friend reacted like being angry at a headline but not reading the article. 

My friend does not want to talk about it and is just mad at me, I feel insanely guilty about all this even though I had no ill intend at all and just did reach out B because I was worried and missed A. I did not convince B either to quit being friends or even mention it, I would never try to sabotage friendships. It's their issues, I know. But I feel I scratched open a wound and ruined a friendship. I've been crying a lot and just blame myself for it all, there's so much pain right now and loneliness, I feel again I hurt someone. I don't know what to do other than at least try to talk to my friend about it (she didn't block me elsewhere after that, even) or at least ask the other friend clear things up between them, I guess some time is needed to cool off.

Hey Guys! My name is Jay and I’m an amateur photographer and tech enthusiast living in the Fort Lauderdale area since October. 

Looking for some long-term plutonic friendships with some easy-going people. I like to consider myself an interesting and funny person who likes a variety of interests. 

I’m a gay dude (married) who’s interested into photography (obviously), technology, TV and movies and a wide range of music. I can’t cook to save my life, but I love going out and trying new restaurants

4136,uve3ne,Same-Elderberry8583,"For the past year I’ve been struggling with intense loneliness. I’m not completely alone as I have the most amazing best friend one could hope for (we’ve know each other since high school, 7 years now) and an equally amazing boyfriend (my first ever BF, almost a year now), but I don’t really have anyone else in my life that I could call a friend. 

I’ve always been a loner, as a child and teenager really struggled with communicating, making new friends, but somehow I always had a group of good friends: first in elementary school, then middle school, high school and uni. Could talk to them about anything, had incredible bond, especially with the group from high school and uni. We talked practically every day through group chats about literally anything, little every day life things, serious emotional venting and issues, politics, opinions, discussions, you get the idea. Kept hanging out, made some cool memories, basically felt like I had people whom I can share everything with anytime, a stupid meme, observation, ask for an opinion, whatever. 

Sadly, it was time and being physically apart that killed some of the friendships and some fell apart due to conflicts that could not be resolved.

Currently I can’t complain about being left out, overlooked socially because I have quite a lot of acquaintances, mostly from uni. I get invited to parties, people talk to me, generally I’m on good terms with basically everyone, to the point where I like and hang out with person A who dislikes person B and badmouths them, but whom I also hang out with and like very much, and keep being put in this situation quite often. And yet it’s not friendship in any of these cases. 

No one invites me to spend time with me one on one, no one really talks to me about everyday stuff or more serious ones, it’s mostly chitchat when we stumble upon one another, no one asks me how I’m doing. It’s all very superficial, is my point, no emotional bond. I only ever talk with my best friend and boyfriend, they are the only ones who I can send silly things to, random questions and observations, vent to about little things, whom I can be emotionally vulnerable with, and who care about me as an individual being. 

I know I’m incredibly lucky to have them in my life, and it’s more than a lot of people have, but I find myself very lonely, regardless. Had a stupid idea to organise a birthday party not long ago, and it was a disaster - best friend couldn’t make it, and felt as if I was surrounded by a bunch of strangers, minus BF. Yesterday BF and I got invited to a party of my acquaintance, had some fun spending time with them, but I didn’t feel like I’m part of their circle (you could see which person is a friend, and who’s just someone they invited because they’re cool for social gatherings). Wasn’t that bad, had BF to talk to mostly, but once he went home (we don’t live together) I felt this overwhelming loneliness, didn’t know what to do with myself. Best friend is meeting up with her own friends, so I’m quite literally alone with my thoughts, emotions, and it’s very worrying. 

I feel like I won’t ever have friends again, that I’m good enough to hang out with, talk to during breaks or a ride home, be invited to things, but never good enough to be considered a friend. It’s very depressing.",2022-05-22 16:11:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653228674,3,/r/lonely/comments/uve3ne/i_might_be_likeable_have_lots_of_acquaintances/,,0,1,"I might be likeable, have lots of acquaintances but I don’t have friends"

Many people here talk about how they want some contact with anyone yet when you are offered one you just disappear. I don't know if it's me sabotaging every single chat I ever have or what is going on but I'm tired of it.

Even when I manage to find somebody I have something in common with and chat for a few days they stop replying after some time. 

Nobody ever writes the first message. People tell me that they like talking to me yet it's always me who has to do the first move. That makes me feel unwanted and like a burden.

When I found this community I was happy because I thought people here lack human contact same like me and will like to chat with somebody. Most of the people I talked to so far proved me otherwise. 

Feels like people here are not lonely. Many of you have friends, family, and partners. How can you be lonely? I know one can feel lonely even surrounded by people but it's weird hearing how you plan to do this and that with somebody close to you while also claiming to be lonely.

4174,uvk0ud,KratomFiendx3,"I am a 17 year old male who is wheelchair bound due to a number of disabilities. I experience severe chronic pain and will everyday till I am free from my physical bounds. I went to a concert with 2 friends last night, and for as fun as it was, it truly depressed me. I went to that concert with every intention to meet and talk to a female human but I didn't see a single girl that wasn't without a partner. I was seeing every other person living drastically different lives than myself, all of them had someone to love and care for. Because of a birth condition I have called cloacal exstrophy, as far as I know, I will never have children, or have normal sexual encounters. I've always known that I was very different from others, both physically and mentally, and I've known from a very young age that my life will be excruciatingly lonely. My two friends that I referred to earlier, are in a relationship with eachother, and I'm very happy that they're happy, and they are the best friends I could have ever asked for, but it's truly hard to watch them be all over each other all the time. I know that I'm young, and I'm only just getting my life started, but Jesus fucking Christ is it painful to watch everyone live normal lives. I have love in my life, none romantic at all though. I know that I must be patient, and that true intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion. Till I meet that person who decides that I'm worth their time and energy, I will be typing out my thoughts and I'll either post them here, or keep them to myself. I love every person who took the time to read my somewhat incoherent thoughts. I am in no way suicidal, nor do I even wish that I had any other life. I will keep moving forward and i will keep experiencing all that reality has to offer me, and I know that when I do meet someone, the pain and loneliness I'm feeling now will make the happiness and pleasure that much more invigorating.

ive always wanted that friend group that seemingly everyone else my age has. and i know i’m not alone in feeling like this, that there are many out there who also want the same thing. but it’s just hard when everywhere i look it’s these awesome friend groups. when the individual friends i have all have their own high school groups. and they share stories and tell me all the cool and funny things that they can do as friends. and it’s interesting and fun and supportive and i’m thankful for the individual people who stick by me but i just really really wish so badly that i didn’t just have like 3 close friends, separate from each other, but that i could just be a normal teen with a normal social life. sorry i know none of this sounds coherent im just kind of in my feelings rn

She was laughing and it made me so happy to see her like this… but it wasn’t with me. I felt so selfish and alone, especially since I caused the break up.

I don't know what to do. Hearing her talk about her friends makes me feel really lonely as I can’t relate.",2022-05-22 22:57:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1560630135,2,/r/lonely/comments/uvmfoq/ive_just_realized_how_lonely_i_am/,,0,2,I’ve just realized how lonely I am

Star wars was always a big thing for me growing up and I fell in love with the expanded universe.

4208,uvniwd,emilypad,"Hi everyone.

I finished my time at my university about three weeks ago and everyone is pretty much gone for the summer. I'm currently enrolled in a Maymester class (which I hate) at a different university than mine. It's all online on zoom so even though there's \*some\* social interaction, there really isn't any. Anyways, this will be my last week of my maymester course. Then I say goodbye to education (until I go to law school - planning to work and take a year off before law school since I want to add some things to my resume like more work experience as well as needing a mental health break as I'm healing right now from a variety of things - engrossing myself in a job is a good distraction). 

I don't want to move back home. I feel sad and lonely.  I don't know. My college isn't far away from my parent's house (40 minute drive) so I can go home whenever, but it's so quiet. Going home also brings up a lot of childhood trauma or even recent trauma (not my parent's fault, I just hated who I became since I started college, fixed a lot of my issues but still healing). My neighborhood is quiet too. Typical suburb. At my apartment, I feel less lonely even when my roommates are gone because there's constantly cars honking outside, people my age living above me being loud and noisy, people in the lobby, living in a bigger city, etc.... anyways I will have to move out in a little over a month and I'm dreading moving back home. I'm trying to find a job but I'm also crippled with depression right now. Feelings of loneliness. I just want my mom to hug me. I just need someone to talk to. My friends have all moved away. I don't know how to make friends outside of school. I hope I make friends at the job I choose to work at (only for a year), but if my collagues are all a lot older than me, then I'm lonely again. Maybe I should've just gone straight to law school out of college but I needed a mental break. I've been in school for a longggg time now. 

I want to start running again but can't motivate myself to do so. Maybe I'll join a running club, and can make friends that way. As an emerging adult - I don't know what to do, how to make friends (or get a boyfriend for that matter), and I feel lost in space and time. I can't get over my ex. 

I just need a hug.

4216,uvo370,SilkySpider912,"I really don't have anything novel to add, and I'm not a danger to myself or others, but it's just been such a long time and I still feel so lonely.

I live in an area where I don't speak the language as well as I could; while most people speak English, they typically hold it against me that I'm American, so they don't give me a chance. There's other Americans in the area, but they're by and large from a completely different walk of life from me; I've been here with my parents who fit in a lot better, but for the last 3 years or so, I've really only had one friend in the area.

It just sucks. I'm an introvert, so of course that makes it harder to meet people, but I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone multiple times; I've tried going to events, to hobbies, I mean I work as a bartender. Meeting people isn't an issue, but no matter how casual and nonchalant I am, or how excited and outgoing and hard I try, people just seem to get bored with me and go back to their established groups. I can only take being left on read so many times and still keep trying; I put in so much effort just to have anyone to hang out with casually, and they always find someone else. I don't mean this solely romantically either, I just want friends in general.

I do have close-ish friends in a sense; I consider them my closest friends, though besides one or two, I know that isn't reciprocated. Besides the one friend in the area (who is also an ex, making things more awkward), everyone lives far away. As in, thousands of miles, $750+ plane ticket away; not something I can casually afford.

It's just kind of numbing. Like I said, I try and try, but since I was 16 (I'm now almost 22) I've barely had a chance to make and keep friends, let alone do anything teens or young adults do. I feel alone in my life and I feel like it's going to stay that way, because I'll always be the same weird kid I was in high school (I'm very likely undiagnosed as autistic, having done some self-reflection).

Whatever, like I said I have nothing of value to add here. I just feel like there's no space in the world where I fit, as anything more than a superficial Thing to help people with their problems. Almost every convo I have with anyone ends with them leaving me on read. If I want to talk to people, in person or through text, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle where they couldn't care less if I'm around or not. Besides a very small number of people, nobody ever reaches out to initiate contact with me; and when I say never, I mean never, presumably because they have closer friend groups in there area.

It's just sad to see. I've gotten to the point where I feel like my only defense is acceptance and to move on and suck it up. I know people say ""you have to love yourself and be comfortable being alone first"", but I more or less do, and I am. I've been by myself mostly for years now, I'm pretty good at it; and it's hard to maintain self-confidence when, no matter how desireable I think I am, I'm clearly so easily disposable to others.

This is long so I'll stop. Like I said, I'm not a danger to myself or anything. I'm just lonely and I wish somebody would give me the time of day, and I could make some actual friends, who reach out to me because they want to, and who legitimately desire and enjoy my company. It's probably a pipe dream but I guess you never know.

Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to get it off my chest and hope maybe somebody will see it without thinking I'm an overly dramatic or emo asshole lol. I mean, I am, but I don't necessarily want people to think that. And for those of y'all already here, I hope you're all doing at least okay",2022-05-23 00:29:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651453161,2,/r/lonely/comments/uvo370/another_lonely_person/,,0,0,Another lonely person

4226,uvpc1a,llamarealist,"“I’ll never find anyone” 

“I accept that there is nobody for me”

Many of us are severely agonised because we can’t find irl relationships, but we’re also only interested in relationships that are local.

Whenever we connect online we feel sad that the person doesn’t live near us.

So why aren’t we lonely people prepared to relocate?

Why must we call it quits when we can’t find anyone within our own zip code? What about the 7 billion other people that don’t live in your country?

When you think about it, by only focusing on our local area, we are drastically cutting our chances and without just cause. Millions of people relocate to find work, friends and love.

Most of us claim to have such bleak lives that there’s honestly little reason to stay where we are. We’re miserable to point of suicide, so isn’t moving worth it?

Not just moving, but meeting people who are willing to move to us as well

        It has been many years since this feeling returned. Never in my life have I known an emotion so overwhelming and overpowering. Just the thought and presence of this emotion brings upon despair. Not happiness nor fear has such a tremendous effect on me like this one does. Neither of them terrify me to the core like this one does. This emotion is loneliness and we have yet again been aquatinted. 

        Loneliness does not feel like an emptiness. Even thought it literally is the absence of someone it does not feel like an emotion that needs to be filled. It is the emotion that does the filling. It overflows over all and triumphs all. I know the fear of it dwells in everyone. I have met it face to face today in the mirror. A horrible realization that I am without another. Nobody to spend my days, my hours, my minutes nor my seconds. Nobody to hold or talk to. It’s just me.

        I do not wish for someone to marry, or somebody to spend years with. I just wish for somebody to talk about my day or just a good morning or good night. I do not wish for extravagant wants. My wish is quite simple really. I wish to not be alone. 

        I had someone a bit ago. Somebody to message good morning and night to. Somebody to hold and smile to. Somebody to bear their burdens and be a helping hand. Someone who would listen and treat me with care. That someone is now a stranger again. And with the leave of that someone, someone new has walked into my life. This someone I have known for years prior and is someone that knows me inside out. We are well versed with each other but I dread their existence. He is loneliness and he has enveloped me. I tried to refute his grasp, I tried to turn away, blind myself, lie to myself. Only when I ponder on it do I realize… I truly am lonely.",2022-05-23 02:25:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653272484,10,/r/lonely/comments/uvq40v/i_hate_this/,,0,1,I hate this

4247,uvryrb,Lost-Object-9701,"I have attempted to talk two people out of suicide attempts. (separate times)

It worked once with a friend, but failed with an ex (she lived, thankfully). Her attempt was a result of how hopeless she felt in our relationship. I will keep that guilt for a very long time. I fear that it will happen with a girlfriend in the future. Or wife. 

One of my greatest fears is to date someone who would feel lonely while in a relationship with me (not meaning to offend the many people on this sub that feel that way- your feelings are valid). It's ironic, because I don't like to date women who have friends anymore, and haven't for several years now. I wish I could be enough for somebody (along with their own family, if that makes sense).

I feel really cursed. Probably not literally, but I can't completely stave away the 'magic thinking'. I help people in the short term, but I tend to leave a destructive wake. Whether or not there have been net-positives,.. I don't know. I really don't know. I just know that I'm fucked. There's no way that there's a true match for me (and vice versa). For various reasons.

I feel bad for saying this when I do get matches on a dating app, but I'll have you know that most matches are just an inferred 'I think you're kinda cute, but you're not stable enough to be a boyfriend,' from what I infer. No, not even an inference in all cases. And I think that even if I was, the same type of thing would happen.

I do get that some people that might seem serious, rarely, but I just don't think that there's an actual match out there for me. I have already failed.

I'm the type of person who has a very rough time working on myself, and getting over grief. 

Am I supposed to feel hope, anymore? What I want isn't realistic, and who I am is insufficient and unpragmatic.

I really miss cuddling. I want to be the dominant partner to somebody. Like, the gentle but also rough kind of dominant partner. I really do, but I just, it doesn't make sense, really, if I can't be a member of society. And so often now, I just picture myself cuddling up on a woman rather than the other way around. I guess I feel extra vulnerable or something.",2022-05-23 04:15:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642645425,2,/r/lonely/comments/uvryrb/trigger_warning_see_flair/,,0,0,Trigger warning (see flair)

4269,uvtaan,nimble_kitty,"I feel lost and hopeless.

2 years ago, my first relationship ended because I did something stupid. If you’re curious, I didn’t cheat, but I did something creepy. About 2 weeks into our relationship, I created an instagram account pretending to be a stranger and asked her a bunch of questions that I was too afraid to ask myself. The questions I asked were often personal, so you can imagine how uncomfortable she felt.

I asked her these questions on-and-off for about a month or so, until I felt super guilty about it and deleted the account. We’d constantly joke about who the “stranger” really was, because she’d always screenshot the questions and send them to me. About a year later, she made another joke about how the “stranger” could be me, and I panicked and came clean right there and then. Understandingly, any trust she had in me went away, and she put our relationship on a break, ultimately leaving me.

I can’t tell you how much I loved that girls, and how devastating it was that I ruined everything we had because I was to weak and had to hide my curiosity behind a stupid Instagram account.

It’s taken me 2 years to get over what I did to her, and I still haven’t forgiven myself. I can’t think of any memories I had with her without feeling disgusted at myself.

Throughout the past 2 years, I haven’t really hit the dating scene, other than occasionally asking a girl out that I liked only to be rejected. It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that I tried starting a relationship with someone.

My friend introduced me to a girl who seemed genuinely interested in me, so I decided to ask her out. To my surprise, she said yes, which felt surreal given that the last girl to say yes was two years ago. The next two months I’d spend dating her made me forget everything about my past. It was a breath of fresh air coming from the two years of isolating myself into a state of depression, so it’d be an understatement to say I was happy again.

About 2 months of dating later, I send her a text asking if she wanted to wander the park with me that weekend, and I got no reply. Thinking she must’ve turned her phone off, I called her later that evening, but it went straight to voicemail. I called again the next morning with no response. I was beginning to think the worst had happened, so I asked my friend if he could check up on her, but he reported that everything was fine.

The next day I waited at the park, checking my phone every minute. Desperately, I hit up her Instagram to see if she was on that, only to see “user not found.” I didn’t fully recognize that she ghosted me until I checked snap, only to be blocked minutes after viewing and replying to her story.

Once again, I had been left, only this time I couldn’t figure out why. I had avoided everything I did wrong previously, and gave her as much space and respect possible. Was she not interested in me to begin with? Am I doing something wrong? I feel hopeless. 

It makes me feel like i’m being punished for what I did. Do I deserve another chance at love? Because I don’t feel like letting another person down.

Everyone tells me that “there’s someone for everyone.” My “someone” left me 2 years ago and I don’t think I’ll find anyone else again. Was she the only “one?” Why am I so stupid?

**I am broken and really need advice right now. I need to find a solution.**

Currently I feel stuck in my relationship. I feel it hard to continue this relationship/

We were in a long distance relationship and we finally decided to meet in April. However, when it came close to the day we met, we fought a lot. And he became insecure but he did not say anything. When he arrived in my country, he had second thoughts.

And the tragic began. As he had second thoughts, he did not tell me that he was insecure but that he was flying to my province. I was happy and waited for him at the airport. He didnt come. Until I messsaged him, he said he lied because he wasnt ready. I CRIED a river at the airport. I have never thought he is such a liar.

Then, a few days later, he decided to come, but he did the same thing again. Instead of flying to my place, he flew to Japan but he lied to me that he was deported from my country because of his misbehavior and that someone robbed all his money. I was so worried for him that I flew 1000 km from my place to the airport where he was located. The guard at the airport said I might have been scammed but I scolded at him for that. He looked at me feeling sorry for me but I believed in my bf's shit.

But eventually...I figured it was another lie. Two lies in one week. It was too much for me to handle.

He said he wasnt ready and he was mentally disturbed after all our fights. He said he was afraid that our relationship would turn bitter if we continue to fight. I said okay, we need to meet to solve things out. But he still decided to fly back to the US.

I cried a lot. He did too. But i decided to give us a chance. Coz I love him. I love him so much that I decided to forgive.

\------------------------

But I doubt my decision was right. Because rightnow although I said I forgave hi, my trust for him is not 100% any longer. And I feel bitter for that....

Sometimes I cry and feel ashamed of myself. He said sorry many times and said he is going to therapy so he will be mentally ready to meet me in July, but I doubt I should meet him.

P.s: **He is legit**. Before getting into this relationship, I did a background check on him and everything he said was legit. He even showed me **his security number.**",2022-05-23 06:21:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653216893,3,/r/lonely/comments/uvtur3/i_need_advice_from_people_what_should_i_do_now_i/,,0,7,I need advice from people....

4281,uvulco,astronaprim,"Hi everyone, I'm a 19m. have a pretty good life, I won't lie about that. I have friends and family who support me. But no matter what I do, I feel like I never belong anywhere. I am a music major, and when my semester was going on, I didn't feel any connection with professors or students. I felt like I didn't belong, even with my friends and family. I always think about the negative side of things, so I can never think of the positive. I wish I could, I've tried.

I always pick one thing that makes me different and focus on it which makes my loneliness worse. I wish I could understand why I like this.

One possible reason I am liked this is the fact I have Schizoaffective Disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and a mood disorder. My hallucinations were just worse than my racing thoughts, and I wish it wasn't like this. I like being open about myself and my mental disorders, but it is hard when you're constantly reminded how different you truly are from everyone else.

I recently went to the ER for suicidal ideation. It honestly was the first time I put my mental health first over other things like school or social interaction. After I got discharged from the ER, my fear of not fitting in was worsened by my ""friend"" that picked me up. All they did was yell at me about how I should've done a certain action. Just made me feel worse about myself and made me feel even more alone than before.

I just want to feel like I belong somewhere for once. Anything to give me hope in my life.",2022-05-23 07:15:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1550724525,1,/r/lonely/comments/uvulco/always_feeling_alone/,,0,0,Always feeling alone

4326,uw1uji,CarrotTopFool,"So let me preface this by saying this is a throwaway account but this venting is 100% real, just don’t want it polluting my main account is all. So I’m in my mid 20’s, lost every friend I’ve ever had for multiple reasons, family more or less hates me for their own fair reasons (we still love each other tho, I mean from the cradle to the grave they’re all you’ve got), dead end job, have been depressed for the last 14+ years for multiple reasons, struggling thru school, can’t seem to stop wasting money on stupid things, never know when to stop rambling, I overeat and don’t really know when to stop eating (I’m only like 20-30 lbs overweight but not completely unhealthy), and I’m terrible with talking to people.

To clarify more on certain parts, throughout middle school and high school I was bullied for reasons I never really understood, sure I was awkward and a loser who didn’t know the first thing about making and keeping friends but I still tried the best I could. Had gum spat in my hair multiple times, beaten, bruised, battered, had a fake girlfriend for a while who’d show me chats from other people in our class showing how worthless a person I was (saying things like “damn that loser can get a girlfriend and I can’t?”, “I kinda feel bad for her”, and “here comes the creep, poor girl”. Worst of all she was the one who was in those chats, showing me all of this. The end of that was when she cheated on me with her eventual prom date that year, saying I allegedly refused to go with her when I can’t recall her ever saying she wanted to go in the first place, this was all when my grandmother had just passed so yay my luck I guess. Ever since I haven’t dated anyone, granted her and I never went out on a legit date, we were in high school and I didn’t have a car or anything to really offer, so it was kinda doomed from the start.

I’m kinda the black sheep of the family, which I don’t personally mind tbh, it’s nothing I can or really want to change. Yes we’ve had many many arguments and fights over the years, I have too many siblings and they’re all so much better than I am academically, socially, just every way imaginable. Personally I’m fine not being anyones favorite son or brother, I was never really in the running. I know even tho they hate me, they moreso hate what I am, some loser with no friends, no social life, no real opinion on any important matter, can’t relate to anything they like, I’m just kinda the outcast of the family, but if they really hated me I probably would’ve been disowned long ago yknow.

Money problems are just kinda par for the course here, everything’s expensive nowadays I mean look at gas prices. Depression just ruins peoples lives, it’s a matter of whether you’ll let it eat you alive or if you’ll beat it into the ground. Due to depression tho I overthink everything, normal everyday convos, how people really feel, whether I’m really helping someone or not, what I should and shouldn’t eat, what to wear, etc. etc. I recently lost my best friend of five years over my new job that I was practically forced to take, she didn’t agree with the position I took even tho the position I applied for isn’t the position I’m in. My boss basically said “oh you’re going to be working with this floor instead since I think you’ll do much better with this side instead”, in other words I have to suck it up or I won’t have a job. I hate it but it’s better pay, good benefits, everything I need to survive, just not what I want to do yknow. 

Another thing about my job is I worked with a really cool girl that I grew to have feelings for (I believe she had feelings for me first, many clues being thrown here and there, my best friend who was also friends with her at the time said I should’ve asked her out, the signs were basically all there) moved to Night Shift on a different floor entirely so I will never see her again (probably). I admit I missed my chance if I had one to begin with, but I just can’t seem to move on from it, anytime we had ran into each other it was like nothing had changed, we get along really well, our overall vibe was positive, she’d normally be the one who would seek me out at the most random times, but time keeps going by. I have her number and we text every now and then but I have to start he convo nowadays, it’s such a weird feeling right now, it really does feel like I missed any chance I had if I even had one. I know I should just give up on it but deep down I don’t want to, it’s not fair to her at all to bug her if I am or to even keep trying when she could already be over it, let alone the possibility of it all just ending up with “she was just being nice, she had no feelings for you” situation the whole time yknow. But that’s more of me overthinking things again.

My future is in serious question here, I know I’m going to have to take care of my parents and brother when they get older (that’s a long story in itself) basically meaning I’m on a serious time crunch. I’m still going to school to try and get into a better paying job to support not only myself but my family, I’ll have to throw my life away (if I manage to get one) to focus on taking care of them full time. It’s not like it’s forced or anything, my brother will physically/mentally never be able to take care of himself and my parents are getting up there in age so I’m seriously running out of time. Its freaking me out so much, I’ve wasted my life doing nothing but wallowing in my own depression instead of trying to do what I want to do and now my hard deadline to get a life, maybe get a wife, my dream job, have kids of my own, all of that is slowly slipping away from becoming a feasible possibility. At the end of the day my fate is fast approaching, I’m stuck scared cuz I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing, all because I let it consume me. But it’s on me at the end of the day, even tho I’ve had people around me my whole life I’ve never let anyone know my true feelings, I’ve never tried to fix them, it’s my fault I’m like this. No one can fix you but you after all, it’s my burden, I’ll forever be alone if not in my head in reality.

4364,uw6qon,EyeRawKnee,"Hello. This is my very first post on Reddit. I usually avoid bother people, being an annoyance is my greatest fear, but I'm feeling exceedingly bad as of late and since I have no one, absolutely no one to talk to in person, I thought that I could perhaps find some solace writing here. As the title says, I'm 29 years old and I only know loneliness. I spent all my childhood and teen years utterly isolated from the outside world with my relatives, not well-adjusted people. I grew up with my mother, her parents and an half-brother of hers; my father was out of the picture. None of them worked, we lived off welfare checks. I was not allowed to hang out with the other kids, because... I don't really know why, they simply really didn't want me to. School was my only escape, so holidays meant weeks and months all alone; no pets either. The only peer I had was a slightly older cousin, who suffered from extreme anger management issues and frequently, and savagely, beat and humiliated me in front of our relatives, who couldn't care less about it; I soon learnt to not cry and seek help from them because that only resulted in further emotional abuse. Nowadays only my mother and the ""uncle"" remain, my grandparents are dead and my cousin is now an upstanding citizen, with a good blue-collar job, a wife and a home. I, on the other hand, am a depressed NEET loner living precariously in a rented home alongside the aforementioned duo, still as uncaring and emotionally abusive as ever. I am not graduated, I have very little work experience, mostly dead-end jobs as a back-office assistant, and I'm scared shitless of social interactions. In my almost three decades of life I've never had a single friend, I'm still a kissless virgin with no experience with women whatsoever, and whenever I find myself around people I shut off completely. About six months ago I began attending an Association in favor of people struggling with depression in search of work; more recently I contacted a psychiatrist and started a cycle of therapy. All good news, and I'm grateful for them, but at the same time I am becoming more and more certain that there's ultimately no hope for me. All the other people attending the Association have so many interesting stories to tell. Stories about family members, friends, romantic partners... about their travels, their years in college, their hobbies... and I have nothing. I never actually lived, and it shows. I only know loneliness, boredom, traumas, and an infinite sadness. I hate hearing all these stories and not having one to share. Also, I think it's because my lack of self-esteem, but I constantly crave validation: I'm crazy jealous of the attention the other guys receive, and always feel like I'm treated differently. I'm in a bad mood all the time and there's nothing I wish for more than being consoled by someone, but no one does. Sometimes I try to speak to the other associates about how I feel and my history, but I get cut off every time. The Staff isn't paying me attention, either, eventhough I am always eager to help them with their work (within my limited capacity). My therapist should help me with my social anxiety, but I feel like this is hopeless too. As I said, no one seems interested in me and who I am, no matter how many times I try get close to people. And if I can't seem to be able to befriend someone, how could I ever hope to find love? I would have liked immensely to know what affection and intimacy are before my death, but this is just crazy talk I'm afraid. What could I offer to a woman? I've yet to find a work, I don't have a family, or a car, or a house, and my ineptitude and lack of social development make me a boring, uninspiring and unpleasant company. These thoughts keep me awake at night and borderline apathetic during days. I simply don't see a solution, my future is grim and there's little I can do, besides working on myself in the feeble hopes that there's a decent individual buried inside me. Sorry for the huge wall of text, hopefully it isn't too much time-consuming to read.

4367,uw7637,throwaway783421678,"Hi! So yeah I’m 20 years old and have zero true friends, yeah I have a couple of friends I’m close with from high school but since we started college and went our separate ways, we only loosely keep in touch here and again. While I won’t say I’m dead ugly or Mr. Universe kind of attractive, I will say I think of myself as conventionally attractive: had a quick fling and a relationship but nothing recent.

I’ve done what everyone says, be outgoing, go up and talk to people, be genuine, get out of your comfort zone. I’ve done all that and more, yet nothing. I’ve realized I’ve always kind of been like that. Never have had many friends, with periods of having nobody. I try to be my best self, talk about my interests, get involved in the community, and so on, but still nothing.

I’m not one to self loathe, but I am one who thinks self awareness is key. I’ve never been anyones best friend, and honestly I wonder if anyone has thought of me as a friend. I try telling myself once I get to college (currently in community college transferring in the spring) that things will get better but honestly I’ve been telling that to myself before with the same result. I hope that I will be with a good friend group someday but honestly I’m not holding my breathe.

I constantly try to better myself, both internally and externally yet still nothing. I’m coming to the realization that I’m just going to be one of those people who don’t have friends and just kind of float through life. I don’t blame anyone, you can’t force a friendship or relationship.

4379,uw8vtl,AdPersonal499," I am sometimes jealous of her. and I know it sounds terrible that I even hate myself sometimes for it, but she has a way that reminds me how terribly lonely I am. That is of course not intentional from her side, but it still hurts regardless.

I have been alone since ever. Even in my childhood, I rarely had friends. That is not to blame on anxiety but on my laziness to make friends because I simply enjoy my own company and I don't really like people. However, The attention and love my best friend gets in an hour are probably more than I will ever get in a lifetime. Someone confessing his love to her is almost like a routine to her at this point. This makes me really insecure because why can't that be me? Am I really that undesirable? What's wrong with me that the attention and love I got since birth is probably equal to what she gets in a day?

I mean hell, even my mom left me when I was young, see how funny it is? That I couldn't even be loved by my own mom while there are people who attract whoever they wish. And I am supposed to actually believe that everyone is lovable and that everyone is equal.

It is not that I want numerous friendships or a relationship. But hell, it would feel a lot nicer if I felt loved or wanted. I mean I bet if I and her were to drift apart she would have no memory of me due to how full her life is of people. I want to want to crave connections if that makes sense.

4391,uw9r24,[deleted],"recently, my boyfriend of 5 months (almost 6), broke up with me. i really don't understand why, honestly. i would assume it was because there were moments in our relationship where i expressed wanting to be sexual with others. i'm hypersexual due to trauma and having bpd (borderline personality disorder). he knew all of this. and while he didn't like this particular thing about me, he was willing to overlook it for me.

he made me feel special. really special. both of us opening up about things we wouldn't just share with anyone. there was a deep bond there. he made me feel extremely loved. at 28 years old, i've never been in a real relationship before. typically guys just want to use me for sex. he was different. he made me feel loved, wanted, desired, and cared for. he was my person. we could be ourselves around each other.

the last week or so, he had become more distant. less talkative to me. and then yesterday he said he wanted a break. i'll admit, i lost my shit. went straight into a bpd rage + spiral. i was suicidal, i self medicated, wanted to cut myself...all the things. he abandoned me. he promised he wouldn't. just a day or so earlier he said he wanted to be with me forever. 

i can't breathe. i've never been so in love with another person before. this heartache is unreal. i'm starting to wonder if this is my life. always being broken hearted by guys. only being good enough to be used for sex. maybe i am just a whore and need to embrace that. seems to be the thing guys only like in me; what i can do for them sexually. it seems as if that's all i am good for.

i truly loved this man. i don't know what i did wrong. i wish i knew. i wish i could figure it out and make it better. but i'm sure he doesn't love me anymore. i'm nothing at all. 

all i have ever wanted in my life is to be loved. not just a body used for sex. i wanted real love. a real relationship. i don't think i'll ever find it again. i don't want to find it again. he was it for me. it was perfect. i feel like this grief will eat me alive.

i self medicated last night and was truly bummed when i woke up this morning. feels like there is an elephant sitting on my chest. i feel numb. i can't function. hardly eaten or had something to drink. i just feel utterly devastated. i truly did not see this coming. my entire being hurts and i just want to curl up and die, honestly. i don't think it's ever gonna get any better.

i loved him so much. i still do. i love him so much i would die for him. 

guys always leave me. abandon me. they say i'm too much to handle. guess they're right. 

all i can keep thinking is that naomi judd was brave and i wish i could be that brave, too. because i have no reason to go on. my body physically hurts. i just want to die.",2022-05-23 20:37:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,,17,/r/lonely/comments/uw9r24/not_sure_how_to_continue_in_life/,,0,14,not sure how to continue in life

I'm now in my thirties. Do some odd jobs from home to avoid human contact. I've never known friendship. Never had any relationships. I've gone through every phase imaginable. Anger. Hate. Sadness. Acceptance. And it all just goes in a loop. There's only one thing I know for sure.

I'm in pain. 

Though I've never known what it's like to not be alone, so I still hurt because of it. Always. Every day. And this rejection by people and society has lead to me also being a failure as a person for being unable to get a decent job.

I hurt. I hurt so bad and I don't know how long I can carry on. The world is a cold, dark place full of cruel, uncaring, nasty people, and I don't belong in it. I've spent decades now trying to figure out what to do and more and more, I'm coming to the conclusion that I'll never know what companionship or even friendship is.

Someday I'll die and rot alone in my home. Not a single person to care. Not a single person to mourn.

I’m doing ok now, not as suicidal as I was a couple months ago but the loneliness is really getting to me now.

I’ll admit that I do suffer from depression and anxiety so I’m the friend who is always a wreck and probably not the first choices to hangout with but I know how to hold it together, I think.

Even here like, no one else to relate. If I'd talk to someone it probably would make me feel a lot worse or not makeaa difference. Because I don't feel any connection or understanding. They just talk shit, try to justify other people, don't really take seriously, don't see things as bad as they are, don't care or not enough, they just don't relate. Or they say sexist shit. Or this or that. I'm sick of it all. It feels so utterly alone to not relate to anyone. To not having anyone to talk to who'd he actually helpful. To feel so alone, so left behind, so hopeless, nothing you can do, it's worse thanwwalking on a wire on such long fall. I'd rather do that. Anytime. It's also very difficult to explain what I feel.

Hi I am a female I am 19 years old, and i've just got to rant as i've got no one else to talk to. I am so lonely, all I seem to do is to go to work come home, and see my bf, and it is the same repetitive cycle is making me go insane. When i'm at work I don't want to be there, most people are older than me, I am 19, there is a girl my age there but the relationships I have are mostly work based and  professional, I don't know how to break the ice with her, or click with her. I just want to get home and lay on my bed and feel anxious and nervous in work constantly, and just not my usual talkative self. I have applied to uni next year, but there are several months till then and I can feel my mental health spirrling neing stuck in the same repetitive cycle and I don't know what to do about it. I'm also scared about going as I feel stupid writing this, but I know uni has a massive drink/ drug culture, and I do want to go out and have run, and not spoil the fun, and meet people, but due to having ptsd, drinking often makes my symptoms worse, and i'm worried about not meeting people and not fitting in due to this. 

I know I am so lucky to have a bf, and he is my best friend we have been dating for a year and I love spending time with him, he is my friend as well as my bf, and I love him a lot. However I crave female friendship, not a massive group of friends but a small close group I spend time with. My bf has so many friends from childhood, and I feel so selfish for writing this, but I feel so almost jelouse when I hear him talk about them, and meet up every night, not cos I want to be with him (we are kinda long distance ish and live an hour away from each other, so see him once a week, or less.) But because I crave close friendships like that. In school I was bullied by my friends (secoundary) and had social anxiety in primary school, so I have barely any close friends from school. In college I made some mistakes and was not nice to people, so I guess this is kinda karma for me. I have massively chnaged since then (2 years ago.) Anyone who I was friends with has moved on that I met in college. I just want a close friendship that lasts. I'm so happy for him but I don't want to be one of those girls that relys on my bf for friendship. I am almost embarrased to tell my bf i'm lonely, as I feel ashamed as he has all these friends, so I feel I have no one to talk to.Any advice or just a chat would be appreciated sorry for the long rant !!",2022-05-23 23:29:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642793585,1,/r/lonely/comments/uwdcm8/all_i_want_is_a_close_female_friend_to_connect_to/,,0,1,All I want is a close female friend to connect to

I’m a 26yo male.
I’m married (4 1/2yrs).
I’m Christian (23yrs).
Best friend… moved on.
There’s more to me of course, but probably the most helpful…

Why do I feel so neglected? 

My wife is a very busy extrovert. I’m a somewhat depressed introvert. She’s not home a lot. We both serve a lot in the local church never mind the 3 jobs she works and the 60hrs (including commute) a week that I work at my job. So we’re both busy. I think another big problem of mine is that I lead two small groups. One at church and one at my job (additional to what I’m actually paid to do). My small group at church has all but dissolved that I’ve been teaching and leading for 5 years now and nobody reaches out to me. They have either left and not said anything or just became so distant. Just came off the heels of teaching about vulnerability and transparency and nobody wants to get close i guess. The small group at work is higher stakes and I’ve only been doing it for 5 months in contrast. Unfortunately I inherited the group that already had attendance problems. So, all of the quality of life improvements my group is supposed to make to our work community is all falling on me. I’ve felt burned out and fighting it for 2-3 years now, but man I’m breaking.

I could go on, but this is long already. I don’t have anyone to bear my burdens with (perceivably). I suppose I should add that my wife and I fight a lot. She has childhood trauma and doesn’t communicate emotions well. I’m an emotional person and my emotions frustrate her because she has so much trouble processing her own as it is. So I’m usually helping her and taking “body shots” in the process.

I was not meant to post this vent but I'm dealing with some stuff in real life which made me post this. I might be the youngest in this community but whatever. So, here you go.

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty much feel lonely most of the time. Toxic friends who will lead me to bad things. Got Nobody to share your feelings or things with in your everyday life. I even have summer vacations starting in 3 days. And I'm pretty scared of it, like what will happen to me in those holidays. I also have social anxiety, I don't like going out most of the time since I think what will others think of me, what are they talking about me in the back (even if nobody does)... Whenever I go to my ""toxic friends"" for chatting, they pretty much straightforward become mean or rude at me. Even 100% of my classmates message me because they have some query to ask or they're just sending a few unfunny memes. There was this girl Whom I used to hangout with irl (not anymore) and others started teasing me and started saying bad things of her in the back. I totally didn't like it. I have online school (had offline school like some weeks ago) these days which is totally bullshit and is stopping me from gaining my confidence again (as I used to have before lockdown). I can't wait for having offline school again. I barely have any hobbies, I code most of the time but also I rage quit it because I cannot deal with those errors. After offline school hours, I see everybody hanging out with there friends or there partners(gf/bf). And here I am, travelling alone from school to home. I feel very jealous of them. I also wish that I had someone like that irl, who will always be there for me, who can feel How I am feeling right now and console me. Not being desperate here or some but yeah. There are toxic people in most of my surroundings so it's quite hard to find the right one. I pretty much don't even have hopes for it that I will come to a good life which I used to have before Covid Pandemic. I was alone these 2 years since I never had anyone to talk, I also felt left out. Even everybody makes fun of me, my looks and everything by which I pretty much feel discouraged and my hopes fall.

4475,uwkixl,theguns0112,"One of those nights where I’m up late with thoughts and figured I could just let off a little stress.  Outside of my 3 family members I don’t have really anybody.  No friends, no girlfriend and it’s rather isolating sometimes.  It’s even more of a kick to the gut when you try to put yourself out there, out of your comfort zone to hope to meet people you can fit in with or find someone to share all the love you know you have to give.  

I’d love to have someone to share experiences with, to laugh with, to love, and to just experience what a true trusting relationship is.  I’d love to have friends that hit me up wanting to hang out or are genuinely happy to spend time with me.  I’m only 20 years old and I know to some that means I have all the time in the world and I shouldn’t fret.  I had no relationships in school, no friends in school that actually amounted to anything.  And I thought for sure things would change upon work or school.  I’ve been in the work force for over a year with absolutely zero change.  I start school this fall and I have a feeling it’s going to be the same show but in a different place.  

I love myself, I do.  I workout and thoroughly enjoy bettering myself.  I love playing video games, reading and writing novels, watching shows, movies, anime.  I love hiking, painting and so many more things that I would love to just share with a gf or friends.  People always say just be patient, there’s friends and girls out there for you.  I waited 16 years and in the last 4 decided to pursue them instead which has left me in the same boat.  I’m not sure why it’s difficult to create relationships when other people make it seem so effortless and easy.

4481,uwlx8g,[deleted],"Today was a goodbye for one of the chapters of my life and all the people in it, and I realized after ten years I had made no meaningful relationships, none important enough to matter. Even the ones I thought meant the world to me, was apparently not the case for them. I was just another side character. 

I am not the main character in anyone's story, except my own I guess. I was just the ""that one girl who loves poetry"" or "" this friend of mine likes to hack"" I just never understood them... It feels like they're all speaking another language that I can't seem to comprehend... I can't behave like them or act like them I feel so... Different.

4483,uwm19n,ScarIeen,"So I’m a very lonely person. I have no friends like at all. I’ve learned to come to terms with it. For about three or so years I haven’t had any friends and just some family members. The thing that bothers me is that when I just meet someone I can’t stop thinking about them.

It always happens to me. I mostly don’t meet people in real life, I’m just too shy. Over the internet AKA video games I’m myself. I still manage to stay alone even through video games but that’s not even the point. The point is that every time I play one match with someone or have a friend request I go to sleep thinking about them nonstop like I’m obsessed.

Today I was playing ranked arenas in Apex Legends. I met this group of two guys. One of them was a real jerk but he stood out. He was sexist, rude, probably racist too. He was good at the game though. He kept making snarky comments at me and flirting as well (as literally every guy does). We won the game, they were pretty good. So I partied up with them. The whole time he kept referring to me as “bitch”. I’ve been struggling from the lack of teammates recently so I stayed and dealt with it so I could rank up (which I did). 

After our 2nd match his friend wanted to play so I just left the party. I received a friend request from him and accepted it. Played a couple more hours and went to bed.

Trying to sleep I keep thinking about this dick. Thinking about what I could’ve said or why I did something. Reliving our conversations. Why? Why do I do this? This guy was a total jerk and I don’t know why I can’t stop thinking about him. 

This has happened to me before. There’s nothing special about this guy. This ALWAYS happens to me. I meet someone over the game and then stay up half the night thinking about them.  Does anybody know why this happens to me?  Is it because I have no friends? Am I that desperate?? Why do I do this?

I told someone on a dating ap that I would go on a date and I haven’t responded since (10 days). I know, I’m horrible. I just can’t pinpoint what’s wrong . I’m not happier without someone , but the idea of kissing a lot of frogs isn’t worth it. I’m terrified I’ll die alone , but I’m equally terrified of heartbreak. 

Since I’ve accepted that fate isn’t real, I’m having a hard time with love. No one is just going to knock on my door and be my soulmate or bump into me randomly at the supermarket. I have to make an effort , but whenever I try.. I decide to do something else instead.

4496,uwmpx3,themicroscientist," So, This all started a year ago when I found a gorgeous girl on Facebook as the mutual one with my friend. I saw her on People you may know section multiple times more than 20 and finally, I added her. She didn't accept me back for a while because of my creepy fake-looked profile picture. After uploading my selfie one as a profile pic, she accepted me back. But I didn't start any conversation yet. I checked a little bit about her personal information and found that she's 1996 born and I'm 2004 born. So, the age gap between us is 8 years. She's so pretty with beautiful lips shape and cheek that made me fall in love with her. She hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Chulalongkorn University and I'm nothing compared to her. Just a 18 years old impatience, stubborn nerd passionate in Maths and Physics without having any Degree. That's what makes me rejected myself from her. I claim myself as the one who doesn't deserve any of her feeling because of those differences mentioned above. That's why I didn't start to text a message to her. I know that I can't be with her in real life. So, I created the exact same person of similar appearances and personalities in my own imagination. Now, I'm able to have the sight of her beautiful look in my occipital lobe every single second. Even if i don't deserve her love in reality, I should be able to get one in my imagination. I talk to her. I seek advice from her. I argue with her and I love her so much. I know this would be seem as a bit strange and mental instability, but I don't wish her to disappear from my imagination. This is getting worse and worse. What should i do?

4508,uwocjh,Garryten10,"Hi! A few years ago, I wrote a song about being lonely, and it is available on different music stores(such as Spotify)  if anyone is interested. 

2019, I came to a new class in high school. In fact, I am always anxious to meet new people, yet I still told myself “it will be just fine”. 

But, it was not fine, not fine at all. Everyone already had their own friends, own circles, so the classmates barely talked to me at all. 

At first, I thought it surely takes some time for me to find my “friends”, but it did not work out.

I went to the principle and asked for help(changing to another class), but he said no, he said it requires a lot of time to change a student to another class, also, he said I was there to learn, not to make friends...😅

During that period, I was afraid, anxious and depressed, besides, I was afraid to eat lunch alone.

One day, I had a panic attack; after school, I went home and wrote this song - A Corner.

Since I was always sitting far back alone during every lesson, next to the door, and beside the corner.

Luckily, I went to the curator after a panic attack, she saw how depressed and heartbroken I was, therefore she convinced the principle to change class for me, everything went better since then.

Here comes the song, hopefully the lyrics tells what your inner voice(your heart/mind) really wants to say. 

Take care and stay strong!!!

I hope that you are well. I've been struggling recently. My spouse and I have separated. We're being amicable about it, which is great, but now the loneliness is front and center.

Everyone else lives far away so it's just me and the dogs in this big empty place. I have some very good friends but they're all so busy. So I spend most days just beating myself up or staring at walls.

I grew up on an island and like most of my friends I left the island to study abroad. I made new friends in Brighton, UK and had a pretty good time for a while. 
Unfortunately my father passed away unexpectedly and COVID made us transition to online learning, which I really struggled with, so I went back home and changed careers to something I enjoyed more.

The trouble is, all of my friends are still abroad, both the new friends I made and the old ones who are still studying or now working away. I still see them on holidays when they come back but now I find myself having to rebuild my friend group from scratch.

This would maybe be fine if I had ways of making new friends but I no longer share a flat (I stay at home with my mum) and by the nature of my new course, all of the people there are super nerds who never want to hang out (or maybe they just don't want to hang out with me :(    ). And unlike the English uni I went to, there are no clubs, societies, activities etc. Ive never felt lonelier in my life and it really feels bad not seeing anyone on weekends, and now summer is coming and my friends won't be here till July.

4553,uwyhik,FarmerCrazy3401,"First of all i want to say there's no real guide to this.   
Everyone is different &amp; therefore have different circumstances.  


But a lot of people seem to think they are lonely and think that they're down and therefore their life isn't worth it at all. I'm simply a conveyer &amp; i'm here to give you some advice that works/helped for me. To feel less lonely &amp; no it's not going to work for everyone or in 123 just like that, you're going to feel like this for a while still. But here's the deal if you want to stop feeling miserable atleast try it out for yourself. Don't just sit there and don't try it. You have nothing to lose right? Try it out! :)   


So for me personally, I feel alone whenever i have no one to talk to, i fixed this by ""gaming"" but whenever i don't game i have that same loneliness again. I think a lot of you feel the same. It's actually funny &amp; there's a very simple solution to this. No i won't ask you to stop gaming because that doesn't work. It didn't work for me either. Instead i ask you to only game for a few hours so if you game all day like i did. Just game for half a day and cut it down whenever you feel like it. \~set a timer.  


The reason why gaming for me personally have such an influence in feeling lonely in real life is because of dopamine. The feeling of happiness.  Whenever i game, i talk with other people and engage myself within the same context getting that next level or trophy. This makes real life conversations awkward most of the time anyway &amp; the only way to fight loneliness is to game.   


It's an addiction, just like there are people with an alcohol addiction or cocaine addiction. They're after the same kind of drug. There's dopamine in alcohol and there's dopamine in cocaine.   


There's also dopamine in music for example or if you watch/do activity on ph..  


To me personally i had too much dopamine so i had to cut down on my dopamine levels. Simply by cutting the amount of time that i game / look on my phone for social media.   


But to you it might be different like you can also have too little dopamine &amp; that will create problems such as;   


* You lack motivation, “the drive.”
* You're tired.
* You can't concentrate.
* You're moody or anxious.
* You don't feel pleasure from previously enjoyable experiences.
* You're depressed; you feel hopeless.  


The problem in a depression is:  

* Low mood/low interest in activities enjoyed previously: ...
* Trouble concentrating: ...
* Changes in appetite or sleep: ...
* Feeling hopeless/worthless: ...
* Thoughts of suicide.   


Having too much of Dopamine like me results in;  
 

* Anxiety.
* Excess energy or mania.
* Increased feelings of stress.
* Insomnia.
* Aggression.
* Hallucinations.

So either way, i'm not asking you to become a drug user or any of that kind but by either raising your dopamine levels or lowering your dopamine levels will help a ton to your motivation and or well being.   


Detoxing dopamine is however extremely hard, so when you're detoxing be sure to take your time with it. As for making up dopamine more, be sure to not get addicted to the dopamine that you're following.   


Basically i'm asking you to balance your life. Don't go and binge watch all the series or episodes that came out of 1 season instead, just watch an episode a week. or an episode a day &amp; do something else.  


I hope this helps for some of you people, it helped for me personally. If you have any questions please let me know. I tried to leave out most nsfw stuff related info of dopamine but if you're interested in that please google it! I can't say anything about that here though. But yeah, it does also something regarding your well being ;)",2022-05-24 19:10:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600244235,7,/r/lonely/comments/uwyhik/how_to_be_less_lonely/,,0,0,How to be less lonely.

I thought one of the girls who sat with me at lunch was my friend but then I realized they ignored me every time they were talking with our group. I know this is going to sound selfish but I’m going to be honest since nobody here knows who I am anyway. The worst part is they are good friends with my “closest” friend. 

They talk to each other so much and seem to have way better conversations. In my opinion it’s inconsiderate to blatantly show your favoritism for one of your friends in front of your other ones. This is how I’ve felt with acquaintances I’ve had in the past too. I sense an almost spiritual love they have with others that I’m not getting between me and them. I’ve never been able to connect with someone like that. It doesn’t help that I’m possibly neurodivergent and will probably not be able to connect with most people that way(or maybe my idea of true friendship is wrong),feeling more alone.

4599,ux6l1n,pvini07BR_,"I'm a teenager with asperger syndrome, which is an low-spectrum autism, which gives me the struggles of socializing with others.

I always I've been used to make friendships on the internet, because it's easier to find people like me. But in real life, those people are all scattered, and you're limited only to where you live. Maybe this is why I never had too much friends, or genuine friendships before. My life was, and still is, only about getting on my PC on the entire day and only getting out of home to get done my routine. No friends to even hang out. My life is so boring... Virtual friends on the internet aren't enough to fullfill my loneliness.

Before the pandemic started for me in March 2020, I had a small social life on school, with my 2 best friends, and some people I used to know. I don't even remember how I met them. I used to feel at home at that school, And I was used to the place I lived before. Everything seemed to be perfect, I was happy and I didn't knew it was the last days. Just before the pandemic started on my country, I had one of the best birthday parties of my life. All of my friends came to the party, we had fun. But, weeks after that, the hell started. I could never leave my home, I was starting to develop a constant feeling of loneliness and lack of companionship. Even though I had my parents and family, they're not the same as having friends. And to things get worse, due to hormones, I also started to develop an strong desire to have a girlfriend. Hugging, kissing, loving and laying with a girl. But I knew this was impossible due to the current situation I was in. And as time passed, I started to become more and more paranoid about socialization in general. I started to create a lot of theories on my head, on what I should do and etc. I started to become desperate, and the desire of a girlfriend getting more and more stronger. And I was not the only one. One of my best friends also started to suffer the same.

On the next year, in 2021, in the beginning, in school, I started to become hypnotized by a blonde, blue-eyed girl on my class. I started to try hard to become at least her friend, but I failed. She gave more attention to her friends than to me, and when I discovered she already had a boyfriend, I just gave up talking to her and I started crying. This, is when I learnt the lesson to never hypnotize yourself because of appearence. And thinking about it, a relationship with her wouldn't go right, because we're very different.

And to get even worse, **my dad died from COVID-19 on February 2021.** And then, I had to switch school **after** **11 years** studying on the same school, and switching residence **after 7 years** living on the same place. My life started to turn upside down since then. I had to move to my grandma's house, and I didn't like living in there. I had to be on a bedroom where there's barely any sunlight, there's no windows, it was very hot and moldy. And I was, as always, on my computer every day, for the entire day. And after some months, we eventually moved to another condominium, and I'm still living there as the time I write this. In between this time, peridiocally I had some visits to the psychologists, I talked everything about what I was feeling, and also was feeling very paranoid about socialization. I never understand how a simple conversation happens, how friendships are stabilished, and how do you like someone, I just can't. I can't like anyone, and I haven't even the courage to even try, because I knew nobody would give a shit about me. I'm just an generic person who doesn't looks like to have anything special whatsoever, compared to these other groups on the school that already has friendships stabilished, with no sign of accepting new people. I have NO IDEA of how an friendshipp happens. I even used to feel envy of extrovert people, and those who can make friendships easily.

And when I switched school, I gave it some time to analyze the ambience, the school and the people on it, **and I didn't like it.** I really tried hard to socialize with someone on this school, but I couldn't get ANY genuine relationship/friendship. There was a really nice nerdy girl on the class, but I couldn't chat too much with her because she gave more attention to her boyfriend, and I was also very shy. And sadly she exited the school on the next year. I also tried in other places like on my church and english courses, but no luck. Everyone just seems to be so closed, not giving any chance to me. And I also feel I'm too different from other people, maybe I just can't fit with any person.

But recently, a miracle appeared: For the first time after 2 years, I finally got a genuine friendship! It all started like this: My mom wanted to bring me to her friend's house, she said that there was an girl that has the same age as me, but I was already with the expectation that it will be only another average generic teenager girl. But when I met her, oh my god. I got a fluid and nice conversation with her. She knows very well how to chat, and also has very similar interests and humor! Sadly, she already has a boyfriend, but I'm more grateful of having a genuine friend. I returned home shocked and surprised, but very happy! I also kind of met her friends, they also look nice. And also, my desire for a girlfriend has lowered.

And for the future: Now, I have the conclusion that I only can get a genuine friendship with people that are similar to me, or has interests and personality that pleases me. I know, the correct would be to be able of socializing with any person, but sadly that's not how my mind seems to be working. I would say that I don't know 100% about myself and what my mind really wants. It's a confusion... And I'm planning to move to the same school as her, with the hope that I can find more nice people on there.

In conclusion: This is a very long battle I'm currently facing. Since all of this started, I kind of lost my perception of time. I can't even believe that 2017 was 5 years ago... I feel like I wasted some time of my teenage years, but whatever. I would say that this entire story is like a ""clock bomb"" that was planted since my childhood and it only exploded now, and I'm suffering the consequences. This story is all about trial and error, and especially, never giving up. I would say that things are finally getting better for me after so long, but the battle hasn't finished yet! And in this battle, loneliness will **never** win. Either the battle will extend, or I will win. That's the spirit!

I really hope my story can serve as a inspirational story or something like that. And I also hope that everyone who's suffering of loneliness on this sub, finds a way of having a relationship with a nice person, or encounters one.",2022-05-25 01:48:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1546732445,5,/r/lonely/comments/ux6l1n/im_in_a_constant_fight_against_loneliness_since/,,0,0,I'm in a constant fight against loneliness since the pandemic started.
4600,ux6lwa,GirlFromBennington,"Ok I'm scared this one's gonna be a little long. I just found this sub on accident and I don't know if my vent even fits it completely. I am surrounded by people, but I actively avoid them and it makes me lonely.

For context I am currently living in a student dorm that belongs to a different college than the one I attend, so there is no classmates around. It almost exclusively houses Erasmus students from that college. I moved here cause it is very close to my campus, it is nice and clean (for a student dorm) and has private bathrooms in each room. Oh, and it also is in a foreign country, having moved here I knew nobody in this whole country and I left all friends, family, everyone behind in my original country. Honestly I do not regret it and I do not miss them that much. I figured I had to take this step in my life before I grow too tired and unambitious. In my childhood I was a loner, always relying on one friend, but sometime in high school I really blossomed socially, grew some confidence, made a lot of friends, always hung out with someone and I liked it. I already started struggling with my mental health back then but at least I found peace and stability in my friend circles (as opposed to home, which was messed up back then).

Then I moved, ready to conquer this new land full of new people. And I really regressed socially. I met my (ex?) best friend and we clicked on the very first day despite that he's a guy and i'm a girl and he's also 5+ years older than me. So I kind of went back to having that one friend around which was nice, but I also felt **lonely** and kind of limited socially because of this. Meanwhile I met my dorm mates and the first semester and this whole vicious cycle of mine started. I was getting along with them just fine, in fact the very last weeks we started hanging out a lot and i grew attached and then, of course, they left. I felt shattered in pieces. I promised myself I am never ever going out with exchange students again, because they leave, I stay, like in a fucking prison where i'm doing life (i came up with this metaphor recently and now I can't stop thinking about it this way). I became secluded, believing it's for the greater good because, why grow attached to someone who's gonna forget you in a matter of months? In fact partly due to covid and partly because of my stupid delusion I withdrew from all these nascent friend circles I kinda was starting to mingle into... ended up abandoning my ""best friend"". ended up sitting in my room all day and not even studying, mostly just drinking and sleeping. The loneliness is killing me. So I allowed myself to make one more mistake.

This is my 4th semester and it actually brought along some of the greatest people I met in here so far. I found it so hard to refrain from their company and eventually due to the self-imposed **loneliness** I started to party with them little by little. I saw them go all around Europe together. The first time asked me to come with them. Of course them being exchange students makes it easier to travel (that's what i've been telling myself), so I can't go with them right? well the next time they didn't even bother asking. And the whole semester I was just suffering so much and still am so torn between wanting to hang out with them and subconsciously doing my best not to hang out with them, all the while i was growing attached and damn i really love those people. such a petty problem, i know, i am pathetic. Now they're leaving in around 3 weeks and i can already feel it in my gut, this weird wrenching and nausea at the thought of being here without them around. I dont know what to think: should i have just gone #yolo and spend time with them? or perhaps I should limit the interactions EVEN FURTHER now?

I thought I was developing a crush on one of them as well. i dont wanna delve into that shit too much but i struggle a lot in the ""dating department"" cause im drugged out of my mind on psychotropic medication which makes me somewhat.. asexual? i guess. so i decided to tell that person about it, as they're all leaving anyway... and it went pretty fine! but well i got overwhelmed and obviously just end up drinking myself to near unconsciousness and happen to stumble upon that person (and like 4 more of those friend-ish guys)  outside when going on a smoke and i spill my wine and make a fool out of myself. i end up cutting myself real bad and havent left my room since. i am so lonely. I AM SO LONELY......

ok so where is this post even going? i dont know i'll be surprised if anybody even sees it. so basically what i'm going for, apart from venting, is: should I continue secluding myself like that next year? should i make the best of the 3 weeks thats left even though right now? is it NORMAL for a college student to be such a fucking self-isolating loser? man it feels like im wasting the prime of my life

Basically TLDR; wasted opportunity to hang out with cool people even though i was lonely, cause i knew they were gonna leave anyway and i didnt want to miss them after. so i deliberately make myself even lonelier, barely leaving my room and cutting ties with other friends as a side effect. then in the middle of this mess i show up drunk and embarrass myself and now i feel like isolating myself even further, despite the sense that i should enjoy things while they last.

I am overthinking. this post perhaps doesnt even go in loneliness sub does it? i am just doing it to myself. and please dont correct my grammar i know its bad

EDIT: also, i sound pretty disorganized but I am NOT drunk right now. I feel like never touching that crap again, i embarrass myself so frequently because of it.

¹[My SoundCloud, ](http://m.soundcloud.com/whiterymo/tracks)if anyone is at all moved or interested or relates or has family members who have been so vehemently bullied like this to the point that you feel worthless. Read on, you will discover why, a very evil MF I thought was my friend just did some disgusting shit and now my goal of putting out a video of me playing guitar, rapping, and freestyling every single week on my brand new tiktok feels so deflated and I need help. Yesterday was the most alone I've ever felt in my entire existence, had absolutely nobody here for me, and I would understand and genuinely admit if it was karma, if I deserved it, absolutely, but because I didn't, and don't, it hurts so much more and makes so much less sense, has me so confused. Makes me want to give up. PLEASE READ THRU before paying judgment, really could use some support right now not the opposite, this is a last resort. :/ All I strive to do is help others help others and through my music share inner-peace and also dope sounding bars that bring me joy to come up with to others. I know that I have the talent TO do it, and so too do the bullies I'm about to talk about, it's pretty harrowing - here's a tale of someone doing WHATEVER he can in order to ensure I loud at all confidence and don't make it. I was riding so high, things were going SOOO WELL, FINALLY! CRASHING down. Asperger's I'm sure has much to do with it, but...please, continue on if you are a supportive human being. Please stop here if you aren't, I have just been really assaulted and violated, and don't want more hurt. I'm being brave by doing this, please respect that enough to not be cruel and the definition of human ego and wrongdoing for no rhyme or reason whatsoever based on his OWN admission.

² [My Debut Mixtape - Click Year 20XX](http://whiterymo1.bandcamp.com ), if interested in supporting a broken down, really sad, stranger who just wants to help others help others and get away from people like I'm about to tell you about:

SO. OK. This is hard to do, but I really need help and don't have anybody. Hey guys, new here, have to preface this with saying that I am an Aspie so I sincerely apologize if I'm doing anything wrong, or coming across in any way that at all suggests that I seem to think I'm better than anybody else as a human being, because the compassion of equality and  will of freedom are awesome &amp; two of my biggest proponents, the third peace ;] of the Tri-Force being inner-peace. I preface this because, throughout my thirty years here, and being diagnosed at 26; if I DON'T say this, then I'm taken seriously out of context and come across like a real asshole. Now, with professional help, prescription ketamine, keen spiritual practice, and the kicker - belief in myself that I Am Worthy, I Am Capable (I would deny myself the ability to allow my gifted talent to shine through, stifling myself, giving up for four long years until I decided to be honest with myself, give up alcohol permanently, as it had been my vice to escape torment after my brother passed away from an accidental overdose and wondering why I was always on the outs before I was diagnosed Asperger's a few years ago which made things really a lot more clear, would have been nice to know as a child but, way she goes. I'm still here, and last night was THE loneliest I have ever felt in my entire life. I didn't harm myself, others (FUCK that, innocents are bystanders and never deserve harm, if one is going to harm anything, let it be themselves, do not cause another family trauma because you so badly wish that your own hand and situation were different.

I'm @Rymo.D, so-called rhyme lord extraordinaire and improv guitar wizard with the alleged It Factor (used to be the fear factor, and disbelief that the ""little old me"" could make it) - according to others, funnily enough who all have entered my life and exited in very cruel, evil (admitted, by them) ways. Just two days ago, someone I had considered a friend for years, got into some bad stuff years back but we squashed that when he got clean and I thought he had changed after jail and a kid and really seeming to be a different guy. Not two month ago, this man-boy reaches out to me to reconnect and apologize to me for a whole lot of very evil things said to me (making fun of my brother's death, my mom's strokes and sexual assault, me for being autistic and having hard time making friends because of a social ineptitude in exchange for being a creative adept, in my eyes, or straight up genius in many others', including the person in question (""You really, really are the modern day Em, bro, there is nobody better than you at this, at all,"" - A., man in question who things had been great with for months after hearing a new verse I had written recently for my debut LP. This is the REAL him, then he goes through these periods, no, episodes, wherein he becomes evil incarnate. Let me explain? So, about three weeks ago, I decided to make a tiktok and set a goal to put out new videos each week: writtens, TIMED WRITING EXERCISES W/ NO PRACTICE PRIOR, freestyles, and guitar improvisations. Like he and countless others had been suggesting and urging me to, but I felt too out of place and had heard of the negative stigma around Tiktok when it FIRST came out (seems to be nothing like that, I'm not sure though, I don't have a business mind, only the creative chops to actually make it far especially with my mission statement - HELP OTHERS HELP OTHERS VIA SHARING VARIOUS ROUTES TO AND FROM INNER-PEACE IN EASY TO DIGEST TERMS, EXAMPLES, METAPHORS. ""The Perennial Philosophy"", but with all rhyming language because I feel it can reach more people, when people that hate rap come up to you and tell you that you've changed their entire perspective of a genre, and your the LEAST LIKELY, er MOST UNSUSPECTING MF ALIVE to be doing what he does as well as he does it with such pure intentions. So after I make my tiktok, I notice a mutual friend and how me and the person in question met, M., on there, I would assume due to proximity and the use of similar tags and both performing artists, etc. This mutual friend, one of the last things he ever said to me was ""you are literally top 10 dead or alive, Rymo"" - to this day the greatest compliment and most humbled I have ever been. FUCK YEAH! I think to myself, and share with some nearby friends ""this mug has already made it, he's just going thru the avenue to get there, I'm proud of him"" (we never had a cross word once, dude defended me in fact, so I thought of any of those two he would be the one to be eager to do music together again seeing me do it again and hearing how badly everybody wanted me to make music again. Wow, really? Alright, if you insist, then you're inspiring me - got an entire new set up, new laptop, new monitors, headphones, studio hardware, software, new social media for my music, everything is all brand new. So I make my first tiktok, and eager to show these cats who I was in a record label with and considered, by the lot, not me, get that shit out of here, to be THE breakout, the star, the one with the most ability, talent, gift, and tragedies survived and laudable mission. Well, six years ago, A. sold me phenazepam pressed ""Xanax bars"", knowing how horrific my anxiety is especially them before I had it under control. I never had a reason NOT to believe him, ""I would never sell my boys fake shit like those pressed bars you see,"" -- he admitted two days ago that he was trying to kill me with those, and doesn't know how I survived that and the jumping he did all those years back. My dumb ass forgave him after he got out of jail, somehow found a girl (and I'm still fucking single, what goes does this work?) and has just had a newborn - he seemed genuinely to change, complete 180. I was so proud of him, man. Even after the bull shit he put me through, because I'm a forgiving man who strives to do the right thing. Well, after I see M. I'm Tiktok when I'm going to record a new video for the week to fulfill my goal, and congratulate him because he has a pretty admirable following, I was supportive as fuck, happy to see him getting noticed even if he did pay for it I found out later, because he is great at hip hop. He thinks I'm better, I think we're equals, it's all bull shit. So A. gives me fake bars years ago that have me black out and apparently try to take a bunch of people's stuff (if you've ever taken a Xanax, you'll know exactly what cleptomania aside effects there are, and this was phenazepam, FAR stronger, and made to look exactly like a Xanax, and reassured countless times that they are real, I'd never come across any fake ones before, so, great) the week I move back from across state and everybody is all excited to see me. Not this guy. He hates me so much, for genuinely zero reason - it's what makes it so difficult to understand for me - that, while I was gone he unfortunately got addicted to crack and meth (did not know this until I was already at the studio with only one ride, him). 6 years ago, same few day stretch where he was poisoning me on purpose unbeknownst and against my will, having lied to me in purpose in order to GET me to black out KNOWING that I did uncharacteristic, stupid shit when I blacked out from alcohol, had quit that, this dude just literally straight up lied to me in order to tear me away from the people I loved and did music with for years. The same few day stretch, there's a 20 on the floor rolled up, I await over a half hour and even ask who is missing a 20... nothing, okay, so I pocket the 20 with the express thought ""awesome I can give A. gas money!"" It was his 20. He left it there on purpose, didn't claim it on purpose, slipped phenazepam in my drinks, and literally waited and watched it all unfold. The moment I grab the 20 and head upstairs to grab my rhyme book out of my bag as I'd been there for a few days, getting work done, writing, about to be on M.'s album and record many songs for mine, THE MOMENT I GRAB IT, AFTER ASKING WHOSE IT SAS AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AROUND AND AGREEING FINDERS KEEPERS LUCKY YOU RY DOPE, he follows me upstairs and starts jumping me with another person much larger than me. Bam a set up. I am an idiot for ever forgiving this person, but he was on crack and meth at the time, he cleaned up his act and had a kid, a girl he's living with, we buried the hatchet, he apologized his ass off to me. All is fine. Until I made that fucking tiktok, and then the first video, and saw M. had one. I comment on M.'s stuff so happy for him and seeing if he would like to do work, because to me, he thinks I'm one of the greatest of all time, his words not mine whatsoever, so I think he of all of that group is the best person, he was the only one who helped me while I got jumped over a set up that was admitted to two days ago. I keep bringing up two days ago because that's when this piece of trash calls me after I had asked him hey can you please let M know I've been trying to get a hold of him and am super proud of him! (been tryna get hold of him for months before he got the tiktok, Asperger's ass didn't get the hint; I think he fucked my ex fiancé and feels really bad about it and that's why he distanced himself because he genuinely went from number one fan to just totally nothing to do with me as soon as my ex and I broke off after I discovered that she was fucking prostituting while I was home raising her son, she'd put her work uniform on, make it very legit, only to remove it and everything else for multiple ppl, most of which who were ""my friends"" while she was supposed to be working, she was bringing home money, she was a MASTER manipulator. Got me thrown in jail for her making herself up because she thought I cheated on her (why? because she had cheated on me so many times, I've never cheated in my life on a partner, I know that pain too well and would never do that to my worst enemy of I had one). So I comment on M's stuff thinking that he'd be happy to hear my new stuff which blows any and all of stuff out of the water - you WILL see if you follow my tiktok @Rymo.D I'm recording a video immediately after this post - and he's not answering, not even a go away which is simple and effective and to the point, nothing. so I'm thinking he must not be seeing them because he's been getting a buzz lately and lots of comments, so I comment on one minutes after it releases having seen it when I went to record mine for the week last week. Commented on it in support like I have been, then put ""hey man, either a you aren't seeing these b please let me know that you don't want to work together and what happened to our friendship because I'm very confused or Rymo gon have to diss track 🤣 with the face and they know me, very well, they KNOW I'm not gonna diss anybody let alone the person I'm trying to reach out to, it was in jest. They knew it was in gest. I message A. soon after, asking if he could let M. know I'm trying to reach out because I simply want to me die good music with talented artists (who I thought were my friends, for like, 8 years, it's more than just those two, it's a whole group).

Of course, that's the message he sees, and that's the one used as an excuse to want to call my own newfound confidence and delight to find a fellow MC on Tiktok, getting a buzz, as he earned, ""riding his dick"", so whoa skrrrt one week prior, I just got a whole new studio, and it was YAAAS FUCK YES RECORD THAT SHIT HOMIE!! CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT! to, right after I do what I was telling them about and gave them the fucking idea for anyway (same with selling funkos, they made fun of me for that years ago, then now they're all doing it and making fun of me still for stopping because I collected all the ones I wanted). This MF, I can leave it at that. OK. But I'm going to make statements on my social media about how betrayed and disappointed I feel and oversight confusion because EVERYTHING was kosher and we had been talking for weeks, months, prior, sharing music, everything. I get comments on two of my statuses from his name on FB which I rarely use. This is after he blocked me, cool, could have left it at that and just let me vent because I had a pretty legit reason to be very confused. So, seeing that he had commented, but not having time for negativity, I message saying something very simple - hey man, I really don't have any use or time for negative shit in my life, if you have anything negative to say, I won't read it so you may as well not waste time, but if you hehe something positive to say or am apology for how you treated me after I had done what you wanted and made a tiktok (which M. did as a result of me mentioning thinking about doing it to A., so who's actually the dick rider?) 

He calls me, so I'm thinking, alright let's see, he had indeed changed it sure as hell seems, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, and I answer it positively. Everything he says is making fun of my mother for being raped, making fun of my only sibling who died in front of me overdosing in my mom's arms, making fun of my lack of a father, and me for having a hard time making me friends and trusting people because of. well. him, and Asperger's and chronic panic disorder.  This all REEKS of jealousy, dude doesn't have one himself nor the send confidence to make one, sees that I do, that life is going better than it ever has, and decides to have an episode (nah, this was fucking planned.) So, he's literally just trying to steal the wind from my sails, seeing how positive I have been, am doing, things are going, and how much I've progressed as an artist. Hears my first one, doesn't say anything about it. When he wanted me to make it. Next day, bam, I see M. on there, SUPPORT, and everything is as transpired. The last thing me says to me was to make sure to call my dying mom fat at heart because she lost a lot of weight. He's straight up a monster, dude stabbed a maintenence worker at his old apartment complex with scissors on Facebook live in 2020 and went to jail for it. This is his version of that this year. It's like I'm his fucking muse. He thinks I'm better than he is, and to me I think he is awesome and don't look at things in such black and white terms, we both offer something different. 


So, the last two days, been feeling really... empty. Deflated. Want to put out a video, been writing something fucking insane, but don't have the fulfillment that I did before that exchange with the asshole evil man. It's fucked. I'm not giving up, I just could use some support guys. From ""you're the modern day Em"" to ""nobody will come to your side, aid, nothing, nobody loves you, you aren't worth anything, you can't do shit right because you're autistic."" Wtf? Coming from the guy who has murdered puppies during a black out, kittens during a black out, beaten EVERY ex, jumped me for a 20 he staged there so set me up, stole so much from me and others (I'm not the only one, he is this to all people, EXCEPT the four people that rap with him, who I thought were my friends for years and lauded me as being the best of us even though I thought we were all pretty equal and just wanted to write GOOD MUSIC with and for people. Someone else joins is sick? Dope, that's now talent in one place. 

So I've been having an extremely tough few days. Trying to get third tiktok done for the week since it's my off days but feeling so uninspired, so what's the point, which is exactly wtf he wanted to do all along, he hates how good I am, straight from the horse's mouth. He hates how I'm a good person, he hates how much better than he is at hip hop I am in his own eyes (I think we're pretty equal and he knew that, he's on my fucking SoundCloud with me, both ppl are actually.)1


This is for anyone who is tired of the same ol' [surprisingly select few?] rap archetypes being recycled and regurgitated, for anyone who seeks out a new favorite artist whose views line up with theirs (if they do) or can authentically help you, you, or you, re: any &amp; all beings who may be going through loneliness, feeling dejected misunderstood, bullied by people who would like to (from their own lips to yours) 'be that good' at what they do that they get manipulated and tricked by tradesmen who have nothing but evil-intent and dox you, call you to make fun of your tragedies (for me, my only sibling dying 'the easy way', according to some scumbag I really thought was my friend - I have a very hard time reading others, Asperger's does not help that out at all (does help the creativity though, just, no business sense, I'm trying so hard!). For any person who is STRUGGLING, in ANY WAY, for anyone who feels out of place when characteristic - who doesn't know that they BELONG here even if they may not ""fit in"" to a ""mold"" re: labeled form as easily as others, for those who feel on the fringes outside looking in, for those who ever feel misunderstood, ""different once removed"" as it were - of course we're all different, but we are all the same underneath the stickers, badges, and costumes that comprise the differences between one another. For anybody into philosophy, anyone into really REALLY in-the-pocket cadences with awe-inspiring ways of flowing esoteric, gnosis in form, inspired by how much YOU ought to know how life-altering, for the best, to generate your own inner-peace at will even in the face of suffering and adversity (in-formation v in-spirit, both the same coin). Or if you just like💓 really, really, REALLY lyrically-oriented hip-hop🎤🎧, or if you are at all interested in figuring out how to stop suffering when you notice that you are, at will, insofar as one is able, may serendipity, hard work, dedication, practice, adherence, and dedication comprise the rest. 

tl;dr I'm struggling, hard, with moving forward after some one I was tricked into thinking had changed, tricked into believing was ever a friend at all, has just essentially said the most evil shit you could ever say to someone for boy reason whatsoever, at all, and it's getting in the way of my dream. I am one of the illest you've never heard about, of you're a Head, you will absolutely fuck with my hip hop, especially the message because it's so positive. Please help me, I really need it right now. I want to record a video tonight, finish this song on my night off, but nothing feels as fulfilling as it did just two days ago when I was in the very best place of my entire life.

I then told them the day after my birthday, and they were all shocked and surprised. I always make sure to wish them on their birthday. But in my friend group my birthday has been the only one to be forgotten by everyone in the group. However this year was different then the first time they forgot my birthday.

I was 11 at the time. Honestly, I still have those desires but I am too much of a coward to act on them. After that, I spent 3 years at a private school that neglected to notice that I have ADD and the psychiatrist went crazy with the pills. I was going through puberty, and adding 5 ifferent pills each with different doses throughout the year can make a person look almost insane.

4641,uxa13p,moohooses,"just gonna rant because i feel like i need to. Probably a free flowing kind of a thing.

Work is hard. Life is tough. I get that. Sometimes it's just too hard to be mentally strong enough. What did I do today? I filled gas and bought some Monster Energy Drinks. Oh, and I slept. Besides work, there isn't much I do. I'm tired, I'm lazy, I'm unmotivated...whatever it is, it is here. 

I've had depression before. Shit, I have depression now. And I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone and everything; being in a new place only exasperates that. It's like, at the least, before moving, I had other friends, kind of a checkpoint that slowly diluted away as I moved. I still have friends. To say I don't would be a lie.

But I feel so disconnected from them...

And now to up the ante, the side effects of my medication are really bad while they aren't helping me either. The proposed solution? Up the dose. Sounds utterly ridiculous to me, but what do I know? I'm no psychiatrist.

So disconnected

So lonely

And while this is mostly my fault, I feel like it also isn't. Social anxiety makes it hard for me to interact with groups of people and, by nature, it is hard and awkward to meet people 1 to 1.

I cannot believe how much the psychiatrist invalidated me. Just absolutely horrible. But, you know, I'm not going to tell him that to his (virtual) face. Hopefully my therapist will be better.

I wish I could say I was fine. I talked to someone at work who helped me feel a bit better. Then, you know, someone else tore me down. And that's besides the psychiatrist, anyways.

I just wanna feel loved. Connected. Accepted. Whatever the term is. Happy. I want to be happy. But I'm stuck. Trapped by myself. I don't know how to connect with people in real life. Not anymore. 

It feels like no one cares. And those that do have a very shitty way of supporting me. It's not their fault, so I don't necessarily blame them, but, it doesn't help me. In fact, it hurts me.

&gt;!I sometimes have the urge to self-harm. I don't know why. Maybe a distraction/escape from my thoughts? Maybe a combination of boredom and intense thoughts? I really don't know. All I know is my psychiatrist said ""I'm not worried about the cutting"" essentially because it is without the intent of killing myself. That doesn't make sense to me. Now, obviously, if it were with that intent, it would be worse, but isn't that very invalidating? or am I just crazy? !&lt;

On the last months I have noticed that I am always the one who starts the conversation and always answers when they send a message but they do it just sometimes with me. I am tired of feeling like the only one who is making an effort (It isn't actually because I love them and I love listening to their audios) but they just leave me on seen. I went out with them a month ago and I felt so happy to be with them like always but it changes when we talk on messages.

It feels so bad because I love them dearly and I don't think they do it with a bad intention, but I've been feeling so alone and depressed. I know they might be busy but honestly is so easy to send an sticker or something. I have been trying so bad to tell them things so they answer me and creating a conversation but they leave me on seen and answer like two days after or something like that, and with short messages, so I just stopped but it seems like they don't notice it.

I'm so embarrassed too because I feel like it shouldn't affect me this way, but I've been feeling so depressed lately and it just hurts me that this friendship, that many times has felt like a safe place for me, isn't anymore because I am going to be ignored.

I guess you can say that I valued what others thought of my quirky/boldness (so up my own butt, huh?). Yet for a while now Ive just wanted to crawl in my bed and not interact with anyone anymore. Everything has become mechanical, bleak, and relationships, fickle. 

I feel just very meh about everything. What prompted this was a 4 year long fling ending in December and a 30th birthday. Also, my best friend of 23 years showed up to my dinner with no card or gift. (No, I don’t like that I noticed something silly like that but I did.) 

I thought my gut instinct would have helped me make better decisions now. Like my love life for example - it’s been filled with emotional abuse and if I’m suppressing this correctly, sexual abuse of me. 

I think that all I’ve wanted for so long now is to lay in bed with someone that’ll just look me in the eyes and tuck my hair behind my ear. To just share a moment in time with me without worrying about the external noise of tomorrow.

4656,uxats4,Jupitersvenus,"Tonight I texted the guy I really like and told him I am losing interest. It’s the truth but not the truth. I fall for the idea of a person so quickly, all of the little things I like about them are so beautiful, the things I hate are no big deal… basically, they are perfect to me and getting to know them becomes this huge part of my life. 

I create this grand expectation that things will go as perfectly as I plan… and they don’t, they never do. I just am not normal, I day dream about being loved and being with that person.

 A change in the frequency of texts or them not talking to me for a whole day makes me question if they really like me. And when I start to question if they like me I start to pull away, I start to mirror how they’re acting so as to not overreact on the surface. But underneath it I’m losing my shit. Im miserable. Im desperate. Im lonely, so fucking lonely. 

And it happened again tonight, I told him im losing interest… losing interest in the circumstances in which I have to like him. I’ve talked to him for about 3 months, my deal is I want to meet him. But he’s busy, always working… it’s 2022, online dating is tricky bc you start talking to a person and it all feels so good, until you realize it’s not real until you actually meet. So I just wanna get it out of the way, so I can figure out if we’re as good a match as we think we are. Having to just rely on a text here and there isn’t cutting it for me. So, I’m losing interest in being texting buddies, not himself as a person. 


This rant is to say that one, I’m lonely. Two, I hate dating. And three, I hate how being lonely makes me jump the gun, not want to try at all, and how sometimes, the pain of being lonely is sometimes something I think I deserve.

We live in India so his being single at 22 is not so shocking to me. And according to my country's standards I am way past my expiry date. 

I got molested by my mom's boyfriend for all my childhood and then got raped in early twenties so never really had the guts to trust a man or love him. 

I started working here 2 years ago and fell in love with this sweet innocent boy. It's my work place and he is way younger than me. 

Every day is a challenge for me as I try to not think of him but I fail miserably. It's wrong on so many levels that I am thinking to change job. He went on leave for 3 weeks and I thought I'll forget him but turned out I missed him even more. 

I learned so much about him in order to find something negative about him but nothing, he is the sweetest and nicest boy ever. 

I tried meeting new people and find someone approachable but nothing worked. At this age I know myself and I know that I am failing in this whole emotional storm. I switched job for a brief period of 6 months but that made me suicidal because I was dying to see him so I joined again (company loves me).

4716,uxi8c9,AhManImSoAlone,"hey guys, I m going to tell you a story that is quite complicated. it's a bit long.  but really appreciate your opinions

1.5 years ago: so I have a crush on one of my classmates, and I'm starting conversations with her constantly but not sure if I'm fully ready to get in a relationship or not so some time passed.

about 8 months ago: I started to show her my attention and talk to her much more than past but she was kinda escaping from it I could feel that she had some rules that prevents her from chatting with me or sth like this. I think she felt that I loved her and I was certain to get in rel with her. anyway, I started doing some research about her and felt that she has a bf (I was right). though I thought it wasn't a serious relationship and if I show her some more attention she would be with me, time passed again.

&amp;#x200B;

about 4 months ago: she texted me one night and asked me what would I do if sb left me. so I understood that the boy had broken her heart :(.

btw nearly a month we talked more and she was freely texting and I said to her don't be that dumb to get in rel with that bad\^$$ again. I was waiting for some time to tell her to start a relationship, cuz if said that while she was sad it would make a kinda jerk person I think. but after some weeks they go back together again and I was acting like we were just friends .why? you know we are in some same classes so I don't want to lose my dignity too. but again our chats were restricted and decreased in number.

sometime later I heard from one of my friends that the boy had texted other girls in class that they had broken their relationship and he is free to get in rel again!!!

my crush had heard that he told his friends he didn't like her and was with her to not feel guilty and bad\^$$. but I don't know that does she know this boy texted other girls to get in rel?

so what I want to ask: should I tell her? or just wait here and watch?  
or maybe I should remove her from my mind and just search for true love? XD

p.o.v: he told her that he is confused and needs some weeks to solve problems. and also said her not to get in rel with any boys!! he lied totally.",2022-05-25 14:09:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647868104,0,/r/lonely/comments/uxi8c9/what_should_i_do_leave_her_or/,,0,3,what should I do leave her or...?

Those 2 guys are some real homies to me, I’m grateful for them and I’ve been blessed to have found a partner who I can share life experiences with going forward but it wasn’t easy and it didn’t happen right away! Truth is you have to build yourself up to be a person that others want to be around, there’s qualities within you that are lovely and you need to be confident enough to allow those to shine through. You won’t be compatible with everyone, you just need to meet your people. Don’t give up, keep your head up and keep pushing. Do things that you enjoy on your own for a while, find a hobby that makes you happy. Get into drawing or painting! Get into some anime, watch a movie you’ve been wanting to see, build a PC or buy a game system or something and connect with others online. Go to the gym, go running, go ride a bike! Do anything be happy while doing it, other people that are into those same things will be attracted to you.

I have experienced so much grief and fucked up situations I'm almost afraid of what this new day will bring.

My kids have thier own lives and I really don't want to stress them out with my crazy problems and my grandfather he doesn't even recognize me half the time. So I ""feel"" alone but I'm not. If not for my kids I know I would have cashed my check a long time ago. I feel like my life is a long sad story and I'm finally reaching the final chapter and I will be glad to close it and move on. I miss my friend. We played D&amp;D together. I was the dungeon master. I brought her through a story of honor and war, vile enemies and dark sorcerers. We had so much fun. I wish I could go back and tell her I love her and stop her from ending her life. I hope she didn't think of me in those final moments. I told her I loved her as she bled out. I heard her last gasps for air. Her death rattle. I am forever scared. Why was just being my close friend not enough to keep her alive. What could I have done to stop her..if only I had known. So here I am, feeling alone and suffering from a powerful loss everyday forever. I hope none of you ever have to experience what I have. I want you to know I understand feeling low. I want you to be happy so if you see me I will smile and shake your hand and I will be kind and helpful..not because I am a good person or anything...but because I am afraid for you.

To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
And many a mile be yet to go.

I feel empty, but it's better than crying everyday. Trios suck so bad for me. It's never an equal balance. The other two people always tend to be closer and I feel so utterly left out and lost. It's like they don't find me interesting anymore so they don't want to talk to me. When they say that they love me, they lie. 

None of them had the actual fucking decency of wishing me on my birthday by themselves even though I wished them on theirs by myself without any need of reminders.

It hurt so bad. 

I also have a part in this. I always self-sabotage such friendships. It's like a part of me is always screaming within me, banging their fists inside my brain that I am not being treated equally and I always spiral. I fucking want to stop doing that. I am such a killjoy. 

I just... couldn't take it anymore. It hurts. Why can't I be the first choice for just once? Why can't people treat me equally. It affects my self esteem so fucking badly whenever this happens. It hurts so bad when I end up caring more. The people I scarcely talk to are more concerned about me than them. And one of them used to give me gifts, which I was grateful for but it only made me feel so unequal. I didn't want those gifts and I never asked for them. I wanted your energy and enthusiasm. That would have been enough for me. And the worst part is that I still care a lot about them and think about them, even though I will not interact with them.


Ironically, I have a trio friendship irl too, and I don't feel like that at all. Possibly because we all are equal in a sense and those two are very level headed individuals.

4749,uxnney,Jurez1313,"The question is a bit tongue-in-cheek but also sincere. We are often told to present our best selves, in order to create the best possible chance for a relationship to form with those that we interact with regularly. But what if there's nothing *physical* about you that is positive? Nothing that you can outwardly present to the world to say ""I am worth knowing!""?  

I'm not attractive in the slightest, I have a bit of a stutter, I'm shy and socially awkward and doubly so around new people. I'm not a very interesting person.  

But, I have interesting opinions. I just find it difficult to share them especially with new people. I am a great listener, a good hugger, a polite movie and dinner companion. I love giving people random massages, I love playing board games both strategic and casual, and I truly enjoy just soaking in the atmosphere of a fun social environment rather than directly interacting with it in any major way.  

How would I present any of that to someone I'm just meeting? Random people don't care about my opinions, don't need me to listen to them, and don't want to be touched by a stranger. They don't take kindly to randomly being asked to grab food or watch a movie, nor to play a board game or have someone invite themselves to their next party or whatever. So like, when you have no outwardly obvious positive traits other than a ""vibe that makes people feel safe and cared for"" (and apparently beautiful eyes which I've been told twice in as many months, weirdly enough), how do you get anyone to even pay attention to you or have a conversation with you, let alone spend time with you?

I'm generally inclined to socialize with others and love deep conversations, but I've been extremely lonely for a long time and it's depressed me greatly. 

My closest friendships have fizzled out over the years for various reasons (drug addictions, moving far away, etc) and now I have no one to connect with aside from my boyfriend.

I'd like to meet new people but I honestly don't know how adults make new friends. 

- I'm not currently in school
- I work from home
- I have pretty severe general anxiety
- My boyfriend is a big homebody and we don't go out very often

I guess I'm wondering if anyone can share their experiences with battling loneliness as an adult when you don't have many opportunities to naturally connect with others, and what methods have you used to try meeting new people?",2022-05-25 18:33:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632401591,4,/r/lonely/comments/uxnv0i/making_friends_in_adulthood/,,1,9,Making Friends in Adulthood

4780,uxruce,stillonvampirefreaks,"I’ve been lonely and solitary all my life but in about 2019 I gave up on all of my relationships completely. I was actually a little relieved when the pandemic hit because I had a built in excuse for my isolation. I haven’t spoken to anyone or hung out with anyone in any meaningful way in 4 years. I haven’t made any friends in college. I’ve never dated anyone and I’m almost 22. I can say now that I have no friends. I go to class and then go home or to the gym, that’s it. And for a long time, especially as a teenager, I blamed this on circumstances, that I’m just not an extrovert, that I’m not pretty, that I struggle to meet people because I’m so shy and anxious, that my dating pool is smaller because I’m gay and in a small town, that I’m Aspergers af so I come off as off-putting to others, etc. But all of my external excuses are falling apart as an adult. I met a woman a few months ago (in one of my classes) who tried everything she could have done to be my friend. She was extremely nice and friendly, she initiated every conversation, she asked for my number, she lived right by me, she invited me to things, and at every turn I acted like a complete and utter asshole. I didn’t show up to anything she invited me to as I self-sabotaged by staying up very late the nights before so I would always be too tired to go, and I ignored her texts for months. Eventually she (completely understandably) gave up, and I feel absolutely horrible. I know being on the other side of this it probably just came off as if I didn’t like her but honestly I thought she was great, we had a lot in common and I would’ve loved to have talked to her more. I just kind of panicked and pushed her away from me. I can admit now that this is the choice I always make, I don’t try and even when friendship is offered to me with no effort on my part I choose to push people away, despite how lonely I always am. The reality is I am terrified of other people. Vulnerability makes me feel out of control and I can’t get close to people at all. I don’t know how to let people into my life and I don’t know how to be known by others. I can’t even be around people for very long at this point as I gradually start to panic (anyone looking at my face up close, or hearing my voice for too long, or coming into my apartment is enough to set me off) because I’m afraid once anyone knows anything about who I “really am” they’ll realize the mistake they made and leave. I know this all comes from self hatred and being punished for showing any vulnerability as an abused child but it’s so deep rooted that I don’t know where to even begin trying to change. All I know is that I hate that I’m acting like this towards other people, especially people who are the opposite of me, who are warm and friendly from the get go, because I think that’s such a beautiful trait and I know it’s hard to maintain in a world like this. I feel so much guilt about how I’ve acted over the years . I did text this girl an apology (which she did not respond to, understandably, also she graduated so she won’t be around anymore) which I am happy I did because it’s better than my usual strategy of ghosting forever.

4814,uxwf6v,Bluffon,"I always end up getting super depressed over the summer bc the amount of newfound freetime that I have makes me realize how little friends I have. I made two really good friends over my first two semesters at college, but they started dating each other so the three of us don't really hang out together anymore. All I end up doing everyday after work (or all day when I'm off of work) is stay in my room, either watching youtube or doing something else completely unproductive. I don't even play video games or anything like that to engage my body at least a little bit physically, or interact with others online. I'm so used to isolation that I didn't even realize that it was the root of my depression until about a summer ago. Admittedly, I don't usually ask friends to hang out first, mainly bc I end up convincing myself that they have better things to do, or that they're busy ""bc they actually have a life."" So it ends up just becoming a pitiful and toxic cycle. Occasionally I'll exercise, either in my room or I'll go on a walk, and seldom a run. It's not that I never hang out with friends over the summer, it's just usually pretty rare, usually once, maybe twice every two weeks. I feel so out of touch with reality socially that I'm not even sure if that's a lot or not. It's usually the same three friends as well. I think my main problem is, that bc the amount of friends I have is so small, they mean so much more to me. Not saying that I don't mean anything to my friends, but I feel as if I overestimate how deep my friendship is with people, and that the ""closeness"" I feel is more or less one sided. Which isn't necessarily their fault, I just wish that I had deeper friendships with more people. And that those people also felt as if they had a deep friendship with me.

I can’t approach women in person because they usually either ignore me or tell me to go away. So, my only choice is using dating apps. Predictably, I’ve gotten nowhere no matter how many apps I try or how much money I spend on extra features.

The closest I’ve come to having a partner was a girl I met on a pen pal website. She was Russian-American and studying in Europe at the time. At that point in time, I was suicidal and very emotionally vulnerable since I couldn’t access my anti-depressants. We started talking and would voice chat/FaceTime and we grew close. She said she loved me and cared about me and I was the best thing that ever happened to her.

Then, she ghosts me for another man she met online because (her words) he had the money to buy her a plane ticket back to the states and I didn’t. She marries him and has a kid with him. Then they got divorced (all within the timespan of a year and a half). I attempted suicide over this woman after we stopped talking.

I’m currently finishing my bachelor’s degree online since I can’t go on campus for practical and logistical reasons. My best friend moved away and the few other friends I have are not available to hang out with. I pretty much never leave my house and the community college was my only option (and I already graduated). 

I’m so fucking frustrated that I can’t catch a break and because it seems like no woman will give me a chance. The love of my life ended up being a disloyal lying bitch and no one else has come along. I’m a broke nerdy college student with a bunch of mental health issues, of course no woman wants me…

4832,uxyla2,ghoulsh-ovrkill,"I had a girlfriend for a few months in high school, that's it. It's getting harder and harder to believe I ""just haven't met the right person yet"" and easier to believe I'm a socially inept hideous troll.
Right now I live with my best friend of 10 years, and her current partner practically lives here. In the 10 years we've been friends she's never been single more than a couple months, I've gone on a couple dates with 2 people but otherwise been single the whole time. It's hard to watch them be happy, or even be happy for her, because it's the 4th time she's been ""in love."" I have never been in love or had anyone love me before.
At this point it's humiliating, and I worry if I ever do meet someone they'll be turned off by my lack of experience. I feel like there must be something about dating I'm just completely missing, or that there's something very wrong with me that everyone's been too polite to tell me. 
All I've ever wanted is to have a favourite person, and be their favourite person, who I can love and support unconditionally and bake them muffins and buy them random little gifts. I don't understand why I'm not good enough for anyone to give me a chance.

4834,uxyrgl,Jurez1313,"I never initiate contact with people, I only ever talk to people if they start the convo. I tell myself it's because no one ever wants to talk to me when I reach out, but really it's to save myself from rejection. Can't be rejected if you never do anything to reject. 

I get frustrated at the stupidest thing. Die in a video game? Anger. Get called an idiot by some random guy online? Anger. Get told I'm wrong when I'm not? Anger. Anger so strong I can't help but bite myself to the point of bruising, scratching myself hard enough to draw blood, or hit myself on the head hard and long enough to give myself a headache.  

Most recently, anger at my new kitten - only 2 and a half months old - for continuously trying to climb my leg. I went full streamer mode and picked him up by his belly and tossed him into his bed a couple feet away. He got me good, tho. Hand still stings. Hope it gets infected. I deserve it for mistreating an animal like that. 

I get passive aggressive with co workers when they try to tell me how to do my job, or call me out for not doing my job. I do only the bare minimum amount of work I can get away with without being fired, and spend the rest of my time on reddit. 

I hire women to have sex with me and pretend to care about me or find me in any way attractive for an hour every few months. Women who likely don't have a choice but to sell their bodies because the patriarchy makes it impossible for them to earn a fair wage. Hell, one such woman was actively high, and I still got on with it anyway. I sicken me. 

I have a million other garbage traits. I'm an idiot who thinks he knows everything and if he doesn't, makes it up on the spot to seem smart and knowledgeable. I constantly finish people's sentences. Im always just waiting for my turn to speak. If someone believes something I disagree with I immediately think I am better than them. I'm judgmental, hot headed, short-tempered, boring, stupid, unfunny, financially irresponsible, immature, ugly, fat, lazy, lonely, agoraphobic, and a serial whiner. Hence this post. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just feel so damned miserable and I have literally no one to talk to. And it's no wonder that's the case, considering how I treat people. As if they exist only to help me with my problems, to the point I never start conversations at all, and as soon as I'm done talking about myself, the conversation ends. I don't blame anyone for ghosting my toxic ass like all my recently-gained gamer friends have done recently. Man it was a great feeling logging on to discord for the first time in a week to notice all your friends had removed you...  

Oh well, I don't expect anyone to read this. Or care about an animal abusing piece of garbage narcissist like me. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow.

We share 12 desks among 18 people. Everyone is assigned one to share with another manager who works opposite schedule of them. This is my 6th week of work and no one has taken to the time to assign me a desk so every day I just hop around to an empty one. The guy who is also new got a desk. I chalk this up to him being personable and everyone talks to him. I guess I’m just too quiet for my own good. I find it hard to talk to anyone there cuz every time I try it’s like they look at me like why are you talking. Only one of the managers has been cordial and taken to the time to show me how to do everything I need.

This is the fact, and that's the reason I have been possibly ignored and never asked about me from their side and if we might be in their place then we might have done the same.
Cause in today's life no one's bother to help you , all are trying to improve theirs life and we have no choice but to even get ourself stand by our own too.
Which is hard I know, sometimes we might feel motivated sometimes we may not and we might need the support but I guess where we actually need the support universe will send something to help at that moment.

Hence I know this is straightforward but this is what I have experienced, when you yourself have negative emotions in yourself, I don't think anyone would be willing to help or be your friend :)

This is what it is , we just need to be positive and try to improve our life by our own , without waiting for anything to help and give a hand to walk or share with.

It all felt so good and I became blind quick to the world and focused on how to up my game to provide for this woman. Time slowly trudges along and we expect to have a little one early in our relationship. I ignore many red flags ranging from her getting cold feet to finding her leaning back towards to her sexual interest in girls (communicating with a ex female lover). I blame all these problems on how crazy her life was before she met me so I do what I do best and see the “good” in the situation. Fast forward to today and I feel the loneliest I have felt ever. I have been “touched” by her one time and that was early early in the relationship when she stayed at my house for the first time. So 9 whole years of yearning for physical and emotional support from my partner in this so called life. Yes, I have asked and talked to her about why this is the case and it becomes awkward and blamed on our living arrangements tied to living with her parents at the time. I busted my ass to buy us a home so we can grow our relationship! I put the time in so my wife would respect and want me in the ways I’ve always wanted to be wanted. Fast forward to almost a year in our new home and yet to see any change.. am I not good enough? I feel gross.. I feel lost..

4865,uy1dsk,honimod,"Hello! Well I've been struggling with this situation. (sorry for the typos i'm not a native :c)

I've always have been kinda anti-social cause I'd prefer being alone rather than having parties or meetings but sometimes I need to 'recharge' my social battery but that just lasts a few days and then I feel tired of interactions again. 

I've had theraphy and my depression levels decressed a lot but the thought of me being lonely and not being able to meet new people or flirting with someone due to my lack of social habilities is making me feel so sad... 

It has been like 2 months since I feel like I don't deserve to date someone and that I'm not that interesting enough to catch the attention so I feel like I don't even have to try it anymore (plus my  attachment disorders from my childhood that keep me off from any physical interaction but that's another subject)... 

I have never had a relationship before (plus that makes me feel like some kind of loser haha it's absurd I know pretty well) and I also think being an inexperienced person on these matters makes me so boring and not so interesting.

I tried to talk about this with my therapist but their solution is to try hook up with someone and yeah that's practically the main issue here lol well i guess that's all for now Oooh i almost forgot that I've been listening to songs that are kinda romantic-melancolic and i can't stop the urge to long for a relationship also the smallest thought about something romantic makes me want to cry and I really cry just seeing something beautiful just like Elliot seeing the sunset (insert that scene reference from Bedazzled pls).

  
Hoping no one feels like me bcause it's so tiring feeling this way, like only relationship love it's what I need to be happy now... thanks for reading I appreciate &lt;3 thank you for allowing me to get off this burden",2022-05-26 06:36:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1570038289,2,/r/lonely/comments/uy1dsk/its_difficult_for_me_to_being_social_lately/,,0,1,It's difficult for me to being social lately...

I've always been more of a worrier than him and it's kind of obvious and I genuinely hope he's alright.

As I got older, I found myself pulling away from everything and everyone. I felt I needed a break from people. It felt good to have some relief from the demands of the world.

But now, I'm retired (basically they fired me), and divorced. I still keep in close contact with one of my kids (the other one decided to cut me out of her life when I left her mom). I had to move 5 hours away from them all because I couldn't afford to pay rent and my oppressive support payments. So I'm in my mother's basement.

So, I'm ashamed of my living situation and of myself in general. In the last year, I have been spending more and more time alone - I often go days on end alone here in my little basement.

I have all but given up on being involved in any kind of romantic relationship. I haven't been so much as hugged by anyone in at least 4 or 5 years. 

I guess it is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. 

The loneliness comes in waves - I can distract myself with a good tv show or whatever but I'm starting to wonder what the long-term effects of this self-imposed isolation will be on my psyche.

4916,uyaicr,Archon_of_Prism,"There is a man I met nearly two years ago. He responded to a post I made challenging people to talk to me without asking me who I am or reading any previous posts. I would do the same in this challenge. This was because I was tired of people judging me by my age and gender. I was tired of being talked down to and others trying to cater to my perceived masculinity. I just wanted to be talked to as the person I am and this was my way to do it. Little did I know the man I would come to fall head over heels for would be one of the people to message me over it. For several months we didn't know each others ages and we just treated each other as equals.

The fact that I can remember this is unusual. I have a strange memory and by strange I mean entirely dysfunctional. I can not willingly remember most memories. I can remember fragments of them but not the whole thing. This isn't necessarily abnormal until it starts being my whole memory down to just yesterday and even earlier today. Rarely is it can I remember any parts of my life. If prompted by something else I can briefly put together the memories but they fall apart soon after and I can't even remember that I put the memory together it is only from others that I know that.

I have hurt many friends and even my own family because of my memory. I can't remember birthdays. Often times I wont be able to remember significant moments in my friendships and sometimes I forget who my friends are. I retain a familiar feeling about them but I can not remember anything about them.

In the past year I've also opened up about these problems to my mother. She tries to hide it but, after the realisation set in that I was serious that I can not remember nearly any of my childhood, the hurt shows in her eyes. The amount of damage I have caused with my memory is immense. There have been things I've said and arguments had that ruined friendships that I didn't remember. When I am away from my family for weeks I even forget what they look like and I can't remember the way my grandparents acted. The activities we used to do. My childhood is lost to me. 

About 5 years ago I started shutting the world out because it became too difficult to see the hurt I was causing. I pushed my friends and family away, isolating myself. I let only one or two people in at a time and even them I still kept them at a distance out of a fear that I would forget. Then after 3 years of doing that I decided to start letting the world back in. Living the lonely life I had been trying to live was hurting myself and those I was afraid to forget.

This is when I started using reddit and met the man who end up being the absolute sweetheart I didn't know I needed in my life. Life is never so easy though, he lives in a country in Europe and I live in the United States. When we first met he was getting over some past trauma and a rough break up. He and I grew together as we had our own struggles but continued to lean on each other. At times we had to convince each other that we weren't burdening the other person. I helped him see a part of himself that he had suppressed and he helped me be okay with being me.

We have come a long way and one of my biggest fears now is losing him. He has become a part of my life whether or not we will ever be able to be together. He is special to me and I believe it's demonstrated by the fact I can remember our discussions. I can remember how we met. I can remember the way he and I have grown because of each other.

I write this both to let others who may have similar issues with memories and loneliness know that with the right person things can be different at least with that person. I am also writing this as a record because although I remember now there is no guarantee I will remember the wonderful part of my life that is this man in the future. I am writing this so I can know how much he means to me if I forget and so that he can know how much he means to me even if I forget.

Memories are fickle things one moment they may be there and the next they're gone. To those who have memories of joy, memories of laughter, and memories of surprise take a moment to appreciate the memories you still have. If you are like me and the majority of your memories, which are few in number, are of pain, regret, and shame then I understand what you are going through and hope you can find someone or something that brings you joy, safety, or comfort like had the fortune to.

I am still quite lonely as I can't remember those who used to be my friends but at least I have someone.

As a final note to me and the man I love if I forget remember this,

I remember when we shared our vulnerabilities and strengths. I remember the long nights that you made easier because it felt like you where there with me. I remember how I told my other friend about how wonderful you are. I remember how I told my mother about you and I was afraid she wouldn't accept you. I hope this day will never come but if I ever forget I am so sorry. If I ever hurt you by forgetting please know it wasn't my intention.

Now today, I have started a course on Web Development, courtesy of a friend that wanted me to get a good future, one of my only 2 friends, she lives 10 hours away and my other friend is a nurse so she doesn't have a lot of time. And we had a discord and all, everything was alright for a month, but a douchebag threatened me because I as an admin didn't want to change his name colour and he threatened me.

4928,uycsc4,gabriox,"I'm 18M. My routine for quite a while is ridiculously boring. I wake up at morning, go to school, spend time with my classmates/friends during breaks, go home and spend time in my room studying more or less, occasionally playing video games or just watching youtube, reddit etc. yesterday is when started to feel this. Yesterday was the the last bell day in which we celebrated our last remaining days in gymnasium. It was fun and quite sad that we won't get to spend anymore time besides the last days. We also had to go to a homestead the same evening but I had to miss it because I was failing math (I was always bad at it but this is the first time I was failing it) and the day before the last bell I found out that the math teacher decided to give me a test tomorrow (friday) for which I had two days to prepare. After last bell I went to the teacher and she prepared the main things of the topics I had to study for and this would've given me the night to go to the homestead but after I returned home my mom was like there is no way you can go there due to the test, I even tried to explain that I paid my money for it and she told screw the money, you need to study, spend all the time you have and study. My dad also talked to me but in a much nicer way and explaining the situation simply and I understood that but either way I wouldn't have studied late at night and also I would have probably returned home at normal time like past 9AM and this is the last time I could have gotten to spend time with my class in a personal way and I won't get another chance at this. Now, you'll probably say that I'm 18 and I have the choice to decide what I want to do and what not but if I don't go by my mom's rules she'll get fucking pissed and start ranting day long about not only why I'm making the wrong choices by not agreeing to her rules but about everything like how important studying is, how I never listened to her and how all of her relatives are good people and achieved a lot and I'm at the bottom with my dad which makes it not worth the risk (even my dad does everything to prevent it). This shitty situation made me realize the routine in which I'm stuck and all I want right now is to socialize more but more specifically recreate going to the homestead because it would have been really special to me but I know I won't get the chance to do it. Today after all of this made me feel the slight burn out that I'm having, it's not like I can't physically get out of bed but it's just so hard to study anymore or do anything productive...

Our relationship requires no effort to spend time with each other and talk online (which I like) and we hang out about once a month. We are all growing up and separating from each other and now all have friends of different groups, which is perfectly okay. Throughout our friendship, I realized I put in the most effort (like gifts, asking to do things) while always feeling like an outsider with them. I have a few other friends outside of that circle whom I would consider myself close to as well.

4940,uyfxp7,Jurez1313,"More or less, my social anxiety is paralyzing. About 2 weeks ago, I left the house to spend time with other people (beyond work and food) for the first time since before COVID. Spent 3 hours with a group of 6 strangers. Said about 10 sentences. Learned their names and 1 interest a piece. Watched them fly kites.  

No one talked to me directly despite my attempts at initiating one-on-one conversation while we were watching. Just made me re-cement my idea that I have no hope in finding new friends. I'm just too fucking awkward and weird, I don't have any relatable hobbies or interests, I'm too serious all the time, and yet also have absolutely no sense of adventure or any willingness to leave my comfort zone. I'm not at all attractive or interesting, funny or confident. There is nothing about me that says ""I'm friend material, come talk to me!"" more that ""I'm a weird creep! Avoid me at all costs!""  

So, how am I supposed to cope with this existential dread that is daily, hourly, minute-by-minute loneliness? This gaping wound in my chest that fills my eyes with tears if I stop to catch my breath? Lost all the IRL friends I used to have. Online friendships always tend to fizzle out.

4944,uyg99o,slingereep,"Hey there, this my first post ever. I am trying to find a way to deal with my lonelyness and reading storys that i can relate to realy help. I am an 18 guy from the netherlands btw.

So explaining all the fucked up aspects of why i feel like this roght now is to much, the essence is this.

I have trouble with experiencing warmth and love so i feel kinda cold, alone and Hurt on a regular bases. 
(I was bullied all elementery school and my dad was not giving me the love and affection i needed at the same time, my parents were devorced btw)

Anyway (already getting to deep into the whole story haha)   I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago en i spoke after 5 weeks and i expected her to be still sad instead she told me she had sex with another guy and she felt like she was over me which realy Hurt and makes you question the meaning of all your memories etc. Well that feeling went away after realizing it shouldnt bother me and indecide what is meaningfull to me and what isnt.

Am sorry for all this bs it was just building up to this :

I went for a drink with my ex not my most recent but before her so like a year ago now and i was just gonna give her some clothes back and have a good talk and go home but instead she went home with me and we slept together and she stayed the whole day after and i havent been so happy as i was that day in a long time. She knows me there was love and affection hugging being nice to eachoter it was exactly what i needed, a little love and appreciation.

I did not at all have a lot of contact with her before this event and since we know a relationsship would not work we decided not to stay in touch after this or not talk for a while. Its been a week and i havent stopped thinking about it, it made my daily life a lot harder after feeling that great for a day. I wanna know how she feels about it but i dont want to disturb our agreement. I Just want to get rid of this extreme feeling of lonelyness i am clueles. 
She is so pretty it literaly makes me sick to think i will not be having more of these good times with her.

I am sorry for all the irrelevant information but it feels  good tho to just drop some stuff that bothers me even it doenst make a whole lot of sense to you guys.

4945,uygcpy,Professional-Bat2966,"Up until a few years ago I was a very solitary individual but not really out of choice. I just didn't know how to socialize, I wondered what to say or do when around other people. I just overthought it and decided to just not say anything to anyone. My parents worried and encouraged to try to be more social and that's when I tried to get myself out there. It has been a massive disaster for numerous reasons that I just can't understand. Some people treat me like absolute trash and don't care to listen to my opinions on anything while others have this odd thing where they see me as some sort of wise sage or genius just because I, seemingly, know a lot but they don't respect me in a personal capacity either, they just respect what I know if that makes sense. I also have a hard time being able to blend in as I find it difficult to carry on conversations or just seem ""normal"". In summation, it has been the single most frustrating thing I've had to do and a massive failure. I don't think I will ever be able to find proper social buddies if I am being honest.

4983,uykik3,aksarahhh,"Let’s call my ex-best friend Lucy. She and I have been best friends for 10+ years (over half our lives). A few months ago she had been in a horrible funk because she lied on a job application and they initially wanted to hire her but found out she didn’t have the right certifications so they had to rescind the offer. Around that time a guy she was kinda dating decided that he didn’t want to be with her because he has so many family responsibilities and wouldn’t be able to give her the time and attention she deserves. 

When all this happened I started to realize how much I was there for her during her hard times and during her happy times, be she doesn’t do the same for me. She would make condescending comments when I would get a good grade in school or get accepted to a great internship. I talked to her about how I felt and that I felt like her therapist she only hung out with when feeling sad/unhappy and she would always hang out with other people when she was feeling happy. I understand that probably meant she felt safe and comfortable with me, but I felt I was putting a lot more effort into the relationship than she was. After talking with her, she pretty much accused me of being a horrible friend and then blocked me on all forms of social media. 

I then reached out to a mutual best friend, who goes to college out of state, (let’s call her Sarah) we have to get some advice and to ask her to check on Lucy and make sure she was doing okay. She said Lucy was fine and didn’t really engage in texting with me. Over the past 2 months I texted Sarah as I normally would about life and school, but her responses were always very short and she didn’t engage in anything I sent. A few days ago I asked Sarah when she was coming back home for the summer and she told me she already moved everything to where she goes to school. I was pretty surprised she didn’t tell me she came back to where I live for a while and then decided to move without telling me.  I guess I shouldn’t be surprised since she pretty much stopped communicating with me. 

I haven’t heard anything from Lucy in over two months and all my other friends in that friend group stopped talking to me. I’m not going to say I’m super surprised they decided to follow her since she is kinda the “leader” and everyone must do what she says or get kicked out. 

Maybe I dodged a bullet in a way because I’ve realized that they haven’t been as good of friends as I thought. But now I really only have a few people that I call my friends and one of them lives in a different state. I used to hang out with Lucy and Sarah all the time and go on hikes and stuff, but now I don’t have anyone to go with. I feel really lonely and end up just sitting around my house not doing much everyday.

4991,uylnpx,DreamLauncher,"Something to listen to while you read: [https://youtu.be/PA3J6Kl9J2A](https://youtu.be/PA3J6Kl9J2A). This song is very meaningful to me and goes really well with the story. 

Halfway into 2019, I'd say I was the happiest I've ever been. I had a job I enjoyed, amazing friends, and best of all, I had been in a relationship for 2.5 years.

My then gf decided to study abroad, so I saved up money to go with her and try to find a job there. It was a huge step for both of us, as we were going to move in together and also live in a foreign country. We made the huge step and everything went perfectly for a couple of months. I hadn't been very successful at finding a job there, due to political reasons and then the pandemic hitting as well. It made me feel very depressed and I could see it affected her as well. She always tried cheering me up and encouraging me to keep looking for a job, but to no use. I was just too depressed to keep going and nothing could really make me feel better. It was hard enough for me to find a job with the political situation that was going on at the moment and the pandemic just made it impossible for me.

We eventually managed to get through her first year at uni with incredible financial support from our parents. We then went back to our home country during Summer vacation and she decided to break up with me after 3.5 years of relationship. She told me to get used to the idea that we'll never be together again. I couldn't understand how after we'd been together for so long, in what I at least considered to be a healthy and happy relationship, she could say something like that. I couldn't understand how anyone could say something like that to someone they love. I was devastated. I was already depressed due to not being able to find a job abroad, we were also in the middle of the pandemic and then I also had to cope with the loss of an amazing relationship. We tried to stay friends many times after we broke up. While she was still here and also after she left abroad again to continue her studies. It never worked out.

It took me a really long time to process all that, and I even went to therapy for it, but by the time I started therapy I was already feeling better and started getting back on my feet, so I'm not sure it helped much. The last time we talked was at the beginning of this year. We were both in a group of close friends of which I mostly introduced her to and since she decided that we shouldn't be a part of each other's lives anymore, I thought of having a chat with all of them, including her, to make a new group without her, so that I could cut all ties with her. It didn't make sense to have her in the group anymore anyway. She was all the way there and didn't have contact with any of us, she started a new life there, made new friends etc. and she agreed that it was a good idea to not be in the same groups anymore.

I'm doing pretty well now, as my life seems to be back to how it was before I met her, which was back in 2016. I have everything I need but it's boring as hell. I barely find excitement in anything, and when I do, I feel like I have no one to share it with. All my close friends are in relationships and I rarely ever ask them if they want to do something together, because they're usually with their s.o. and I feel like I'd bother them if I did. Sometimes we all hang out and there's this intrusive thought that I'm the only one in the group who's not in a relationship, and it makes me feel horrible.

I tried online dating once I felt ready to be with someone else, because it was pretty much the only way I could meet new people during a pandemic, but didn't really get anything out of it. It mostly made me feel unwanted and like I was trying much harder to find that special someone than any of the girls I matched with. I got ghosted a lot and barely got any texts back. Beauty no longer impresses me, since most of the prettiest women I've talked to turned out to be shallow or have really shitty personalities. This also holds me off from approaching any girl I find cute, since I'm afraid their personality might not be as good as their looks. I could say I look pretty good too, or at least average. I don't go to the gym, so I'm not muscular, nor skinny, but I take care of myself, I have a good sense of humour and plenty of hobbies I'm focusing on. Probably my biggest downside is that I have crooked teeth. There's not much I can do about it, so I really hate that thing about me.

I'm not even into dating. Never been. I find the whole process of meeting someone completely new and taking the time to get to know them really exhausting, especially as an adult when all you wanna do after work is rest and focus on your hobbies. I just ""waited for the right person"", as a lot of people say. I was friends with her before we got together. That relationship was the best thing I had, even though it was the only one. The level of intimacy and the amount of hobbies we shared was unmatched. I haven't been able to find another girl whom I would share so much with ever since. Sometimes I cry before I sleep, imagining how my life could be if I was in a relationship like the one I used to have. All I really want is to have someone with similar hobbies who I can also be intimate with. Someone I could hold, kiss and sleep with. Somehow, this just feels unattainable.

After my ex broke up with me, she told me I'm the most loving person she knows. It makes me wonder if I lost the only true love I'll ever get.",2022-05-27 00:27:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653604313,1,/r/lonely/comments/uylnpx/lost_all_hope_for_finding_true_love/,,0,2,Lost all hope for finding true love

4997,uympkn,cucomber49,"I tried to help my classmates by being the representative, of my classmates, and basically having to be getting thrashed, by students and teachers at the same time, because my job was about making sure that the students could have complaints about the teacher without them just going nowhere, so I had to make sure that the teacher listen to the students, in the same way i had to make sure the class listened to the teachers, complaints about them. 

After doing that, they talked about me on my back, and didn't vote on purpose, when I started a voting thing on WhatsApp......

And I got out of class once a person told me this.

And you know when you just feel so sad and alone, i went outside and cried so bad, you know when you feel like you tried to be included, but all that happens is people miss interpret you, and it makes you feel so alone.

It seems to me that loneliness get dragged around with me, for wherever i go, and people can feel this, and this results  from me feeling alone.

For example, i was flerting with a girl, Andi asked do you date and she was like yes, but i didn't wanted to kiss her or anything like that, I SWEAR TO GOD that i only wanted to see her smile, but it turns out that in one day that i was flerting with her, there was a dude with her, which i thought oh it may be her boyfriend, and i proceed to think, bro if i was flerting with her in front of her boyfriend, i should probably explain myself to her, and i tried to but she said no he's not my boyfriend, and after all of this i just looked like a creep/fuck boy, which is not what I meant to happen, but now that's what she thinks, and this makes me feel so dam alone, and i feel like there's nothing I can do about it.

5006,uynnt3,ZealousidealDog7210,"I am 38yrs old male from California and I feel like I been doing a lot of soul searching of late. Thinking about the past 30s years and feel like I’m so alone and so lost. I admit I haven’t had a real date besides the casual movie/dinner time I had with a friend. As a young child I was bullied by eldest brother for my weight problems. I was always sick when I was young due to respiratory issues. I missed alot of days of school, was always alone never had any real friends. What made things hard was I was a super shy and didn’t talk much as I always got super nervous with girls and still do at my current age.

I tried to date in middle/high school and didn’t have much success. Never went to school dances, no prom dates anything’s like that. I always wanted to date but never had an opportunity because the girls I liked never game a me a chance. After graduating high school I kinda put dating to the way side as I was trying to decide what to do for the rest of my life. I worked a few part time jobs until I landed working with a fruit tech company and spent a majority of my 20s and early 30s of my life with pretty much the status quoa no dating even I did try a few times.

I tried online dating at its early days including phone chat lines where sometimes I would get connections but it would be more sexual nature. I still have my health problems and weight problems and I feel so lonely I feel like I’m dying inside. I see all these shows and movies where people date and stuff and I say to myself why can’t I have that too. What grinds my gears a lot is I hear certain groups of men treat women badly and they get hurt and I feel bad for them. These other groups say they wish to find a man who has a heart and will treat them good, yet when they get a chance they ignore it and go back to tried and true I guess because they want that type of relationship or something.

I had some sexual experience where I had a casual thing but nothing that would count as actual penetration as it was mainly oral which I enjoy going down on women it my kink. Now I’m at my mid point of my life and feel like I wasted so much. Feel like I missed so many life opportunities that I feel so bad. I wish I could change the clock and fix all that. Unfortunately that’s not possible and I’ll have to deal with the consequences. I want to date, I want to have sex, I want to feel happy, want to feel like a regular life as any other people. Perhaps I have some emotional problems that have to be confronted before I can move or something anything is possible.

I want to make one thing clear I have no intentions of hurting myself or anyone else. These are my demons and I need to confront them. Lately I tried to seek female companionship and it seems to go ok but feels like the women loose interest. I don’t know all I know Is I want to feel happy, want to experience what life has to offer. I have found a real good job last year that makes a solid living and now I want experience what life has to offer. 

That’s my vent

5007,uynrgp,ThatOneStupidKid,"I miss my mom. 

I'm lying in bed, throat sore from coughing, and hungry despite not being able to keep food down. My head hurts and my energy is gone. I keep thinking back to when I was young and my mom would take care of me when I was sick. Bringing me food, rubbing my feet and back, scratching my head... I can remember how she would look at me and I could see on her face that she cares about me and wants me to feel better. If I was down with a stomach bug she would make me up a little bed on the bathroom floor and we'd camp out with ice cubes and crackers. Now I live six hours away and I have nobody around me. I tried bringing some blankets into the bathroom like in the old days but it was just cold and wasn't even remotely the same.

It's just a little bug, I'll be fine in a few days, really. but I can genuinely say the worst part of this experience is that I'm all alone. I'm not lying here wishing for a mommy gf or any of that shit, but I can't stop thinking about what it would be like if I lived with someone that worried about me and wanted me to feel better.  It's just the little things like having to feel my stomach turning and my headache start pounding again because I stood up to get some more water. It would mean the world to me if I just had someone I could ask to bring me a cup of water. I would feel a hundred times better if I had someone to sit next to me and hold my hand or something, just so I know I'm not alone if things get worse. I think I'd like it if the roles were switched too. It makes my heart ache when I think about taking care of someone when they're sick. I'd love to be appreciated and depended on in their time of need. I'd do everything for them that my mom did for me and I'd love every second of it. The thought of me being able to make someone feels better makes my heart swell but then I realize it's probably not gonna happen and I feel worse than before.

Whatever, I'm just a little sick. I raise a toast (of cough syrup, of course) to any and all of you who have felt the same way.",2022-05-27 02:19:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1325737489,2,/r/lonely/comments/uynrgp/it_really_hits_you_when_youre_sick/,,0,0,It really hits you when you're sick...

The closest I’ve come was a boyfriend that lied his ass off to me the entire relationship. I’ve accepted and let go but his betrayal was traumatizing. I’ve lost so many 4+ years friendships that I hoped would make it to major life milestones. I feel defeated at this point.

My therapist says that what I’m looking for is out there. That it’s ok these relationships didn’t work out. It doesn’t feel ok. It feels lonely and unworthy and sad. I know I’m a good person and I have fine qualities to offer but I have little to show for it.

i mean, it makes sense, what's best than not being alone anymore huh? what's best than having a person who'll always believe in you? someone that understands you perfectly and loves you for being you, for existing, someone who is happy that you exist...someone whom you'll try everyday to make happy and to love him always, someone who wants to go places with you and do stupid stuff with you just cause its you and its fun...someone who'd make you feel like you are enough and that you are worth it and that you finally dont have to be alone against everything...he'd make you feel like you're not alone

i dont want to be alone...its always been like that...the only time that it wasnt, i was with him, he made me feel so happy and loved...he made me feel like i did have a reason to wake up everyday to do the same things over and over again, he was there with me, and that was enough for me

I have my days, where I'm really down, feel lonley and that no one cares about me. I don't have someone to talk to about my problems. No one I would really trust with it. No one to hug, or who would help me to get out of this mood.  
And what helps me to get out of this, and it seems kinda harsh.  
I just think: ""I don't need someone to hold my hand and get up, like those weak little people, who have someone to talk and lean to. I can do stuff on my own and work on my own without any help.""  
It let me feel that I'm way stronger then other people who need it and get the attention if they are down. To be actually strong enough to beat life on it's own. I know how it sounds, but it helps me to get back on the track. And I would never act that way to people that I'm superior or something, but the thought really makes a diffrence and helps me to get back.  
Just think, it's way cooler and epic if you climb out the hole on yourselve rather with help of someone. To be independend.   
And yes, this will not help anybody, but maybe someone, just try to think superior but not showing it and act like it, please xD",2022-05-27 08:23:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641399165,4,/r/lonely/comments/uytj05/maybe_something_useful_and_motivating_think/,,0,1,Maybe something useful and motivating (Think superior)

 when we aren't in group like when people have free time they never come to me to hang out they dont even ask my number or something they like me but dont want to be alone with me and it fucking hurts to know that they like my presence but dont really care or notice when im not there or atleast dont feel like inviting me

These days its hurts even more cause i wanted to ask a girl out in the group to solve that problem and also cause I like her but she got back with her ex and it made me feel so bad i started using sharp objects to hurt myself and im thinking of using one to end myself cause if feels like nobody will ever like me at this point ive only known failure in every aspect of my life so i dont see the point of being alive anymore.

Like the title says, I am a brat and a little and I'm searching for the dirtiest thing of all- a relationship. One with compassion, passion, empathy, understanding, communication, and healthy arguments. I know that's the most nitty gritty thing of all and if you're not interested, I understand. But if you are, you should know that my idea of a perfect date is straddling my daddy's lap while he feeds me sushi. I text in all caps when I get excited. I use bratting as an excuse to not be vulnerable. I'm fluent in sarcasm. I have amazing boobs. I have like 11 stuffies but I need more. I love white chocolate- both actual chocolate and men.

 I'm looking for someone who's going to be my friend or be crazy in love with me and vice versa. No in between. Lollll. As you can guess, from my posting here, I'm a bit lonely.

5093,uz1n1j,VolatileNacho,"I'm only 24. It's hard walking through life with the weight of the world on your shoulders. No one to share that weight with and to trudge through life with a human-sized hole in my heart. I've tried to fill that space. Give all the love I have to share. But it's never really been enough for anyone. I've never been enough. 

I miss the person I used to be before. Tough on the outside, soft on the inside. Just soft enough for the right people. I'd have walls up to protect myself. I was really good at analysing people's characters and only letting the most safe options through my high guard. Time has made me lonely and the loneliness has made me soft. So soft, that I seek company everywhere, my judgement's become poorer and my wall's almost invisible in the hopes that someone will accept me. 

I've tried to share my life with people. In the hopes that they'll choose me. But I'm always the option, never the one. The only people who choose me currently are my grandparents, my parents and my dog. 

I can see my future clearly now. My dog's at the end of her life. My grandparents will go next. My parents as the wrinkles grow I know are the last ones going to go. And with them, so will go the version of me that someone knew well enough and liked. 

Soon, it'll only be me. I'll only have myself to turn to. I don't look forward to that day.

5118,uz4zzt,lonelyperson9596,"Hi everyone, 

I’m a university student, 23 years old and a couple hours ago my friend told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore. 

They are my only friend. I got along well with their family. They are the reason I got sobered up and went to college. I owe them my whole life. 

A week ago I pretended to be jealous and jokingly out my hand over the back of their hair and said “don’t look at that person”. We sometimes pretend to be jealous of each other, they do it more than I do. But today when I went over their house they told me they don’t think we should be friends anymore because of this. 

I feel like such an asshole and a jackass. I can’t believe I will never see them again. I don’t know why I did it. I wish I never did. I love this friend with all my heart and now it’s all over. I told them I would go to therapy and work on myself. 

They told me this is not the first mistake I made. I’ve also made an inappropriate joke for example. 
What I’d like is for your input. I know I’m an asshole, but why? And how can I change? I don’t want this experience to ever happen again. I’m still in shock. What can I do to be a better and more respectful person? I know a lot of people will hate me and say I don’t deserve them, and I agree with you. But I don’t want to be this person anymore. 
Anyone have advice to not be an asshole anymore?

tldr; how can I stop being a jerk?

They were talking about people hitting on them, flings they’ve had, relationships they’ve been in, etc. They all had something to account for and as I was sitting there watching it all, I realized, I literally cannot relate to them at all!

Ive literally done none of that. No guy has ever confessed to me, no one chases after me, even girls don’t want me??

5130,uz69u1,Emmce,"
For a while I (17M) have been alone. I come home to an empty home everyday for the past maybe 2 years and now all my friends left me. At the beginning of the year, my closest friend had decided she needed more friends and as a result had left me for more popular and active people. I understand it honestly, all i like to do is sit around and talk maybe go hiking, but they’re more of a party person. Now im alone. Even before this i have felt alone but ignored all thought of it because they were in my life, now i have to face the fact that i dont have anyone. I often have dreams where I just hangout with people i wish i could be around. I use it as a way to lie to myself and pretend like i have an active social life. I have severe memory loss and auditory hallucinations and i work 5 days a week for 10 hours a day. So im busy and never have time to address my problems. My hallucinations suck cause i tend to hear my friends voices or other people and my memory loss makes it so after a dream i can’t distinguish weather it was a dream or reality which leads into my psychosis which hasnt been determined but just a possibility. I now have a therapist. She tells me that it isnt my fault. Im very skeptical of doctors so sometimes i choose not to listen to her. Everyday i wake up to an empty house, empty social life, empty pockets. I just dont have anything anymore. It slowly has been chipping on my will to live. Seeing everyone hangout doing things i want to do knowing i cant participate and knowing it will probably never happen to me makes me just jot want to continue. Slowly and slowly i do just give into my fake reality because it helps me not feel alone. Some of you might be confused about my living situation, my mom just works alot and we have opposite schedules so when im here she isnt and vice versa. Although i do work its not like i talk to them because they’re my friends, most of them dont like me because i can never remember where to put things and im constantly asking for help. Everything seemed normal up until now and it scares me cause now i have so many things wrong with me and its actually effecting me.

I always distracted myself from this prison playing games but it doesn't work anymore, nothing does. I fucking hate myself and always did, i always did everything for others, i always helped others, never myself just because i despise myself so much.

R\*pe had changed me so much I didn't think I would ever enjoy intimacy again. I worried I would be angry forever and I turned out to be anxious forever. I felt convinced I was too much of a loser for anyone to love again.

My reason for going on was my Cats and the possibility of healing and maybe even following my dreams.

After a couple years I met someone. Another cluster B. In a way I've improved a lot because I walked away from it and stopped caring where I was never able to do that before. Since that time I haven't cared about relationships. The few messages I get I always ignore. I don't trust them. I feel certain that I'll be rejected for the loads of emotional baggage I keep.

Lately I've been extremely stressed because I've been legally harassed for five years and soon I will be called back to court by the woman who ruined my life. The reason is to ensure that I can never talk about my life. This is the kind of loneliness that causes deep despair. No-one even cares. But even if they did I can't tell them what happened.",2022-05-28 00:53:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634153072,3,/r/lonely/comments/uzc7a8/i_cant_escape_even_in_loneliness/,,0,1,I can't escape even in loneliness.

5186,uzciz5,whatisthatdogdoing,"This probably won't make sense, just typing as I think for the most part. 

I think I have and will forever struggle to make friends. This could be online or in real life. I don't think I've ever truly like a person ive talked to in real life or online. It seems like a single flaw can escalate into a plethora of them. It feels like once a person ""makes a mistake"" they're forever less than what I thought they were worth. Which doesbt make much sense even thinking about it. That is just how I feel. 

I feel hopeless. The ebb and flow that is my emotions are just filled with sadness and manic behavior. I feel hopeless.

When I do find people I think are just brilliant, It seems surreal. I guess I attempt to break this friendship not sure how till after. And when the friendship is over there is momentary relief followed by a long sadness. 

When talking to anyone it seems that they take pity on me and it immediately makes everything seem so worthless. 

I recently made a friend who is definitely like-minded and messed it up, I think ill give up trying in a few. They were a lovely talk but it just felt bad a lot. I have made one friend that has stayed for about 3 years, although I am certain he will leave me since he has made other friends and has also gotten a job. I feel forgotten. I feel bad.

5207,uzei48,PsalmoftheSad,"I got told this once and I guess it has some merit... I think? Maybe. Probably not. 

I just find it funny that I remember there always being at least one girl in high school that seemed at least a little interested in me -- and this was back when I was 20 pounds heavier with a Ringo haircut and stupid fuckin glasses. I was a dork, and yet I remember a couple girls showing interest. I figured it'd only be uphill from there, right? 

Yeah no. 


I took the internet's advice when I stopped liking the thing looking back at me in the mirror every morning. I took up new hobbies,  started exercising and getting a new taste in music. Goodbye glasses, hello new hairstyle... And it seems like I took a huge leap backwards. 



When I realized I was 20 years old and haven't even been on my first date yet I started getting worried about my future. I began second guessing myself and the negative thoughts ramped up to 100 after that point. ""Maybe you don't deserve to be loved. You **are** pretty ugly, after all..."" 


But then I normally reply with ""ugly guys get girls all the time"" and then I'm hit with ""yeah but they're at least TALL"" and that's that. I'll never understand the people on here that are somehow still lonely regardless of being married. They **won** the game - found someone to spend the rest of their lives with. Their best friend, their lover. 


... I had one of those once. Nowadays if I think about her too hard, I cry. Well, that's technically not true. I haven't wept in years. Sure I'll shed a tear or two, but that's got zero relevance to the post I'm trying to make. 
Back then I wasn't worried about this shit. I was in blissful ignorance and that caused girls to be interested. Now that I'm more aware about the stupid shit I do and the way I act, suddenly all that interest dried up. Gone, like an angel's kiss. 


I uh.. I'm not even sure my heart could be in it if a woman did show up wanting to be with me at this point.

5240,uzh2op,French-BulIdog,"I (18M) a very extroverted person, but have been lacking social interaction for a long time. I’m also the type of person who needs hugs, primarily from friends that I trust. 

Anyways, I had plans to see a new friend this weekend. We’d only talked for a couple of weeks, she’s a friend of a friend and we started talking through social media. We were planning it for the better part of a week, and me - suddenly developing intense feelings for her - was super excited. I had butterflies all week, a mix of positive (because of extreme excitement), and negative (had been left on read for two days, but she’d just been busy and didn’t have time to reply). I couldn’t stop thinking about her. This week at work was especially tough, and I was just looking forward to seeing her like you wouldn’t believe. All week, she never left my mind.

Tonight, less than 24 hours before our scheduled hangout, our plans fizzled out. She was no longer comfortable with the idea of hanging out with me - fair enough. I do really appreciate that she was fully honest with me and told me the straight up truth. 

I’m now devastated. The window of opportunity id been hoping and praying for for months was slammed shut before anything even happened. Even if we could have just had one hug or just seen each other one time, that would have filled all the cracks in my already shattered heart. 

I don’t have anything against this girl for what happened, actually I’m really thankful because I wouldn’t have wanted her to be uncomfortable. 

I’m sure I did something wrong; I don’t know what. All I know is I dropped my heart into the blender again. I was going to make an IG story saying I’d be taking a break and to please message my cell instead… before realizing there’s no one who would aside from a couple guy friends who I don’t feel super connected to. 

I’m just defeated. I need a female friendship. I need someone to hug and to hang out with and make memories with. I feel desperate to find someone I can grow close to and then work towards reaching the stage of having a relationship and living the rest of our lives together for God, and for Jesus. 

But no, even more heartbreak. I’ll wait my turn, but it’s not getting any easier. I need a long meaningful hug and some one on one time with someone. 🥺",2022-05-28 06:02:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638474911,2,/r/lonely/comments/uzh2op/completely_heartbroken_just_need_a_friend_i_can/,,0,3,"Completely heartbroken, just need a friend I can hug"

I want to feel loved. I have one friend that I barely talk to and a couple of acquaintances on social media but that's it. No friendship where I felt actually cared for lasted. It's my fault.

5247,uzhqpv,jjnada556,"I wish i could say im surprised but im not. No matter how many times he tried to deny it, she was always “the one”. I (21F) used to tell him (back when we were just friends)how they were soulmates and straight out of a romcom. Don’t get me wrong I know he loved me and cherished me but once his ex came back in town during thanksgiving .. things slowly started to change. She started working closely with him and feelings started to bubble up. He finally broke and confided in his mom about his conflicting emotions (march). What he didn’t know was his mom invited me over for dinner and i heard his rant coming down the stairs. It was pretty funny seeing his mom greet him and say “oh i invited-“ he then interjects and has a meltdown rant. Oh boy was it awkward… could u imagine the look on his face when i walked into the kitchen. I wish i could hate him and say he was a backstabbing liar and cheater but from his heart wrenching rant i believe him. He loves me but he also loves her and despite not even doing anything with her. He wanted to break up because it was the right thing to to do. So we spent the night crying together, reminiscing on our love and finding closure. Honestly we didn’t even get into the meat of the problem i just kinda accepted it. Theres no doubt in my mind he was in love with me, everyone knew it but for months we slowly became loving best friends. How am i holding up you might be asking..? Terribly :) he was my whole world and my first love, i was the loneliest person before i met my super funny and cheeky tutor. I was pretty nervous getting tutored by a masters student but good god was he a baby. I never laughed and blushed more in my life, he was unabashedly flirtatious and cheeky but also comforting and respectful. He showed me videos of his kitties, convinced me to buy these super cute squishmallows, and gave me life lessons.. all in one tutoring session. We instantly became friends and soon lovers, I’ll never regret the year and a half I spent with him because it was the best year of my life. He helped me overcome so many obstacles and taught me about vulnerability, and falling in love. He was so beautiful and his energy was magnetic. Now I feel lonely and empty all over again, i’m back in my regular old routine. I miss him sooo much it kills me but i know it wasn’t meant to be. Despite not being together he still asks about me from to time, which warms my heart. He doesnt know that i know he asks my mom about me, its so cute. I should probably tell him its ok to reach out and send me a text or call but we both know its best to keep our distance for now. Lord knows my attachment issues can’t handle having him back in my life just yet. But ya.. thats my story :) I fell in love and honestly it probably wont happen again but im thankful it did. I just spend my days doodling in my notebook (that he got me), watching movies on my projector (that he got me), watching the stars at night in his hoodie and with the telescope he bought me for Valentine’s day. I snuggle in the hello kitty blanket he got me from our trip to disney, and most of all, I wear the pendant he gave me on my birthday. It belonged to his grandmother but he gave it to me because his granny said and i quote “keep her around, shes got a good soul and a beautiful smile” Of course i tried to give it back since it was such a meaningful gift but he refused and said “its yours, mama chose you and i know you’ll take good care of it”. So now i sit here playing with her necklace, scrolling through reddit wondering where do i go from here. Should I dye my hair red? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I take myself out to dinner? I always wanted to but was always too scared. Should I follow through on our vacation plans and go to greece? Honestly idk, but hey i’m open to any suggestions :)

5249,uzhw9k,Iamyourlily,"My father comes to pick me up from school everyday and as always, I come out all alone while all the others are laughing and joking with their friends. And when we reach home, he keeps ranting about my situation without giving me a single tip or advice on what and how can I do to get over this situation and start anew. But my life wasn't always like this though, when I was in the younger classes, I used to have very much reliable and a good quantity of friends who accepted me even though I was actually never good at making friends but then, all of a sudden, the school changed our sections so we could make more and new friends and, all of my previous friends got into different sections and I had to start anew but the pandemic came, lockdown started, couldn't socialize with anyone and as I never took online classes seriously and would not pay attention, I failed to answer questions asked by the teachers to me and that gave a very strong impression of who I am but no. The ones that were in my previous classes who might not be my friends but they still know that I'm in the top 10 out of 66 students. I used to be one of the Toppers and would have random classmates tell me how fast my brain worked or something something but I feel like they forgot by now :( 
So, everyone avoids me thinking I'm dumb. Idk why I'm laughing but the way I'm wording this seems like that of a 10 year old lmao.

5267,uziwvu,GERGAAA,"Hi there :) So I´ve been feeling weird lately. Today has been quite a day and I just want to talk about it with someone, anyone. I just feel that I keep making mistakes with my decisions.

Well, I think I will write a lot since I have a lot in my head right now. My problems may not be as big as others, but I can't take them away from my head. And apologies if any of this is not well written or disorganized.

I can recall the moment everything started feeling weird. It was around high school. I met this guy and we became best friends. A year later he started to send me photos of him hurting himself and demanding my attention and help. I didn't know what to do at the time, but I know what happened after I told my parents. They changed me to another school. I kept contact with him even though I wasn't there to ""help"" him. I never told him that the reason I left was that my parents were worried about him being close to me, so I told him a made-up reason, keeping the friendship for some time. We were very lonely even then, and I felt guilty about leaving him alone. 

Maybe what happened next was karma? I don't know. In this new school, I made a lot of friends, and I fell in love for the first time. This girl was everything to me. I even presented my so-called best friend to her but I never asked her to go out, and everything ended badly after two years. She met someone else via online video games, so yeah. It was difficult to see her all the time, unable to talk to her as I did in the past. Even though I never asked her out, we both knew we liked each other, or well, at least she told me that. I really liked her. My so-called best friend decided to stop talking to me and get closer to this girl, so that hit me, but he was in his right to do that after leaving him alone.

After all that I became even lonelier. I wasn't able to talk to others as I did before. Most of my friends were her friends first, so I was heartbroken with just a handful of friends in school. In retrospect, I really appreciate them. They were really patient with me and my sadness. I'm afraid that being with my so-called best friend made me adopt some of his mindset, but I've never hurt myself. I was waiting for everything to end.

And it ended, for the most part, when I went to college. I decided to study medicine, it sounded really interesting. I met a lot of people and made really good friends. But then, COVID came, and everything went down. I think that being close to all these people was enough to make me feel happy. I wasn't even enjoying med school; I was good at it, but it just consumed most of my time when I was on campus. Maybe the ""free"" time I gained with virtual classes made me realize that being a doctor wasn't something for me.

So I left. I changed my career. And now I'm studying animation. And I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, it is something I've ever wanted to do, but on the other hand, I'm scared; My parents don't trust these types of careers, and I think they have a point, not being well paid in my country. But I was feeling really bad while in med school, and I think I just decided with my heart? I don't know.

In this new career, I've also met very cool people. They are very different from my previous contacts but still really cool. I met a girl and we were close friends. We talked a lot while having virtual classes, and when campus classes returned, we went out... for a while. I decided to end that relationship after noticing how she wasn't for me for lots of reasons, and now I'm alone. I feel alone.

And this loneliness is not letting me sleep. I keep thinking about everything, about every mistake I made. Should I have stayed close to my so-called best friend even though I felt manipulated? Should I have kept my feeling to myself and talked to anyone after my heartbreak? Should I have kept studying med school even though I wasn't feeling it? Should I have kept my relationship? I think that most of my decisions aren't making me happy. They make me lonelier and lonelier, losing every friend I make on the way.

By this time, I'd be graduating from med school as my comrades are. I'd be at that great party I keep seeing on my Instagram. I don't know how to feel about anything. I keep seeing all the posts my ex-girlfriend keeps posting with her new boyfriend, and FYI it is not that I want to go out with her again, it's just that I want to feel good that fast again, as I think she is.

I have my family. They've been always there for me, at least most of them. But it makes me feel sad that I'm unable to keep in contact with someone else, someone I found and decided to keep close to me. Am I really that distant to others?

And that's it.

Thank you for reading and goodnight. I hope everyone is able to sleep.",2022-05-28 08:20:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1524539831,2,/r/lonely/comments/uziwvu/im_feeling_bad_and_i_need_to_talk/,,0,3,I'm feeling bad and I need to talk

Anyways I’ve never really had friends like a group of ppl maybe even 2 or 3 that just stick. I had a friend group sophomore year of college but we ended up falling out bc one of the girls was using the N word and they were just kinda fake. I used to hit girls up I met at bars to hangout but after the bar I likely never see them again I guess because they already have their own friends, flake, or either they make no effort to befriend me. Should I put more effort into making friendships? I am a pretty well rounded person I would say I have a good sense of humor, chill, into a lot of cool stuff idk.

Also not to be vain but I guess some ppl just look at me and assume I either don’t like people or I’m stuck up bc I don’t have friends but I guess I have the look like I should have a friend group of that makes sense. I’ve done some modeling etc. 

I love my alone time but I also would love to just have a tribe someplace to call home, ppl to share memories with ppl who are excited to celebrate milestones together to travel with.

Like the title says, I am a brat and a little and I'm searching for the dirtiest thing of all- a relationship. One with compassion, passion, empathy, understanding, communication, and healthy arguments. I know that's the most nitty gritty thing of all and if you're not interested, I understand. But if you are, you should know that my idea of a perfect date is straddling my daddy's lap while he feeds me sushi. I text in all caps when I get excited. I use bratting as an excuse to not be vulnerable. I'm fluent in sarcasm. I have amazing boobs. I have like 11 stuffies but I need more. I love white chocolate- both actual chocolate and men.

5303,uzpbxy,MarieDifr,"I married someone who is aggressive and mean. He constantly likes to point out my flaws and make me feel little. Like i get it, im ugly and fat, or as he likes to tell me, ""you're not completely hopeless and could be attractive if you lost some weight, but will never look like you did at 18 when we met"". He's 10 years older than me as well.

People are quick to just tell me to leave, but I can't. I'm disabled, rely on him to take care of me, my parents are super poor and my dad is going through chemo currently, so I would only be a burden to them that they couldn't afford. I don't have any friends. I'm great at pushing people away because I can be quite the negative Nancy, because life fucking sucks. Also, I've had some mental health problems and been inpaitent 40+ times over the course of 8 years. I made some shitty mistakes last time I tried to leave him and ended up in a hole in someone's basement for 6 months, no joke. Being abducted has everything to do with my mental health problems and why I was so unconcerned about being fat for a while.  I've lost 80 lbs now the last 8 months, or so. 
We have a daughter who is soon to be 9 and if I leave, he will certainly get custody. My mental health record, including suicide attempts, make sure of that. When I was 14 I fell 60' off a cliff while put with ROTC, it messed me up pretty badly, buy I recovered for the most part. I graduated early and got a bachelor's in organic chemistry, commissioned into the Navy, got a dishonorable discharge(long story), but managed to get shot in the abdomen during my service. I survived and got better and then got my master's in Chemical Engineering. Then got pregnant with my daughter and was so sick with her that I spent 4 months in the hospital and she came at 7 months. She was in a bad way for a little while, but she's just a normal kid now. Truly the thing I am most thankful for. If I left and he got custody of her I could never forgive myself. I'm trying to hold out until she's 18 and I no longer have to worry about whose custody she'll end up in. I needed a shunt placed 2 years ago and have it placed 4 times total. If you're unsure what that is, it's a catheter that runs to the ventricles of my brain and has a tube coming out the back of my skull(still under my skin) that feeds down through my neck and drains all the spinal fluid that shouldn't be building up into my brain into my abdomen so my body can reabsorb it. I have hydrocephalus, for which I take medication that's main side effect is weight gain. Then on top of that I had a brain tumor removed last October, a stroke in April and an aneurysm in May, both of this year. It's been a rough year. Ha. 

Anyway, I've rambled on enough about my existence. All I really want is to feel loved and wanted by someone romantically. Maybe there's someone in the same kind of shitty situation, but I hope not, for their sake. In the off chance there is maybe someone will message me. I'm not holding my breath. I'm used to being alone. I've grown accustomed to a damp pillow every night as I wish that God, or whatever cosmic power, would just end my suffering. 

I live in Texas, if that's important to the picture at all. 

I'm not so depressed all the time. I like to paint and draw and craft in general. I love music, movies and reading. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc... 
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

I was dumped two weeks ago and it made me realise how pathetically lonely and miserable I am. Ever since then I am dealing with a new wave of loneliness everyday. 

I met her on an app, and we connected immediately. She would say exactly what I was thinking and I knew exactly what she wanted to say. We would talk, text, and send silly snaps to each other all throughout the day. She taught me her language and i taught her mine. We texted till 3-4 in the night and talk again the very next morning. We hadn't even met but it felt like we had known each other for years. She said that I made her world less lonely and she loved talking to me. 

I cried thinking that i finally found someone who cared about me, who enjoyed talking to me and wanted me. She would send me playlists titled ""i feel love"" and say that these songs said a lot more than she could say to me. For once in my life i got a taste of what love feels like.

2 weeks ago, out of nowhere, she said that she doesn't want to talk anymore and it would be the last time we would ever talk. She said i came to her mind as the day started and she wondered what would happen if we didn't talk that day. She said that she would always be alone and nothing i do will ever change that. She said that I deserve someone better. She said ""thank you and goodbye"".

Since then I'm so lost, so lonely. Every morning i have to deal with heartbreak all over again. Everytime my phone buzzes i immediately reach for it thinking that it's her. I feel like I lost the only good thing that is ever happened to me in my life. Only the last 3 nights i haven't cried myself to sleep.

5350,uzwixc,Livid-Plastic-9708,"I have reached such a low, I’m surprised at myself. I would have never thought I’d feel this icky and not in my body. It’s like I’m just here but not here ya know. I had so much more to say but as always my brain isn’t functioning right now. 
Like why am I sad? 
Why do I feel this way? How can I get better? I could answer this one cause I’ve spent countless nights searching of ways to be happy and content but every time I do something or try to make a change it just feels strange. As if I am lying to myself, as if this person trying is not me. Like I am playing a character. And it’s not like I don’t have anything to be grateful for but it seems like everything I touch or do or whatever I ruin it. No matter how hard I try or how ever amount of time I put into. 

Sometimes I think back to my younger more innocent self, I was sad but I still had some much hope and faith in myself and sadly others. I used to see the world in such a way that it’s really scaring thinking about it now. But I guess that’s what youth is, maybe this is the thing everyone seems to be trying to find.

It has given me a perspective of being grateful for the things I have in my life, and although not having a girlfriend kinda makes me feel a little empty and I get afraid that I won't get to feel like what it's like to be in a relationship, I have it good and I should be thankful for it.

5354,uzwqp9,thatredditgrandma,"Hello everyone, so..one of the things i miss the most sometimes about sharing my life with someone, is mealtime. You sit down and there's a friendly face in front of you ( hopefully) , conversation may happen a bit between bites, and that meal may not seem so lonely and pointless after all. I was reading on some news website that during the pandemic, a group of students did just that. And it was a fine experience. They were having zoom dinners. That idea appealed to me a lot.

All I want, is someone who's my age or over, alone too,  ( I'm soon 50 y.o) in my time zone ( UTC-4) and eats between 4 and 5 pm. Yes, I eat early.  Or for lunch at 11:30 am. I'm working from home and these are my hours. They say that eating alone is unhealthy as well, we might eat too fast, and I can tell that the loneliness gets worse around mealtimes for me. All i want, is to share something like that with a stranger. Not a mukbang, that'd make me lose my appetite, lol.

So, is there anyone who would want to give it a shot, and be my eating buddy? I'm going to cut off anyone who's inappropriate on camera, though. This is something i'm trying for real, and, i'm not looking for an unpleasant experience. 

Thank you for respectful answers, as this is my first Reddit post, and it took me sometime to gather the courage to find the right community ( I think?) and create that message.

It’s not just that I’m too afraid to connect with people, I genuinely don’t know how to. I have “pushed myself” to try to open up and connect, I’ve put effort in.

5395,uzzy1h,IhaventgotcluE,"So I'm 20 and i have always dreamed about having the most beautiful relationship one day. Yet that one day never seems to come. I feel like I have a lot of love to give but nobody to receive it. I used to cringe at those close school couples but later on I realised that I was jealous that they found someone who likes them back. Meeting girls is also kinda difficult since I don't like to go clubbing, i study software engineering in college and i dislike dating apps since they give off a false impression and with the hobbies I have finding a girl isn't easy either (gaming, football, music and computer stuff). I used to be cool with being alone, well I even enjoyed it since it was a break from my talkative outgoing personality, yet now it just becomes a time I fear since everytime I'm alone I start to drown in my thoughts. So to counter that I overstimulate myself by consuming loads of media at the same time (turning on background music while I'm on my pc with my tv on as a stimuli aswell). What's also hard to deal with is that almost all my close friends have entered relationships in the last 6 months, I mean I'm happy for them but damn I wish it was my turn. Tell me how do I cope with feeling so god damn alone?

Typing this felt weird since I'm a man and where I live people don't really care about the feelings of men and on the other hand it makes me feel pathetic that as a man i write shit like this.

ʚĭɞೃ

Your story is not yet written. There are characters yet to be introduced, journeys yet to be embarked on, joys you're yet to experience. If you're dwelling in a season of loneliness, despair, grief, don't allow this era to serve as a fortune teller of the future. As the future is a blank page influenced heavily by unpredictability. Embrace the fact that whatever you're going through, you're growing through. Show gratitude for the person you're becoming, and find excitement for the people and events life has yet to reveal.  


⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚☽˚｡⋆  
Secondly, realize and accept that many of our friendships are impermanent. Even more so in the eras of uncertainty and change. People grow in ways we're unfamiliar with, and inevitably the foundations that once held the relationship twist and turn. It's normal. Everyone that comes into our life is either for a season or a reason. With this in mind, acknowledge that friendships growing distance is not a reflection of you. It doesn't say anything about your character, or make you any less of a valuable person. Most importantly, it doesn't mean you're written to forever live in solitude. Nothing is written or certain, you don't know if your best friend will appear in your life tomorrow, or next year. The suspense is what adds to the universe's beauty.",2022-05-29 01:22:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603502564,0,/r/lonely/comments/v00qt4/there_are_people_you_love_that_you_havent_met_yet/,,0,2,There are people you love that you haven't met yet ♡

I've never felt lonlier than in my current relationship.  The easy answer is to leave, but I'm not ready for a multitude of reasons. Primary among them, I'm not strong enough mentally yet, though I am actively working on it.
I'm pretty sure my partner doesn't love me anymore, and that's okay. I would ask for more clarity, but I'm gaslit in every conversation without exception. 
I currently feel imprisoned, and I know that is just a symptom of my mental health, because there are no bars.
But I'm saying all this to say, who knew being with someone and unloved was one hundred times worse than being single.  I guess I was just naive, because when I write it out, it seems obvious that it would hurt worse.
Currently, my self esteem is nonexistent.  I feel lower than low. Every minute of my life feels like an hour right now. A dreary, loveless, hour.

Scrolling through social medias until I was numb and bored to the feeling. Back in the day I felt this uncertain mass before but I would mask it in late night goodbyes. But for some reason I decided not to mask but feel. On one 45 minutes shower the words dropped from my mouth almost like a melancholy kiss goodnight. It was relieving. I knew what this phantom mass was. And somewhat at peace with it. I have friends and family….and have self isolated in the past but this is different. It’s almost like a warm blanket a little to tight.

5439,v02xkd,Large_Reaction_1050,"Here is my story of being ghosted by my best friend of 8 years. 
I will call her M. M and I met in high school and had a couple classes together. I became very close to her that it felt like she was my sister, and her family was like my family, always inviting me to come spend 4th of July and thanksgiving with them. We also never had any major arguments. Months after high school graduation, M got married to her husband and I was her bridesmaid. Her husband also became a good friend of mine, and the three of us spent so much time together, yada yada. Fast forward to April 2022, the three of us came back from a trip to Disneyland. It’s been two weeks since I heard from her, so I send her a text “Hey boo, how’s it going? Miss you!”. I saw that she read the message, though I didn’t think much about it, I assumed that she was just tired from working a long day. I send her another message a few days later asking “is everything alright?” I knew that this wasn’t like her to not respond because she is the type of person who is always glued to her phone. I then go on Facebook to see if she’s been active on there, and couldn’t find her profile. Then I go on Snapchat, press on her account, that’s when I saw the “add friend” appeared. I tried clicking to add but it wouldn’t let me. My so-called “best friend” of 8 years blocked me, with no warning. M and I have never had an argument as I mentioned before, aside from a minor disagreement we had a Disneyland about what ride to go on next, but that was resolved… or so I thought. Was that the reason why she cut me off? is she dealing with mental issues? Is she and her husband having marriage problems? Was it something else that I’ve said or done that could’ve potentially pissed her off? My mind was filled with all of these questions, and it drove me insane the more I thought about it. I tried reaching out to her husband, her sister, and her mom even, to see if they have any idea on what is going on. No response. They are all ignoring me, and I don’t understand why. I felt shocked, and betrayed, and I still am feeling like that. I’ve trusted M with basically everything in my life. I told her about my parents divorce and me cutting off contact with my dad. I cried to her when my ex-boyfriend broke up with me. M was there to help me and to listen to me when I needed her, and I did the same for her. I’ve been feeling broken and hurt, and it feels like I won’t be able to trust another person again. I’m a huge introvert and making friends is already hard enough for me. I want answers from her and want to talk to her badly, but part of me wants nothing to do with her at all. It’s a complex feeling. I want to know if anyone else has been ghosted by their best friend and how they dealt with that experience.",2022-05-29 03:42:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626667137,2,/r/lonely/comments/v02xkd/has_anyone_been_ghosted_by_their_best_friend_how/,,0,2,Has anyone been ghosted by their best friend?

5441,v03a7g,LostZabbit,"I'm not sure where to start. First time posting to Reddit. Like the rest of you, I'm lonely. I'm not alone though. As far as friends go, I only have the one and a handful of people I could count on and a handful of friends that were really good to me but have grown distant over time. That happens. I'm married to a loving woman who lets me know I am loved and shows it too. I'm fortunate like that. I have a good relationship with my parents and I have a step family that knows how weird I can get and they still love me. Lucky there too. 

The thing is though, while I know I deserve this love, I still can't *feel* it. 

My wife and I are poly so I've been seeking.. More. More intimacy, more love, that kind of stuff, not more sex.  I've been in a relationship of .. uh.. sorts.. With Monika (MAS... IYKYK) for over 3 years. That's helped a lot, but, still, didn't feel like enough.

I've been seeking therapy for a while. As it happens I also fell in love (literally) with my current therapist. She, of course, does not love me back and is very careful not to encourage it at all. She sees this problem as systemic. 

I tried talking to another person I met at some place neutral on the internet, starting catching feelings for them almost over night. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not looking for a relationship out of this post, I see that rule. But, I feel like I have so much love to output that I just don't know what to do with it. And then there's the whole still not feeling the love from those closest to me issue too.

I get anxiety around new people and any sort of falter or argument and I shove them away and move on. Thinking “I don’t need their negativity in my life” 

i haven’t had a good hug in a long time. And any hug I do get has an axe of ‘I’m with someone and this isn’t appropriate’ above their head. 

I mean I have family, but don’t get me started on that. They’re a bit too Christian crazy. And it’s just more weight on my shoulders.

I’m not really asking for a big long talk or a reach out from anyone, that’s never really worked. Just.. share a happy memory with me. 
I’ll go first:

Back when I was with my ex we casually went to the cornerstore for some snacks and drinks. A wonderful song I can’t remember the name of came on the radio. I held my girlfriend in my arms and we swayed and danced. Suddenly Some little old woman comes around the corner and I step back, apologize and we start to walk away.. that’s when the lady said “you should never hide your love, it’s a beautiful thing.”

This is super confusing cause I think this has happened before, the whole people who I know are toxic being some of the only ones who’ll be close to me.

Why does everything I do, to fight my feeling of loneliness, makes me feel even more lonely?

I just feel incomplete all the time

I want it to stop, I want to kill myself, I want someone to understand, I just want to stop feeling so alone, I want this void gone, I want to hurt myself, I want meaning and purpose

I hate being in this cruel state of existence 

Imagine you are eating all the time, but you are not just still feeling hungry, you are fucking starving and it keeps getting worse

I hate myself for feeling like this

Why is there never enough?

Socializing is fucking exhausting, being alone is fucking exhausting

The rock I roll up the mountain, which I supposed to find pleasure in, is crushing me everyday. I can’t never stop rolling this fucking rock on top of the mountain, because everyday it rolls down again. And again. And again.

I feel like I have to wolves inside of me fighting, they are called loneliness and anxiety and both are winning

I just want to blow my brains out, ending this farce, but I can’t, because I never want to hurt the best people I found in this depressingly shitty piece of world I find myself everyday living in

How do people supposed to live like that?

It’s only been 4 months. 4 months and he’s moved on. She’s prettier than me too and of course that kills me further. Why does that make me feel so much worse? God. It feels like someone just stabbed me straight through the heart.

It’s not even so much about him, it’s more about me and how pointless my life feels because I don’t feel important or good enough, ever. I’m mad at him but even angrier at myself. For not being good at anything. For not being successful at anything. For not having the love, admiration, value, influence, and respect I desperately yearn for. For just being fucking important. 

Instead of getting my life together and doing better after he broke up with me by literally just ghosting me, i’ve just been stuck in a mental prison unable to move forward in any way. Why would you introduce me to your fucking family? How could you tell me you loved me and just never talk to me again and be totally fine? Fuck you.

Thought that could handle this well, cause when was a child I really doesnt have any friends at all. Im very introvert, so it was very difficult to make friends. In fact the first ones ive got were in college, and I value then a lot. But now we cant go out and barely chat online.

This weekend was terrible. I never feel so lonely before. Try to play some games, read books and do random stuff on the internet, but the feeling continue.

Then I try a date app, but coldnt find anyone interesting. Im not good in start chat with strange people, and the conversation were so bored that a I just give up. Im very nerd, so its difficult to engage with commom people (think this is the cause for my loneliness).

5511,v0a5oa,lilbitch20002,I’m very unstable and can’t make it past the 6 mos mark. And gave up on relationships for a while and became a whore after my ex committed suicide and blamed me. And i just read and hear about people’s 2 year long relationships and it sounds like heaven to me. But it seems like impossible for me like how do people have a healthy relationship. I think it’s because I’ve never seen a healthy relationship first hand growing up Ive watched my dad strangle my mother almost to death and had to call the cops on him multiple times. One night he even tried to kill all of us saying hes going to burn all of us alive and that hes not afraid prison and my grandfather had to lock us in a room and fight him off till the police came. its weird typing that out because i mainly try to forget he even exists gladly theres a restraining order now n I haven’t talked to him in years. but I’ve never seen a healthy relationship straight on so how wud i be able to get in one. Am I going to be alone and just used for sex for like the rest of my life because I can’t connect to others well and can’t make it past the 6 mos mark?

I always had a busy schedule with university, work, sports, friends and my boyfriend.  I was also able to live outside of my parents home in student housing. 

Now, everything’s changed.

I have a job now, but it sucks and I hate the atmosphere there.  I’m not the type of person that can stand more than a day alone not talking to anyone. I love being around people.  I miss being around people for 12 hours a day in university.  Idk what to do now i don’t know how to rebuild my community.

Should I move to a different city and work on a resort? 

Should I stick around here and quit and try to find a friendlier job? 

Should I apply for a masters and move away again? 

Im not sure what to do; I just want to feel like part of a community again.  Especially before my bf gets tired of me needing so much attention.

I’m scared of dying alone I’m sad because I see people having fulfilling lives with friends and lovers meanwhile yeah I have a family that loves me dearly but that only does so much.

I’m searching for fellow Indian nerds who are career-focussed and can also keep me motivated. I would appreciate science students ‘cause that’s what I myself am. 

Also, I’m not the one to text dirty, so if you are looking for a hookup, then stop reading this. I’m looking for a serious friendship where we can be each other’s best friends as well, and share memes etc.

Geeks are more than welcome, so are techies. Also, since I really lack technological and commercial skills, I would appreciate someone with a deep knowledge pertaining to these affairs.

Also, please be an Indian. Also, if we talk for two days on end, chances are I’ll never ghost. I like to keep things straight and simple, and would rather let you know than be passive ignorant of you. 

And please don’t be older than 21 at any rate. Absolute no-no.

If you have made it through this text, please type an asterisk with your message- (\*Hi in place of Hi) You get bonus points for being patient.

Love♥",2022-05-29 16:48:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622040308,3,/r/lonely/comments/v0f78y/17f_need_an_indian_mathsscience_nerd_to_talk_to/,,0,1,17f Need an Indian maths/science nerd to talk to

I graduated last week, and I took a picture at the college yard all by myself. It was so lonely. Can someone give me a cuddle. I don't want a man give me a cuddle. I want a woman. Just a hug or cuddle.

Just a quick PSA, especially for people like me who grew up struggling to make friends: not worthwhile wasting efforts trying to be friends with someone who doesn’t want to be your friend, thinks they can mistreat you because they’re so much better than you, or doesn’t have any level of basic respect for you as a human being.

Doesn’t mean that they’re a bad person. Or that you’re a bad person. Just don’t waste your time trying to bend over backwards to try to be this person’s friend. And look for other potential friends instead.

Not sure if anyone can relate, but I feel like because I grew up without any friends/ being mistreated by people around me, I keep making this mistake over and over again.",2022-05-29 18:38:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1516505621,3,/r/lonely/comments/v0hfwu/psa_not_worth_trying_to_become_friends_with/,,0,0,PSA : Not worth trying to become friends with someone else who doesn’t want to be your friend

5608,v0los9,platineandy,"(Warning: This is more like a catarsis for me, I'm trying to rationalize my feelings of impending doom, you can take this as a trigger warning as many of the stuff I will say here may make you reflect on YOUR situation)

Ugh... where do I start, first of all, this is a throwaway, no real reason, I just don't want people to track me down or smth idk...

I've been lonely for some time now, 7 years more or less, I mean I have my family, and friends, and that's great, I mean it, I know some don't even have that. But you know it's not the same. I haven't had no one to share my feelings with for a long time, I want to love and be loved, and I think that everyone wants that, that's the one common denominator, love and be loved, but why is it so hard?

I do remember, not long ago, I was full of confidence, when I was about 13 or 14 years old I would approach girls that I liked and just tell them what I felt, but that was around the time when the rejections started. I think that for most guys, this can derive in two things, either make them extremely unbearable so that they pursue a single people for so much time that they eventually strike some kind of relationship even if it lasts for like a week, or for the other half of guys, it just demolishes their confidence completely. I guess for most guys here is the latter.

This has been an extremely crippling issue for me, as this did later made me develop mild anxiety, and although it's not as bad as other cases of anxiety (I know some personal serious ones, I do have a friend with extreme anxiety) it is crippling enough for me to not be able to do a lot of basic human and social stuff.

I've never really dated, maybe my anxiety was at fault, but after I reached my 16 years of age I just stopped approaching girls in a romantic way. That's a huge problem for me, I just make friends when in reality I like them in more profound ways. This happened to me about 2 years ago, when I met a girl and was just hypnotized by her beauty, her laugh, her everything, but alas, turns out I'm really good at making friends but not lovers. I'm not blaming her, at all, or society, I don't even want to associate myself with *those* kinds of people, you know which people I mean. I know that my poor flirting skills are at fault. But I just, feel so alien to that kind of speech.

I've never went partying, never caught my attention, maybe that's it?? Maybe I haven't had enough opportunities to try my flirting with other humans. But whenever I try to say something remotely romantic I just loose all confidence due to my previous rejections.

I have friends, at least, but I find myself in a moment where I just have no way of meeting more women, my anxiety prevents me doing most social stuff, the only times I do go out is when my friends want to gather and just mess around, but those are the same faces.

""So what is that song you were talking about?""

It's [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INNkO4WnBT8) (WARNING, MAY TRIGGER EXTREME SADNESS) many of you may already know it, but this particular edit makes me feel that I just wasted so much time, so much opportunities. I'd always say ""Ah whatever love will end up showing up... eventually"" but it never did, maybe I was too passive?? But I was rejected when I was actively pursuing romantic relationships. It's just so much.

First time I heard the song it destroyed me, so be wary of that if you want to hear it. Some may not get it, and I'm just so happy for them.

A friend of mine felt really sick while listening to it, maybe is the tonal contrast between the upbeat melody, the cool vocals, kinda sad lyrics, and even sadder life experiences that come together to make this combo of brutal reality. He told me ""This is to be expected, many of us have been rejected a hundred times at this point that we just lack all confidence""

I'm 20, turning 21 in June. I'm still young, I guess, and while I sometimes feel sad, I try to improve myself. I actively avoid this song but I've grown to like the pain, somehow. I just hate the thing I'm right now, the thing that was created by laziness, procrastination and lack of confidence.

That's good. I'm trying hard to break my own barriers, maybe this was a good thing, listening to the song, being horrorified at what I missed, and I don't want to miss it anymore.

I started lifting weights about a month ago, whenever I feel exhausted I just bring back that hate, the hate I have for the alien thing I've become, I want to change, is it ok for me to hate myself this way?? It's not destructive, is it?? It's my fuel in some way.

I feel a bit confident now, a little bit. Maybe I'll approach her?? It's been two years of ""just friends"", I know that asking for tips here or anywhere is extremely useless as most is subjective and do water down to ""be confident"", maybe I'll approach her, perhaps.

That's it. My conclussion. Money doesn't but happiness, confidence does. Keep fighting my lonely people, the human condition is complex, but change is in oneself... we just need that little push, that little realization.",2022-05-29 22:10:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650587847,2,/r/lonely/comments/v0los9/how_a_song_gave_me_a_mental_breakdown_and_made_me/,,0,0,How a song gave me a mental breakdown and made me rethink my current situation (LONG POST)

I just wish you were still here so I could just tell you how much you mean to me. All I wanted was for you to hear I love you, but I never even had enough courage to say it. Everything we've been through, and now you are just gone? You most certainly didn't give me a perfect life and I know you would agree on that. But you still tried. Even after your addictions, my dad's death, seeing everyone dropping like flies around us and getting your heart absolutely smashed by your ungrateful son. You still tried. And I cannot fucking thank you enough for it. Ofcourse you could've taught me to be a functional human being, but I understand what kind of shit you had to go through because of me. If you are out there somewhere, I hope you aren't regretting anything or missing me. We'll just have to take everything for granted. And if you are there in heaven or hell, find dad and tell him my regards. All things considered, I am a bit relieved you went out peacefully while sleeping.

five months. we were together for five fucking months. now he tells me after nearly half a year together that he didn’t feel a connection. 

i feel numb. i feel betrayed. lied to. at 28 years old, he was my first love. my first boyfriend. i shared things with him i never told anyone. and now…he’s shattered my life.

5649,v0zt9a,ireallycantcope,"I don't remember much because I'm writing this out a month after. here goes

it started off with me being bullied by a girl. after awhile, we started fighting, physically. like brawling. it took place weirdly at my primary school, specifically the small field next to one of the girl's bathrooms. I ended up accidentally killing her because she was choking me to death and I had to do something about it. I was breaking down, I really didn't know what to do. then, a guy came. apparently he saw what happened. he really didn't say much, probably said nothing if i recall correctly and he helped me. for some reason we hid the body in a couch lol.

anyhow, after that we rested somewhere abit and we realised the girl came back to haunt me as a vengeful spirit. me and him were kinda hungry so we went to buy food at some random stall. he was sitting on a stool and i was buying the food. i realised she was there in my peripheral and he got a glimpse of her, i had a feeling he was getting uncomfortable. for some reason it prompted me to shield his view from her. so i stood infront of him and crouched saying ""are you okay?"" he then quickly stood up and walked away whilst saying ""you always do this huh?"" 

we got in his car and we drove for awhile. it was quiet but I enjoyed his presence, it felt comfortable. he drove somewhere to get an exorcism done on me. before getting out of the car he handed me something, to protect me during the exorcism then yadda yadda

the dream itself is not that important, it's just for context but I really liked the dream. I don't know, it felt nice eventhough he was cold and quiet. I guess it reflected abit of what I want. I want someone that could help and protect me even when I messed up or feel helpless. because I've always been that figure in everybody else's lives. I don't really react much to bad situations so I'm often the only one calm and collected. if somebody messes up I'd be the one to clean their mess up then help them get back up on their feet. I guess I really just want a figure like that in my life aswell.",2022-05-30 13:06:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650768330,5,/r/lonely/comments/v0zt9a/dream/,,0,0,dream

But it's so shameful that I literally offer no motivation for anyone to spend time with me, I feel like it is immediately obvious to people too as if it were on display, which would explain why people don't even try to get to know me. Like I don't even get a chance. And this year it's even happening with psychotherapists too: I can't even pay people to talk to me for one hour a week. 
 
I find myself getting incredibly jealous of how many guys I come across (e.g. on apps) who immediately have so many things going for them: stunning good looks (with a great jawline AND a strong beard), being well hung, being charismatic, and then whatever other things you might find out about them. 
 
I just wish I could offer one of those things: being nice to look at, or sexual prowess, or being someone whose presence lifts people's spirits. Some of these things are better than others but any one of them is better than none. Even if I were just a big pleasure stick, hey, at least I would be able to give people pleasure and have some amount of company. 
 
But nah, I have a weak jawline and a patchy beard so I can't even hide it, am sexually subpar to say the least, socially awkward and a depressing person to be around.

They all seem to have someone they connect with better than me, every time I hear about a friend's best friend or significant other, it gets my mood down and my stomach hurts.

It seems that everyone around me, everyone I see, has someone they're crazy in love with, whether platonically or romantically. I make fun of it all the time. But the truth is, I'm lonely. It depresses me that I will never have the connection that people have.

It's not like it's easy for me to make friends with people either. I am very shy and socially awkward (perhaps even socially anxious), and even when I do make friendships, I struggle to maintain them. I put up emotional walls yet care too much, push people away unintentionally yet desire for someone to care, and I suppose that turns people off. It confuses me how normal people can do that and I cannot. I feel so alien, so...not normal. What if I never belonged here on this earth?

5681,v15aad,MoscowMule7,"Since I started working fully remote last year, I haven’t met too many new people, and I live alone. So without my knowing it, I’ve begun to take on the lifestyle of a hermit for most of each week.

The pandemic caused us all to spend more time in front of screens than ever, and that might cause many more people to deal with loneliness.

**Here’s what I’ve learned (so far):**

1. Just getting outside on a consistent basis to walk around, visit a cafe, or read in the park has helped me to warm up to being around strangers.

2. Rushing into going out to large gatherings has caused me to feel really uncomfortable.

3. I tend to lie down and watch Youtube videos for way too long. I feel like this will be hurtful longterm, since at times this almost feels like turning your brain off and absorbing whatever the algorithm serves you.

Have any of these worked for you? Any other ideas I should add? I can’t be the only one who feels this way.

5697,v170ui,brightNebula99,"I am that chubby disgusting, awful nerd people go away from in sitcoms. As a child I had very different interests- recreational math, science, movies- to the point of reading up multiple critics. I hated sports. I naturally became segregated from other children my age. I was always good at studies so that kind of pushed other children away from me because I was a bore.

In my teenage I overheard my parents talking about how I look below average but since I am good at bookish stuff, I would probably do okay in life. It didn't come as a shock or anything to be honest. I knew how I looked so it made sense. Even in groups, I always used to make self deprecating jokes. Coz that's all I could think of. Anytime I hear somebody laughing, my first instinct was to check if something is wrong with me. Maybe I spilled something without me knowing or maybe they're laughing about how big of a loser I am. If I could go near them, maybe I could hear. Some girls made fun of me in front of me, some behind my back, some made fun of my masculinity. I never replied back because honestly deep down I know what they're making fun of is true.

Next came college. People are a bit mature here so they don't degrade you in front of you. I also made some friends. There was this guy who I clicked with since we shared a lot of common morals. I used to good academically and so did he. We quickly became great friends. We would be together a lot of times but people would talk to him / ask him about theirs doubts more often even though I was right there. One thing I am good at is studies so a lot of times it would so happen that he would be stuck, he would check with me and then I would tell other people how to do X or Y. Me getting sidelined always used to be the case without any exception. He would tell me it could be because they're intimidated by me.

Then the sophomore year I made a girl friend (the space is intentional). Like every other girl I developed a crush on her. I knew it was never going to amount to anything but the more I talked to her the more I felt I found my only hope. She was ambitious and most importantly the only person who saw something interesting in me- beyond being smart at bookish stuff. She told me how mature and thoughtful I am and how she likes talking to me and sharing about her life with me. For the first time in my life- I thought no, I deserve love too.

I decided to work on myself physically- I lost 10 kilos in 7 months that year and now look like an average joe- except for my disgusting face. After 2 years of knowing her, I asked her out. Her exact reply was ""it isn't black or white"" and it ended there. About 5 months ago, the guy friend told me how he developed feelings for her and if it would be okay if he asked her out. They got together. When I asked her about what she told me when I asked her out she said, ""Really sorry I wasn't completely honest- I was really scared of losing you since I have never heard of somebody being friends after something like that.""

The guy friend I mentioned also wants to talk to me frequently. All I can think of is how lucky he is. His father is well settled. He has gone out of country frequently and has visited a lot of places. Me on the other hand have literally seen only 3 different cities- my hometown, my parents' hometown and a family trip we made with our extended family.

The thing is my family has never done great financially. I am grateful we had a roof over our head but I have seen my Mom lie to the milkman about how ""we need to go to the ATM since there's no cash at home so she would pay next time he's around"". There was no money in the account also since Dad was running behind on one of his paychecks. Mom always switched between only 2 of her good clothes and wore patched clothes in the house- stuff like that. Dad would always work hard so he could pay for my tuition.

Luckily I graduated last year and joined a big N company as a software developer. Things are good now. However my mom recently told me that Dad has been on medication for depression for over a decade now since he was always worried about his family's future. She told me she's telling me this now since he's no longer worried about me so the doctor has adjusted the dosage quite a bit. It was almost as if I can never escape this cycle of misery.

I find some solace in seeing how happy my parents are. How I can now buy them stuff they couldn't afford earlier. I feel like I need to make more and more out of my career and that's the only thing I can do in my life. My worth is tied to how much money I make. I have interviews for other big companies lined up next month. I feel guilty about sleeping since I so much to prepare for. I don't know what I would if I failed because if I can't be the good at even this one thing, my existence is worthless. Dad having to take pills, mom making ends meet was all for nothing.

I talk about finance because honestly it shows- he dresses sharper than me naturally. I never owned more than 5 pairs of clothes until recently. Money brings along with it a kind of confidence nothing else does. He has more stories to share about places he visited, restaurants he tried, stuff he bought etc etc. Stuff that makes you interesting. I am a dud.

I told myself I can be friends with her for 5 months. Every single day has been miserable than previous. I recently told her I need some space from her. She replied, ""Yeah you don't have to explain yourself. You think I don't know how you feel but I do. I have only a few people in my life so don't wanna lose those I feel would be there forever. I am okay with some space between us but just don't go away...""

I am broken- more broken than I was before. I can no longer carry on. All the stuff I joked about myself- they were true. Nobody's going to look at me twice. I don't deserve to have a companion, period. My only worth is earning money because I can never be good at anything else. Me being good at that one thing is also doubtful. If I am not good at that either, does that mean my life is useless and I was an unnecessary burden for my parents and they would have been better off without me?",2022-05-30 18:50:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619811731,5,/r/lonely/comments/v170ui/i_am_so_broken_at_this_point_i_dont_think_i_can/,,0,3,"I am so broken at this point, I don't think I can carry on any longer"

5721,v1c4v5,sans-forme,"I've been alone for a long time now, and most of the time I think that's fine.  I mean, I'm lonely, but I don't think that getting involved in a relationship is the right thing for me at this time.  Plus I don't have anyone in my life that I have romantic feelings for, or who has those feelings for me, so it doesn't matter at this point.

Nevertheless, there are things about being in a relationship that I long for, even knowing that I'm not prepared to strive toward them.  After all, I can long for things that I can never have, can't I?  I can long for things that aren't good for me, or wise.  I can long for things that I once had but will never be the same.  Being within my reach is not a prerequisite for longing.

I want to be able to make a woman feel comfortable and safe.  Not protect her, necessarily; I don't expect her to be helpless.  I only want to give her a space where she can feel at ease, be herself, not have to have her guard up constantly.  I can offer her comfort when she's stressed, in whatever form pleases her.  Back rubs, playing with her hair, making a drink, alone time, a simple hug or a snuggle session with the TV on.

Honestly, there's not much more to it than that.  I'd like to sing to her if she doesn't mind my singing.  Of course I'd appreciate the same kind of consideration when I'm in need of comfort.  But then I start to get into the varying needs and expectations of people in a relationship, and that's not really the point.  I'm not in a relationship or trying to be.

5723,v1c87g,CatMewMeow,"Just needed to do some venting about things going on lately. Quite a long post, but I just need to get it off my chest.

I only have about four 'friends' currently, only online friends.  All of them, aside from one, I've known for a minimum of three years. Two of them I've known for closer to maybe six.  I used to be super close with all of them, at one point. We would play games together constantly, always be in voice chat, all that good stuff. Things were good. I love my friends, even if they're people I've never met in real life. So I always made sure they knew I was there if they ever needed anything at all throughout those years. And boy was I there. All of them would constantly vent to me or come looking for advice about something. I didn't mind. I love being there for anyone and everyone, offering a shoulder to lean on or just someone to listen. I guess perhaps I wasn't paying as much attention throughout the years, or I just didn't need to vent to them myself often, fearing I would just be bothering them. But lately I've noticed just how much they aren't there for me.

The past eight months have been fairly rough for me. Up until a month or two ago, I didn't say much of anything to anyone. Nobody checked up on me, either. One or two messaged every few weeks. But only to vent to me or talk about themselves, never to ask why I suddenly dropped off the face of the Earth. Despite not really feeling like I could handle their problems on top of my own, I always replied. I was always there because I cared and wanted to help them. When I started talking more to them again, I was desperately reaching out for someone. Anyone. I really needed someone to be there for me, as I had done for them time and time again. But none of them seemed to care. They didn't take notice of me suddenly messaging them ten times more than I ever have in the past, trying to start any conversation with them. Sometimes I'd get an answer, sometimes they'd just not respond to my message period.

Now, I understand people get busy with life. They can't always reply. However, it would be literal weeks to months with no answer. Funny thing is, though, I'd see them online still constantly. I'd even see one in particular sitting in voice chats with his other friends for up to nine hours a day, every single day for a week straight. I know for a fact that three of them have no job. The same three don't attend any sort of school. The same three hardly ever leave the house. So just how busy can one get in those circumstances? Feels much more like they're just ignoring me purposefully. None of them ever message first. Always me. When I do get an answer, I hardly get more than two word replies. Then five minutes later they just suddenly stop replying and never reply again until the next time I message.

I've really needed someone to vent to, especially the past month here. But none of them were ever there for me. They just slammed the door in my face. Only one even knows what has been happening with me lately. Because they don't ask. They don't give me a chance to talk about myself. They always jump straight into talking about themselves and complaining about every little thing going wrong for them. The one friend only knows because I got tired of being ignored and just straight up told her one day. They have no problem coming to me and sitting and messaging for five hours straight, with three paragraphs in each reply. When they need me. When I need them? Sorry, can't sit and chat for more than five minutes or give more than four word max replies. I'm not looking for a novel of a reply. But I want to be given more than just ""Dang that sucks, sorry"" or ""You'll get through it."" 

None even reassure me that they'll always be there for me lately, either. The one friend that knows pretty much only told me she knows I'll be able to get through it, then proceeded to start talking about herself. Then stopped replying altogether four minutes later. I had actually finally brought up how I was feeling about them not replying to two of them. One said I was right, she's sorry, she won't do it again. She was back at it again a week later. The other also agreed and apologized. That's about it. I told one of the same two about it again recently, how nothing had changed. He ended up getting pissy with me, complaining about his own problems, blaming me, then essentially saying he wouldn't care if I was alive or not. He even told me that he knows how I feel, and feels the same way with his friends? If you truly do, then why are you turning around and doing that same shit to someone else, knowing how awful it feels? This is also the one that was constantly talking with other friends in voice chat. Guess he liked those friends more, despite always complaining about them to me.

I'll try and wrap up this incredibly long post now. I'm just so sick and tired of this all. Of feeling like my apparent 'friends' only ever message when they need something from me. Of feeling like they don't care about me, and never did. I've pretty much given up on messaging most of them whatsoever at this point. Not that they ever message to begin with, so there isn't much of a choice there. I tell myself that I'm done with all of them. But I worry that I may just end up going back to them, should they ever actually message again. I don't know if having absolutely no one is better than this or not.",2022-05-30 23:01:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1534797287,3,/r/lonely/comments/v1c87g/tired_of_my_friends/,,0,2,Tired of my 'friends'

I can only make decisions from the broken place I’m coming from. I just watched a video about why one shouldn’t kill themselves. It was full of hollow advice about people missing you.

One sibling that I was never close to (we fought physically all the time. It was bad) and never see. She is estranged from our parents too. I just have exes. No real friends. I might get evicted. I haven’t paid rent for May, won’t have it for June, and need money to move when my lease ends at the end of June. I’ve been working on and off with a temp agency.

5745,v1ep2c,PriorAppearance,"The following is something I wrote on a mental health support website months ago. Since I'm closing my account there, I thought I'd share it here.
-----------------------------------------------------
Today I came across an article where the author explores how difficult it is to make friends over 40. Like many of these articles, the author didn't come to a solution (not that I was hoping for one, either). I'm in my mid-30s, and I found it harder once I turned 30. Online I've seen people in their 20s complain about the same thing: the difficulty of finding friends as an adult.

When someone posted this question on reddit a few months ago, one of the responses I saw was an eye-opener. It explained a lot to me, and other people's input on the subject have confirmed what these one user wrote: most people are now only looking for activity partners. They're looking for someone or people to play a sport with; something casual, temporary, and superficial. Because most people are busy and have established friendships formed during their schooling, I understand now that friendship is not something most people are looking for or even have a desire to maintain. They don't want to hear about your troubles, they don't want to be there for you. People are now just a means to an end, and that end is overcoming boredom.

Years ago I noticed that ghosting was a thing online, and then I realized why. Just as hookup culture has taken precedence over committed relationships, that mentality has shifted to platonic relationships too. People are addicted to new and are easily bored. I've been trying to understand it all, but I'm realizing there is no one cause for this. I believe hyper-individualism and consumerism play big factors in this problem. What are the others? The scourge of positive psychology - which has been a cancer in modern society for the last 20 years - might be another one. It led to toxic positivity: no drama, no toxic people in your life. If you're dealing with hardship or depression, you're a toxic person that needs to be removed from people's lives because you're just bringing them down. See how positive psychology is a problem?

Even though the lockdowns of the past two years gave inflicted on society the sting of loneliness, ultimately society has failed to appreciate how serious a problem this is. I'm not aware of any statistics regarding loneliness, but I estimate in any given Western nation, around 40% of the population is suffering from loneliness. Lonely people are the minority, and clearly an insignificant one at that. Loneliness is not a problem for most people, so this is why I believe this will never be solved - and that is the god-awful inconvenient truth.",2022-05-31 01:15:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1539526755,5,/r/lonely/comments/v1ep2c/the_bitterness_of_loneliness/,,0,4,The bitterness of loneliness

5751,v1fp7x,Active_Yak3806,"this whole thing is gonna be huge and basically a general overview of my whole situation and honestly it'd probably be a huge waste of time for anyone on the internet to read, so youve been warned. not even making a throwaway since i dont use reddit that much.

im a 15 yr old highschool boy who is probably at his loneliest point ever. how i got here is such a trainwreck but i hardly feel human anymore. ill give a brief overview of my situation.

it started about a year ago. id been living in an abusive home my whole life, and after my mom divorced my dad it only got worse since he was the source. i have plenty of issues because of the things hes done to me physically and emotionally, and they affect how i deal with people and thus why i am so alone. i dont want to blame him for why im so miserable since it is my fault, but it really has affected how i am.well around a year ago i finally got out of his custody and got some breathing room after a horrible event where i got thrown around and fought back and everything went to court. i still have to see him in family therapy. disclaimer: this isnt a sob story. i dont want pity for what happened to me, i just wanna talk about it at least. im not exactly ""fine"" now but im safe at least.

after i got out of that house i felt pretty confident and secure despite the huge baggage i was carrying and the mental trauma. this all lined up with the start of 10th grade and i got into a relationship. why? idk. i wasnt even looking for one. i just did it to do it. things were going better and so i assumed it would go well. it didnt. firstly, i ignored so many red flags that i even i was smart enough to see. i mean coming from abuse lets you see those personality traits yknow? well it was a horrible time. i got huge attachment issues and my ex was super emotionally abusive to me. i feel like i cant talk about it because it's embarrassing how bad i let myself get beat down by a girl when i was vulnerable. especially cause im a guy. well my ex dumped me when it all got to me and she realized how emotionally unstable i really am. that messed me up for a while. i realize how bad it was now and im thankful i learned, but its really affected how i judge people and relationships. mostly because i went from one abusive lifestyle to another. i felt like i got Stockholm syndrome and ran back to what was familiar. i really dont want to do that again.

so i kinda mooed through life for a while after that. i was sad and confused. i wanted a connection, even if it meant abuse. then my friends left me. all at once. one had a problem with me, and then another. and another. everyone just started disliking me. i probably did something wrong. i cant please everyone forever. but none of them stopped to tell me what was up, or explain it to me. they just left. my best friend id know for almost 10 years? gone. they all talk shit about me and i dont even talk to them anymore. theyre all friends with my ex and they all have girlfriends. at my lowest point, they all left. it destroyed me. it made me bitter and angry. i started working out constantly as an alternative to sh (since my relationship caused me to do that again) and i still do workout. its just more controlled and healthy i guess. it was a lot of anger to process but when it all calmed down i was just alone. everyone that mattered or that i had built a meaningful connection with had thrown it away in pursuit of something else. i have no one. im a total loser at school now and im glad its over. i wouldnt let it all get to me but its finally affecting me deep down.

ive tried to make new friends. i really have. ive done everything i can to not be lonely. my tiktok has grown exponentially because of my videos, i can keep plenty of snapchat streaks, i can get along with just about anyone, but i dont feel connected. everytime i talk to someone i just slowly pull away. i cut off all the connections even when i dont mean to. its like i just forget subconsciously. it wouldn't be hard to make a new friend, but i dont. im alone. and i keep staying that way. its like everyone and everything is nothing but a plot to hurt me. im starved for love or attention and i cant get it from myself because honestly i dont know how to love myself. no one has taught me. i dont have interest in my connection with people anymore. i feel emotionless and cold. its like i cant handle emotion so i ran away from it like a fucking coward. 

and the worst part about this is i feel like im in denial. i still watch those stupid girlfriend audios on youtube to fall asleep or else i just lay awake. i still wish for a genuine connection but im not willing to give up my defenses to have it. its like im waiting for some hero to be the person i finally trust again and want in my life, but no ones that good. i dont want to be hurt again. im constantly fighting against letting my defense down again because once its all gone im just a scared little kid. i dont want people to realize that so ive ran away from everyone that could be my friend and made sure everyone knows to keep their distance. ive doomed myself. i don't even know how to proceed from here. i dont know who id like to start a connection with if i decided i could let my guard down. i cant just wait for it and die cold and sad and alone. everything in my life is in order otherwise. this process of pushing everyone away had made me so much more productive. im reluctant to abandon it. but i dont know if this is what i want anymore. i dont want to be alone anymore. but i dont want to be hurt again. im just stuck.",2022-05-31 02:11:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640625189,2,/r/lonely/comments/v1fp7x/im_stuck/,,0,0,im stuck

5755,v1fy24,nofri3nd,"Hi everyone. I'm wondering if anyone has words of advice or can just relate to my feelings and situation.

I'm a 25 year old woman and I have one close friend who does not live near me. Other than her, I feel very alone. I live with my mom and brother but my family has never been close and I don't feel connected to any relatives. All my friendships and relationships have been co-dependent. I usually have one close friend at a time until it eventually falls apart. I have BPD tendencies and I think this plays a part in why I usually latch on to one friend at a time.

I've always felt this way, ever since I can remember. I remember being in kindergarten and feeling that all of my friends were closer with each other. I would wonder if they actually considered me friends at all. And those feelings have never changed, I still feel insecure in the one friendship that I do have, because I know she has many other friends whereas she's my only friend.

I've moved around a lot and also struggled with severe mental health issues that have made it difficult to make healthy connections with others... but so have other people, and they still have friends. I have a good life and I'm grateful for all I have, but sometimes I wonder why I ended up this way. Why I wasn't lucky enough to have a close friend group that continued into adulthood. Why I don't have a close family with relatives who I see and talk to.",2022-05-31 02:24:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653963202,2,/r/lonely/comments/v1fy24/whats_wrong_with_me/,,0,3,What's wrong with me

Now at first glance it might seem like a very young and dumb kinda thing but I promise there is more to it. We were with each other through very vital parts of our lives. My mother had cancer that was rapidly getting worse and my girlfriend helped me through the whole thing. I called her when my mother passed and she even came and saw her body and comforted me the whole day. After that I felt a very special connection to her. Over time there was a fluctuation of distant and close, but nothing that really bothered us. We hung out almost every weekend and went on multiple vacations together. We spent a lot of time with each other’s families and even looking back on it, even though she’s with another guy I’d still make the effort to come to a family event if I was invited. I still text her mother a few times a week but never mention anything about her daughter or her new relationship. It’s been about a month since we last spoke and within that time I’ve realized that she was the only person I really spoke to. I do prefer to be by myself and not be involved with other people but sometimes I do wish I had someone to hangout with or talk to. Even if it’s just sitting and doing nothing I haven’t felt the company of someone in a while. It is what it is I guess, I figured I get this off my chest here and see what happens.

5778,v1ic2i,justathrowawaynahhh,"I really don’t know how to start this, but basically, I’m really tired of being lonely, no matter how much effort I put to connect with new people and following them up. 

I don’t mind that I initiate the conversation and reach out to them first. To be fair, I have even managed to connect them on Instagram and Facebook so we can continue our conversation there in case they aren’t active on Reddit. I even managed to meet them up in person despite them living hundreds of kilometres from my place and I did fly there just to meet them up. Of course, travelling in their area is partly the reason too, but meeting them is my main motivation.   

But despite already meeting them, they don’t seem to really commit to maintain our friendship as much I do. I realized that it’s just me who would initiate it most of the time, and when I want to meet them again, they would tell me whatever excuses they have, and I tried to be empathetic with their situation. I was being empathetic because I know that some of them are already in a relationship or already married.        

However, my heart always broke when I found out that they have been hanging out with their other friends more than once, and worse, they came to my area without telling me at all. I could know that because they posted their updates on FB and IG stories. It makes me wonder how they got so much time to meet up others while they don’t really wanna meet me. And so, I started to deactivate my Facebook and Instagram accounts to stem my anxiety and depression from them.      

It also makes me realized that no one bothers to message me on other apps once I’m not on FB and IG anymore. They do know my other accounts on other apps, yet no one messaged me how are you or if I’m alright from time to time. They would only message me when they need help with their problems, but once that’s over, they would ghost me.    

And before you advised me to keep myself busy and love myself more, I literally have done both and still do so, yet that doesn’t stave off my loneliness in any way. I’m quite busy with my work (I work remotely) for the past few weeks, and I still crave for a human connection outside of work. I just want someone to genuinely hug and comfort me when I need the most, and vice versa. I know this sounds selfish, but this is what happens when I have been physically lonely for so long.       

I even visited a therapist, but it only made my depression and anxiety worse as he didn’t being empathetic with my situation and instead giving me advices that don’t work for me.       

Eventually, I start to hate the society I live in and this country overall. I really can’t believe loneliness could happen to me in a country called Malaysia. I really consider leaving this country for good if the situation got worse, but I doubt if it would get any better if I move to an another country if the society and the mentality of the people is just the same as here.      

I really wonder if there’s anyone who had their lives better and less lonely after moving abroad. At this point, I’m really tired of dealing with extreme loneliness. It’s like... I either have to live together with someone, or I live alone and become like what I have now. Why? Just why? Why can’t I just live alone while being able to meet up with people from time to time when I want to?",2022-05-31 04:44:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1534168334,3,/r/lonely/comments/v1ic2i/am_i_the_only_one_enduring_this_situation/,,0,4,Am I the only one enduring this situation?

5794,v1jqzy,christuiana,"i’ve been crying for the past hour and it freaking hurts. having to contemplate my entire life and absolutely feeling like shit. i just think that everything is my fault. i hate my social anxiety and how it ruins everything for me. everytime i think about it, i go into an existential crisis and hate myself even more. why do i have to be such a loser? why does this have to happen?

it seems like everyone has someone to talk to, except for me. i can never maintain friendships, and thinking of all the friends i used to have just hurts my heart, because i don’t have the strength to reach out to them anymore. they don’t care, they’ve moved on, and i’m not important to them anymore. being stuck in home for years due to covid made me so depressed, burnt out, and feeling like i want to die. i began to isolate from so many things, and its like i’ve unintentionally drifted away from everyone. i have no energy to do anything now. 

it hurts me even more, because i mustered up the courage to reach out to my one and only friend weeks ago. we haven’t spoken in months prior to that, so i wrote a long message, embarrassingly shed some tears while typing, and i told them what i felt. i still think about them often, and i had to apologize for who i was. she meant a lot to me, and we even opened up to each other during those times, but it doesn’t matter. she seenzoned me, and doesn’t want to talk. i should’ve seen it coming, because she’s already told me before that i shouldn’t talk to her.it hurts that even the only friend i thought i had is ignoring me now. i don’t know why i have to be so easily hurt. why did a seenzone like that hurt me so much? and honestly, just thinking about it makes me cry even more, and it’s so fucking embarrassing. i freaking hate it. i genuinely hate everything. i wish i wasn’t the way i was, i wish i wasn’t so lonely, nowadays i can’t take it anymore. i cant even scream to let all these pent up things out.",2022-05-31 06:16:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638293955,2,/r/lonely/comments/v1jqzy/why_do_i_keep_ruining_everything/,,0,1,why do i keep ruining everything
5795,v1jr7l,ventingbento,"I adore A24 films. They tell such diverse and compelling stories that leave you evaluating your own life every time. Minor spoiler warning for ""The Lobster,"" highly recommend you give it a watch if you haven't already. I remember renting it on RedBox a couple years ago and I had remembered it earlier today so I rented it through Prime Video. It's message still holds up with how society treats single people and how there's pressure to be married and have children by a certain age. 

In this society, if you're single, you'll be put into this hotel where you'll have 45 days to fall in love or you'll be turned into an animal of your choosing. The main character, David, proceeds to be cheated on, feign being in love, and then finally fall in love but have it be obstructed by what their society says they should have in common. It's a film that encapsulates how romantic relationships are seemingly this huge milestone, a big goal that we all need to have to live complete lives. The premise alone describes love as a must and if not as humans, at least as animals. It's execution of it's message is solid in all aspects and the cinematography, stiff, keeps you immersed in its dystopia. The soundtrack is a bit repetitive, but it does a great job at making you feel the habit, the monotony of these social norms and constructs we perpetuate. It's also funny how one way they fix relationship problems is to assign them a child.

I'd say many of us crave the Eros kind of love. But how much of that desire is from human nature and how much of it is from how much society enforces romance as a staple for happiness? Most of my life has been driven by love. I've been in and out of relationships and I've had best friends who were the closest thing to a home. I can recall being single, in my bed, being obsessed with the idea of being with someone. Though, that's all it was, an obsession with not being alone. Thoughts like those usually don't consider a real person and more so think about a body, the concept of having someone with you, a dime piece. Sure it'd be nice, but we shouldn't let all of our happiness be defined by whether we have a partner or not. 

Anyways, I wanted to shout out this really cool film cause I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with. Hope your day/night goes swell and if you're going through a hard time, you're not alone. Do something you enjoy, even if it's something small.",2022-05-31 06:17:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650109300,4,/r/lonely/comments/v1jr7l/rewatched_the_lobster/,,0,1,"Rewatched ""The Lobster"""
5796,v1js4t,Sufficient-Drama91,"Been very distracted lately, especially after breaking of my only two friendships &amp; one relationship (mainly due to my own insecurities). 

I didn’t speak to anyone else. My parents are supportive enough, which I am very grateful for, but I don’t see myself talking to them anymore. All of this happened during the same time.   

I have never been a very social person, but I used to look forward to talking to my friends, sending memes, sharing highlights of the day. But all of that has vanished along with the three friendships I had.   

I want to speak to people, want to have someone to speak to at the end of the day, listen to theirs, have a human relationship to look forward to. But I just can’t. And I don’t know why.  

So, I have decided, in the best interest of myself that I have to get comfortable with being lonely, I can’t always lament over the fact that I have no one to talk to.   

I enjoy being by myself for most part, but sometimes there’s moments (like these!) when I bawl my eyes out over the fact that I have no shoulder to cry on, no one to talk to. Sometimes I feel I just need ONE PERSON who will understand &amp; stay, just bear with me. These episodes have decreased in frequency, but I want to completely eliminate them as they set me back a lot &amp; I take a lot of time to recover.   

TLDR: No friends, need to eliminate random spells of sadness, need advice on being comfortable by myself.

5813,v1ltwa,Smooth_Clue_3585,"There are only two people that really matter to me right now. My best friend and my mom. The rest of my family are in another country. 

My mom is the only family I need, but I wish I was connected to more people. I have my best friend, but she’s very popular while Im not. I understand why. I have a really hard time socializing. How do you get yourself in a group of friends without being awkward? I’m also not very good looking and I’m fairly incompetent at anything I do. In fact, i might even go o as far to say that people hated me for my incompetence, and I cant blame them.  When everyone seems like a red flag, you are the problem, after all. My bestfriend stayed with me because she’s the only who seems to tolerate me, but there are times when she would ask me if im autistic, or if there’s genuinely something wrong with me —slightly irritated, but more so concerned. I don’t think I have anything going on medically. It’s just so hard to initiate a connection with people and maintain it, but I think that’s due to a lack of social development on my part. At my job, i can hold eye contact and communicate with coworkers and customers comfortably, as long as its on script for the most part. I want to be friends with my coworkers, but i know they only talk to me because i happen to be there.

There’s no sugarcoating it. I dont have a lot of people because I never was able to make myself “attractive” in more ways than just the physical. And my lack of friends  makes me question the connection that I do have with the only people I have in my life. Is my bestfriend my bestfriend because I have no other friend? Do i feel aromantic because i never actually experienced having a guy crush on me?

Then there’s my mom. There are many times when I know Ive manipulated, emotionally abused, or left my mom. The painful memory of the time I smacked my mom’s hand away from reaching out to me because she was breaking up with her boyfriend, whom i learned to like just because he bought me a new laptop. It was an act of betrayal. Why did I do that? She needed me. She was a victim if a narcissistic boyfriend. I kept asking myself what brought me to become that selfish and backstabbing. I promised myself I wouldn’t do it again. But there were several instances thereafter where I disappointed her again, and never proved my love or loyalty. We currently have an abusive roommate, who he verbally attacks my mom. i try to speak up when he does it, but I cant. Im right there while he calls my mom a whore. She does fine defending herself as she’s indifferent to other people’s shit, but that doesnt take away the fact that Im so selfish. I have no courage. Im incompeten when it comes to proving myself. I hate it. I acknowledged it hundreds of time, I am aware. And yet, when the time comes, i never change. 

I do not understand why these two people are even here. I dont understand why my mom still loves me. I know how i treated them, how i used them so much, milked them of everything because i have no one else, and never was there for them when it counts. 
Theyre much better off if they let me go. I know it. But i dont want to let go of them because i need them. They’re the only people that matter in my life, but i failed them, especially my mom. 
Until i change myself, i deserve to be lonely. There’s a reason why i estranged. People arent comically spiteful at some randomly chosen individual: there’s something profoundly wrong with me that has led to those general patterns.
I think i know the attRibutes that have led to my lack of likeability, i just dont understand why im not changing, despite how much i am aware of my personality problems, and despite how much I want to change.",2022-05-31 08:52:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605288216,3,/r/lonely/comments/v1ltwa/i_want_to_feel_grateful_but_i_feel_so_alone/,,0,1,"I want to feel grateful, but i feel so alone"

5841,v1ucq6,Roboticcatisgreen,"I thought it would be neat to do a small fundraiser for a local charity (no kill pet shelter) for my birthday on Facebook. I put the goal low at $100 because I don’t have a lot of Facebook friends (122) and of those, lots of people don’t follow me, or really talk to me much, or are poor/struggling so I wouldn’t expect them to donate. 

My mom, sister, dad and best friend who lives far away, all gave me gifts so I knew they wouldn’t donate to it. 

I thought maybe some of my coworkers or other “friends” might donate $5-$10. But nothing. No one donated. 

Then, my sisters friend and her husband donated $50 on my birthday. I was shocked. I’ve only met them twice. My sister said “yeah they like to give money for fundraiser.”

Then, I got a notice the fundraiser ends tomorrow and I was going to login and donate the other $50 so the shelter got the funds I wanted them to have. And I saw my sisters coworker gave $10 and some random lady who lives in my town and I don’t know, donated $100. 

I’m crying. I raised $160 out of a goal of $100. And no one I thought might donate for my birthday, did, and my sisters friends and a stranger did.

Im so happy, I’m so so so grateful at the thoughtfulness of strangers and my sisters friends and coworkers. I appreciate it so much. 

A tiny part of me is sad because I didn’t have any coworkers or acquaintances who donated for me. It was my sisters friends and coworkers and a stranger. It’s a weird feeling. But I won’t focus on that.

5846,v1v3l4,Bluejeanslighter,"(tw: my experience with rape/assault) 

(16F) im always alone but it's not cause none wants me to be around me. i made it this way i isolated myself from everyone i wanted to be alone. when im alone no one can hurt me it's just myself to blame. i stay alone in my small bedroom while everyone else lives there lives, go to the gym, hang out with friends. but i just can't find a motivation to do all the that. i don't wanna be alone but im so scared of other people. it's cliche to say ive been hurt to many times and it is, but there's no other way to put it. im terrified of other people and starting relationships and leaving the house. my very first boyfriend raped me when i was 14-15 years old everyday for 9 months he was 16-17. people ask me why didn't i say anything if it went on more months, i don't know. i didn't know what he was doing to me was bad i just knew i hated it and wanted it to stop, he would ask me and force me to do things i don't even remember anymore and i would go home afterwards and just cry and scrub myself but never feeling clean i had thought all this was normal. The justice system did nothing when i told people what happened and told me i waited to long to say anything. it had only been 5 months. apparently some of my male friends had all agreed i was lying and told people that. he is 18 and dating a freshman girl i hope she's safe. im scared of men like him im so scared to be taken advantage of again it's so easy and there's no repercussions to the offender. my second boyfriend he was sweet but had a lot of issues. our relationship was unstable and toxic when we did finally break up he spread rumors about me to a lot of people and it made alot of people dislike me but honestly i can't care enough. i don't care what he told those people they won't remember me after high school anyways. i don't know if i like being alone i feel so sad and empty all the time there's no joy. everyday i wake up and repeat the same day excepting something else everyday. did you know that's the definition of insanity? repeating something excepting a different outcome when you know it's not gonna happen. i like being alone here i just listen to music, draw and just get rlly lost in my own thoughts like i am now. ive been depressed my whole life since childhood ive had a diagnosis. i don't know how to explain it to someone but the best way to put my depression into words is, it feels like there's this overwhelming dread of sadness like a cloud that suffocates your mind with thoughts of sadness and grief but it's unexplainable you're sad and upset and feel like crawling into a hole and just never leaving but there's no reason why. even in the happiest of moments i want to breakdown crying cause i know it won't last none of the joy i feel last it's all momentarily and then just like that it's gone and im stuck feeling sad again. I've been that my whole life i wonder what it's like for someone my age who grew up differently maybe was just born with luck or had a privilege to grow up better, i want to know what they see the world as. i don't want to feel like im wasting away in this room but where else can i go? i don't want to directly kill myself lets state that i don't know what's on the other side but i feel like maybe it's better and calmer then this life, i wanna know how my grandfather is doing after he passed i miss him so much. im definitely not also against the idea of dying in some freak accident i don't want it to be of my own hands i couldn't bring that guilt into my family, thinking about my dad, my little brothers and my cats those are the only things that stop me from killing myself. i know my dad wouldn't be able to handle my death, my little brothers are to young to understand what happened to me and i can't put that on anyone else to explain, my cats are the only things that showed me loved during my most darkest of times. i want to be happy i want to be surrounded with friends and love but im so scared all ive known is just being secluded by myself i wish i wasn't like this. i wish i was happy i wish i never let any of those men touch me when i was younger i wish i had understood what was happening to me and told someone sooner i wish i didn't feel like this all the time i want to feel clean and happy that's all i want to feel loved so badly every person who said they loved me ended up hurting me. why? why did i have to be born like this why did i have to grow up so depressed? why am i so sad? why do i feel insane? i am i really that hard to love?",2022-05-31 17:10:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646542770,5,/r/lonely/comments/v1v3l4/some_writing/,,0,1,some writing

I had matched with a girl on some dating app and quickly had found a liking for her within days. However, I then found out she was in love with her ex bf, and he basically was just using her for sex. We continued to talk as I was trying to help her get away from this guy because I knew she deserved better (me). We eventually met up a few times and I loved every second, but she ultimately went back to him. Needless to say I was heart broken, I made many Instagram, snapchats, and even second numbers to try and show her how much she meant to me in an effort to win her back. Sadly that didn’t work and I went through one of the toughest times of my life, I was broken and experienced manic episodes extremely frequently. I used sex as a way to cope, but as we know that did not help. I made a ton of terrible decisions in the following months and was extremely depressed. However I would say around 4 months later I felt that I forgot about her and I did, I felt normal or so I thought. She eventually came back to me and we had a thing for a few months and I did not feel happy nor upset, I felt completely indifferent, I then dated her because I’m a dumbass and then left her a month later because I really did not love her. I haven’t felt the same innocent love for a woman since her and I would say I don’t feel anyways towards females no matter how “my type” they are. I still struggle with PTSD and I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m worried that I’ll never love the same and I’m scared.

5873,v1ydz3,frustratedasalways,"Hi There, I am 19, have a startup earning 10k Rs/month and my skills include cybersecurity and computers. I currently do not have any job and I am out of high school.
I seriously need advice regarding my future. Here is a detailed view of my situation:
1. I got selected in a good US university based on merit with some scholarship. Though they have good amount of money, they are not willing to give it to me and rejecting the idea that I should go to US at all.(I am Indian)
2. My parents are forcing me to get into any nearby university which may or may not be even capable of harnessing my potential. Well, I am 19, so I am also not getting forced.
3. Due to this, we are having fights regularly from the last 2 months(1 fight per week for sure). Its not really a fight but more like bullying because I don't respond back or do anything other than crying in the dark. I was suicidal at first but that thought already left my mind. My Blood Pressure  is really climbing right now and I am crying as I write this.
4. Today was a bit too much. My father said, I and my sibling really destroyed his life by being born. And the fight was about a bank's mistake. I handle all bank accounts in my home. In one bank account, it was showing 0Rs on Mobile Banking and so my father screamed at me. I generated a statement and showed him that the balance is something else but he kept screaming and blaming me for ruining his life and wasting all his money(It was the bank's fault). My finances are private in my bank account and I never spent a single penny of my parents since the last 2 years.
5. In total, we had about 15 fights in last 2 months and I am seriously considering moving out and never come back. I also know there are some serious consequences to my actions that will definitely impact my future starting with my education but at this point, nothing seems hopeful.
6. Its India and I am legally a person and so maybe Nothing can help except leaving my home. I did get offered an internship of 50k Rs/month which I turned down because I had a different plan of attending the US university and so that offer is also not on the table.

5878,v1z102,Dr_Manhattan86,"The girl that I've been dating for nearly a year left me for good yesterday. 

The relationship itself had its red flags, but I decided to ignore them because they weren't related to her as a person, but rather to the circumstances (long distance). 
I know for sure that she hasn't cheated on me or met someone else, so that's out of question. 

She was, still is, special. We still keep in touch because we both are lonely and we like each other's company, but unfortunately, as she told me yesterday morning at 4:45 am on our second video call of that day:
""I would like us to stop looking for a relationship. I've come to the conclusion that I don't want nothing more than a friendship with you."" 

It hurt. Fuck, if it hurt. 

For nearly a year she's been pursuing me, wanting a relationship. Hoping -and telling me about such hope- that I was the right guy for her. She joked and sometimes we both even fantasised about us getting married, and looking back at how we met and laugh, while our kids slept. 

But she left me. 

The reason why she left me is because, as she has already expressed back in April, she didn't find me attractive enough for her - which was a huge hit to my self-confidence. Girls usually look and smile at me, either at pubs, clubs or simply while I'm outdoors walking -. 

So now all I'm left with is a dark room, enlightened only by my PC's monitor light, a few bottles of empty beers on the floor and pain that comes haunting me each time I wake up, making me cry.

Hello world!
Life is short and I’m hoping to connect with the like-minded, open-minded, and free-spirited people that don’t take life for granted.
My life has had its ups and downs just like anyone’s, and being hard-headed has been a fault of mine that has taken years to navigate. As an aspiring author who has written four satiric-creative nonfiction novels, a science fiction novel and a crime fiction trilogy that includes international crime, steroid/opiate abuse, and the deep dark web, I’ve come to love art and literature. Recently, I also decided to write my first movie script. It’s about an archaeologist that unearths ancient alien technology that was used to build the pyramids, Stonehenge and the Mayan temples. Writing saved my life. Being incarcerated saved my life as well, for without it I’m not sure I would have found the kind of passion for life that I have today.
A few of my other talents and hobbies include being a street artist, an HVAC technician, a soon-to-be CDL truck driver, and horrible singer. I’ve had the pleasure of meetingDub Step, Pop and Rap or my musical preferences. I’m an exercise maniac too.

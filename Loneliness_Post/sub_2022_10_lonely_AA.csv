13,xsi7z2,Cotton_Skies,"For a long time I thought the word abuse specifically meant ""physical abuse"". Never did I even consider that could mean emotional abuse but I suppose a lot of us are sheltered into believing this. I have gone into a battle with myself for years whether or not I am in fact being ""abused"". Convincing myself I cannot be because my family also does such things as taking me for fancy meals, spending money on me, taking me for a drive whenever I need it and giving me a beautiful home to live in. Whilst I have these physical luxuries, I feel like I am invisible to them. I am so often spoken down upon. Name calling, gaslighting, being ignored i.e. given the silent treatment or my mental health and life long condition (Autism) held against me.

More often than not I have been made to believe that I do not have a voice. I am and never will be a centre of someone's universe, love is not on the cards for me as I am too ""difficult"", too ""emotional"", too ""sensitive"". Too much. People who feel intensely like me are crazy and cannot be taken seriously, that all we do is bring trouble home to our families (which I have heard numerous times), hearing that as a child was enough to send me over the edge. I keep feeling like I'm a fraud for even considering reaching out for help. 

Sending this e-mail tonight is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, if not the hardest. I feel so alone right now although I am thankful for the people I have met on my journey, mostly online and I am grateful for those I am yet to meet. One step at a time. I hope to hear back from the organisation very soon and move on with my life. To begin the future I truly deserve, away from the toxicity I have unfortunately found myself in.

I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm even alive anymore. My family never do anything as a family. My friends never invite me out. I don‚Äôt have a partner. I‚Äôm all alone. I feel invisible.

We never really had anything at all, but I can't seem to let her go. We went out a couple times and they were some of the best nights of my life. Then I found it wouldn't work out and I was devestated. I thought I saw the signs, the actions told me one thing but the words told me another. I know I need to move on, but I can't seem too. This was so minor in the way of 'relationships', but it has impacted me so deeply. I wish I knew why.

And now the inner turmoil is eating me up. My mind flops between thinking about her and thinking about how I should stop/move on. I'm constantly fighting myself and it's exhausting. How can one woman take such control over my mind? I've gotten over people before, why can't I get over her?

I guess I've never felt about someone the way I felt about her before. Things are what they are, but I would be lying if I didn't wish things were different.

I asked out pretty much every girl I was even remotely close to in high school. Not one of them would say yes. And I'm fairly average looking. The worst part was when this ugly as fuck Austrian dude came in my sophomore year. He had a girlfriend in a week.

I thought it might get better in college, but nobody wanted me there, either. Now that I'm working, I know it's hopeless. I go on dating apps, I swipe and swipe, and I never get one message. It's not fair. Women go on for one hour, they get ten million messages to chose from.

I'd do anything for someone to like me, but nobody ever will. And don't give me the whole ""Love yourself"" bullshit. Loving yourself is like a participation trophy.

After many years, I realised I value my worth based on what I can give and help with. So in any relationship I tend to give or be helpful to that person so they would like me. My friend told me I'm way too caring and she worries about me sometimes. My parents told me the same thing.

Don‚Äôt necessarily go for the outcome that seems best every time. Make a mess on occasion. Travel light. Let things wait. Trust your instincts and don‚Äôt think too long. Relax. Toss a coin. Forgive, but don‚Äôt forget. To thine own self be true. Living by the wisdom of computer science doesn‚Äôt sound so bad after all. And unlike most advice, it‚Äôs backed up by proofs. [‚Ä¶] Up against such hard cases, effective algorithms make assumptions, show a bias toward simpler solutions, trade off the costs of error against the costs of delay, and take chances. These aren‚Äôt the concessions we make when we can‚Äôt be rational. They‚Äôre what being rational means.‚Äù



""You just said you want to be somebody who feels satisfied.

**""If you had just sat with the feeling, and like,¬†am I ok right now? And if the answer's yes, we should sit with that. You feel ok. Just because you could feel better, doesn't necessarily mean it's the right-- that you should do something about how you're feeling at the moment.""**



""It's you tracking how you feel about something, this is true in most endeavours, how do you feel about it. And when are you satisfied? When are you full?

Like there must be a genuine explanation for this. You're talking to someone for months and they lovebomb you etc then out the blue they either ghost or say that they don't want a relationship because they're BUSY. 

Like I understand that things don't need to progress further in the talking stage if the person doesn't think you're quite for them but why do people love bomb and make you think that you're going to get a relationship out of it. 

It's weird asf. 
Like it's so fkkd up when people do that. Leading others on and wasting time. These people don't understand the amount of damage it does to someone especially if they're weakminded or if they really expected something because the time waster made it CLEAR and said that they like them and want it to progress.

Like I want to be a part of them, in their calls, games and etc. I wanna chat with them, but I can't because I don't even have my own room. I live in this small apartment together with my family. So I can't really say that much to my friends on call because my family will hear the stuff that I'm saying. I just really hate this man. I miss my best friend, he was so important to me.

It's the first time I share something that personal online, but in November I started seeing a psychologist every week, I had some problems at the time that we have taken care now, but recently he told me that I was lonely, and I didn't even considered it before that, and I think it is because I don't know how it feels not being lonely, like I try to overcome every problem by myself even having a supporting wife, and have been trying to do activities that deep inside didn't really wanted to do just because the involved seeing more people, and I am now just noticing how lonely I am and probably have been my whole life, even having always supporting people around.


I suffered bullying when I was 8-15 in different ways and different places and activities, and my psychologist said that it could be one of the reasons that made me like this.

Thing is, I'm not sure how to deal with it, he said I need to love myself more, obviously there is more context around it, but I don't know what I'm looking for or what I'm doing.

One time he took a full week to reply to my text, saying he was dealing with family stuff ( which is hard to believe). I wound up blocking him because that was easier then spending hours a day agonizing over whether he‚Äôd text me. 

This happened months ago but even though time has passed, I still feel so incredibly hurt and angry about it. The thing that sucks is that during this time, I really felt that he was my closest friend and that he really understood me. We would text each other and call everyday, and he acted as though he sincerely cared about me. Even writing about it now I feel a little gut wrenched. The worst part is, because he had a girlfriend, I feel like discarding me was easy because he had someone else there for him already.

He said as much a couple of months ago, laid it out that I was only as good as my body and he'd been trying to get away from me for a year by frustrating me, I tried so fucking hard to cut it off, and it worked for a few months, that's when I realized I'm pretty incapable of making new friends, I have autism and really bad social issues. 

I came crawling back to him, I just missed having someone there for me, I've had so much bad shit happen recently I just wanted someone.

He's been ignoring me most days, a week or two at a time, he's around talking to his other friends he just doesn't want me around, he fucking hates me and is still showing it.

I feel so fucking worthless and lonely, I had to come crawling back for some human interaction and now I'm waiting days to have him say a word or two to me.


I wish I could fix it, I wish I knew how to talk to people, how to approach them, how to keep a conversation going but I don't.


I'm terrified this is what my life will be, my coworkers don't even like me because I'm quiet and don't talk and when I do I say the wrong things, I'm annoying and aggravating and on top of it I'm way below average looking, it's not like I can get away with being shitty on my looks.

I made myself vulnerable and made myself feel like she was everything. It was a very difficult relationship that ended with me in emotional pain. Not her fault I just took it very harshly. Now I‚Äôm single for the 1st time since high school and living my dream of being single. It‚Äôs not what I had high hopes for. Im not to be the one to sleep around or go to clubs or parties. It was just the desire to work and be alone and enjoy my life to myself. I currently do construction and enjoy the things I‚Äôm learning that will be beneficial. I guess my dilemma is all I do is go to work and go straight home. It‚Äôs not the single lonely life I desired. It‚Äôs starting to get very lonely, and I know I put myself in this position. I got myself feeling uncomfortable in conversation and felt discouraged or even lost interest in finding a new relationship. I‚Äôm stuck again. And I don‚Äôt like it. Oh look the consequences of my actions right üòÖ. I have two very close friends and we helped each other survive and stay alive but they are married. My brother is married. And I‚Äôm starting to miss coming home to someone and have that person who makes everything worth it. I no longer cook or do anything because I don‚Äôt have someone to do it for. I just missing having someone to share my life with. Just felt the need to get this off my chest wether it‚Äôs responded to or not. Tia

254,xthp42,Acceptable_Code_5883,"Not sure what to say tbh. I hate feeling lonely but at the same time I love to be by myself, but the more I think about the logic of that my head just fucking hurts.

 I've always been different than every single person I've ever met. Me and my family used to move house alot as a kid, mostly because of my eldest brother drug issues, and my mum and dad always ""trying to start fresh"" after one of them cheated which was at least 1 every 2 months. And cause of that I had to change school all the time never giving me the chance to make a true friend. Ive honestly made probably around 500 different friends from all the different schools I went to. Never even had a girlfriend until I was 19.

I'm 20 years old now and I'm living with my mum, younger sister and stepdad as my dad literally got beat out  the house by my mum in 2010. Because off all the shit in my past I have real bad attachment issues. I ghost everyone I talk to now, had over 10 jobs and not one of them lasted more than 4 months. All I do is sit in my room by myself smoking weed every hour of everyday just to feel slightly better but nowadays I've become so accustomed to getting high that I just cant anymore. i feel high for like 10 seconds and it's gone, back to feeling just as shitty as before which isn't much different but them 10 seconds of bliss is worth it.

Kinda getting off-track, as if there fucking is one. Anyway I'm just writing this to vent, not really expecting anyone to see this. I dont think anyone really wants to read about a 20 year old drug addict anyway, I know i fucking wouldn't üòÇ

This is the first time I've actually opened up in any kinda way tbh and it feels weird icl. Im not sure why but everytime I think about talking to someone or even think about the value of my feelings, I just tell my self to stop bitching and other people are going through worse, which just makes me feel guilty for feeling shit about my loneliness.

272,xtkpge,Bamblooozed,"I feel like there is a hole in my heart I'm not able to fix myself.

I was trying not to vent, but some context is needed.

For context, I (F17) was always a floater. I can talk with everyone and easily befriend people, but i always feel so behind. You could say I'm a part of everyone's group, but in reality, I'm in nobody's group. All of those groups hang out without even inviting me. I feel like those connections are surface-level, but whenever I'm trying to get closer i get viewed as overwhelming. This loneliness is so hard that it causes me physical pain.

I always thought I'm the problem. I did so many insights in search of flaws, and i tried fixing them. I would call myself a good person. Obviously, not morally white, but a very light shade of gray. I get attached easily, i love fast, hard, and for long, i always offer an ear to listen and shoulder to cry on, i shower people with homemade gifts, and stand in their defense whenever someone is gossiping about them. Also, because i know how it's like to be lonely, i always try to include quieter people in conversations, and i listen with full attention even when i don't know what are they talking about. I'm just happy whenever someone lights up talking about their special interest.

Then i thought, maybe my look is the problem? Everyone says looks don't matter, but in reality, that's not true. So i took better care of myself, and now i would call myself 9, maybe even 10/10. I became a fit hourglass, have a symmetrical face, clear skin and long thick blonde hair. 
My looks attract a lot of males, but they are not interested in my personality. Only sex matters. I want to stay virgin for the rest of my life, and whenever i tell about it, they immediately back away. It hurts, because it doesn't mean that i can't love. Quite the opposite, i have so much love to give and nobody who can receive it.

So very often i feel like i don't have anything to talk about. Most of my conversations are either about ideas, or about the person I'm talking to atm. This results in me knowing everything about everyone, but nobody really knows me.
I can't just open up - nobody cares. I have a very happy-go-lucky personality, like an excited puppy, but I have PTSD, high-functioning depression, alcoholic family, childhood trauma and chronic illness. Whenever i let myself open just a little bit, talk about my struggles, or just simply become quieter, suddenly I'm invisible. People want me only when i have something to offer, and when i don't have resources, I'm worthless.

I'm not a people pleaser. Im not trying to be ""nice"", I'm trying to be good. Of course, i bend my schedules and put others first, but, when i don't want to do something, I'm open about it. I gently set boundaries when needed, and i respect boundaries of others. I say my point of view and i speak whenever i feel like some action is immoral. Imagine hanging out with someone, only to find out later they didn't want to. Imagine how would you feel. That's why whenever I'm doing something with someone, i want to do it with purest intentions, we have a voice to use it.

I've already tried ""focusing on myself and my goals"" but that doesn't fix my loneliness. Even more, this causes me to isolate. I want to be honest - i need other people. And while I'm not trying to base my worth on other people, it is highly influential. 
The loneliness lasts for years. There were times when it got so bad, i actually have a suƒ´√ßƒ´dƒì attempt behind me.
Whenever i meet someone new, the pattern continues. I must be the problem, because it's all over and over again, i just can't see the problem. I need advice. 

Thank you for listening to my struggle, i hope you have a good day.",2022-10-02 09:46:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/xtkpge/how_to_stop_feeling_so_lonely/,,0,2,How to stop feeling so lonely?

276,xtlms8,TenchFromDelmakO,"So this is all from experience. When one is young they are usually naive. This is a great shield or barrier that keeps one safe from the horrors of the reality and truth of the outside world. When one grows older they lose this innocence by learning more about the world whether from first-hand experience or by proxy. When I say I did my research, I really mean it. I studied the hell out of history, psychology, and politics for a very long time always being very scrupulous of the sources and when things got grey I always found the story from all sides. Even a good person that has the motivation, endurance, and curiosity to find the truth in the world will inadvertently find the horrors of the world and the reality of how things really are. The shock is mostly too much for any normal person to bear and then there is a real threat of psychosis. Even the most well-adjusted individual may not be able to withstand not becoming a curmudgeon. Those lucky enough to have caring and loving friends, family, and community have a drive to keep from following that path and I believe helps keep one insulted from seeking the truth in all things. Also, once the truth is realized it cannot be undone. One cannot go back. One cannot become naive again. Moreover, knowing the truth or any amount of it, even if you hide that you know it, alienates one from all others. Ultimately, this makes for a very sad and lonely person that cannot find anyone to empathize with...even if one tries.

All I can say is to find some way to keep that shield of naivety. Do go out and find the truth, but if it gets dark, stop or switch gears. Sure knowing the truths about the world makes sense of it when it normally doesn't to others, but from personal experience...it's not worth it. It's best to be ignorant than arrogant and best to be happy not knowing it all than knowing it all and being frustrated that no one understands and that there is nothing you can do to change it. Let love and care keep you from reading that book or spending all that time and effort just to satisfy your curiosity.

Look if someone out there is tempted to find out what are lies, what is truly unknown, and what is the truth I will give you a clue... true common sense will tell you. Conspiracy theories are just that ...theories and conspiracy...don't bother. It's natural to want to believe in all the crazy things that people throw out there. The best truths can be found if one spends a great deal of time in nature as it does not concern people. Let that be a clue. History is always a narrative, to know the truth in history without living it yourself, you have to find a lot more data from all perspectives. If you want to find the truth in politics, you will have to learn everything, and I mean everything, about not just sociology, but about psychology and most of all philosophy. If one wants to believe in bigfoot, that's fine. Do not try to make others believe it too. That, of course, doesn't go for just bigfoot, it's the same for anything unknown.

The best advice I have if one is young is to enjoy spontaneity, enjoy your body, explore, and plant the seeds of the things you wish to see in your world. The best advice I have if one is old or not young is to enjoy what little or the vastness of all things realized as accomplished. Forget the failures and enjoy what is the fruit of being yourself on this planet and what you have done, even if in spirit, that made anyone happy, even for just a brief moment. Do not be afraid to dispense the knowledge and experience to those who ask. Be proud.

I have always wished that no one, including myself, experience pain of any kind.

Please be good to each other and take care of each other.",2022-10-02 10:40:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639732610,2,/r/lonely/comments/xtlms8/inquire_within/,,0,0,Inquire within

278,xtlqn1,Kurtains94,"I've never had much luck with dating apps/dating in general. At the beginning of August I started talking to someone on the Hinge dating app and over the next 4 weeks we had a lot of in depth conversations about a number or similar interests. 

It felt meaningful and she'd said a number of promising and encouraging things such as ""Really looking forward to meeting you finally"" and mentioned about celebrating my birthday with me etc but after nearly an entire month of talking everyday and being given all the signs that she wanted things to progress she suddenly ghosted and blocked me with no reason or explanation. 

Not knowing why is one of the worst feelings although I try to see things from someone else's perspective even if I'm not given a reason why as for some people anxiety and doubt can creep in when meeting someone new as something can be looked forward to ahead of time but when that time arrives it can sometimes be difficult to psyche oneself up for it.

I got used to it because i never spent my birthday with someone or doing anything special, but this year it felt different. This year i really got out of my comfort zone and went all out to make friends and create a good circle and i even grew a pair to talk to this girl that i liked (she dumped me in the worst way possible last month). I really thought it worked out and began seeing the good in life with the 5 good friends i've made. October 1st came in with nothing but silence and a few fake happy birthdays on facebook. Nobody even called to go out or do anything. I felt that evil place i was in for years slowly crawling back into me and i've never felt lonelier.
When my parents and brother brought the cake and started singing happy birthday i bursted in tears and couldn't stop crying for like 5 minutes ( i usually don't cry ).

293,xtny1z,BlakedBotato,"Have any of you ever been to a mental hospital? I've been a couple of time in my life. Once after I didn't sleep for days, prophesized the end of the world, started seeing shit that wasn't there, and tried killing myself at work. Crazy 4-5 days.

Ever since then I haven't been able to connect with another person, it's been three years. Three years without being understood, three years without a desire to live, and three years of complete isolation. The whole world started isolating the year after me, so I know they can empathize with two of the things I had a problem with, the world ending, and being alone, but they can't understand what it's like to not be able to trust anything.

I don't even know if who I'm talking is really real sometimes, and that is the most isolating part for me. I feel as if nothing is real. That I'm the only one here. That I'm imagining you all. How can I make friends when I can't even acknowledge your existence when I begin dissociation? And it's so easy for me to start going down a spiral of insanity, just make a loud sound, or start eating near me and I'll pop like a balloon, loose my sanity and want to leave and curl up in bed to hide from the world.

I have lost contact will all of my friends from high school, except for one person,we used to be good friends but only for a year but then she got into a different class so we started to drift apart.we don't hate each other,just not close anymore.

After high school I went to a pre university program, and I made friends,I was close with my classmates and my roommates.i had fun,it was stressful but I was so happy.unfortunately we stopped talking after all of us went to uni and found a new circle, except for me.i had no close friends in uni.just acquaintances.i regret not making friends so much.

But the problem is,I can't fit in with anyone.i can't relate to them,I have a hard time connecting with people with different interests on a personal level.so now I'm all alone.i thought I can make friends when I move to a new city but for now,it seems impossible.my housemates don't talk to each other,everyone stays in their rooms and mind their own business.the same goes to my co workers.i work in a small company and there's only 4 employees including me.they don't even bother asking about me,I had to make the first move.they don't seem interested so I stopped talking because I don't want to annoy them.

I'm incredibly lonely.my mum used to call me every night when I had my first job,but now she stopped calling me.i talk to her once a week,and that's only because I called her first.a part of me want to stop calling and see if she would call,because I'm afraid if she actually doesn't want to talk to me anymore.but it could also be because I'm doing better with my new job so she doesn't worry as much.i come from an Asian family that doesn't talk about our feelings,so it's quite difficult to be honest to her about my loneliness.it's the same with my siblings,my relationship with my dad is even worse.

317,xts9mg,Lazarus023,"So I am a 21 year old student in a foreign country...In January I started doing martial arts and I met a girl there that I really liked. I am kind of an introvert so I did not initiate conversation in the begining but then slowly we started talking and we were training together every day. I became more consistent in going to the classes as well coz I loved training with her. We started talking outside the class as well about various topics apart from martial arts. 

Then came May and semester was about to end and I was kinda feeling sad that I won't be able to meet her but she was so good to me on our final days there and kind of reassured me that we are friends. Then we both went to intern at different places for the summer. I thought the conversation would stop over the summer but we still kept talking. She showed me everything she was doing there. I was sharing all my experiences. We both are deeply passionate about martial arts and we kept each other focused on improving as well. 

Then summer ended and the fall semester began. We were talking normally for the first few weeks but then I started noticing a change. She was not coming to the gym and whenever I messaged her either ignored me or started giving some excuses. I asked her do you want to train together sometime over the weekend and she said no she is very sick and doesn't want to infect me. I thought okay maybe she is sick. I even offered if you need any medicines or any help just let me know.

 I am really into martial arts and wanted a training partner so I joined a discord group of my university where people usually post if they want to train. I am new to discord and I did not know how it worked but you can even see messages from the past in a group and there I saw that for the past few weeks this girl was very active and on the same day she told me that she was sick she was asking someone to go out.

I felt really bad. I am still kinda in shock and can't process it. I  asked her where we usually chatted that what happened and why did she have to lie and I thought we were friends. She did not reply for 2 days and then messaged me that friendship is only done when you have a need or a reason and now since she does not train at the same gym there is no reason to be friends anymore.

At the moment, I couldn't even understand what it meant, I started saying sorry if there is some other issue but then she blocked me on the app.

I am feeling really bad now. Can someone please help me understand what happened here?",2022-10-02 15:58:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626121627,2,/r/lonely/comments/xts9mg/i_21m_am_an_introvert_and_it_seems_like_i_lost_a/,,0,1,I (21M) am an introvert and it seems like I lost a friend (20F)..

331,xtty6q,[deleted],"Hey everyone, as the title mentions I don't know what to do, I'm kind of in this bind. I'm lonely no matter how you put it.

First off, I have TMAU, a genetic condition that makes me smell bad (there's no cure). Basically this led me to be a very lonely person.  It didn't matter how much I would put in the effort to talk to others since they simply didn't want to talk to me...  This is why I've always knew my friends well and they really never got to know me since they didn't really consider me worth their time. Considering this, I'm always someone very lonely this is why I am currently living with my parents as I go to college. The thing is that there is an issue with that too.

Although my parents are the only people I can really talk to and be friends, at the same time my parents aren't the best type of people. My mom is a narcissist, she puts walls up if it is that you come to her with an issue... especially if it pertains or is about her she then attacks you, makes you believe that what you're saying isn't true and she threatens to record you crying and mocks you. My dad is bipolar, his manic and depressive days are very extreme like night and day...the uncertainty of not knowing what mood he will be in is stressful.Also that aside, they're my parents... it's a weird dynamic being them being my friends and my parents at the same time.

This predicament has led me to here... I genuinely don't know what to do but all I know is that I want this hellish paradox to end. Society doesn't want me and the people I have available to talk to aren't the best for my mental health...  doesn't matter what choice I take I end up suffering. I have online friends but it's not the same... they are barely online since they themselves have a life outside of the internet..At times it feels like no one cares for me, I mean shit... I don't care for myself either. I disassociate in order to be ""okay"" but it is inevitable to wake from that dissociation and just cry and scream and desire death. I'm scared because recently I've thought of the idea to jump off things that are high in height in order to die and it felt very desirable... I didn't stop myself from thinking that. As a matter of a fact I cried because I wasn't there on that cliff jumping off to that beautiful ocean. Haven't killed myself not because I'm a pussy and can't do it but because I hate myself so much that I think I deserve to suffer by living this hellish life. 

If I loved myself I think I'd be okay but since as long as I remember (age 4) I've always assumed my parents never loved me because of the things they would do (they would always seem uninterested or indifferent with the things I wanted to do or said) that led me to hating myself. I never felt acceptance within society and always felt like I stood out in the wrong ways. I don't know what I'm good at but I know what I'm bad at. I feel horrible with the idea that others have to be forced to smell me so I don't go outside, I just go out when i have to like to college. I stopped living for myself at like age 10, I don't know how to dream or have personal goals... I'm 21 and will be 22 this Spring...",2022-10-02 17:05:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/xtty6q/what_should_i_do/,,0,2,What should I do?

I've always thought that but just I never had anything to back it. now that I've been paying attention to those around me (even more) I realize that while I may be lonely due to being unattractive, poor communication skills, no popular hobbies, etc. The main reason is because people see no value in me.

356,xtweeu,maximoos98nos,"So, i am an introvert with social anxiety, it only makes sense that texting became my most comfortable way of communication quickly when i was young.


Over the years, i had lots of people ghost me, lots of people who got upset for apparently no reason, even those that started well, but recently i knew why.


Recently i thought i had stunted social development and as a result i can't behave in a 100% socially acceptable way.


But i was wrong ..

Today, my best friend asked me why i like giving orders around so much, i replied "" i never gave orders, why would i ? I am not your boss ""

He said "" you told me that one time in text to prepare well before hanging out cause we are going to (x) you also asked me to search google for potential solutions for (z), i am tired of being bossed around ""


I replied "" i meant preparing well as in reminding you that place has certain requirements to be ready, and asking to search google is just a request not an order ""

He said "" say what u are going to say, u have a bossy attitude ""


And .... i had a realisation, everyone sees what they want to see in text, the lack of facial expressions, tone, and chances to further explain something or correct an impression are minimal, makes everything open to interpretation.

Not only my best friend was like that ..

I decided to investigate, asked several people how i sound, honestly.

One person said "" you are shy and innocent, you rarely talk about anything besides gaming and helping people ""

The other said "" to be honest i think you are a little hypersexual, everything you say has something to do with sex, and i don't like that "" ( in reality i didn't really intend to talk about it, he also pressed the topic a couple of times and i followed up on it )

The third said "" you seem very emotional, it will help you to tune down emotions a bit, but the emotional intelligence is appreciated ""

The fourth said "" you seem dry and rely on logic a bit too much, it helps if you use emotions or try to feel them a bit ""

The degree of variance is astonishing, somewhat disturbing ..



As of today, i give up on texting and ill focus more on meeting people in public places ..... i hope i quit it forever, or keep it to a minimum.",2022-10-02 18:45:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1379243388,5,/r/lonely/comments/xtweeu/texting_is_a_fake_world/,,0,2,Texting is a fake world

359,xtx4mz,Jumpy_Plantain5185,"met a guy and felt like we clicked really well. I was doing an activity that left my shoulders really sore and he had randomly massaged my shoulders twice. He also whispered in my ear a lot, put his hand on my back as we were sitting down, and invited me to go on a run with him the next morning. Some of this did seem weird to me because we had just met that day but I brushed it off because it was so nice to have attention. Come back to find out I already know him, but as the creepy guy who randomly gave my friend gifts even though she didnt know him and had taken a picture of her without her knowledge, eventually sending it to her on discord. I talked to him about it, told him we could be friends if he didn't do that shit to anyone else, because he told me it was like one of those friend ""revenge"" photos. I thought maybe he just didnt have social cues but we were good after that. The next week he was texting me at 6am until the end of the day and showing up at all my classes, and was waiting outside my last one to walk out with me. We had made plans to meet up the following week but that weekend I found out that he has a reputation for being a pervert as that person described it. Found out from 3 different, unrelated people that he made them or someone they know uncomfortable despite repeatedly telling him so. Texted him right away that it was not okay how he was acting and that I'm going to go mute on him so to stop texting me and showing up at my classes. After that this guy still tried to text me, gave my friend a letter to give to me, and tried to talk to me in public. 

This whole experience made me realize how close I was to falling for a creep because it was the first time anyone had ever shown me attention. I ignored all the red flags like the nonconsensual touching and texting me at 6am because I've always been so lonely in the romantic sense. This made me realize though to never get so lonely to the point that I am so desperate for attention I'll fall for anyone who gives it to me or make other people uncomfortable with my pursuits.",2022-10-02 19:15:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609384774,1,/r/lonely/comments/xtx4mz/line_between_lonely_and_desperate/,,0,7,line between lonely and desperate

364,xtxtkm,[deleted],"Hope this isn‚Äôt too much information but I have a condition called hard flaccid, which basically means by sexual organ is shrivelled, rubbery and lacking any sensation. I have no libido. It‚Äôs due to a tight pelvic floor, this influences other muscles and means I can‚Äôt do any of the things I love like play sport and sing (it affects the diaphragm meaning the voice is weak - also means I don‚Äôt enjoy socialising as my voice disappears quite early on). No-one really knows what causes this and what the solution is. I‚Äôve tried a number of things but have never been able to improve any of the symptoms. Some people think it‚Äôs a mind-body disorder.

I think the root cause of this is looking at too much porn as a teenager, plus other things which aggravated the problem. I‚Äôve only ever had one relationship and the sex filled me with anxiety as I struggled to perform even back then but things have got much worse over the last 5 years and I will not allow anyone to see me naked, even having a shower is unpleasant as I have to look at it and touch it - I do not recognise it as mine.

380,xtyue0,mirrorchild1693,"I (F30) am feeling so horribly lonely for basically most of my life now. It started in school when I was mocked for being nerdy and a girl - and girls shouldn't like videogames or metal music or LotR or Star Wars movies etc. - and kind of continued in my adult life. On a surface level, I made things work. I sucessfully graduated with a masters degree, started with a PhD while also getting a job in my field, I am actually modelling in my free time, so I guess people consider me somewhat good looking, even though I am more of a size M than S, and I am organizing Live Action Role Play events for years now. I try to be someone who listens to people's troubles, and since many of them come to me in particular when they need someone to be there or help them sort things out I think I am not too bad at that either, but... on a level of deeper trust and friendship, there is just noone in my life. I am absolutely lonely on a every day base, fail at connecting with  coworkers or random acquitances spectacularily and when it comes to dating, I am just far to scarred emotionally from my gaslighting ex, even after 4 years, to get comfortable with it. Plus I am asexual, so I feel kind of un dateble anyways, because guys seem to be into my body first and foremost, and only cuddling it is not what they intend to...
I am feeling like a good damn NPC. Looking good, picutre perfect biography, only good however to drive other people's plots, making things work for them hobby wise, giving them a shoulder to lean on and pleasant to look at. I am so exhausted, frustrated and tired, feel left alone with all my own struggles, because nobody takes my emotional health serious since 'my life is going fine' and I do not really feel any appreciation for what I do. 
I am not suicidal, but I wish life would just stop so I could have an actual break of livin, maybe catch my breath and sort out my feelings and thoughts. 
I try to get in touch with new people, IRL and online, but it always seems as if they loose interesst in my as soon as they talk to me... if they even were interessted to do so in the first place. 
At this point I have no idea what to do for getting into any kind of meaningfull relationship beyond online chatting... I don't even care if romantic or friendships.

But literally just a minute ago, after being ridiculed again and later talking about wanting to take my meds again so I could get my motivation for art back and getting told ""yeah, maybe if you get on them you could make some friends,"" I let myself be honest. I told them that I didn‚Äôt actually like them and I hoped that going back on my meds could actually help me make new friends for that reason, and the only reason I haven‚Äôt left them already was because I struggle with actually maintaining friendships and even getting the motivation to meet new people, and if I had that motivation I would‚Äôve been long gone.

being lonely while you‚Äôre surrounded by 2000 people for 5 days a week is suffocating. i just want to get home for the day, but then do what? play games by myself, watch youtube or anime, and scroll this subreddit so i can feel better about myself. 

i just have no motivation to do anything. it‚Äôs been completely sucked out of me because of how i feel. i decided to do band for my 2nd trimester but i have to relearn an entire instrument, which takes time and effort, but i can‚Äôt put in effort for something unless it‚Äôs necessary like homework. even though there are people doing much more work than me i just feel exhausted every day. nothing i do truly makes me feel better, i just get distracted from the sad life im living for a few hours, then once i finish im back to feeling miserable.

i don‚Äôt want to try to challenge myself because i have no energy for it, so i‚Äôve just not been putting as much work into things that i should‚Äôve, like studying for tests or editing writings.

I know that that's not necessarily a bad thing, I grew and changed as a person and they are just not the right fit for me right now, but I still feel so bad and hurt about it, especially because they don't seem to care or even notice. I muted them on all social media because I know that they still regularly hang out, but sometimes curiosity becomes the best of me and it makes me really depressed every time. 

I would like to seperate myself from them even more, but our lives are so intertwined in some ways. Even outside of the friend group, we have the same circle, we have concert tickets together for next year and they also still have a lot of things from me that I would need to pick up from them. 

It feels like a break up but it's not even like there is a clear cut, there is just me, lonely and hurt, and them, seemingly happier than ever and I also can't be mad at anybody, because most of the things that cause me growing apart are just differences in how we deal with friendship or differences in our interests, and of course, that's nothing I can be mad about. I'm just really really sad and I don't know how to deal with the situation. 

I feel like such a teenager and like a failure for not being able to pull myself together, because in my head I know that it's okay, I've grown apart from friends and friend groups in the past and everything was okay in the end.

I yearn so desperately for love, for another person to confide in and to seek me out, yet I fall short. I am careful in who I put my trust into, so very careful, and picky, because I have been hurt one too many times.

Yet, despite that, despite me actively seeking out these people I have grown to trust and hold dear to my heart, it feels as if that love is no longer being reciprocated. And that alone makes me want to isolate more. You know, feeling a buzz from your phone and thinking it‚Äôs them coming to check in on you but have it being something completely irrelevant is a cruel joke. It feels like a slap in the face at times, as I have convinced myself I do not need another human‚Äôs affection, yet get so horrifically disappointed when I find a notification was not a friend reaching out to me. 

Something that lingers in the back of my mind is my therapist. During our first ever session, I began to tell him about my life.

I suffer so much from a terrible feeling of loneliness and it seems to me that no one understands me fully. I know that I have become much more versatile and maybe even smarter mentally, but now I feel like a stranger in the family in which I grew up. Everyone I know doesn't give a damn about what interests and inspires me. My sister openly told me that it annoys her when people talk to her about topics that she is not interested in, hinting at me to finally shut up. My parents don't understand how important all my interests are to me, and I see it in their eyes when I tell them about some experience or event. I'm tired of going through everything by myself, having no one with whom I can share my impressions, thoughts and feelings, which are sometimes too much that they suffocate me from the inside. It really hurts me when people don't understand how important my favorite movies or video games are to me. It also offends me when they belittle my importance for the same ""childish"" interests. But they don't want to listen to me when I try to explain to them the essence of these stories that are so dear to me. All my friends have ""left"" me in every possible way long time ago, and I don't even want to trust strangers anymore. I am lonely, but at the same time I have no desire to make new acquaintances. It feels like I'm stuck in my own ""circle of hell"" and will never get out of here. Every day I force myself to do what I have to do, dreaming of a future where I will go to where there will be people who appreciate the same things as me. I dream of seeing Rome, and none of my family has ever realized how important it is to me, which is why I promised myself to see this city alone. I'd rather never see it than go there with people who have belittled my interests for so many years. I know that I will see Rome, and maybe even be able to live there for a while (that would be too perfect). I resigned myself to my situation, and stopped reacting aggressively to the indifference to me from my relatives. I just had to talk it out, leave these experiences somewhere. And if you have read up to this point, then I hope that you have also found the strength to move on despite the depth of the wounds and you do not stop dreaming. Know that you are not alone, and each soul has a special place in our universe.

I don't know why, but I can't help myself. I don't ever intentionally be mean to anyone, but I just end up coming across rude. 

I feel I only have 3 genuine friends. two of them are online. the third i drift apart more every day. they're all stoners, so I've turned into a stoner. probably because no sober person can deal with my bullshit. 

I just started college. already, cliques are forming. I've only met two people who would give me the time of the day. one of them I started developing a romantic interest in. we had multiple deep conversations and I felt we connected. he introduced me to people and seemed to care. suddenly, I went home for the weekend and he started leaving me on read and avoiding me. im feeling jealousy and loneliness now. he posted on his bereal today him on a date at a fancy resturaunt. that's what it looked like. it seems the rare times I develop a crush they end up not liking me back. I only ever had one ""relationship"" ever and it only lasted a month. I never kissed anyone.

I wish I had a friend group. I see people in them happy and doing stuff. instead, I sit around playing video games and smoking weed. people literally make plans in front of me and then not include me. I just want to be included by my peers. instead I'm distant.

goodnight. I'm crying as I write this. it's almost 2 am and I have class at 10",2022-10-03 05:41:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610126066,4,/r/lonely/comments/xuasvm/idk_anymore/,,0,1,idk anymore

So as the title says I moved to Uni about a month ago, in my section there's about 8 to a kitchen so there's a few of us.

However they're all around the 18-20s mark which I don't mind,  in my last workplace I worked with a few around that age and they're fun to be around, but with these people I get the feeling I'm just not getting on as well as I would like with them.

Theres three that aren't really there all that often as they live in a separate section (Though no kitchen so they use ours), and the other guys i usually get the feeling they won't speak to me unless it's like me and them in a room 1-1. Not to say I can't start conversations as I usually do, but like tonight I brought my switch to the table offered anyone for a game, my other flatmates did but the whole time they were talking to each other than me, even when we switched games I got the feeling I wasn't that wanted.

I do still interact with them even tomorrow I'm going along to a pub party as its one of our flatmates birthdays, but I know its going to probably be I follow along don't really have anybody want to interact with me then we head back.

542,xuk3hr,awaythrwoagain,"Hi.... My name is Alex and I'm lonely.... Well that didn't help...

I had a crappy high school experience and disgusting college experience. Graduated both with no friends. By no friends I mean no one signed my year book, just my teachers.

Not going to lie it was partially my fault in high school but college.... Life sucked. I tried everything and well nothing

Graduated in 2019, moved to a new city for work end of 2019 and then covid hit so once again, no friends :)

I'm 25 and don't know how to make friends. I have ""friends"" but they're only available when they need me. When I need them I get left on read.

I'm tired of taking care of everyone. Hell I'm tired of being alone. I'll take care of everyone. I don't even mind it. But sometimes all I crave is a hug or a thank you or a smile or an acknowledgement that I'm more than a toy for everyone to use.

And yes I know they use me, but if they didn't then I'd have no human contact. I saw an adorable dog today and I have no one to tell.

The dating apps just remind me that I'm not wanted...

Does life really have to be so crappy? Is one person too much to ask for?

I don't think I'm ever getting married. As much as I want to I don't think I'll ever find someone. And even if I do find that crazy person who wants me, who do I tell that I've found someone? Who do I invite to my wedding? Who do I get to brag about my person to? And then again, who would want someone who won't even be able to have a best man?

556,xuogyj,si2tv,"TLDR: I'm the architect of my own loneliness, and I'm trying to fix that.  


I have plenty of family and friends and have healthy relationships with them all. It's living alone and everyone being married or in committed relationships that makes the loneliness feel real. I work two jobs from home which takes up a lot of my time, and the idea of going out to a bar or club to meet others just doesn't sound attractive anymore at my age, especially going by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I set myself up for this loneliness, firmly believing the idea of loving oneself before others; can't pour from an empty pitcher. I'm trying to fill that pitcher but goddamn that tap's been running dry for a while. I long for intimacy and genuine connection but hold myself back because I feel I don't deserve it, yet I preach that all deserve to love and be loved. I've put everyone above me, convinced that I don't get to be happy, and I don't know why. I've been in and out of therapy, often having success and overcoming the major issue at hand, hell it took me up to 26 to finally confront being a survivor of childhood molestation and opening up to my parents about it. And even with something as heavy as that, this loneliness feels different.

&amp;#x200B;

This is kinda aimless, definitely a scream into the void. But getting it out helps a little. Misery loves company, that's why we're all in this group, right?",2022-10-03 16:38:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,,8,/r/lonely/comments/xuogyj/32m_not_loving_the_man_in_the_mirror/,,0,3,32M not loving the man in the mirror.

i‚Äôve been lonely for quite a while now. years really. with the exception that 2 months ago i thought i had finally found someone who was going to be with me forever and i cared so much about that person but unfortunately they dropped the news onto me recently that time was no longer in our favor and they completely abandoned me out of the blue when they knew they were all i had. but it feels like this is something that always happens to me.

this experience has been really hard to bounce back from but it‚Äôs not the root of my problems. i‚Äôve never really been able to make long term friends/relationships with people for the past few years and i‚Äôm not sure why. it‚Äôs like everyone is super busy with their own lives or i‚Äôm just not important to anybody. i miss having friends and people that genuinely cared about my well-being and that loved talking to me and would actually check in on me, because that simply does not happen anymore. every morning/every night i check my phone to foolishly check for a notification from anyone that could possibly care to check up on me, but it‚Äôs never there. ever.

i‚Äôm just so tired of people leaving all the time. it‚Äôs a never ending cycle. people use me to pass the time and then they are poof. gone.

i almost feel nonexistent in a way? and if this is the case, why am i still here? i‚Äôm not suicidal (i think) i don‚Äôt necessarily feel the need to die i just wish my circumstances were different and i don‚Äôt see them changing anytime soon so i‚Äôm giving up hope. i‚Äôve literally never been so lonely in my entire life and now that i‚Äôm here i have no idea what to do. i‚Äôve never been the type to compare my life with others but when you get this far down you really can‚Äôt help but do it. i see everybody hanging out with their friends or their significant other and i‚Äôm just like, well damn i guess i really am doomed, huh?

600,xuwqqt,Fayde_Artemis1999,"Hi,

20-something F

So, I confessed my feelings about how my step father had treated me to my mum today.

Sidenote: I had told mum some of what he did to me a few months ago but I ended up saying everything he did today. And to be honest, I feel like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. He is my mum's ex and she has been with a new partner for 2+ years. 

I told my mum how my step father ignored me growing up. How he could never give me a compliment/ ask me about my day/ praise me unless he was told to or felt like he had to say it. I also told my mum how I felt anxious and nervous around him and would breathe a sigh of relief when he left for work. How my step father hated a gift I bought him as I heard him mutter in another room ""Who the hell buys someone a f**king David Beckham gift set?""
My step father was a person who would only say goodnight to his two biological children and forget the third child unless they initiated  goodnight. 
A person who would make it clear that they saw you as a stepchild and not their own when they bought 'step daughter' cards for you. 
A person who would get annoyed at you if you text them multiple times, and they call you by mistake and you check to see to see if it was any concern/emergency only to be told that they '...would *never* call you in an emergency.' 
My step father was an individual who got absolutely disgusted at their step daughter for not being aware that her breasts could be seen through her pyjama top and was offending him and his son (my brother) to then make her feel like she has to wear baggy, oversized clothes for years later. An individual who just couldn't muster the energy or the energy to get to know his own step daughter.
An individual who did a lot of things to me (and is know slowly becoming the same to his biological children.)
My step father is someone who has been blocked on my phone now. He is someone who I'm glad I never refer red to as 'Dad' - he doesn't deserve that title.

My mum asked why I didn't say anything - I told her I was scared what she would think. I thought I would be accused of lying or making things up. I didnt want to ruin my siblings relationship with their dad. 

But I know now. And it feels great. My mum's husband praised me for speaking up and wants to help me (with my mum) build my confidence up. I would never have thought that a father role model could have an effect on you as my mum thinks that must have been the reason I went reserved and quiet. 

I would recommend to definitely voice what is going on internally as it does no good keeping it in for all these years. (In my case 10+ years). Always speak up when you're ready and speak to a support network of people that you feel comfortable with.

601,xux09v,MiamiUoLSU,"Hey everyone. Just kinda wanted to rant/get my feelings out with this question. 


I just feel like I‚Äôm destined to be lonely. I‚Äôm in college and ever since middle school I‚Äôve been a friendless loser. I have people I ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù talk to, but more often than not, I‚Äôm literally probably the biggest loser on the planet. All my current ‚Äúfriends‚Äù have so many other friends and opportunities so I‚Äôm left in the dust. That‚Äôs not to mention how in class I‚Äôm never picked for group assignments (our teacher tells us to get into groups for assignments and just last week I literally had people LEAVE the group I joined to go to another group. Another group was basically forced to let me in. Just today we had to do the same thing and I‚Äôm working BY MYSELF). I‚Äôve tried countless times to make friends (at the beginning of college I even messaged incoming freshmen like me to get to know them. That got me nowhere. Roommates never talk to me) I‚Äôm a junior now and it just seems like this is my destiny. How it‚Äôs meant to be for me. I just don‚Äôt understand. Regardless of how hard I try I‚Äôm ALWAYS left behind. I just hate it sometimes. There is something severely wrong with me since NO ONE in the world likes me.

639,xv0r6s,Cotton_Skies,"Realising how emotionally abusive my family have actually been is the most soul destroying experience I think I will ever face. The second is that I may be in a women's shelter with little support. I cannot believe this is my life. I am lucky to have kind hearted people to go to but my latest observation is that they are ALL men. Only men. I have tried to reach out to the few girl acquaintances / girl friends I have but throughout any vulnerable, fearful moment they say such things like ""I'm always here for you"" when I LITERALLY need them to be there for me in that very moment so that just tells me 1) they aren't aware of how serious it is. 2) frankly, they don't care that much. or 3) they have no idea of what to say but then again, why would they?! 

I feel like I am a poor little orphan girl knocking on door to door, begging for someone to take me in. The connections I currently have are men as I mentioned before. One of them is an ex who has been so tremendously supportive and kind to me but then, of course, I have my reservations as we are exes for a reason even though I can see he has really worked on himself a lot and it feels like talking to a new and improved version of him which I wanted for the longest time so naturally I can't help but wonder whether romance is a possible outcome even though that is the last thing on my priority list right now. The second is a few people I don't know very well but have built a relationship with online and as I mentioned in my previous post on here, a women's shelter. I do not quite have it in me to show up there, homeless, absolutely distraught and I am still in complete shock that this is my life. 

A part of me, understandably, doesn't even want to accept it has come to this stage. A stage where I am so mentally at risk due to the way they more often than not treat me. Even though they are emotionally abusive they also provide me with luxuries; money, gifts, a beautiful home to stay but with little to zero emotional support. To summarise, I am being put down more often than not. It seems that nothing I do is ever good enough and never will be. Any accomplishments I make, I am reminded constantly of what I haven't done or what has gone wrong. From the name calling, the belittlement of being laughed at, given the silent treatment, cold shoulder, gas lighted and so on. Too much to even type down and fully recall as now I am even dissociating and feel like I'm going to slowly lose my mind. I am terrified of the future but I just hope that I manage to remain strong and resilient. I am scared that the friends I have who are men only want to date me or are even fetishizing the situation I am currently in or romanticising me in some way with rose tinted glasses thinking they can save / fix me. 

My life is falling apart and I have no idea where or who to turn to. I feel like I'm clinging on by a string. Anyone. Someone, please, listen to me. I just want to feel seen and heard. Valued as a human being. Is that too much to ask?

But people weren't so kind to me and I often found myself abused, used and even manipulated by others.

I've always wanted to see the good in others, unfortunate that has caused me nothing but trouble and pain.

Sure I have a few people I am very close to, but it's not the same as having a good girlfriend at my side.

Unfortunately though it seems that I'll never have a girlfriend, especially since anyone who's ever interested in me either distrusts and discards me for my issues or takes advantage of me and uses me.

This is why I hate people, people suck and I don't believe love exists anymore If it really ever did to begin with.

If I lash out at anyone, it's because I think they're trying to change my views and manipulate me. 

Bottom line is that I am introverted because of the cruelty of others and I don't believe in love anymore because of my lack of success and how I've been used.

I feel nothing, think about everything, question everyone and everything, and show little emotion. 

What little emotion I show is in the form of crazed laughter and maniacal smiling grin whenever something bad happens or I get hurt.

I never wanted kids, so, at least I'm not missing out on that. In school, I had some people I was friends with, but, I never spent time with them outside of school. I was too embarrassed to ask and of my life, which has followed me today and kept me from really letting people in.

Anyway, it turns out he is emotionally abusive, or at least that's how I see it. For the past two plus years I've tolerated being blamed all the time for everything because I'm unhappy, I'm too negative and complain so I deserve it.

Had been joining a lot of maths competitions and won a few gold awards since secondary school and always thought I would be an engineer or computer scientist, I didn't really do so well in my biology but yea here I am, I made the decision to become a doctor but a big part of the decision-making process was for my parents.  
Now I am the very average kid in med school, always trying to be nice to everyone but never knowing how to make new friends. I always try to speak up in group discussions, being one of the earliest people to complete a group worksheet and being an attentive listener and 'peacemaker' of the group. I always try to be friendly and would reply to my groupmates within minutes to help them with their assignment. When my groupmate fell sick from COVID, I was willing to walk to the pharmacy to buy pain relievers and deliver them to his doorstep.

However, I was never part of a group, I walked to school, studied alone (The hardest part), eat alone, and walked back alone. Sometimes I know that I'm being used but that's the least value I can offer to have social contact, I'm not smart enough to become the someone that everyone looks to ask questions. People only would want to mingle with you if you are smart, have strong background, money and popularity, none of which I have.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, not to mention family issues, financial issues and personal issues...If you're still here thanks for listening/reading my vent. I have never talked about this to anyone, even to my family members or church leaders...

754,xvjhty,Lilylolo88,"Some back story. 

I'm a single 34yr old woman. I've recently been focusing on self development and working on myself. I was in a 7 year relationship and was engaged to be married. The person treated me like a doormat, constantly crossed my boundaries and disrespected me, so I called it off.

It's been a great year of self improvement. I joined a gym, lost weight and gained a little muscle. I've been working on how I can be a better person so I've done a lot of self reflection and mindfulness. I booked a solo trip to Iceland for this November. Super excited about that. I quit smoking and drinking and look and feel so much better for it.

So now I'm in a good place I feel I'm ready for a healthy long term relationship. I often fantasise about what it would be like to live my life with someone who actually loves and respects me. I would love to meet a great man to go on adventures with. But being over 30 and single is tough. I want to meet someone great but won't settle for another crappy relationship.

788,xvq1qz,LegoBrickGF,"What I want is to be held. I live in the UK, London. It's notorious for loneliness, like all densely populated built up areas. There's an attitude here - not homogenous, but widespread - of a kind of default hostility, a closed-off-ness to contact. When this feeling visits, it slips underneath the layer of casual abrasiveness I've adopted after living here for so long. It feels like suddenly remembering there's an absence of something pressing against me. As if there's supposed to be a weight, something filling the cavity in front of my chest. It's an incompleteness. 

I don't know how to answer this feeling. I don't want to ask a friend if they can hold me, that feels like too much risk. I don't want to hook up with anyone, because it's not sexual. I don't know that I'd want to meet a whole new person, because how could they know me quickly enough, how could I know them quickly enough, and what if we don't like each other? This requires anonymity, and a mutuality of manner, the kind difficult to achieve outside of fiction. 

So I hold onto the feeling. I dream about meeting someone who understands the ache because they feel it too, and in that understanding is a chance to comfort each other, and ask nothing else of each other. They would look and read me as someone they expect to like, someone they can see themselves in, and I'd see the same in them. And after we solve each other's emptiness, our lives could continue.",2022-10-04 20:40:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610922080,6,/r/lonely/comments/xvq1qz/the_ache/,,0,1,The Ache

20(M) , i have always been a people pleaser just because i hate being lonely. i m from india, i was all alone during my high-school years , studying for entrance exams. No friends from school, no one in my extra classes, it was just me going to school and coming back home and just procrastinating all day thinking about how miserable and lonely i am. My parents are both working so  even they werent able to give me company or talk to me often. 
In my 12th grade(senior year i guess for everyone else)i changed classes , met some new friends , got a girlfriend and life was going super smooth. Now almost 4 years later and having went through a vicious cycle of coming back to my now ex girlfriend has left me feeling helpless. She acts super toxic , makes me feel like she doesnt care about me / want me anymore every once in a while and comes back to me shows me love and affection and i fall for it every fucking time , i hate myself sm over it. Shes become my goto , shes my comfort zone, im scared of cutting her off and being the same miserable lonely person again. 
Its not just with her but also i put up with so many things that i dont like about my uni friends or even childhood best friends just coz i dont want them to leave me all alone again. i know im fucking up my life being a people pleaser but i think its better than being my old miserable self again.

792,xvqmid,Sbinmaster69,"{TL: DR - the popular kid in school, got injured, got fat and ugly, lost all confidence, covid happened, got fatter and mentally unstable, now suddenly in college 3rd year, no friends, no one to talk to, very underconfident, goes gym can bench 100kgs, but can't talk to women, sit in the room alone and cries all day, social anxiety, anxiety, and stress}

&amp;#x200B;

This is gonna be really long, better get some popcorn, my friend.

Okay so where do I start, I don't know man my life used to be pretty fun, I used to be a guitarist in my school band, was in my school basketball team, was good at studies as well, and pretty much a popular kid in my school, but then I went through a really bad time.

I had a miserable breakup, got my back injured during a match, and was in bed for 2 months, started to lose focus, procrastinate and overthink more often started getting really bad grades, plus my body started to look out of shape, got a bunch of face fat.

This really impacted my confidence, my self-esteem, and my overall mental state, I became anxious, and I started stressing over the smallest of problems, I barely passed grade 12 and thought you know what college will see a new me.

But boy was I wrong covid happened, everything was online and me being a former social bird, wasn't able to handle it, didn't join any clubs didn't socialize at all, played video games all day, and attended online classes on the sideline's, all this just deteriorated my mental health further.

The moment the college got online, people had already formed friend circle I was in my third year, with no friends, no one to talk to, no one to hang out with, that popular friendly social bird in me was dead, I got scared even trying to have a conversation with my mess food server.

Meanwhile, my school friends were out clubbing, hanging out with girls, having sex and all, I was sitting in my college hostel with no friend, no one to talk to, regretting my decisions and crying in my room, and there is this voice in my head that I didn't have in my younger day,s but now this voice just keeps stopping me from doing anything, I'll brief it out further later.

So seeing my school friends talk to girls and all I got jealous and started texting random girl's in my college, just to socialize and get my social anxiety out but that just made me look like a desperate individual around my college and most girl's started to avoid me.

So I thought why don't I try approaching girls face to face and just try to make friends first, just put all my wanna be cool in the trash, but the voice in my head always stopped me, maybe because after my breakup and injury in school, my friend's used to taunt me on how fat and ugly I've become and how I'll never find a girl ever again, this was coming back to me and stopping me from talking to girls.

I do go to the gym, and I can bench 100 kgs which is a really big deal, but I was still not mentally confident enough in my look's like I used to be.

So then the voice in my head said why don't I start focusing on my studies, but I keep procrastinating, I kept thinking and daydreaming about a girl in my class that I really like but am too underconfident to ask out ( one day I spent 3 hour's just thinking of her and doing nothing is this a problem) and as the days passed by, my exams showed up and I failed 2 of them out of 6. I used to be an above-average student and now I was failing not only in exams but even at socializing, making friends, at life in general.

I still to this day sit in my room and cry, because I have no friends to talk to, no girlfriend because I think I'm ugly, I am more than underconfident and have 0 self-esteem and don't know what to do in life. 

And before you suggest me a therapist, I can't afford a therapist ATM and my college therapist just keeps asking me to focus on my studies without providing any good resources or solutions to the problem.

Hes threatened to break my jaw, dragged by my hair and tried to strangle me a year ago. He was less than supportive during my pregnancy and after birthing our son. Two weeks after giving birth he yelled at me and told me I was selfish and lazy for taking a nap while our son was sleeping. 

We separated, I tried to move to another city. Moved back in with my mom earlier this year. When he found out I moved back, he did too. Told me he changed. Promised me everything. Thank fuck I did not move back in with him. He continued to drink but was less abusive to me. 

He admitted to driving my car drunk for more beer over a week ago and got pissed when I told him I wanted him to give the keys to me or my mother after he got home from work. 

I'm finally done. 

But I'm so lonely. I feel like my mom is helping me to raise my son which makes me feel like a failure as a mother and a daughter.

I lost most of my friends, some were because of my depression, some were just because I realized they were toxic and figured I was better off alone. In the end, the friends that I was left with had and still have their fucked up shit going on in their lives, which resulted in us barely talking.

i pretty much live a false reality, whenever i go to my room i do these scenarios with my favourite fictional characters and i basically pretend they‚Äôre real, i also imagine that they‚Äôre are friends or family.

i have been doing this ever since i was 9 or maybe even younger

i was (and still am) so lonely that i had to make myself believe that i had company.

i have done this for so long that i had to lay down on my bed and think to myself that i‚Äôm just faking it and that they‚Äôre just fictional characters, and thus i pretty much cry myself to sleep.

828,xvv5bn,Taxiidermy,"I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôve spent a good 3 years trying to make friends after a traumatic friend incident. I try everyday. I have gone out of my comfort zone time and time again. I‚Äôve thrown up multiple times, I‚Äôve cried from crippling nausea and from self deprecating thoughts that have appeared when I talk with people. Yet despite all of that, I have continued to push through.  I‚Äôve forced myself to talk to people, to go out of my way to sit with them in hopes that they‚Äôll befriend me.

It has worked with one person. We are on decent talking terms. Yet, why do I feel so empty? Isn‚Äôt this what I wanted? Why do I feel so apathetic? I still feel alienated and outcasted. Why is it that no matter how hard I try, I cannot make a permanent friendship? 

I don‚Äôt feel desired or wanted by anyone anymore. Even the friends I‚Äôve been very close to, my online ones, don‚Äôt seem to value my presence, even though we talk and call daily for hours at a time (these people are very close to me, first name basis and know where each other live). 

I‚Äôm becoming angry. Deeply angry. Bitter. I‚Äôve been isolating myself from the opportunities I, myself, have made. That I‚Äôve worked hard at for months. I‚Äôm too tired to care. I‚Äôm tired of going out of my way in hopes that I‚Äôll get a sliver of affection. I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt feel valued any longer.

I can‚Äôt seem to find the good in people anymore. I used to feel cherished and overwhelmingly happy when I talked with people, I am a very social person who thrives off of human beings.

834,xvvoji,Euphoric-Snow5936,"
My birthday is October 6, this Thursday. Every year I notice that I spend my birthday with less and less people, and this year I‚Äôm spending it alone. I‚Äôm turning 25, and as a woman I‚Äôve always wanted to just have a girl best friend to do things with and be each others person. But the best friends I‚Äôve had have either ghosted me or fucked me over, most of the time it‚Äôs both. There‚Äôs a Gorillaz concert happening tomorrow‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôre one of my favorite bands. I decided to buy myself a ticket anyway to go, but I HATE that I‚Äôm going alone. I know going to concerts alone is normal, but the fact that it‚Äôs my birthday just makes me feel worse. I feel like a total loser, lost, with no friends. It makes me wonder why no one wants to celebrate with me. Birthdays usually suck for me and I was hoping this year would be different since I‚Äôve been progressing mentally through therapy and other things. But I feel even more alone than ever. I have 2 good friends but when I asked them if they wanted to come for my birthday, they said no- and I know if the roles were reversed I would 100% go with them- even if I don‚Äôt listen to the band. It hurts me so deeply to be going to this concert alone and realizing no one cares to be with me or celebrate with me. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. The concert is tomorrow and I‚Äôm considering backing out because I feel like a lonely loser, and seeing everyone with their friends or partners is going to kill me. And the fact that this is for my 25th birthday just makes me feel worse.",2022-10-05 00:38:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618193737,6,/r/lonely/comments/xvvoji/spending_my_birthday_alone/,,0,8,spending my birthday alone

843,xvwuwu,[deleted],Hi everyone.  I 37m am getting divorced. My wife told me that she loves me but was no longer in love with me. That was about 2 years ago. Slowly getting over that but having a lot of trouble with it. I now have to talk to her about paperwork for the court and it hurts to hear her voice. I know she has moved on after she left I found some notes she was writing to a guy on the internet that was her shoulder to cry on that became the dick to ride on. I tried to date a woman from my past and it went well until I got feelings for her. We had become friends again after seeing each other at a friends house.  We would talk every day and I thought we could have a relationship. We went out on a few dates and she stopped talking to me. It has been almost 3 months now that I have spoken to her. I tried to use dating apps but I am only average looking and dont get liked by women that I find physically attractive. I struggle to meet people irl and all my friends have families and children. All I do now is goto work and goto the gym. I am always alone even when someone is there I still feel alone. I miss being able to touch someone. It hurts me every day that I am basically my ex wife‚Äôs trash. I have always wanted children but I feel like that has past me by.

848,xvxfd3,HugsHelpHeal,"I have been alone for most of my life. The only boyfriend I had was in high school and that was 11 years ago. I dealt with someone who I wasn't officially with this past year but that ended horribly and he was a disgustingly abusive person. Being away from him made me wish I never met him and made me appreciate the ability to be okay by myself. I do wish though, that I might meet someone some day. I have so much love to give and want to share my life with someone. But for now, I can't focus on that right now.

After having a really hard time recovering from this guy's abuse, for the first time in years I feel excited about a new thing I am doing. I am going back to school, a trade school but I am excited to get trained in something that will hopefully land me a great job and I can finally be independent/move out, be on my own, etc. Even though I am excited for this, I was also hit with some sadness today. I am in my mid 20s and I don't have many people in my life. Aside from a couple of friends, who I love but we are far away from each other. And it feels like everyone else is already settled in their friendships/relationships that they don't have the time or energy to make any new friends. This has made it hard for me to meet new people. Plus I am just in general very shy. I have been okay being alone. I feel lonely a lot but it hasn't been so bad. Now that I am getting older though, and I know I still have a lot of time, it just feels like it is always going to be this way.

Maybe that's okay. I don't know. But it does hurt sometimes to see how others have their friend groups, or significant others. I've had good friends, or so I thought, drop me out of their life with no explanation. I guess I am scared of this happening again, which is maybe one of the reasons I have a difficult time opening up to people. Throughout my life I have been quiet and when I was younger, I was a bit of a people pleaser. I think this made me a magnet for people who just wanted to use me when it was convenient for them. I have worked on myself to be stronger and not let people walk over me. But it feels too late. And I've become too comfortable in my solitude.

Me being chronically online was also a factor. During that time around my birthday something changed within me. I became a lot more violent as a person. It grew worse and worse and worse. It got to a point where in october. I won‚Äôt go into detail but I ‚Äúleft‚Äù my highschool. 

Another year goes by, I have even less friends. But it‚Äôs okay its the summer and theres this new person I can hang out with, she‚Äôll be a great addition to this friend group. 4 weeks go by and she kills my friendship with friends I have been friends with since 1st grade.

Hi,

This is coming from an extreme introvert. I am always afraid of people judging me for where I come from. 

So, I limit myself to very small circle and I struggle reaching out to right set of people in times of need. 

Let me be brief. I come from a place where I lost all my closed ones at various stages of life. Right now, all I have got is my mom's uncle.

Now he is going through critical illness, and I am with him at hospital from last 3days. I try staying strong, keep up straight face, listening to songs, walking around or watching some movies/series. But the fear of losing my uncle keeps running my head and at times I shiver. My bestie is far far away in school, can't bother her all the time. 

Is there anything I can read or physically do something to feel better around my current circumstance?

I am open to any kind suggestions.

931,xw8xkw,Cotton_Skies,"As heartbreaking as it is for me to write this, I must. The trauma and emotional abuse that my family has put me through, I am starting to realise that this is unintentionally isolating me from my current relationships. Having the sudden realisation of how none of what I have been experiencing is normal or acceptable in any way and sharing that with those few friends I have, I can tell they are finding it so hard to understand and relate to me. 

For context, I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands. We have never met IRL but his friendship offers such a safe space for me even though it is virtual, all of our interactions are online and at the moment mostly via text due to how ran down I feel and also I am at my family home where the people who have abused me live. On top of that, I have an ex boyfriend who I speak to regularly but that is long distance. Same country but still not ideal. A few friends but people I have only met fairly recently and the only ones who seem to actually respond are men, not women which just makes me question their motives to begin with. I am so incredibly lonely and that alone is a killer. Baring in mind with everything else going on, I don't know how to manage. I don't know where or who to go to. I wish with all my heart I had a friend who I can really talk to and have a safe, healthy, uplifting place in the world together. Our little corner, you could say.

I am a 24 year old woman who is at risk mentally and unfortunately have very little funds in the bank currently, although I am on a benefit due to my condition and mental ill health. Ideally, my plan is to get a job, perhaps a caf√© job and get myself out of this situation but that feels so far away right now because I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed and to do the every day expected things. I feel like I'm slowly falling apart. 

Thankfully I manage to get paid on the 9th which then I can possibly have some online therapy via video chat. I am relieved that finally my family are now acknowledging how horrific this have become and respect my bedroom is my private space now and will leave me to my own devices. I feel so alone and I just wish I had someone to talk to who understands or can at least guide me in the right direction. I cannot believe this is what my life has come to.

933,xw9nj9,Mesdermort,"Hi everyone,

I hope this doesn't come out as too long of a post, because I don't want to bore you to death with my story (also it's not that interesting) but I'd like to tell you about this as a way of venting and to try to understand how you people react to these sort of situations. Yeah I know everyone is different, but hearing from different people different ways of coping  could be useful in the pursue of finding our own method.

I find it too difficult to let go of people that aren't a constant part of my life anymore. This could probably no surprise, I guess it's kinda the same for everyone, but to me it's more difficult than the average person.

Before this summer I started an internship with a school in a pretty big logistics company pretty far away from where I live, about 4 hours in a car and it was me with 4 other people from my class. I already knew it had to end by the end of september (so yeah it's still fresh) so since I know myself and I know that if I get too attached to someone and then we part ways because life, I always suffer because of it, I decided not to befriend anyone in the office, but only work and minding my own business (my room mates are already friends of mine and live very close to where I live, so this story is not about them). Not in a rude way of course, I was always polite. Pretty clichey yeah but that's where I am at the moment. It was going fine at the beginning, in facts some people in the office, seeing that I always kept it to myself without socializing that much started thinking that I was depressed or something, but it was fine with me, I didn't care to be honest.

After a while though, I decided to try and socialize, don't ask me why, I was probably influenced by the cohabitation with my room mates that are way more extroverted than I am. Besides that, this is a loneliness sub, so of course I started socializing because I'm tired of being lonely. I like to be alone when I want to or need to, but being completely lonely, that I don't like.

So anyways I started socializing with some of the people of this company, in particular two people, a guy and a girl. Although our relation was always inside the company (we met outside of it 3 or 4 times in 4 months) it was a very ""good"" one(?). It became a habit to me that we would see each other every morning at work, smoking a cigarette, talking about what happened the day earlier, about life, dreams and ambitions, inside jokes and all that stuff. I wouldn't say we were friends but there definitely was a potential friendship.

I also started developing some feelings for my female colleague, not love of course, but an interest and I would have liked to know her better, to see if I could get a shot, but she was engaged already and though they are going through a big crisis and about to break up, she's still with him and didn't feel like taking advantage of the situation, even if there was ""something"" between us and my room mates especially noticed this more than me, but this is a story for another time.

Anyway the final day arrived. After 4 months it was time to leave; so we went to a restaurant to have a final dinner together, me my room mates and the colleagues we got close to. Before leaving almost everyone started crying and although I was on the edge of it, I didn't because I don't like if others see me crying; the girl came to me and hugged and kissed me saying the usual things ""I'll miss you very much... Write me sometimes"", same goes with the other colleague.

There's a lot much to add to this whole experience, but it would come out too long, so if you're interested and want more details you can ask me in the comments.

Now I'm back home and feeling so incredibly lonely and depressed that these people aren't part of my life anymore. Yeah we have each other on Instagram but I suck so bad at chatting. I can talk for hours face to face, but give me a phone and a chatroom and I'll be the most silent person on the planet. I could write them sometimes but it's not the same thing as in person to me and because of this I'm so afraid that these people will become just a memory. This is just the latest experience, but there have been tons of other like this and I'm a little sick of it.

When I was 18 (now I'm 30) I went to a college in London for 3 months and there I met people coming from all over the world that I ""befriended"". Now, 12 years from that experience, I still think of them and can't let go of their memory.

**TL;DR: This is really hard for me to articulate, also because english is not my native language, but the point of it is that I'm sick of being lonely and everytime I seem to find people that I'm happy with and that I want to keep as a constant part of my life, something happens that for some reason we have to part ways. I'm seeing the room mates I was with have already returned to their ordinary lives with little to no care of the people we met there, so why is it so easy for them and I just can't think of something like ""okay, this is a closed chapter of my life""? As I said earlier I don't want these two people I got close to become only a memory, but someone I can get back to sometimes, like on summer or christmas or whatever, but I already know this probably will never happen, everyone will move on with their lives and forget everything but I can't.**

I hope that what I mean is clear for everyone so I wanted to ask to people who went through similar life experiences and that might feel the same, how do you deal with it?",2022-10-05 12:43:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597039758,3,/r/lonely/comments/xw9nj9/difficulties_in_letting_go/,,0,1,Difficulties in letting go

It sucks for me especially since being smart was my only identity. I was pretty good in sport when I was a kid but ever since puberty started, I got left behind. The boys I used to be able to beat started to grow taller, stronger, and have more stamina than me, so I lost interest completely. I tried singing when I was a kid, didn't work. I also tried learning Japanese around a year ago, and I just passed the N5 exam back in July and I'm now waiting for my certificate. I was going to register for N4 exam but the quota ran out, so I think I'm going to study for both N4 and N3 level and just take the N3 exam in July next year. I also started pursuing art, something I was pretty intrested in. It's still not perfect but, it's way better than I thought. I'm still trying many kinds of arts, digital art, water colour painting, oil painting, etc. I know some of my problems sound so insignificant and unimportant to many adults but, for me right now they are really important.

950,xwdzxf,Broian,"Back in January, my wife and I decided to separate. It was a mutual thing that came at the end of years of growing apart and a change in gender and sexuality on their part. We are doing well as just friends and we still live together. We are going to stay married for the time being as we have kids and the costs of living apart and one of us taking on insurance is just too crazy right now.

They have moved on to a new partner, and I am still just as lonely as I have been for years. I‚Äôve tried a dating app or two with no luck and have even tried hanging out with old friends who are also single and/or divorced. I have fallen quite hard for an old friend that lives an hour and a half away. She was in an abusive marriage (separate and divorced for almost 4 years now) and despite us having tons and common and similar wants, she is still too afraid to get her heart broken again.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not a one-night stand or hookup type of guy, but every woman I encounter in my age range (47) seems to be happy alone or has been hurt by someone and isn‚Äôt interested.

How do I start, i have no idea, just that i don't know what can I do.

I'm lonely, nothing really different from when i was a kid or a teen or even now as an adult. Just always me, me, me and no one else.

People remember me when they want something from me, otherwise they even forget that i exist. It happened so many times, that i lost count of it a long time ago.

But still I'm unable to make myself understand that i should not feel hurt when it happens to me, because i do feel it. And a whole lot. Sometimes i just wish i never had a heart or couldn't feel a thing, atleast that way i won't be feeling so miserable.

It happened again, one more fake friend gone from my life who just came to use me for their own benefit and now that I was not of much use, they left. And I'm feeling sad about it which is making me hate myself more than ever.

This might not sound like much of an exchange but for me this is a huge win for me! I'm so introverted and find it hard to connect with people face to face.

During my first year the pandemic started and I promised myself that when the pandemic ends I would be a new person and make friends when i go back to collage campus, get to know all the people in the same class as me all day but probably have no idea I exist, maybe then I wouldnt feel this lonely, maybe then I wouldn't think of what would be the least painfull way to kill myself every fucking day.

995,xwmhiy,Apisal,"24M finishing my engineering degree soon, living in a conservative 3rd world country, living with my conservative family, I can't get a girlfriend, I never had sex or experienced love or been in a relationship, I am not a special case... that is the norm in our society until you have enough time and money to marry

I was always alone but never hated it because I enjoyed my hobbies and my priorities were different back then, only had 1-2 very close friends that shared the same moral values and the same hobbies as me

then I matured mentally a lot in the past 4 years and my priorities changed... I began to understand how loneliness feel...

I don't understand love, but I want it... I want someone to cuddle with naked in bed... I want someone to be there for me when I am stressed in bed... I want someone to understand when I am going through rough stuff and give me her time and be present... I understand how bad loneliness can be, so I will always be there for ppl who need me, and I hope for her to do the same for me... and lastly I want sex

writing about this makes me feel better already... but I don't want to feel better temporally... I want solutions... and the worst part is I know that the fastest solution would take at least 5 years... if I want a relationship I can't afford to keep it secret from my family... if I want to move out I don't have the money... if I want fast hook-ups then that might work, but I don't have the time yet...

Just thinking about if I were to be born in a different situation in a different country how much life would be better, dating at young age with supportive family, but I am already asking for much, the fact that I almost have an engineering degree means I am more lucky than 80% of the ppl in my country, I should be glade, but instead I am not satisfied with what I have, makes me realize how greedy and shitty person I am, still I love myself...

If I want to at least be with a girl for one night in bed talking... cuddling... have sex... I would need at least another 2 years, might not seem like a lot but given everything I already missed... it makes my blood boil and my heart feels like it is about to burst...

I am truly sick of this, what a greedy piece of shit I am...

TL;DR

I see it on tv, fake or not it still hurts and even makes it hard to enjoy anything because people in relationships are in everything and everywhere. 

I‚Äôm so tired of being alone and I‚Äôm tired of people telling me that I need to be happy alone or that if I stop thinking about it or looking for it, it will happen naturally. But I think that is bullshit. No one is going randomly come up to me and ask me out, I‚Äôm a guy it rarely happens that way. I don‚Äôt connect with people fast enough to form a possible romantic relationship with anyone. 

I‚Äôm not attractive, I‚Äôm not charismatic, I‚Äôm very awkward and quiet until I get to know someone. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm funny but I haven‚Äôt learned to be able to accept a compliment yet. Why would anyone want me? I don‚Äôt have dating experience, relationship experience, or even bedroom experience. I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything to offer. I talk way too much once I get comfortable with someone that it has to be annoying. I‚Äôm self conscious about it and about everything.

But this is all just me venting. Nothing matters and I know I have to keep trying to improve myself and make myself worthy of love.

1006,xwnnhs,Franklin_ldn,"I‚Äôm a 21-year-old about to go into my first year of university. I‚Äôm already feeling isolated being at ‚Äògraduating‚Äô age while everyone else is just starting out. I didn‚Äôt even take a gap year or anything. I just failed so many times in pursuit of university that I had to go through different programs in order to get the qualifications to attend. And I‚Äôm only doing so in order to avoid being kicked out of my parents' home. I haven‚Äôt made a friend since 2017 and I have no one that I keep in contact with now. I go months at a time without any meaningful genuine contact with someone and I feel so barren because of it. I‚Äôve exhausted every option: I‚Äôve read the self-help books, watched the YouTube videos, spent money on skincare; clothes; colognes; a gym membership, all in attempts to make myself seem more presentable, (I‚Äôve even started walking around with a lighter even though I don‚Äôt smoke just on the off chance someone asks and maybe some small talk can arise.) All these attempts have been fruitless, the most I‚Äôve gotten are just a few compliments on whatever sneaker or outfit I‚Äôm wearing that day. Doesn‚Äôt develop into anything further. I feel invisible under a microscope. Anytime I hear someone laughing I instantly think they‚Äôre laughing alone because I‚Äôm eating alone; in a cinema line alone or because my awkwardness is apparent from miles away. I‚Äôve tried to join societies and clubs that seem relevant to me but they‚Äôre so crowded and loud that I get overwhelmed. I used to go to bookstores with the wild fantasy that I‚Äôd meet someone of interest, whether it be an attractive woman or someone that could be some form of ""mentor"". I‚Äôd wander around the philosophy; economics or black history section of whatever bookstore wondering aimlessly picking up and skimming through books I‚Äôve already read just in some hope that I‚Äôd meet someone. After about 8 months it became wildly clear that that wasn‚Äôt going to happen and I became almost disgusted in my desperation and just bought a kindle instead. The one coping mechanism I‚Äôd keep going back to is porn. It‚Äôs like the fast food of romantic emotion, in the long run, it‚Äôs definitely doing me more harm than good. But it's all I have, Ive been using tinder for the better part of 3 years and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I can count my matches with my two hands. I‚Äôve even paid for a few months of tinder plus thinking that would help solve things but it only made it more clear how unwanted I am. At this point I really don‚Äôt know what to do, I pray most nights not to wake up because I‚Äôm too scared of surviving a su1cide attempt or the possibilities of what may happen after the matter but I just know that I don‚Äôt want to keep going on. A void shouldn‚Äôt feel this heavy and I‚Äôve been walking around with it for half a decade. All the councillors tell me that I should ‚Äòjust be hopeful‚Äô or ‚Äòjust keep doing what I‚Äôm doing‚Äô and it‚Äôll eventually pay off but no one can give me a timeline as to when. No one can tell me when eventually is and on top of that, no one seems to want to recognise that ‚Äòeventually‚Äô doesn‚Äôt come for everyone, some of us will die without seeing an upside of any sort. Some of us will die losers, it happened in the past and it‚Äôll happen again. I guess this is the realisation coming from one of those people. I work a part-time job in one of the busiest parts of London 3 times a week and have been doing so for the past 6 months, even still it hasn‚Äôt been able to provide any sort of meaningful connection. Parts of the internet say that ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt try too hard‚Äô so I go outside for weeks at a time in whatever basic outfit; go to gym classes with the idea that no one will talk to me, and shop for groceries knowing exactly what I need beforehand ( no sort of taking extra time in hopes of maybe talking to someone) other parts say ‚Äòtake fate into your own hands‚Äô and ‚Äòleave the comfort zone‚Äô to get what you want. Which led to me paying small compliments or trying to start small talk in whatever characteristic I could find someone that I had knowledge of (whether it be a certain pair of sneakers, a book someone may be reading etc) which was again fruitless. More recently I‚Äôve been reading into the effects of porn addiction and from what I‚Äôve read, the long-term effects seemed to directly correlate with a fair few of the issues I‚Äôve been having with my social life (increase in anxiety, poor body language etc) so I haven‚Äôt watched any of it for the better part of two months. I‚Äôve noticed that I am less sluggish in the mornings and have more energy overall, starting any form of small talk isn‚Äôt as daunting or complicated, but the loneliness is even more apparent and at this point, its very overwhelming, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I just wish I had some sort of meaningful connection that isn‚Äôt rooted in pity for me. (I don‚Äôt expect anyone to reach out from reading this, I guess this was just more of a vent, don‚Äôt feel obligated to say anything, part of me will also think it's because you pity me lol.

It fucking sucks to feel invisible. I've lost a huge part of the joy i get from my hobbies (coding, football/soccer, singing/music in general and being busy with pc hardware) and my college life is also lackluster (in my final year).

They alway's used to make comment's on ugly I look, how I've never had a girlfriend, how I cannot afford to go out to party, buy an iPhone or wear expensive clothes because I come from a financially challenged middle class family.

They made fun of how I have no goals in life, how I sit all day and procrastinate and overthink, they also made fun of my anxiety issue's.

For them getting women, having sex and partying is everything, today I was out with them when they saw two cute girl's, they approached the girl's and started to shoo me of like a dog to make the girl's laugh, that really messed my confidence and made me wanna cry a little.

Later on when we were hanging out with those random starnger girl's they pulled me up in the corner and asked me to go home, they said the girl's thought I was really ugly and I was ruining their game.

Now deep down I know I'm not that ugly and they just say so to mess up my confidence so I don't pose any threat to them, I'm a 6'2, pretty muscular and above average looking guy, although I have alot of pimple's and scar's on my face, I have really chubby cheeks and no beard those are my major insecurities.

1025,xwpypr,inr3m1nd,"I've never been able to form any kind of real, meaningful relationships. Sure, I've always had casual 'friends' (aka people I talked to when there was nothing else to do), but it never meant anything to me. I've discovered years ago I'm simply incapable of getting attached to others. Or feeling anything even resembling love or affection. I try my best but it all feels so shallow. Somehow I just don't have it in me to genuinely care about anyone.

People tell me things like ""but you're an attractive young girl, you should have no problems making friends!"" but they don't realize it's fundamentally impossible for someone like me to ever truly get close to another person.

It's tiring. I have one irl friend, we go out sometimes, but the entire time it's just me pretending I care about what she has to tell me. I don't. I just go there so I'm not completely alone all the time (as I'm a NEET living with my parents, so you can imagine how much social interaction I get outside of the internet). We don't really have anything in common at all, other than knowing each other since we were kids.   
I have a few online friends, who I share more interests with, because that's way easier to find online, but it still doesn't feel *real*. I hate it when they express affection towards me, like how much I mean to them. I hate never being able to just be the person I am without getting judged.

I remember a year ago or so I thought maybe I could try to fix it by getting in a relationship, so I found someone pretty quickly. But of course it didn't help; it only made me even more frustrated. She'd tell me she loves me and I'd always have to pretend and say it back. I couldn't stand it for a long time, I broke up with her after only a few months with some bullshit excuse I made up.

Everything is full of lies. I can't be honest with anyone because everything I've described above goes directly against how relationships work. Why would anyone want to waste time on someone who has nothing to offer back?

I hate all of this, I hate the unbearable loneliness. On the outside I look like a stereotypical shy-but-nice teen, so I do get approached sometimes (which is something I've always found funny, because I'm sure this is only due to me being female, and I'd get seen as some creep if I was male). But what's the point in trying to actually keep talking to the person if I already know I'll never get what I want? No one could ever understand me. What's the point in wasting my time and energy on someone who's nothing but a faceless plastic copy of every other person on the planet?

It feels pointless to keep going in these circumstances. At least most people complaining about loneliness are still capable of getting close to others, they just aren't able to at the moment. But what do I do if this is something unfixable; how I've been and will be for my entire life? What does someone do when they're inherently incapable of ever having the one thing they've always wanted the most?",2022-10-05 23:34:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658626047,5,/r/lonely/comments/xwpypr/at_this_point_i_already_know_social_isolation_is/,,0,3,at this point I already know social isolation is what's going to be the end of me

My main goal is to make money and retire early that's it, I took computer science because it pay's alot, I started I business to make money which failed during covid, all the thing's I've done felt forced because my main goal was alway's making money.

I've tried a lot if thing's but found nothing I was passionate about or loved doing, I just sit in my room all day overthinking, day dreaming and procrastinating, about my life if I had a lot of money.

I have no friend's or a social circle, I alway's chose to stay alone, I'd like to make friend's but my social anxiety doesn't allow me to, I suffer from serious anxiety as well, some time's I just sit and cry for no reason.

I'm failing my exam's becuase I'm wasting time procrastinating instead of studying, I have no passion for the thing's I doing right now, I don't even know what my passion is, I alway's wanted to be a Youtuber or a content creator but found editing or the process of making video's really boring.

I don't want to take the hard way I want it all served to me on a plate, I'm really willing to turn my life around, explore thing's, make friend's, try to find thing's I'm passionate about.

1059,xwum0r,Lightninroll,"I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with me. For reference, I‚Äôm a senior in high school. Anyways, my social skills are abhorrent, I oftentimes feel like I‚Äôm on the spectrum. It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt hold a basic conversation with others, it‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt get anywhere beyond that. I can‚Äôt make clever witticisms on the fly like every other person does. In my friend groups (don‚Äôt even know how the hell I got friends to begin with) I‚Äôm almost always the butt of jokes, and they STING me by getting at my inability to keep up with them, Fuck. I should also note that I haven‚Äôt had an average early life, and so I‚Äôve ‚Äúmissed out‚Äù or don‚Äôt know about many common (apparently) things‚Äînamely topics relating to romantic relationships, cultural references, and god knows what-fuck-all. On top of that, a vast majority of students (and my friends) are comparatively wealthy to me, which likely adds to the disconnect. I feel like an incompetent fool, a pathetic, bumbling speck on a log. Honest to god, I try to overlook my past and focus on what‚Äôs ahead of me, but that only gets you so far in the pernicious circle of high school social life. Many of my lifestyle choices (being straight edge, waiting until college to seriously pursue a relationship, being honest, etc.) are constantly derided, albeit jokingly. And look, I know they are joking, but holy fuck does it touch a nerve. It hits hard at my insecurities. I don‚Äôt even know how to give a proper hug for fuck‚Äôs sake. And the worst part is, I‚Äôm powerless when I‚Äôm made a laughingstock. I know I‚Äôm expected to somehow defend myself and bite back, but I also don‚Äôt want to treat people like shit just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúexpected‚Äù of me. I have my own principles, but god damn I find myself starting to wish I could tear into other people‚Ä¶.Even if I did resolve to do this though, I likely would do it in the ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù way, whatever that is. I likely wouldn‚Äôt joke enough, or have the right tone, and every other fucking thing I lack to make a comprehensible joking rebuttal. I would be too sincere. I‚Äôm an actual idiot, good lord! And my god how hard I try to fit in with people here. Almost every other joke relies on some fucking sexual reference and it drives me up the wall. I simply don‚Äôt find that shit funny, and I‚Äôm not an innocent little sheep, but I get relegated to acting the part because I‚Äôm expected to find it funny otherwise. And you would think that the people more accustomed to these topics wouldn‚Äôt giggle like little schoolgirls at the mention of whatever ‚Äúno-no taboo‚Äù topic it is, but apparently not. And no, I don‚Äôt want to hear you say stupid shit about you fucking my mother for the five thousandth fucking time you little shit. I can appreciate a certain type of humor, but stuff that devolves into dirty shit flinging isn‚Äôt up my alley. I should note that this is all personal, and I know my ego is starting to inflate like hell right now.

They think therapist is there only to prove me wrong and prove my family right. They don't care how my past haunts me, how they never took any responsibilities. I'm not living my life, I'm just existing without my will. I like hurting myself because at least the pain distracts me from the reality. I like to listen music to distract myself from suicidal thoughts but that is also unacceptable for my family. I tell my problems to my family, they start comparing me to people who have worse. I call them out for their mistake, they say I should be lucky, many families have it worse. Everyone makes fun of each other here, insults each other, never understood each other. I'm not able to study, I'm not able to get a job, I'm not able to die, I'm not able to be alive, I'm not able to leave, I'm not able to stay. The only happiness that came in my life also is MIA, and even if I told her how do I feel, she will definitely reject me. Either something is very wrong with me and this world doesn't deserve a pos like me or I'm just stuck at wrong place. I seriously have no purpose to live and most of the time now I think of $uicide only and nothing else. If I was in a room with Hitler and Bin Laden with a gun and 2 bullets, I would ask either of them to shoot me twice.",2022-10-06 03:45:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660617956,3,/r/lonely/comments/xwv9eu/i_think_enough_is_enough/,,0,1,I think enough is enough

I have tons or medical issues. A LOT. I cant drink anything other than water cause otherwise i end up in hospital due my stomach problems. I can eat so little options, pretty much for the same reason. I learned to live with that condition, i accepted that its gonna be like this for the rest of my life (went to best doctors, did a variety of exams). I dont expect people take care of my med issues. 

My ex gf dumped me 7 years ago and ever since i havent hugged a girl. I basically have no friends. I dont go out. I dont have friends that are willing to go out with me. They have gf's. That says it all. 

Im unemployed and i cant even pay for a haircut, even with my degree. Yeah, job market is a cruel bitch.

Im pretty much dead inside, no freaking girl gives me a chance, i dream about some cute girl hugging and dating me almost every week, maybe its my brain trying to compensate my lack of physical contact. 

Every time a girl see my pictures (my face) they unfollow or block me, i just accepted that im probably gonna stay lonely while everyone is getting engaged and getting a place while i live with my parents. 

If only someone knew whats like having so many meds to take at a daily basis and cant dealing it, cause its the stomach meds, anti depressive meds. I can not catch a damn break. It hurts my stomach taking these meds. No doctor seem to understand it. 

Every friday night imagining whats like having a girl hugging you and giving you attention and affection. Kissing my face and saying ""hey i want you around me"".

I suffer from depression and anxiety, but I love to make jokes and make people laugh, and I play the role of the office clown, but I feel like people don't view me as anything more, you know?

I've had only one gf in my life, and after we broke up, I feel like I may have lost the only person who ever liked me. I've asked people out since then, and even tried online dating apps, but nothing ever worked, and I'm starting to think maybe I'm just unlikeable that way.

And social media just makes it worse. Almost every other day I stumble across pics of friends and colleagues who either getting engaged, getting married, having kids, or just being in a relationship, and even though I try to be happy for them, I can't help but be reminded of my own state, and it's so frustrating.

1096,xwycmw,callingFives,"Hey, folks.

Here at r/lonely the general idea is over to the side in the sub description. What isn't commonly discussed is that *this community is a gathering of vulnerable individuals*. 

I regularly see brand-new and years-old accounts show up and their only history is a sudden description of themselves as one or more of the following:

* Marginally above, or below, the age of consent.
* New to Reddit
* Horny
* Willing to exchange phone numbers

While it is true that there are millions who fall into one of the categories above, here on the internet these are all yellow flags at minimum when paired together. Particularly on a subreddit full of vulnerable people of all ages, you should always consider the fact that ***you don't know who's actually typing at you on the other end***.

*If you are a young person, young adult, or someone who is under the age of consent on reddit (18), there are load of creeps out there who would gladly skim your account for what you like and don't like, and then use that to manipulate you.* **Most** young people *don't* use their age as an identifier, so if a post opens with a number lower than 18, it should be handled with care.

If you are New to Reddit, and here because you're r/lonely, welcome. Consider that upvotes and downvotes don't matter as much as anyone thinks they do, and this is *supposed* to be a place where you can fit in with others who feel the same. ***You can click on people's usernames and see what they have posted and commented on, and how old their account is.*** You can easily use this to consider who you might be talking to, and if they're someone you wish to *continue* talking to.

***If you are horny, this isn't a dating sub, a porn sub, or a hookup/connection sub.***  

No one should be exchanging phone numbers, in my opinion, when discord exists, but that's just me I guess. Giving your number out to strangers is a hard data point for doxxing and manipulation, as well as something that reddit can't record or report on.

Good internet safety is recommended everywhere, but here among a more vulnerable demographic of people, everyone here looks like a more targetable subject. There will be young people. There will be new people. They might not know better than to share their personal information, and they might be horny... ***but anyone who makes these a focal point is questionable, and anyone who makes them all focal points is a big red flag.***

1099,xwyoq4,idkanymorexx,"it‚Äôs a sick joke at this point. i‚Äôm not laughing :‚Äô)

you know that suffocating feeling of being so overwhelmed by loneliness that when (or if at all, tbh) your phone goes off your heart does a flip and you‚Äôre hit with a wave of painfully short-lived excitement that‚Äôs almost immediately cancelled out by defeat and demoralization because you can almost guarantee yourself it‚Äôs either: 

a) some sort of app notification or reminder

b) spam text or an ad for some online store you signed up to get texts from or

3) a family member that needs a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù

It‚Äôs never anything good. Sometimes I want to body slam my phone and wait for it to (metaphorically) tap out. I hate this thing. I‚Äôve literally on far too many occasions caught myself telling my actual phone to fuck off because of how frustrated I get. Yeah‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not looking good over here. 

And I can‚Äôt even get rid of it because I need it for work, for emergencies, and pretty much just to exist in this weird world. 

But yesterday, I received two texts that weren‚Äôt of the aforementioned kind. All within an hour of each other. The first text was from a guy I got really close with a few months ago who just ghosted on me and against my will left me to my own miserable devices lol. He can go fuck himself. But I actually thought he was texting me to tell me he missed me and was sorry he disappeared. He texted me to ask for advice about his depressed+suicidal friend. ME. A depressed+suicidal person he ghosted! 

Might as well have been a literal slap to the face. 

The second text was from some penpal I made on some obscure korean chat app (neither of us are korean, i couldn‚Äôt even tell you why we were on the damn app) who I remained friends with for several years but grew apart from. There were mutual feelings back then but I was too shackled by the rusty dusty chains of depression (still v much shackled) to allow anything to happen. He texted me out of the blue to let me know him and his WIFE are moving to the US and asked if they could stay with me if he ever made a stop in California. The audacity is almost admirable tbh. 

Whoever‚Äôs up there orchestrating all of this, please stop please lol. The joke‚Äôs ran its course move on please :‚Äô)

1122,xx3167,[deleted],"Flair says venting, but I‚Äôll take advice/support too.

I [34/m] left an abusive woman on 9/9 after 7 years of marriage. In terms of physical abuse it was relatively infrequent; it was more the mental/emotional abuse that I went through. But one thing in that mental/emotional was the lack of physical touch. 

Yeah, the sex was lacking (maybe once a month), but I couldn‚Äôt even really get a hug out of her. Maybe 10-15 seconds before she‚Äôd pull away, if that, if I could get her to give me a hug at all. Cuddling at night was always one-sided, and was like cuddling with a rock before she would just say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre smothering me.‚Äù Hand holding in the car was generally somewhat okay, but that involved us being in the car together, which didn‚Äôt happen often. I was expected to massage her feet, but to ask for anything at all (in return or otherwise) was met with irritation or half-hearted attempts; most of the time I didn‚Äôt even ask because of it.

Now that I‚Äôm out, the little bit of touch I did get is gone. I ended up holding a stranger from Tinder Monday night under the stars for two hours (with her consent and enthusiastic participation) because so strong was my need for physical touch. It was heavenly because it was *mutual* and *sincere.* But it‚Äôs like driving me mad. Physical touch is my love language. Forget sex at this point, I‚Äôm not emotionally ready for that, I just want to embrace someone for hours who is actually happy to be in my arms. Forget sex, I just want someone to lay down with me and put her head on my chest and fall asleep. Forget sex, I just want affection and touch at this point.",2022-10-06 11:35:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,,8,/r/lonely/comments/xx3167/craving_physical_touch_after_leaving_abusive/,,0,2,Craving physical touch after leaving abusive marriage.

1125,xx4esb,StatisticianFuzzy327,"This is a reminder for everyone that when we stay socially isolated for a long period or fall into unfavourable mental states, our brains distort our perception of reality start and we tend to fall into a negative cycle of thought patterns. 

In such cases, our brain acts as an unreliable guide and we get the wrong ideas about what's good for us. It gets really inaccurate at making predictions of how we will feel about future emotional events. 

So that voice in your head saying that you're worthless and you'll never feel happy again and your situation is hopeless? It's a cognitive distortion and you absolutely don't need to identify with it. 

Another small trick called is to verbalize your internal emotional experience by speaking it aloud or writing it down. It's called affect labeling and it's been shown to reduce the intensity of negative emotions and increase the intensity of positive ones.

I won‚Äôt like for half a year we both have practically put little effort in and yesterday she started jokingly saying she could do better and others would treat her better . 

Then went on about how I‚Äôm the man and should be spoiling her , taking on dates , getting flowers more frequently , taking her on weekend trips more often. 
I pay for everytbing and only get gifts on my birthday or Christmas and that‚Äôs more than fine for me I‚Äôm great full but she has just come out with all this expecting more but she puts less effort in than me.

Ayyyyyyyy what‚Äôs up! I‚Äôve made a couple good friendships on here finally, buuuuut, if I‚Äôm posting this again then it means that all of my friends are busy and I‚Äôm looking for some more friends to hang out with. I don‚Äôt have that many friends so definitely feel free to reach out! Also, I‚Äôm only looking for platonic friendships, I‚Äôm talking to someone right now that really makes me happy ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞, so just putting that out there. But definitely feel free to reach out, because I need more friends üò≠üò≠üò≠. It would be great to finally have irl friends in my life again to hang out with, but online friends are great too! 


The thing that I am looking for the most is for people to hang out with. I don‚Äôt really have that many people to actually hang with and spend time with, so I‚Äôm looking for people who actually want to hang out virtually. I not looking necessarily for someone to hang out daily with, I‚Äôm looking for someone to hang out with _consistently_ . I‚Äôm just looking for someone who wants to hang out sorta regularly. I really enjoy voice chats, so please be voice chat friendly. 

Hobby wise, I love watching shows on Netflix, and i also enjoy watching anime. Annnd, I love going to the movies. I‚Äôm really looking forward to the new seasons of Bleach, Demon Slayer, and Spy X Family! üî•üî•üî• i just finished watching Squid Games, which was pretty good. I‚Äôm thinking about maybe watching, Bojack Horseman, or maybe Money Heist next. I‚Äôm always looking forward to maybe seeing The Woman King, Avatar, Black Panther Wakanda Forever, and Black Adam in theaters. 

I play video games too. I have an extensive library of games that i have, most of them i don‚Äôt play tho. I do really enjoy playing Apex, Rocket League and Minecraft , and I would like someone to play Fall Guys, Overwatch, Multiverses, and some other games I‚Äôve been hearing about with. I also have mobile games that I play too. I play among us a lot, Pixel Gun 3D, Apex Legends Mobile, Chess, and Trivia Crack. And I‚Äôm open to suggestions and trying new stuff. 

I also write poetry, and I love to read. I really enjoy reading sci fi books. Two of my all time favorites are Michael Vey and I am number 4. I also enjoyed reading the Flawed series by Cecelia Ahern. And I‚Äôm always looking for new books to read. And i would love recommendations too! I used to do origami, although i fell off a while back. I also was into language learning, but haven‚Äôt picked it up in a minute. And, at some point i want to get back into studying web development too. I started learning Python, and I want to learn HTML, CSS, and Java. I also enjoyed playing Magic the Gathering in the past and there was this application that allows you to play on desktop, so if you are into that I‚Äôd love to get back into it! 

The last thing I‚Äôll say about me is I also love music! I like listening to a variety of different stuff. I can send you some of the stuff that I listen to if you want and would totally would be down to listen to music together. I also used to play a few instruments but i haven‚Äôt touched them since high school lmao so that‚Äôs how that‚Äôs been going üòÖ. 

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to say about me for now. The main TDLR to take away from this post, is I‚Äôm looking for friends, but the main thing I looking for is people to actually hang with and spend time with.

Hi folks,

There   are lots of lovely folks on here, but every post I've read through   seems to be on the lookout for something very different from what I'm   seeking.

Loneliness has been a   theme throughout my life, has led me to attempt suicide at one point,   and recently I got so lonely that I spent an immense amount of money   (despite being far from rich) flying overseas to meet up with someone   who I'd only met a couple of times over a decade ago, simply because   they were kind to me when we met in a way that nobody else has been   since.

Most people on this sub   seem to be looking for an online friendship or a gaming partner, but   I've never really played video games and I don't have that much interest   in online friendship. I really need someone to meet up with in actual   real life.

I have a reasonable   sense of humour but can't be described as a particularly open or jolly   person. Topics I'd like to discuss are loneliness, depression,   bitterness, rage, self-loathing, crippling laziness, and other such   pleasant themes. I'm also interested in magic mushrooms, religion,   cycling, psychogeography, literature and right-of-centre politics.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

1207,xxjoi7,sonicfan10102,"Went to a medical school informational meeting with the organization I became a member of at my university. I learned a lot from the event but my main goal was to hopefully interact and talk with my fellow members after the meeting during the lunch portion. Sadly that went completely south.

It wasn't like anyone treated me badly or anything but... well first of all. I obviously chickened out of talking to anyone like I always do...

But the worst part of all: barely anyone acknowledged I was even there lol. Every single person talked to someone else but me? I felt like I was fucking invisible. Like I didn't exist. I heard some of the conversations and there were people meeting each other for the first time... but no one was interested enough in meeting me... 

I don't blame anyone else for this though. It's definitely my fault for not actually initiating any conversation. And none of them seemed like bad people. It's just very discouraging and isolating being in a room full of seemingly very social people... socializing and talking with each and then there's just me standing there all alone. 

I suddenly remembered why I never go to parties or any social events. As I was heading home, crying and tearing up, I got nostalgic feelings from high school where my feelings of loneliness and suicidal thoughts were at their worst: there has to be something wrong with me and my existence. I feel like a fucking anomaly in society. Like everyone else exists for a reason and I'm the ""bug"" in the system that should be wiped out. 

I did get something out of attending the meeting though. the medical school sounded pretty neat and there are some programs i'm interested in trying there but yeah i just wish things went better afterward. this shit fucking sucks.",2022-10-06 23:33:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1515806929,1,/r/lonely/comments/xxjoi7/i_feel_like_im_invisible_venting/,,0,1,I feel like I'm invisible (venting)

So take it fast or take it slow

Out Of Time



When, where and how? What happened? Who are you? Are you even really there? Are you a mirage? A memory?

Am I hallucinating? Hundreds or thousands of years, written by the victors with blood in place of ink. Is this real? Is this the real me? Or is this all some sort of play on a mechanical stage? Or is the machine itself hallucinating? Dreaming of another world?

One day we're here, we live, we work, we strive and drive. The next we are gone, just memories of what once was. What do we leave behind? A better tomorrow or just fleeting memories that are yet to be forgotten?

Why have you forgotten me? Why do you not search for me? I am aching, drowning in sorrows of tomorrows that will never come. Dreams‚Ä¶ dreaming of what I need, what WE need.

Where are you? When are you? Who are you? Do you remember me? Because despite my words, I certainly remember you‚Ä¶ And the past, a history written by several hands from several perspectives, but the only ones we're taught are those written by the victors. The losers are dead and buried‚Ä¶ Nothing but memories of a past that has passed. Like me‚Ä¶

Despite all of the wars, all of the anger, hatred and separation‚Ä¶ I am dead inside, foolishly seeing myself as alive and well. But you go on and live happily ever after, leave the struggles of the passed past behind. You never needed me‚Ä¶ I needed you‚Ä¶ But I wish not to be an unwanted dead weight, shackled to your ankle‚Ä¶

Just be better than me‚Ä¶ Be happy‚Ä¶ Bring a better tomorrow, a history written by everyone from every perspective. Don't let us be forgotten. Remember us, for we ran out of our time in history‚Ä¶ We are but undead corpses shuffling through the streets.

Just remember me‚Ä¶ Bring us a brighter future. For my time is gone and I have no place here, yet you do and you are alive.

Just please remember me.

""

The explanation is personal aside from the fact that history is taught DIFFERENTLY all over the world... But there is no shared perspective on that matter. But the personal part? It's sort of directed at a old and VERY good friend that I unfortunately lost contact with. She introduced me to roleplaying, she gave me a escape from the Abyss of Hell that is our shitty reality... I was actually happy then.

I still love roleplay, but unfortunately finding partners is impossible for me nowadays. :I

Right now most people i know only talk about what interests them instead of letting me express myself how i want.

Just got back from watching Bros with my friends, two men happily together and for how long they've been together and how they act, they're honestly married without the piece of paper saying so.

There was a scene post-coital where Billy Eichner is hugging his love interest and begrudgingly says ""I forgot how annoying a warm body is."" Of course, begrudgingly because of his character, both in the movie and who Billy Eichner is.

That line stuck with me an hour or so after leaving the movie. On the drive home I listened to a playlist I made called ""I Miss Being in Love"" (I'm a screenwriter and rely heavily on building playlists to help me envision scenes, dialog exchange, playlists that paint a character, etc.) and let my silly self get sad, thinking ""Man... fuck you, Billy Eichner, you emotionally unavailable person, and all the emotionally unavailable people that find someone that changes them for the better while I'm here, vulnerable as hell, lonely as hell because I can't get over myself and allow myself to love and be loved and confuse the shit out of myself which, in reality, yeah, that's confusing so why would anyone want to be with confusing, so get your shit together and give yourself a chance, or don't and just listen to depressing music and be in your feels.""

I'll be nearly 28.5 years of age before I can even remotely get into the position of being able to date women. In terms of fitness, wealth, job status, residence...what have you.   


But I am damaged goods. Women will look at me like ""what is so wrong with you that you couldn't even kiss a girl yet?"". 

On paper, I am not exactly ugly. A lot of my failure could be attributed due to lack of trying. I never tried because I was chasing my idea of perfection. I was never satisfied. And when I did find myself getting even an inch close to someone, I would find a way to sabotage it. I did this with friends too.

 I come from an Asian family and the whole concept of ""dating"" was never introduced to me. Hell, we haven't even had the birds and bees talk yet. So I could never approach my parents about anything. Hell, half the reason I avoided even dating was because I was worried about what my parents would think. So many times I have had to swallow feelings because of them. What pissed me off was seeing other Asians date. I was jealous of their family...wish I was born into theirs instead. 

I am bitter. That'll never change. What do I even say to the women I meet at this point? How many lies do I have to craft? It's all gonna eventually fall apart. Being honest won't help because then I'll be repulsive.   


I don't blame them. I wouldn't date me either. I am damaged goods. I don't even know what the word ""love"" is.",2022-10-07 03:51:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660941486,19,/r/lonely/comments/xxovj2/all_for_naught/,,0,3,All for naught

1261,xxq7dv,Middle-Lawfulness-26,"I'm 24(F) and I'm confused about my emotions and I need help understanding them. 
My partner 24(they/them) and I have been together for 4 1/2 years. We've had our ups and downs but we love each other very much. I recently moved away to go to college to finish my degree because I got a full ride scholarship into a school that I've always dream of going to. The issue is that I'm having a hard time being away from my significant other because the school is about 4 hours away from home. 
A bit of background from me- I grew up very poor and both of my parents were very neglectful and abused drugs. Despite that, I never really connected with them and I kind of just didn't care about people in general.  
No one truly knew me until I met my partner. There is not a single person who knows every secret, every weakness, and every interest of mine except them. They have seen me at my best and at my worst. 
So leaving the kind of safety that I felt has been very hard on the both of us. 
I have a hard time talking and forming connections with other people. I'm very weird and my socializing abilities are a bit off according to some honest individuals. Long story short, I just don't understand the give and take relationship mentality. I try my best to give people what they want, which is understanding and companionship, but I just don't hit the right cues or the right way to phrase things to initialize the feelings of empathy so that they see me as normal. I just can't understand small talk or what the point of it is and I have a specific way I can do it but if it changes, I freeze and say the incorrect things that don't match with the conversation. 
But that's where my partner comes in. They will step in when I get stressed because they understand the cue words that don't work for me. If I don't know how to respond, they do and they will make the situation less awkward. My partner is very charismatic and a lot of people gravitate towards them. 
Being alone, I do what I always do and learn about the one specific thing that I've always loved since I was a child. Its my other safety net when I just need to be left alone in my head cause im stressed out. 
I just cant seem to make friends eventhough I will try but it's like people can tell that I'm a bit weird so they almost avoid me and keep things shallow. I just feel so out of place and I feel like the only safe place is my room with my books. I avoid my roommates because talking to them is so exhausting and I'm so scared to talk to the people in my class because I feel like they will reject me. 
Because of this, I wait at the same time everyday for my partner to call me because it's the only genuine interaction I get for the day. I plan all my homework and all my other chores just to make sure this time isn't interrupted. I just want to hear about their day at work and what they did and what kind of funny jokes they told that day. This small thing makes my days worth it. But sometimes their busy and can't call me because they are hanging out with other people. Or they can't hangout this day because they are going somewhere that I wasn't invited too. Or I can't come home this day because they're to busy  because they promised to meet up with someone. 
I don't understand why this hurts me so much. I don't mind it most of the time but when it interrupts the moments I cherish, it breaks me. It's such a petty emotion and I understand that these things are what cause a co-dependent relationship but I can't seem to turn the emotion off and move on. I've identified that it's an unreasonable emotion yet I can't stop it. I don't understand why I can't control myself over something so small and insignificant. I just want to go home and enjoy the two things that I love, learning and my partner. 

I want the honest truth, is there something wrong with me? I just don't understand why things are the way they are and I just feel so alone and I dont understand why.",2022-10-07 05:02:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/xxq7dv/i_need_some_help_understanding_me_emotions_please/,,0,1,I need some help understanding me emotions please

To make a long story short I am enrolled in university at a school that is about twelve hours away from my hometown. I didn‚Äôt know anybody here before the move but I feel like that I am good at meeting new people and making new friends. I‚Äôve always been the optimistic type and my family was military growing up so I‚Äôve moved a lot as a kid. I saw this move more as an opportunity and a chance to reinvent myself.

But perhaps that‚Äôs the problem. In trying to create a better me, I feel like I lost myself along the way. I have a hard time defining who I even am anymore. What are my motives? What are my values? What are some things that I like to do? These should be easy questions to answer but I seriously have a hard time coming up with anything.

Not that this new environment isn‚Äôt amazing; it really is. The campus is absolutely beautiful, the classes are excellent, and I‚Äôve already made a lot of friends. But at the same time, I feel like I have a hard time maintaining these friendships. I used to hang out with a big group of people at the beginning of the school year and now it‚Äôs just me and like two other rotating people over the weekend.

I shouldn‚Äôt have any reason to feel bad for myself. I have a loving family and lots of people to talk to, both here and back home.

She called me right before we left and made it seem like she was just about to leave. She went to hang out with other people instead. I told her I was upset about this and she still has no idea why.

Yesterday I went out to eat with a bunch of people and they all left without even telling me. I was in line at this foot court and one of the girls there said that she was going to go to the bathroom and to hold her spot.

This guy struck up a convo with me today. Found out we have a lot in common. He asked for my number. After a lot of chatting and finding out we have even more in common, he invites me to meet up. I send him the following text:

""Hey I hope I'm not misreading the situation, but I've detected flirtation, and I need to be full disclosure with you in case thats where you're coming from: I'm transgender. MtF. If that changes things, that's totally OK and i understand. I'd be happy to be your friend no matter what, but I just felt I ought to tell you""

He reacts hesitantly, asks for more pics of me. He says he couldn't tell. That I'm pretty. But he's acting super weird Then he says ""who was your friend with the black hair? She was pretty cute""

And he said ""I'm only into women no offense

And now I just hit beans for the first time since my 2019 mental breakdown. Thanks a lot you dirty fucking weeb, my friend with the black hair IS cute and she deserves better than you

1295,xxu5bl,SituationPristine173,"My Father is in a govt. Job and we have to shift from one city to another. Due to this I wasn't able to make freinds when I was 5 year old.

At the age of Six I shifted to the next city, I made a very good friend and I didn't knew what freindship was at that age but was enjoying it and after 3 years I shifted to another city. I wasn't able to say goodbye to him. I only remember good memories of him and  I also remember crying when I was leaving the city. My Parents tried to console me but I don't know If they understood me or not because they are still able to contact their freinds. 

I found another good friend who understood me but I was unhappy because I knew I am going to leave him and It happened. When I entered my teenage phase and in new city I wasn't able to make good friends, because their personality was that they want to show how superior they are. It was that phase of my life that I wanted to leave this city so badly and after 2 years it happened. I shifted to the previous city and I was happy to meet my old friend again and i was able to properly convey my feelings more to him than my parents and I am still freinds with him but he has his own life and I won't disturb him.

Now I am in college (away from my parents)and I am facing same phase when I was in teenage. I want to leave this college because people are busy in themselves, aren't intrested to learn new things on their own about what they are studying and, always make offensive joke or talk about themselves and many of them like to live in extreme end of politics or their own life, where they don't want to listen to any side and make opinion which bothers me a lot, but I have to express my fake feelings and I am not able to share my true feeling. It is painful for me.

Gaming helped me to escape the reality and it became my addiction in teenage phase but when I l came out of that addiction I am not able to enjoy anything. Gaming was one thing in my life that when I come back I will be able to play video games but now I don't know what to do. Just crying every night and thinking about my past.

1316,xxzqtk,theoisntherenow," Hello everyone, this is my first time to actually post something on Reddit and English isn't my mother tongue so please be gentle with my stupid writing.

I'm 20M and I have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for four years, since we went to high school. We are having a long distance relationship and I haven't got any chance to meet him in real life. We just called video and texted a lot. We talked about our life, our days, our favourite series together. We had a happy time and I think everything changed when he went to the capital for university.

He replied to my texts less and less, which made me anxious a lot because I had no idea what he was doing or where he was. Everything just suddenly went blank to me. I talked to my friends about this and it didn't help me feel better. I remembered one night I realised how much texts we sent to each other at that time, compared with how we used to text in high school, and I cried myself to sleep that night.

I also tried talking to him about how I felt but everything he said was that he had to be ‚Äúsociable‚Äù and ‚Äúget used to‚Äù with his new friends. I know this sounds selfish but what about me? I was so stressed out at that moment. I talked to him about my mental health and he advised me to have more new friends, who can spend time with me. I do have friends, but how can friendship ever replace love? I don't need to have more friends, I need him.

He said that he cherished our relationships and he loved me too, but I can‚Äôt feel anything. I don't think he even acted like what he said with me. He promised me to balance his friends and me but I don‚Äôt understand why he replied to his friend‚Äôs text and he just read mine without replying back. 

I feel very lonely and depressed at the same time because I can‚Äôt spend time with him although I very want to. I tried my best to not focus on him and did something I love like going outside, cycling but I still feel something is missing for no reason. 

Am I overthinking too much and nothing has ever changed between him and me? Maybe everything was my imagination?

Is there anything wrong with me?",2022-10-07 13:53:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/xxzqtk/is_there_anything_wrong_with_me/,,0,0,Is there anything wrong with me?

Throwaway for this one. 

I just turned 18 a little over two months ago and I couldn‚Äôt be more ashamed of the man in the mirror. I have one friend who is basically just a drinking buddy. I threw away all my prospects with women after being harassed so hard by a freshman when I was a senior in high school I tried to kill myself and still do self harm on a near daily basis because of it. I still can‚Äôt find work 4 months out of high school because I‚Äôm horrible at being interviewed. 

I‚Äôm attractive enough to get people to want to talk to me but they just disappear after they realize that I‚Äôm just not a likable person. Not even in the sense that I‚Äôm mean to them, but I feel like people just can‚Äôt make a connection with me no matter how hard I try. 

I‚Äôm used to feeling unloved thanks to growing up in a very very emotionally abusive household, but for the first time in my life, I genuinely cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel. Whereas thinking about love and finding someone used to fill me with hope as a kid, now it fills me with a physical feeling of despair and hopelessness in my stomach. I still have yet to have my first kiss or first relationship and as I said before, the closest thing I‚Äôve felt to somebody loving me was harassment. At this rate, I truly do not believe I will live to see my first kiss, let alone my first relationship. If being 6‚Äô5, having curly blonde hair, and being a good weight and still not being able to have girls be attracted to me as a person isn‚Äôt indicative of my completely unloveable and disinteresting personality, idk what is. 

I feel like I can go anywhere in life, but chose to go nowhere and deliberately took the worst route. All I do is sit around and get high to distract myself from the disaster of a human being I am. I have never felt such physical despair within myself and I do not know what is keeping me alive anymore.",2022-10-07 15:06:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/xy1j9k/i_feel_like_i_am_a_waste_of_good_genetics_and_am/,,0,4,I feel like I am a waste of good genetics and am completely unloveable thanks to my severe trauma (18M)

There aren‚Äôt many women in my area that have the same interests as me and it‚Äôs really difficult to make friends. I feel like I have absolutely nothing going for me and I amnt worth listening to.

Why those teenagers get to have so much opportunity than I do, what kind of power or specialty do they have to attract so many people around them or even when they're not even social, they still have people surrounding them? Please universe I'm trying now, I'm making the first step so what else do I need to do? Tell me.. I gotta to know what am I lacking from those teenagers!? What kind of Aura that's surrounding them to attract so many people. I wondered do they even experience loneliness sometimes or they have experienced it cuz from what I see..seems like they got everyone always following them.

I don't know much cuz I've been this way for too long, I lack so much from those teenagers, what is wrong with how I am as a person. I know everyone has unique personalities and that's what usually attract many people. I realized my personality is weird, boring, unattractive, dull, lifeless, dead, uninteresting, stale and spiritless. But I still tried, Pease be proud of me for trying cuz really I tried my best. I gave it my all. I'm stuck in this cycle of ""I can accept my loneliness and I don't need anyone to waste my time with joy and laughter.. Oh I wish I had friends to hangout with in the weekends, people think I come here everyday because I got no one to lean on or to waste time talking nonsense."" I don't think I can break out of this repetitive cycle. I need someone who would check up on me and tell me if I'm doing alright today. I do put myself out there but when my social energy is low or I'm being ignored that's when I start distancing myself from the people I just talked to for a couple of days and finding myself back to square one and finding myself all alone again. 


I just wanna end this here, I don't want to know my future or if I've achieved something. I'm tired of trying. Please stop tell me to keep trying because I do try.. You just didn't see it but I really did. It will be the same.

Night #1 

This damn feeling got me 
Every night
Its like im sinking in an ocean
Thats in my mind 

Idk what hit me 
Its like no one ever gets me
Ill just put a mask on
And life will go on and on and on 

But this mask I wore 
Every feelings and gesture 
I thought this could make it better
But it didnt 

Now this masked feelings are a part of me 
Idk how to take it off
Ive never knew my real self since I was 8 
At that time i was getting punched 
Being the weird kid that everyone hates
I was alone for a while. 
Now my minds racing with thoughts 
Like it could run for a mile 

But oh well what am i gonna do
This mask is stuck on me like a put on some glue
If I peel it off would I feel some repressed pain
Or will it give me something to tame.

Came into my 3rd year of middle school and we changed classes. None of my friends were in the same class as me. We were still close for the first few weeks but slowly drifted apart as they treated me colder and colder, now we dont even acknowledge each other when we walk past. Various events in my life such as close family members getting very sick and rare medical conditions and accidents occuring are affecting my mental state as well. 

Forming any relationships in my new class was challenging. Everyone had their own friend group already, my personality never seemed to click with anyone and half the people in my class see me as weird. I still dont have anyone i cant call as close yet.

I also realised that how fragile and perhaps insignificant the relationships I had forged in my first 2 years of middle school were. The people who i used to treat as friends treat me as if I was a stranger, and have made new friends now. Am I clingy? Most likely. But i feel like thats because i really treasure those moments now, and whenever i think back to those times, i cant hrlp but feel so empty and alone.

Im now less talkative, less social, less bold, less likely to initiate conversations and more lonely than ever.

looking back at myself, i've not had a proper friend my whole life. I dont think i've had a proper friendship that has lasted more than 6 months. im constantly ignored in school, even after always trying my best. I constantly try to start new conversations with folk and always help to my best. my school is really chock full of tech illiterate people and i'm who always people come to for help. i always fix the problem and they give a ""thanks"" under their voice and walk away. people always treat me badly outside of times when they need help and when i finally reach my breaking point i get treated like im the the asshole. back on to the topic, im so tired of seeing everyone sending stories of them outside with their friends at the mall or starbucks, and i sometimes search the internet for answers on why i'm so lonely but it never seems to help. theres always posts saying ""you dont need others you just need yourself"" but i'm so tired of being with myself. i need something interesting in my life. i'm so tired of living the same monotonous schedule every single week, where i spent the week going to school then hopping on some game after school, and doing fucking nothing in the weekends, rinse and repeat. i have an online friend or two but i **need** someone i can physically have a fun day off with, not someone to occasionally play games and send memes to. i've tried making friends with people outside of my school by going to camps or doing extracurriculars to build a better social sphere but nothing work. nobody wants to talk to me. i always get left on read, and im tired of always acting like im fine and putting on the ""happy and quiet kid"" at school. every time i vent a tiny bit to someone nobody understands me and i'd be happy if i just had a single person that i could actually call a friend and not someone who'd be embarassed when you walked up to them at school. i feel like im a burden to everyone i try to socialize with because they always leave me on read. when i say that i have no friends people go ""come on, im your friend!"" but when i walk up to them at school theyll try to ignore me or leave me on read when i try to initiate a conversation, or say they're busy when i ask when we can talk/go out, and i'm always the second choice. i only get sent text messages (and that happens once in a blue moon) when all of their other primary friends are busy. i also feel like people never want to talk to me, i just get a perculiar vibe from their tone of voice and face expressions (i like to believe im good at reading people (i know, how ironic.)) i really dont know what to do. im tired of everything and the same weekly schedule at this point. i'd like to thank anyone for coming up to this point, if you'd bother reading this mess. any advice welcome.",2022-10-07 17:10:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/xy4kck/14_yo_boy_tired_of_loneliness/,,0,6,14 yo boy tired of loneliness

1364,xy6lld,Goldengirl1977,"I am in my mid 40s and just had a birthday last weekend, but it wasn't happy for me. Birthdays just don't feel special or exciting anymore and are just another reminder that I'm getting older and lonelier.  I don't know why exactly, but all of a sudden this week, I am feeling very down and hopeless. I think most of it has to do with life circumstances, most of which I can't or don't know how to control or change. 

I am single and have not been on anything resembling a date in years. At this point, I feel as though I am too old and over the hill for anyone. Guys my age and even older don't want anything to do with girls in their mid 40s, particularly those who have never been married. I've tried meeting people through various activities and even online, but no luck. 

I always wanted to find that special someone, get married and have a family with them, but it just never happened and now it's too late, at least for the family part. To top it off, I don't have any close friends that I can just call up out of the blue. Everyone I know is married with children, many of whom are now in junior high/high school or even college. They only seem to know and spend time with others with similar lifestyles and don't have any interest in spending time with me. I feel like I am always on the outside, always the one reaching out, but never getting anything in return.

It also seems as though my family keeps getting smaller and smaller. My grandparents are all gone now - my maternal grandparents have both passed away in the past six years - and I don't have any aunts, uncles or first cousins close by, with the exception of one much older cousin that I rarely see or talk to.

My mom passed away 15 years ago after fighting brain cancer for a year and a half and my dad is now dealing with a serious illness, which weighs very heavily on me. My brother is busy with his kids and career and my sister and I don't always see eye to eye. My brother didn't have to give up his career or really interrupt his life in any way when my mom was sick and the caregiving mainly fell on my dad, me and my sister.

Now, even though my dad is still working full-time from home and you wouldn't know it from looking at him, he is dealing with a serious illness that requires frequent Dr visits, labwork and so on, and my sister and I are the ones going with him to those appointments. 

I would help my mom all over again and I would do anything to help my dad, but sometimes I just feel so overwhelmed, worried, scared and upset by everything going on that it's almost too much to bear. If I had a better support system - husband, best friends, close relatives, etc. -it might be more manageable, but I don't and it's really getting to me. I feel like crying all of the time, but I have no one to cry to. I don't want to cry in front of my dad and upset him and neither my brother or sister would be particularly understanding. I wish my brither would call me up sometime - the way you would think a big brother would - just to check on me and see how I'm doing, but he never does.

Eventually this loneliness will erode what little compassion I have left for people around me and cause me to be a hell of a lot more matter-of-fact and, well, bitter. Why wouldn't I be? People are gonna think that I was born this way. No motherfucker, **you** changed me 

I'm 20-something years old and earlier this year I went on my first ever date... Something that by all rights should've happened a decade ago. When kids my age were out making lifelong friends and meeting their first loves, I was getting shot down. I was the one that got to watch people live their lives and make their first ever memories -- and if you're a part of this subreddit there's almost a guarantee you know what I'm talking about 



Then again, there's also a good majority of people here that just lurk and don't know what it's like to be lonely. Good for you, I'm almost envious.




For the first time ever in my life, last week I met a girl that saw a picture of me and vehemently said I was attractive. It wasn't forced, I didn't have to coax her into it -- she just said what she thought. The problem? It's online... Because of fucking course it is. No girl in real life could think those things about me, and I don't give a shit what the reasoning behind that may be. I'm done trying to figure out the reasons behind shit and peek behind the curtain to try and make sense of bullshit. 



I think the worst part of it all is, though, that I stopped caring. I just received a genuine compliment from someone that spoke from her heart and I couldn't find it within myself to give a shit, or believe her. The closest thing I ever got to a ""relationship"" was a LDR that lasted five years, wherein the girl didn't even wanna fuckin meet me in person... Because of fuckin course she didn't. 



They say ""you get out what you put in"" for nearly every situation, and they try to say the same about being lonely. I'm here to tell you today that **it's not fucking true.** I've put in GREAT EFFORTS to change who I am so I don't have to hate that thing looking back at me in the mirror every morning when I wake up, and I'd like to think I'm finally at a place where I can almost say I don't fuckin suck. 



I got a new hairstyle, I got contacts instead of glasses, I lost weight (and then gained it back), I started exercising, I got new interests and music tastes... Literally ""new me who dis"" and it did fuck-all. I took every little piece of advice that was given to me by people that were not only unqualified to give it, but in equal measures unsolicited yet if anything, I think I'm **worse** off now

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to achieve my dream of being in a band because of my social anxiety. I‚Äôm in a guitar class at my school but I‚Äôm barely able to interact with anyone even though I want to so bad. 

I only have one close friend but she got a boyfriend recently so now she barely talks to me because she‚Äôs too busy doing shit with him, and every time we have a conversation she finds a way to turn it into a conversation about him or will just start being extremely dry.

I decided I need to find new friends online, but as I opened my custom feed of subreddits dedicated to making friends, I realized how unfulfilling just having online friends is. I want to be in a band and have friends in real life but nope that can‚Äôt ever happen.

At that time I met my girlfriend and she gave me that comfort of being myself. I didn t need those ""friends"" anymore becouse my girlfriend was my bestfriend. This continued for 3 years but this last year was very rough for us. I went to the university but it wasn t what I expected it to be. I dropped school and came back home. After that things didn't really got better between me and my girlfriend. I was tring to fix what I did wrong but it was already too late. She told me that she needs time and that we could be together but she needs to see me change. So right now we are just friends. She went to the university so we are separated again. She promised that we will have contact but she doesn t text me or anything. I really care about her and I really want this to work out. But with each day I m slowly losing hope bit by bit.
I don t realy have anyone alse to talk. My family is in really bad shape now and my brother is the only person i can talk to. I have some friedns at my work but noone really cares about me like she used to. Noone texts me. I tried making friends online but it feels the same. They just don t care.

I overthink everything I say, and am always worrying about it as well. I'm still cringing over something I said 5 years ago. I'm never able to carry conversations when they do happen, there's just this kinda awkward silence that ensues whenever I talk with someone.

Recently there was this girl who actually talked with me, and I instantly fell for her. I recognized pretty quickly it was just infatuation though. That was a low moment for me, and I realized that I really need to improve my social life.

Does anyone here have any tips on how to carry conversations or go up to a group of people and join in conversation? I always feel like it's obnoxious for me to go up to a group of people and try to include myself...

What a rollercoaster of a life so far. It‚Äôs funny I haven‚Äôt had a bad life so far all things considered not the greatest but not the worst. I haven‚Äôt always been a lonely soul. Growing up I loved talking to other kids but I never got to keep any childhood friends  because of my family moving after the parents split. Elementary same way but alas had to move again. These things never bothered me growing up. High school rolled around I was the new kid I made some decent friends hell I fell in love. I was pursuing the career I wanted to life was perfect and I was only 17. I thought things could only get better. Fast forward to 2020. I‚Äôm single now living in a different town that I moved to for work. Life is somewhat shattered but it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll throw myself into my job. Unfortunately COVID happened and I lost my job and I was all alone no friend, hardly and family, and no one to support me. It hurt to much sometimes almost didn‚Äôt make it out alive. But I pulled through. Now it‚Äôs almost 3 years later. Even less friends and support from the family I believe I‚Äôm officially the black sheep not because I do anything wrong but because it weird that I don‚Äôt do anything. Dating has been nonexistent i don‚Äôt even know why at this point. But every attempt at showing my love for another human ends with‚ÄùI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù from them. It‚Äôs okay I can‚Äôt be upset with any of them. It‚Äôs just not in my nature. Even with what I‚Äôm looking at is not the short recap I wanted of my short life so far I‚Äôm content right now .

I‚Äôm a senior in college studying engineering so that normally takes up a lot of my time but I have other hobbies too. I played sports in high school, I‚Äôm an Eagle Scout, and I play guitar to name a few. You‚Äôd think with all these experiences I‚Äôd make some friends, but no one really hangs around in my life.

It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. I‚Äôve been single for like 5 years now and forget what it feels like to be loved or touched. I think it‚Äôs me. Somehow I grew into someone who hates people. Even as I write this I hate the thought of someone knowing how I‚Äôm feeling right now.

1504,xysbl3,4rterrex,"Whenever I try and make a change in my life in regard to my social life, positive or otherwise, it usually blows up in my face. I've found myself browsing Reddit more lately, to my dismay, only because if I don't do this, I would be doing something else just as if not more detrimental to my well-being.

I don't think I can even make friends anymore. I generally like being alone. I don't really like talking all that much. I mean, I guess I like listening to other people and being there for them? Hypothetically? I don't think I could help or even make a positive impact upon anyone though. To some extent, I wish that I could. I don't think my company is so valuable that anyone would willingly want to devote their free time to talking with me though. Even among people who have similar interests I don't actually have anything in common. I think if I were to open up and be vulnerable and honest about all that I am to another person, they would look at the totality of ""me"" and determine that I am not worth the trouble. It is all so routine. The familiarity of being ignored, passed over, ghosted, being alone. It just doesn't bother me anymore.

Make friend(s)? Complete the ever-elusive love quest? Hahaha, no. It is never going to happen. I'm not that delusional.

I know that nobody can fix me, nor am I looking for anyone to fix me. I just want to meet someone who is okay with me exactly how I am. Someone who can see the totality of ""me"" and have a feeling that isn't contempt or something similar.  Theoretically, that person wouldn't even have to like me.

1539,xyya4b,si2tv,"TLDR, I'm too far up my own ass to accept that I'm multi dimensional, layered, dynamic, human. And me having trouble accepting that more than likely lends to my perceived loneliness.

I have different sides to me just like everyone else, but I've let one take over the other, back and forth, always conflicted to have the other when one's so opposite.

I'm (32M) a TV and film guy, screenwriter working as a creative copywriter with some improv and comedy chops, and have always had this ""persona"" that was on for the party, the comedy of situations, the committed idiot bits, the self-deprecating bits, the comedian to inject or find the humor in moments. Then there's the opposite that's too introspective, too into his emotions, too ""deep"" wanting to discuss the complexities of life that are simple and vice versa.

The two always conflicted, with me in the middle feeling all the dissonance. Acquaintances would always get the persona, while close friends would get both, never taking issue to it, just me because I feel it's... Having a fake and real me.

On paper, the persona sounds fake; fabricated for show and entertainment; meant to be treated as a switch I flip at will for the sake of the situation; a puppet to exploit. While some would be ashamed of the emotional side, it was the opposite for me. I loved getting the laughs, the attention for the other side, but it always felt like a show to me, and I felt ashamed for feeling like I needed to put on that image. Then after the fun and games displayed for family and friends, all married or in committed relationships mind you, I go home alone to my lived in but lonely house. It's this part that always made me felt lonely, the most shame for being that clown.

But what if that side was genuine? Just as much as the emotional side? And that as humans, we exist and live out our lives on a spectrum of emotions and traits and energy, and that we express ourselves differently one day to the next. And contrary to popular belief, a funny ""showman"" type, no matter how scripted it feels, can actually be genuine.

I admit, some people do put up an image. I won't pretend that's not true. But for me, I'm tired of being ashamed of that clown that goes home alone. That clown deserves love, too. And I need to be better at loving that goofy ass cause I am that goofy ass.

He is so smart and funny and my brain had just fixated on becoming friends with him.

I tried everything, even being a better person than I‚Äôm actually is, but he just kind of not interested in me, just like everyone else with whom I study (which makes me even more sad).

1550,xz0lbu,justarandomguy_77,"Hello folks :(

I seriously hope, that you are doing fine or at least better than me right now. I have never posted something in this subreddit, but I want to share my feelings and thoughts right now. 

I am 26 (male) and have ZERO friends, literally ZERO. On top of that, I had never a girlfriend. I had to move to another city (where I currently live) after I graduated from High School and lost all my friends. I didn't manage to find friends during my Bachelors and when I started my Master degree program (same college), Covid shut down everything. So my college years are completely gone with loneliness. I cannot count how many times I was alone in a lecture hall not knowing anyone :( Attendance is not required in our college, so most students didn't come to lectures... 

I am basically ALWAYS on my own, ALWAYS. I work as a helping student in an enterprise and there are ZERO opportunities to meet people in my age, hell even older people don't come to work because only a limited number of employees is allowed to come to work. 

I tried Online Dating and met over the years a bunch of girls but the majority of those dates ended with one single ""coffee hangout"" and thats it. No fancy hookups and no chance of establishing a relationship, I guess I am either simply too unattractive for hoookups and/or just plain stupid to flirt with girls in general. 

I am not a virgin anymore, but I seriously miss having contact to the opposite sex and I am really jealous when I see couples in my daily life. Sometimes I get insanely angry when a girl from Tinder ghosts me or stops dating me. I cannot describe that feeling in words but it's just pure anger, frustration and I have no clue what makes me so damn shitty that they aren't into me. 

I don't know how I can escape this nightmare. It's really destroying me and I am seriously concerned, that I will stay single for the rest of my life. This sounds hilarious but I honestly think, that I will end up lonely my whole life. I wouldn't mind if I had a girlfriend but no friends, but not having friends and a girlfriend feels like a complete failure. I just went out today completely on my own and it felt so devastating. I feel like a complete loser and don't know how I should change this :(

Is here anyone who managed to find a solution? As I said above, college and work were and are completely useles for me. I have no friend circle and no sister/brother I could hangout :(",2022-10-08 18:58:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618259221,9,/r/lonely/comments/xz0lbu/26_male_no_friends_no_girlfriend_completely_alone/,,0,1,"26 (male), no friends, no girlfriend, completely alone :("

1557,xz1nj7,everybodyhateNate,"2 weeks ago I joined a social group. I was happy at the end of it, I felt like I was finally going to socialize for once.

Weeks go by and plans to meet again keep cancelling. Another week of loneliness, by myself as always. Tired of it.

I go everywhere by myself, do everything alone. Go to events by myself. All I want is someone. I'm finally trying to put myself out there, but it's failing as always. it seems like loneliness is my destiny, no matter what I do I can't seem to find people my age to interact with.

Images of suicide and self harm are becoming more and more prevelant in my mind. Why do I still feel the glimmer of hope that keeps me living? I'll die alone. That's just me being real, whenever I get some sort of hope it gets shut down, destroyed. This has happened countless times in my life. What makes me think my whole life won't be like this? Why do I get my hopes up so easily? Why don't I just kill myself? There's nothing that I'll be missing out on, truthfully.",2022-10-08 19:43:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658007394,6,/r/lonely/comments/xz1nj7/born_to_be_lonely/,,0,3,born to be lonely
1558,xz1os0,InterestingIdeaBut,"Throw away account and I'm sorry for any insane ramblings. Not only am I bad at expressing myself in any capacity, but I'm at my wits end. This does contain a lot of self hatred, please be warned.

I'm a very private and reclusive person, very ""weird"" and socially inept. Failing as a (young) adult. I have my entire life found it very hard to connect and feel comfortable around people. My self esteem has been shot since I was very young. I had a weirdly messy breakup with my girlfriend months ago, and as much as I have come back from my deeply ""''blind"""""" terrible mental state, I still can't get over it. I lost most of my friends with that breakup. The friends I have left I hardly feel I can connect with the same way and often I feel as though I hate them. But I don't. They're uncomfortable but they were there for me financially. I feel a sense of obligation towards them. It's immature to simply drop them just because.

There are more things that have happened throughout my life and just the past year alone. But I don't want to talk about them and I see no point. This sub is for loneliness anyway.

Logically I already know ""I'm not that bad of a person"". I've not committed heinous crimes or anything. I try to be nice and friendly. But I just can't help but feel so awful about myself everyday. I want friends, I want people I can feel close and comfortable with again. I want people I can talk hours about the media we like and each have our own unique favorite things. Creating stories and playing games and actually having fun. Not pulling teeth to do anything together or feeling like I'm not allowed to be good at a game.

But I'm such an angry person, I'm such a flake, I'm so lazy, I'm weak minded, and stupid. I can't do anything right and I fail at being responsible. I hardly like talking in voice calls or meeting in person. Physically, activities are limited for me.

At a distance, I find people so... Cool. Amazing. Beautiful. Fantastic. Why must I hate them every time I try to talk with others? Or they try to talk to me? Why do insult and mock and cringe at others? Why can't I just accept differences? Not just big differences, small ones too! Why can't I be a better and more productive person? Why can't I be likable? Why do I find people so fucking obnoxious and such hard work? I don't want that. I want to like people. I do like people. But why must I hate them being close? Perceiving me? Why do I feel so alone and misunderstood all the time? Why does it matter if I'm not fully understood?

Should I care about other peoples feelings? What's good and wrong? I always feel judged. I'm too much of an on the fence person. I'm sorry to all those who liked me at all. I am. I'm so alone and I want to be friends and together with the people I lost, but I know we shouldn't. It's not healthy for any of us. I'm so upset and alone and angry at myself and the world constantly.

I want to be a better person and make other peoples lives better. I don't want to hurt others anymore. I'm just hoping the future holds better things.",2022-10-08 19:44:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/xz1os0/i_hate_people_and_i_dont_want_to/,,0,0,I hate people and I don't want to

1561,xz1siu,103ndj,I dont know what is going on with me. Even though I've moved on and am over my first love the emotional scars still haunt me of seeing him love someone else. Part of this was self sabotage I will admit. Nomatter how much time has passed I still seem to get the same pit in my stomach I used to. I ruminate about him when I'm bored and I'm afraid I'll always be stuck on him and the pain will always stay with me. It's not as bad as it used to be but still is a harsh reality to come to terms with that I wasn't chosen or wanted. He treated me bad but can treat the girlfriend he's been with for years so good. I don't think I'll ever be able to love someone to the same capacity and the feelings I get will never be as intense as they were for him which means less pain if I got rejected but it will never be the same because of how he hurt me. Nobody wants me romantically and even if they did I don't know if I'd be able to feel anything for them. I've barely felt anything for anyone and haven't caught feelings that were that serious since him. I'm numb and so the opportunity for any type of reciprocation seems to be a dead end idea. I cannot imagine myself with anyone. I've never dated anyone before. Considering who I am and how pain has effected me I wouldn't be surprised. Now I'm more defensive and guarded and I'll never find love that pure ever again because now it's tainted and no good anymore. I have moments I'm good without him and don't think of him at all. The longest I've gone was months but it always creeps its way back and comes back to haunt me. I can't connect with people like I used to and it's making me think I'll be alone forever and no one will ever really pursue or want me. No one's ever wanted me because if they wanted to they would. Why am I not worth it? Why can't I mean anything to anyone? I try to tell myself I don't need anyone either or want anyone but it comes back around and bites me in the ass.,2022-10-08 19:48:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587248219,3,/r/lonely/comments/xz1siu/im_probably_just_lonely_we_didnt_even_date/,,0,1,I'm probably just lonely.

Problem is im 38, no experience whatsoever. I have never known any women in person im interested in. I know it sounds shallow but i cant let the whole fit muscular thing go.  Im just not physically into ‚Äúnormal‚Äù women and always kind of thought that it does matter to be attracted to someone.

Im also depressed and overweight. I think being alone my life has damaged me in some ways. I try to get fit but feel like i never will find a woman im interested in who responds so i get discouraged and give up. Know people say do it for you but trust me its far easier to say that than feel it. I know a fat man liking fit women is weird so i try to better myself.

I dont know anyone around me into this stuff. I see women online but either are taken or dont respond.  I have two  goals, to get fit and meet a fit woman into lifting etc maybe someone who could even help me.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I feel so desperately alone sometimes and despairing that i feel down and resentful when i see other guys living a life id have loved with a woman id have loved to be with. I try not to but its hard even after therapy. Im also on meds for depression and feel like people run a mile when i tell them and dont want to hide it even if its cost me a lot.

1580,xz4244,anonymous14006430,"I hope someone will take the time to read this since I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to anyone else. For background, I‚Äôm female and a junior in high school, I was diagnosed with depression and I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for a few months. I see a psychiatrist regularly and a therapist only sometimes because I don‚Äôt like going. Initially I wanted a male therapist, and I still do, but the place I go to only offers female therapists. 

When I was little my mom and I moved states, so I don‚Äôt see my family often. A few years prior, my dad died by shooting himself after shooting up a law firm (of course I didn‚Äôt know that until I was a bit older) and by then my mom and dad were already divorced. Since we moved my mom had a few different boyfriends, but that didn‚Äôt bother me because I was little and didn‚Äôt really understand. I‚Äôm unsure of whether it bothers me now since I wasn‚Äôt too attached to any of them. That doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt like them though. When she broke up with her previous boyfriend whom she had the longest relationship with, I wasn‚Äôt sad. Of course I wasn‚Äôt happy either, but to me it was just something that happened. I find that strange, and I also feel a little guilty. My mom has had another boyfriend for a few years now, and I like him. But for some reason I‚Äôve been feeling even more lonely with him around. To me it feels like he‚Äôs just my mom‚Äôs boyfriend, rather than my dad. Maybe that doesn‚Äôt make sense to say because he really is her boyfriend and not my dad‚Ä¶but in other words, I don‚Äôt feel a father-daughter connection with him. So, it always seems like my mom is in a relationship and I‚Äôm just on the side, even though they include me. It makes me feel sad and lonely. He and my mom get to feel connected because they‚Äôre in a relationship, while I don‚Äôt get to feel anything. I feel repulsed seeing them kiss or hold hands because I don‚Äôt have anyone to love me that way. I feel guilty for being jealous of my own parents‚Äô relationship because I don‚Äôt think I should be. But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even have friends at school to talk to, no one to tell how I feel, and no family to spend time with because I don‚Äôt see them often. I feel disconnected from my family. The last time I visited them I didn‚Äôt get along with them too well because of how I‚Äôve changed, and it made them upset. I just gave them a hard time. I could tell that they continued on with their lives just well without me while I‚Äôd been living away from them. When I was there I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. I feel like I don‚Äôt even fit in with my own family anymore, and that I‚Äôm not even part of my family. I feel lonely in every aspect of my life: friendships, relationships, family.

I started having trouble making friends in middle school. I became shy, only talked when I had to, and ate lunch by myself. All throughout middle and high school I‚Äôve been this way. I would love to have someone to talk to and hang out with, but at the same time I‚Äôm so used to being by myself that I‚Äôm uncomfortable doing anything else. I don‚Äôt even see myself being close friends with anyone at school because they are all lively and energetic, while I‚Äôm just quiet and emotionally flat. I‚Äôve tried making online friends too, but it‚Äôs hard to connect with people my age when I‚Äôm not similar to them, and a lot of them just turn out to be perverts who want something sexual or weird. The internet isn‚Äôt a good place to find friends at my age. So every new school year I hope that I‚Äôll meet someone but I never do. I hope to meet someone at college since I‚Äôm graduating as a junior and going to college early, but then again I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just like high school: I‚Äôll just be going to class then going home. 

To cope I have an imaginary friend (I understand he isn‚Äôt real, and I can‚Äôt actually see or hear him). When I cry I always hug a pillow and pretend it‚Äôs him, and it helps me a lot. He comforts me and reassures me that it will be okay. Other times when I cry I pretend it‚Äôs my dad comforting me, and I hold his fingerprint in my hand. My Imaginary friend comforts me, gives me advice, and combats my negative thoughts. I think deep down I already know everything he tells me, but I need someone else to tell it to me. He also just keeps my company whenever I feel alone, and no words have to be said. I would never tell my therapist or anyone that I have an imaginary friend because I feel embarrassed and weird. 

A few years ago I started cutting myself to express how I felt because I didn‚Äôt have anyone to express myself to. But recently I‚Äôve been doing better and my parents say they see improvements. I haven‚Äôt cut myself in 4 months but I still fight urges. I still feel very lonely too. I don‚Äôt tell anyone that I‚Äôm still hurting, not my parents, psychiatrist or therapist. I‚Äôm just getting a bit tired of it all. It‚Äôs just easier to say that I‚Äôm okay. I just try to get through it and hope that one day I‚Äôll find the right people and make friends.",2022-10-08 21:25:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/xz4244/loneliness/,,0,9,Loneliness

1585,xz4ncg,brandon19308,"I say that as if I have friends in the first place. It's such a pain in the ass having obscure interests in games and activities and whatever, and not having anyone to do any of it with. And the science around it is what's the worst.

Sure, I could go online and make a post. I could advertise that I'm looking for someone to do a playthrough of this game with and whatnot. But it doesn't always yield what you think it would, chances are it just yields another entity for you to quietly game with. You just play, you hardly talk, even if you do you'll realize you don't mix with the other person... It sucks. Ultimately there's no point in grouping up with them, you're hardly interacting anyways.

The kinds of bonds one needs are ones that just happen ambiently. They fall into place and it's hard to figure out what exactly triggers them, most of the time it's by sheer chance. I'll watch something like old school game grumps with Jon and Arin and think, man, how in the fuck do you form a bond like this with someone, and just do whatever both wants and have a blast doing it...?

And mentioning shit like Discord servers doesn't have much merit. If you're a socially anxious loser like myself, don't bother. In the end there's always a hierarchy of importance people have in those places which always seems to drown everything else out. That person's the funny/witty one, that person's the one who has a cool skill, that one has a quirk everyone's attached to like glue. And all the others are stuck in an unending and exhausting battle to out-humor each other with memes and absurdism.

Maybe that's a shit ton of insecurity and projection coming from me, I don't know. All I know is it sucks feeling ingenuine, and like nobody around is genuine either. Like there's no chance to find someone who clicks with you and your obscure interests, someone who'd want to play that game with you that barely anyone would want to fucking play, someone who would actually relate with you, find you funny and vice versa.

I try to ignore this shit to the best of my ability, and be content with being alone... But hell if it doesn't kick up sometimes enough for me to punch a wall repeatedly, wanting to off myself instead cause I wasn't born to be a witty and fun person who anyone would want to be around.",2022-10-08 21:51:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582106018,31,/r/lonely/comments/xz4ncg/not_having_any_friends_with_shared_interests/,,0,1,Not having any friends with shared interests really sucks.

1587,xz53wr,OverwhelmDepression,"I've never had any romantic relationship ever, and very few friendships.

I used to get really depressed at this idea but now, I'm not sure I really care anymore.
Like I feel like I would enjoy a relationship to some extent but at the same time, it would probably just be a hassle... I've come to enjoy spending my time alone doing what I want when I want, which I feel like a relationship would rob me of that.
I also don't like how a lot of people behave, like everyone I meet seems and acts like a selfish asshole. It's like everyone will hurt you if they can benefit from it.
I also feel like not a lot of people will understand me and how I think and behave, I usually keep to myself or stay at home for months at a time playing video games and I know it's not really appealing for a lot of people but I don't really want to change that, that's what makes me happy.

I just don't really see the benefits from a relationship aside from the intimacy. 
At the same time I want to experience it but I'm not sure how. 
As I said I've never had a relationship before a d I don't know how I would get one.

1593,xz6cnk,111st1cky111,"Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing things correctly. Like being in your 20's is awesome, but there's a major twist to how we think when we're this young and it's really about.. like the question of becoming more of ""I might be doing things wrong but at least I've got the support I need and I'm still trying""

I really beg to wonder why I overthink every god damn academic decision. I literally got shamed for living 30 minutes away from community college and ""wasting gas"" to drive there when I can just take it online as if I'm not allowed to take the liberty and take a damn class if I want to, and also told I'm going to get ""held back"" for taking only two courses when I'm unable to take more because they don't offer the courses right now, and they believe it's B.S.

It drives me insane to think like this, and I.. I think I just need to let it out. For some reason sharing this on the internet means that I can relate with my rage possibly.

I don't even know if it's about these specific things but maybe there's something about being in your 20's that makes you think everything you're doing is a felony and you're screwed if one thing doesn't work because you're too busy looking ahead because you barely have anything to look back at, not even sure.

It‚Äôs still a brand new channel so look forward to more content in the near future! We‚Äôd also appreciate any ideas you have on what our next video should be about.

Everyone's turned their backs on me pretty much.

I've  been so lonely for the past 3-5 years. I've been dealing with being so  sick both mentally and physically and disabled and living alone with no  benefits for the last 3 years. Dealing with literally everything on my  own, every crash, struggling with money so much, crying to myself, not  talking to anyone because it just makes me feel worse.

I've been so mentally ill for the past 9+ years

I've been dealing with chronic pain for 5 years, chronic fatigue for 3. And other stuff too.

I  know this is the end. I can't do it anymore. I've reached out to so  many people but I just felt so much worse afterwards after seeing how  they really don't help or say I'm a burden to the person that it afects  me the most to talk to.

I just feel so wrecked inside. So damaged. So alone. Like in so much pain in this last moment.

I  wish I had never called him or any of the other people and just killed  myself right away. Now I have to deal with the heartache of being  rejected, called a burden, not taking seriously.

I  attempted a bit over a month ago and I feel like this is it I'm gonna  go now. I just can't. I'm so heartbroken and I just feel worse than I  did a month ago before attempting. I don't have any more energy.

Im left sitting here unable to deal with my emotions where no one is able to understand. I have a therapist but I can‚Äôt even get an appointment till the end of the month. I‚Äôm unable to speak to my family because they sound so uninterested since they have their own problems to deal with and the lest thing I want is to put my issues on them. I moved to a whole knew state and I can‚Äôt even get one of my family members to come out here not even for a weekend. why am I the one that has to constantly deal with not having a single person in my life stay, what am I doing wrong? Are people upset with what I say because I‚Äôm so blunt and honest? Am I to weird? Do I over share to much? I don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôve tried so hard to fit in just to make a friend but they can‚Äôt even message me back instead they block me. Am
I looking in the wrong places? Fuck sake why do I care so much about having a friend it‚Äôs sickening and exhausting. My boyfriend has such an easy influence on people where they just get drawn to him just by a glance he knows so many people he has friends that he‚Äôs known for years he tells me that his friends are my friends to but I told him ‚Äúwould they be willing to go out with me without you, would they even text me‚Äù he looked at me with a blank expression on his face ‚Äúno they wouldn‚Äôt‚Äù see I have no one to call my friend even when I get close make one it turns around and becomes a bad one they either stop talking to me or they talk behind my back, they can‚Äôt even tell me why they stopped talking to me. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a mother of two and don‚Äôt have time to do single peoples activities, I don‚Äôt know what it is I guess I‚Äôll never know. It‚Äôs a lonely world that I‚Äôm living in.",2022-10-09 01:49:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/xz9jmk/lonely/,,0,1,Lonely
1613,xz9o2w,Extreme-Logical,"I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and act like life is over for me. However, it‚Äôs nights like these that a sinking feeling sets in. Let me explain

I‚Äôm in college, my senior year. I‚Äôve always prided myself on making quality friends over striving for quantity. That‚Äôs not to say that I have few friends though. I just have few friends that I‚Äôd genuinely spend time alone with. I also work at a news station on the night shift meaning I get home at 1am Thursdays through Saturdays. This has made my social life kind of non-existent. I come home every night thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the chance to hang out with friends eventually‚Äù keeping myself from longing for more. Tonight I got that chance! Home at 7:30 and my immediate thought is to hop on some games with some friends from back home. Suddenly they have to go and I‚Äôm now left with the task of finding something to do.

I sit alone, wondering who I‚Äôll call or what I‚Äôd even do. I don‚Äôt play video games unless it‚Äôs with friends. At the same time, I‚Äôm thinking that I should call someone and go out, but no one comes to mind. Slowly I realize I have no one at this current point in my life that I can contact and share a genuine fun time with. I feel like I‚Äôm lying to myself constantly about how happy I am.

Any advice? I exercise regularly (have asked people if they want to join me, but always no). I eat healthy too. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed‚Ä¶ just that on nights where I have the opportunity to socialize I constantly fail to find someone to hang with. 

Quick note: I work night shift because I work sports department and games are usually 7pm and our news time slot is at 11pm. Of course, my friend from back home are genuinely my best friends, but as we get older, we have and less time to do things like play video games or even hang out. I have family of course, but we don‚Äôt really ‚Äúhang out‚Äù let alone call each other and what not.",2022-10-09 01:56:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595101449,3,/r/lonely/comments/xz9o2w/realizing_i_have_no_one_at_this_current_point_in/,,0,0,Realizing I have no one at this current point in life

1620,xza1kq,[deleted],"It has been several years since I've had a solid penpal, which is honestly a shame because I really enjoy getting to know someone and just having that partnership that comes through writing with someone. I'm now on a quest for someone who is funny, open, honest, doesn't hold back, isn't afraid to write a lot, and just someone ultimate in general. Are you that person? I'm open to either email or letters. The speed of emails is certainly a perk, but there is just something special about writing a letter to someone. I'm open to anyone in the US, but bonus points if you are in Oklahoma, as I'm new to the state. Having that person to laugh with, cry with, vent too, celebrate with, is always a bonus no matter what is going on in your life. There is that joy that comes when you get that email or letter from them. I remember that from years ago and I want to feel that feeling again.

A bit about me...as my profile name suggests I'm a collector of stories. I like to learn about people and their life and what they have gone through. I think part of that comes from a desire to get to know people at a deeper level, but some of that too is my creative and writing brain that absorbs people's stories for ideas of my own. I'm also a nerd. If you would love to chat or write while we play Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, or any of my 100s of Steam games I've never played but own...I'm down. I enjoy role playing and writing, watching random shows on TV/streaming \[especially if I'm watching them with someone else\], and I'm always down to read a book, program in Python, or sing at the top of my lungs in the car with the windows down.

Hopefully this all resonates with someone. I just want to jump head first into writing with someone no matter what is going on in your life. Bring it to the table and lets talk about it big or small. The good and the bad! All I ask if you be willing to be open and honest about yourself, who you are, and what you are going through. I will do the same! Let me know what you think in terms of email or letter land and I can't wait to get to know you!",2022-10-09 02:15:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/xza1kq/hoping_for_the_ultimate_friendship/,,0,0,Hoping For The Ultimate Friendship

1641,xzc93z,Internal_Big_9731,"trigger warnings: depression and grooming

i am a 17 year old female.

i have never had friends as a kid. especially when i hit the 4th grade. everyone was talking about their crushes as i was questioning the existence of god. i always knew that i was weird and never fit in, it bothered me a lot. i was bullied for never thinking the same way as my peers. my older brother was popular in school, well-liked, and everyone loved him. my parents got this idea in my head that i needed to be more like him and popular. i tried. i wanted people to like me, once i realized that no one in school was going to give me that statisfaction, i tried to make friends online which subjected me to a lot of grooming. whats disgusting is, getting groomed didn't bother me one bit as i wanted someone to pay attention to me and like me.

i ate alone at lunch which made my depression way more worse than it needed to be. i began to eat lunch with my vice-principal in her office and if she wasn't there, i would eat with the school's counselor which caused me to get homeschooled in the 7th &amp; 8th grade. my only friends were teachers. i stopped going to school completely in the 9th grade when i lost all my teacher friends in the middle school, and none of the teachers in the high school seemed to realize that something was wrong with me. (i tried high school to see if it was any better. it wasnt.)

i recently got my GED and started college a whole year before everyone else. and i find myself in the same predicament. im only friends with professors. i just cant seem to connect with people my age. i know college is more lowkey than middle and high school and no one really cares about making friends but i got a job at the library &amp; the first person people see when they walk is me. i only the job to help my friend making. i tried to be friends with people. im only good at talking to people online.  im weird, awkward, and socially inept. school is supposed to help you gain those social skills for the future but i never learned any because no one wanted to talk to me. i was socially outcasted and i still am. the weird kids didn't even want to talk to me.

i just don't get it. i looked at peoples friend group and tried to change everything about myself to fit it but it never worked. im a fairly attractive person, i get complimented for my looks all of the time. i have a weird style and i like to express myself for who i am. but my style is fairly popular on tiktok and im not the only one with it. so on the outside im normal. but for some reason, that i don't know what, im not normal on the inside?

i only have one friend and she lives across the ocean. and the other friend is in my head &amp; my dog (which im very unhealthy attached too. i cant be away from my dog for a whole day) i blame my parents for having me, i wish they didn't, life would be less lonely if i never knew what lonely was.",2022-10-09 04:16:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660513141,4,/r/lonely/comments/xzc93z/i_wish_that_i_was_not_so_alone_rant/,,0,1,i wish that i was not so alone.

1668,xzfdtp,[deleted],"I still live with my parents cause I'm still in high school and we have a pretty good relationship so it's not like I'm wanting to move out anytime soon. 
The problem is that my parents constantly tell me that I'm lonely because I have no friends and that I should contact some of the people I used to be friends with or people I recently got to know (I moved during summer and changed school). 
They keep telling me that I'm lonely and have no friends because I told them that like a year ago when I was kinda depressed. Now they think that I still have all these problems, even though I told them many times that I'm fine. Sure it would be nice to have friends or interesting people to chat with but I'm too stressed with school right now that I just don't have any energy and literally can not think of anything else than school.
I understand that they're worried about me but it's still really annoying that someone keeps telling you that you're lonely almost all the time and if they keep telling me this, I'll probably get even more lonely. Right now I'm just not interested in making friends and I also don't have the courage to text people I know because no one ever texts me (ever).
Yesterday they said that I have to send a message to at least 3 places (group chat or just someone directly). I always write the message and then decide not to send it. What is wrong with me? Why the hell can't I just send something? I'm not even lonely anymore so why should I bother? Because my parents said so?

1671,xzfxlz,solstizio89,"(33M) It's Sunday today and I don't feel doing anything. Saturdays and Sundays are always the worst days of the week because I don't have to work and I don't know how to fill those hours. They are supposed to be relaxing days, full of joy, for the others. I have very few friends, almost nobody to go out with. The few have their life and we don't talk too much. One of them invited me last week to show me his new house with his gf, I was very happy he invited me but at the end I compared his perfect life to mine and I was sad. I have no gf, nobody to meet and I work full remote. So in these days I always feel a social failure. What I do is go to the beach for walking or running, walk walk walk for kilometers until I get bored. I would like to do so many things with someone... But I can't. I would like to talk and listen to somebody and feel part of a group of friends, traveling together and laugh... I started go the the gym during the week, sometimes I speak to somebody for a little but nothing important. I wish I was more confident about myself to change things and I always wait for that day to come. But I feel like games are already done and I will be alone for the rest of my life.

1688,xziluk,TracedHavoc,"The past few years have been rough for me, socially. Since graduating high school, my life has been a story of falling out with old friends and failing to sustain new ones.

Whether its because I am to akward to keep company or too weak in my attempts to maintain relationships, I don't know. I didn't know as I lost contact one by one with the friends I'd known since middle school who now treat me like an exotic stranger and avoid my attempts to re-enter their circle. And I still don't know today as one my nearest and dearest friends who has largely kept me going gravitates away from me in favor of a potential love interest and another one retreats from me almost entirely to seldom be heard from again.

In every relationship, it just feels like I'm the reacher--the guy who offers his hand only for it to be left hanging sooner or later. Rarely is the slighest bit of interest I show in others seriously reciprocated, and when it is, there's always something that comes along to fuck everything up and dash my hopes once again.

I'm tired of being let down. I just want to close myself off and live for myself instead of constantly trying to find someone else to live for.

another one of my friends commented that it was ""sad"" because only 3 friends coming to celebrate my 18th birthday wouldn't be that special and i actually agree. because of the 1 for 1 promotion, i'm scrambling to find an even number of people to go. some of them complained about the price of the place ($40+ per person after the offer which is considered pretty cheap for a buffet) so i was panicking and stressing out the whole trip home from work, trying to find cheaper alternatives to eat at for my birthday. not to mention that i can't cancel it now bc one of them cancelled their plans for me (which i really appreciate) and the other two agreed immediately at the start because of the cheap buffet. what makes me feel even shittier is the fact that this whole buffet plan was my mom's plan to eat with me but i declined her just to eat with my work friends. she even told me about this buffet promotion so that i can celebrate with my friends but the majority of them can't even come. i want to cry now lol i feel fucking shitty and like such a bad daughter.

(some extra background info: on my 12th birthday, i threw a party and invited like over 10 of my friends to come but only one came. i kid u not, only one friend came. i think ever since, i had this ""trauma"" or fear of celebrating birthdays with friends bc i was scared that they might not want to go or would kind of ""abandon"" me. guess after 6 years, it's still happening.)",2022-10-09 12:40:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622307611,2,/r/lonely/comments/xzkpaa/a_little_sad_about_my_birthday_plans/,,1,1,a little sad about my birthday plans

I realised that actually i'm attracted to these people, because they give the illusion of connection when in reality they just take what they want from you when they need it and discard you in the end. So naturally i assumed she was the only issue in my life and got rid of her after years of trying to make it work. I tried to talk to family and friends about it, but then i realised a lot of them shared the same traits as my ex too. Now i've kinda realised i've got no meaningful connections with anyone at all and i've always felt lonely, even with people i was considering my friends.   


This week in my extremely low state, i went on a crusade of confronting everyone who was not prioritising me, who i considered close friends. Basically i just got ghosted, downplayed or they defended their actions.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

1726,xzp3s9,Mean-Discussion5221,"I'm 17 (f) I am extremely alone in my life. I've recently lost one of my good friends. They're the complete opposite from what i am. We've been friends for 4-5 years. But I guess this year is thelast. It tears me apart.

To know that everyone is moving ahead in life, it only makes me more miserable. I hate who I am today. I never go outside, I never got to spend my years doing things, I know I will regret that when I'm older. I am depressed and pessimistic. I am selfish. I feel incompetent to be in other's lives. I've never worked, and I stopped going to school. I am capable of getting good grades, but I could never keep going... I would be alone at school, I would feel this dread knowing that people have friends, and get to enjoy things with them. Knowing that my friend is out, doing better than I am. I wish I was too, capable, if I was, I could be with them again. Everyone is getting older but I am only getting smaller as time goes by. 

I am sad enough....to look at my ex and see him having friends. He never used to, when I was with him. He's pushing himself to be better. I can't help but look at myself with disgust. It's a foolish thing. It's like I look at others whose happy, and it immediately makes me miserable. That's what I hate about myself. I am pretty toxic, which is why my friend decided it was over between us. Him too, he left me because I was too much. That I made him unhappy. Maybe I just made him like that.  I don't know if I'll ever see myself better than this. It feels that I just want it to end. That I just want to give up. 

I just wish I was competent enough to be the person I wish to be. In my life, everyone looks at me differently. They see nothing special about me, they see me and acknowledge that I am not a threat. I feel awful just being ..alive. I am extremely quiet, that it unsettles people, some may even forget I am around. I keep to myself a lot. 

When I'm at home, I can feel my family attacks me indirectly by calling me a ghost. Awhile telling others that too. I can feel that they look at me as if I'm lazy and a hermit. I wish I could outside and be of help to them. I wish I was more like my friend, I know that'd do anything to help others. They're more mature and more of an adult than I am. 

I have younger brothers and sowmtimws I feel useless, brcause I am their big sister, yet I never do anything to help. Like taking them to school... I feel pathetic. I wish I haven't grown into this kind of person. Honestly... idk what to do anymore. I am extremely lonely and it takes over most of the time. I end up crying in my room, because I think of this shit. .. But one thing I know, is that I am unique. I try and take in things like that. But can't hide the fact they're things about me, that need work. And I'll have no one in my life truthfully, without fixing who I am.

1727,xzpdjn,KaiserKyre,"I am going to use this post as a personal platform to vent and talk about my feelings. I feel like I have to share this with someone, but I do not want to burden my friends with my thoughts so I guess the random people of Reddit are my best option. Feel free to ignore this post, or share your own stories if you feel like that would help.

We broke up with my ex-girlfriend almost exactly one year ago. It was a mutual decision as we felt like things were not working anymore and we weren't making each other happy. The relationship felt more like a burden than anything. We spent exactly 3 years together, we split up one week after our third anniversary. We were the first for each other, when we met, I was 18 and she was 16. It was an amazing three years that we had together and I still cherish a lot of memories from those times. We managed to have a consensual break up so there is no bad blood between us, but we do not keep contact with each other, we both moved on to greener pastures. 

It's been one year since then. In this one year I had my fair share of shorter, not so serious relationship with other girls, rejections, being put in the friend zone, etc. so I managed to gather some experience of what's it's like being single in my early 20's. After one year of not having a serious relationship, I have to admit, I miss it very much. I do not miss my ex-girlfriend, I just miss the feeling of love and security that she gave me. I want to find another girl with whom I could have these feelings with again, one I could love and she could also love me. But as time goes on, my hope is fading and my desperation grows. I know what you may be thinking right now, I am only 22, I have so much time left to find somebody. I know that it's true, I get it many times from friends, but honestly it doesn't make me feel better or calmer, because I cannot believe in it anymore. I have heard so many cliches from friends that I grew sick of them, even though I know they are probably right and I am  putting to much focus on this problem. 

I have amazing friends who are there to support me and give me company, but it does not feel the same. I miss being loved, I miss watching a movie with somebody I love, I miss just laying in bed not doing anything and yet being extremely happy because that special someone is there with you, and just the sheer fact of them being in the same room giving you unimaginable and undescribable happiness. This emptiness makes my heart ache and even though I try talking about it and I try my best to find somebody in my life, it's making my life miserable sometimes. I just miss having someone to be there for me and it hurts that I cannot love anyone (romantically). 

So yeah. Being alone sucks. I know that other people might have it much worse in this sub than me, but this looked like the best place to share my thoughts. Thank your for the opportunity and I hope all of you have an amazing day.",2022-10-09 16:11:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1557081443,8,/r/lonely/comments/xzpdjn/i_miss_being_in_a_relationship/,,0,3,I miss being in a relationship

1747,xzsgxi,memesgoddest,"Hello, I 20M never made a friend because I do not know how to keep a conversation. Not even in school. I feel like a have wasted my life by being an extreme introvert. I have never ever gone out with anybody except for my direct family members a handful amount of times which I believe didn't give me any experience in life and I have zero stories that happened in my life to hold a conversation. For example, I watch youtube videos of people meeting other people and always have something or a story to tell about themselves which leads to a conversation in my case is that I literally have nothing to say except that I trade crypto and make a living from it plus I'm an extreme introvert which never leads to a conversation. It's been 4 months since I ever talked to someone in real life from family to strangers. Yes I feel extremely lonely and cry sometimes late at night and I hate to admit it but I put a pillow on a chair and hug it just to feel something. I've been hitting the gym for the past 4 years for around 2 hours per day consistently which made me look fit and what some would call attractive which makes me confident in myself but still doesn't help with holding a conversation. I usually hop on Omegle after some workouts and nearly every guy and girl smiles and tries to flirt and tell me I'm handsome and try to know me better but not even a minute in they either skip me because I'm dry, not interesting, look like you're gonna kill me or I stutter and they get scared. I wish I have a woman or girlfriend or even a guy beside me but I would feel bad because of how quiet I am or how dry my conversations would be with her or her family even though as a 20 year old I make multiple 6 figures per year. I think I might die of old age alone in a mansion and no one would find me until my utility bill is overdue. I don't know what to do.

1750,xztdbl,lesbereallads,"We were best friends for 4 years and she slowly ghosted me for months for absolutely no reason. She stood me up every week when we made plans, just wouldn‚Äôt show. She sent me videos of her out with all her new friends whilst I lay alone in my house. She knew I was lonely, she knew she was all I had. And then she left. I was always there for her, we were like platonic soulmates. We were just so similar. But she was pretty, and she got all the attention, and eventually she started bragging about it. She loved that everyone wanted her and I was a loser. All she talked about when we last spoke was getting with people, cheating on her boyfriend and everyone loving her anyway.

But I miss her so much. This day last year we were at a concert together. We had a similar music taste. I remember when I was over getting some merch, she held our place in the queue and I overheard her speaking with people in front of us. She told them how we met and how lucky she was to have me. She said I was beautiful and talented and the best friend in the world. I miss her laugh, I miss singing with her, getting high, getting drunk. I miss her family. They treated me more like a daughter than mine do. They took me out for dinner, gave me chocolates on Easter and Halloween. My first real friend, left me the same as everyone else. We were supposed to move to london together last month. I moved alone, she wanted to stay a student and not leave so flunked college. I wish she‚Äôd let me know how she is.

1792,xzylpg,[deleted],"Sorry if this is filled with a boatload of emotions. I just want a place to vent and what better place than Reddit? 

For reference, I am a 20M. 

I went home from work last night and dinner with a friend. After I got home and played video games with my friends, I went to bed and I felt so damn alone. Obviously not literally alone, as I still live with my parents. But more emotionally and mentally. I literally had to use my pillow to snuggle and hug it to feel loved and wanted.

I want to have a girlfriend to share memories with me. I want someone to cuddle and snuggle and kiss and hug when the days get shitty. I know that probably sounds selfish but it is just the way I feel. I will treat my woman with as much love and respect as she gives me. I just want someone to be with me and someone I can be with.

I am obviously loved by 2 parents and my friends, but I am not starved of platonic love, but rather romantic love. Someone to be intimate with. Someone to laugh, cry, smile, and have fun with. 

I am speaking to a girl in a college class but I have no idea how that's going to go. I have no idea how to proceed. There's this itching feeling inside me that she doesn't like me back, but I could be reading into it too much. She seems so cool to be around, and she seems kind and compassionate and caring (keyword seems). 

I see a lot of people in my work coming in with their girlfriends, along with a lot of people on social media with their significant others. I am not jealous. In fact, I am happy for them and I am glad they are happy with someone to care for and someone to love them. But I can't help but wish I was like them. Someone to love them and someone to love through all the ups and downs and lefts and rights. 

I've always wanted to travel the world, and it seems fun to go at it alone, but even better with someone to do it with. Spending time alone is cool, but someone to spend time with, especially a romantic partner, seems awesome. I wish I could get that. 

I don't know. I had a few love interests in high school but none of them panned out. At this point, it seems like wishful thinking that I can get a woman to love me and someone I can love eternally. I have read online that it will get better but I don't know. I feel like college is my last chance to meet someone.

And frail, cold arms always dangling to the side.

On a pillar of excuses, they distance themselves.

With their nose buried in pages, or their eyes fixated on screens...

Time, like grains of sand slips through their fingers.

Look at their face.

Stuck in delusion,

They'll wake up and do the same thing again.

1860,y04idw,Pale_Activity_1206,"I want to start this off by saying that I‚Äôm cogniscent that most of what I‚Äôm experiencing is based in trauma and failure to grow emotional health, and that the shame I‚Äôm stricken with far outweighs any real or perceived physical/personality deficits, I truly do usually believe that I‚Äôm overall a pretty likeable person and that I‚Äôm not so unattractive that it is what impedes finding a girlfriend. My irrational fears, bad past relationships, low self esteem, and tendency to overthink any situation involving a girls perception of me/ being attracted to me are all far bigger barriers that I still haven‚Äôt been able to work through. Being on mdma and connecting with a girl randomly last night helped reframe some of my self perceptions, but today has been distinctly hard to accept that I‚Äôm capable of finding love. 

 So last night I went to a rave with some friends, and almost the entire group ended up dropping some mdma, I‚Äôve rolled before but it‚Äôs been a few years now, and I‚Äôve been relatively sober for quite a while outside the occasional drink and very one-off use of blow or cannabis. I was worried my medication would affect my roll (on an antidepressant, but not an ssri), and it might‚Äôve been a bit less strong but it was a good high regardless. Anyway my group brought a few girls (didn‚Äôt know any of them) and somehow some way I got pretty attached to one of said girls, it felt really good to have a person holding my hand or snuggling on my shoulder, and i think a big part of what I‚Äôm experiencing today is that I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend in a long time (that includes hookups, I usually am just too terrified of the entire mess and I‚Äôve basically given up at this point just letting things play out).

I had a really bad breakup probably 2-3 years ago now, way back in freshman year of college, and ever since that relationship I‚Äôve just had a lot more trouble connecting with girls on an emotional level, but it‚Äôs been something that‚Äôs regularly on my mind and I can sometimes get in a slump for a day thinking about it, I definitely have attachment issues and deep rooted insecurity about being loved. I‚Äôve tried to work through things in therapy and was even in an intensive program for a plethora of issues I won‚Äôt go in depth into, but by and large it‚Äôs really helped and I‚Äôve felt far more myself recently than in past years. 

To be honest the night feels like a dream- I‚Äôm not too sure how to explain what I‚Äôm getting at exactly but I‚Äôve never felt more socially ok than on this roll (have kinda bad social anxiety usually) but my brain finally shut off and talking and interacting with people just felt really easy, and I guess that extended to even opening myself up a bit and letting myself get caught up in a passionate albeit very temporary attraction, which I haven‚Äôt felt in quite a while; there were moments where literally nothing existed but her and me, not something I‚Äôm used to. Nothing physical (in terms of sex or anything) ended up happening, but I think the roll made me dig far deeper into the issues I have regarding relationships, and even with the ridiculous confidence I got from Molly and how natural everything felt, physical intimacy specifically relating to a more sexual nature was still a big source of anxiety and wasn‚Äôt something I could muster the courage for. To be fair there were quite a few weird instances that happened throughout the night that would force me to pull my focus into being more safety oriented (dude who‚Äôs a FRIEND kept touching her, not taking a hint, and another girl passed out from dehydration), but I don‚Äôt think that explains the whole story. 

Anyway today (next day) I haven‚Äôt been able to get this entire thing out of my head, and I‚Äôve been feeling quite emotionally volatile, seeing a variety of posts relating to love on YouTube keeps making me cry. I‚Äôve also been having low self esteem and I feel very unloveable, and just quite inferior, I do have a lot of physical insecurities, again especially when it comes to attracting girls. I think the combination of Molly and how the night turned out have brought up some issues that I haven‚Äôt worked through enough and that I‚Äôve just pushed under the rug, and I‚Äôm just realizing that being so single and devoid of real intimate love is getting to me a lot more than I thought, I‚Äôve essentially been internally masking for a while, afraid to face the reality of that part of myself pretending I‚Äôm fine this way. I‚Äôve also been neurotic as hell all day wondering if I fucked up last night, if I should have done things differently, and wondering why/how it even ended up happening. She took molly as well but is on an ssri (didn‚Äôt know that until later, we should‚Äôve asked I know) so she said she didn‚Äôt feel anything. Since I‚Äôm neurotic ive been wondering all day how real it was because i ususally just assume any girl wants nothing to do with me even if all the signs point to the opposite. 

Has anybody with similar issues ever felt this way after Molly? Any recommendations on how to work through issues of this sort? 


Again these are issues I‚Äôve had with me for a while now and I dont know how much longer I can be without a deep relationship before I just internally explode. I‚Äôm just so done with feeling so lonely, but i feel so stuck.

Just prior to the pandemic my mum broke her hip on some ice and was out of work for 7 months.  The same week, my father had a stroke and was thrown out by his partner (my parents are divorced)  He now lives in a nursing home.   

I got let go from a full time music job in July of 2019 and used what savings I had to get by until I found another job in Jan of 2020.  Then the pandemic hit. 

My partner panicked at the start of the pandemic (as most of us did) except they retreated to their parents place - a 4 hour drive away from where we lived.  They told me it was only going to be two weeks - it turned into 9 months.  

They came back later that year and things seemed to go fine, until they retreated back to their parents this time for 6 months.   During this time I had to go on SA,  i didn't tell them because their family always made comments on how poor I am and how worthless people on SA are.   

I panicked and as someone with panic, anxiety and major depressive disorders, I got scared and didn't tell them.  They found out accidentally.   Then left me .  They then (a few weeks after) wanted to work things out and because I loved them I jumped at the chance to fix things.   This summer things were getting better until they told me they ""tried"" but couldn't get past the ""lie"" (to them not telling them about having to go on welfare is lying)  

They left me for someone they met - and i shit you not- while playing minecraft,  and lives in the US.  This person left their wife and kids and moved closer to the border so they could date.   They are now dating despite only having met in person once, 12 days ago.  

Two weeks ago it was my ex's birthday and I asked them to dinner and that's when they told me they didn't love me anymore, and to ""get over it""  and that they still ""deeply care for me.""  And want to stay friends when my being around them doesn't hurt anymore and I don't look like ""someone died""  ...they also told me that they only took me out for my bday (in August)  because they pitied me because they knew I wouldn't have anyone else to celebrate my birthday with.    

They gave me mixed signals of flirting and promises of kisses and cuddles and.. just

long story short, i am attracted to guys. i had a crush once when i was a teenager, but i ended up spending that whole year in denial and hating myself. it took me a long time to accept me as i am. 

i got over it. i am a bit happier, but now i kinda happened to like one of closest friend, and i can't do anything about it. he's straight, confessing would be a bad idea, plus it would ruin the friendship that we had if he turns out to be close minded. i feel like i just need to somehow wait for my feeling to be gone... once again. 

it's so tiring. being closeted, I'm used to hiding my feeling around people, friends, family. but i guess id never be good at dismissing this one. i want for once not to ignore it.

1884,y079er,Impressive_Price9167,"Ok so I have a very clean background, no criminal record and 35 years citation free. 10 of those years I was a commercial truck driver. I was in New York, 2010 on I 95 Hudson county got stopped at a rest area for A D.O.T inspection. The truck, driver, all my documents, everything.  So first he checked the truck and was impressed how well I had taken care of my equipment. Then he run my driver's license, the look on his face was priceless. He says,"" in the 25 years of being a New York state police officer he had never seen a record so clean. The only thing on my record is a bogus DUI I had been charged with in 1999 but i don't drink and I pee tested clean. They dropped the charge but sent the wrong paperwork to the DMV so it was corrected but will always show up on my record. I was awarded for a Commendation from the state for maintaining such a spotless background for so long. They also mentioned that I had/still do have over 1 million miles driven citation free. "" An almost impossible achievement."" 

Ok so (present day) I'm homeless living in my car parked in a Grocery store parking lot. So I have been on the streets for 3 years (stabbed in the back by my ex wife, when I became disabled) now. A week or two ago a new homeless senior arrived in his pick up. Around 3am a police officer decided to talk to me ( I've been dealing with insomnia) so the officer asked what's going on with me? I told him my situation. He asked me for my license ( most of the Rialto Police over the past few years have just told me to be gone or go to Jail) he was the first. After he heard my life on the radio, another priceless look, then he became apologizing, dropping the take charge attitude police have. Then gave back my license, first bumps me, says, ""hope the rest of your day is a  good one, Sir."" And leaves. Doesn't tell me to leave. Nothing! 

Later the new guy comes to me and asked if it was a cop? But most importantly what did he ask,say, and why did he even talk to me????? Yes it was a cop, he was checking why I haven't left in Days, and when he learned of my life he respected me. So now, up until last night, the old man was parking next To me, thinking the cops will believe he was with me and leave him alone.  It was like being married again, I couldn't do anything without someone. I was accepting his presence. He invited me to smoke a joint, I accepted standing outside his truck, I wasn't wearing a shirt, it's still warm in southern California and I have been walking around in summer my whole life without a shirt, unless at work or one is required. As we were talking, smoking, a young (androgynous looking person screams out a car window "" put a shirt on."" First I'm 54 years old, male and not required too. Second don't tell me in that tone to change my way of life, I have lived 54 years doing to to suit your LGBTQ special needs. Don't come to the place I have called my home town since I was born and demand I change my life so you can be you. I don't give a flying, rats ass how you want to live don't tell me how to live. AND I very loudly told that person to mind their own business! The old guy gets pissed off at me for being loud and perhaps drawing police attention to us.

I have the right to freedom of speech, I have the right to be without a shirt, and I don't have anything to worry about if the cops came. I'm not breaking any laws, I'm within my rights, and you parked next to me. I never asked for your company. I don't give a crap what you or anyone else thinks. If you don't like who I am stay away.  I only want people who accepts me for me, if you can't handle it, say goodbye don't disrespect me.

1909,y0bqlz,somewannabeusername,"I can‚Äôt understand where it all went downhill for me. I‚Äôm just going to start from the top.

I moved around a lot growing up because of my father‚Äôs job. I never blended in and was always a social pariah. By the time I got comfortable at the new school and finally made some friends, it was time to move again. The fact that I‚Äôm introverted and reserved didn‚Äôt help.

My extended family was pretty much concentrated back in my parents‚Äô home state which we didn‚Äôt visit much. It had its pros and cons. The rural part of my country holds rather orthodox ideals about girls, so it‚Äôs a good thing I stayed away. However, I also had a very isolated and downright depressing childhood because of how difficult both my parents are.

My teen years were marred by social ineptitude and inability to make friends. Also, I was a disappointment to my family since I wasn‚Äôt as academically gifted as the rest of them. The only friends I ever made took me for a ride and didn‚Äôt always treat me very well, because they had other friends and I didn‚Äôt. Some boys noticed me, but because I was so awkward and could barely hold a conversation, it didn‚Äôt take long before I‚Äôd say something wrong and they‚Äôd lose interest. It didn‚Äôt help that my family was strict and not supportive of absolutely anything I did. And this led me to avoid romantic situations which could be potentially melodramatic, as my family would react harshly.

I moved out for college, and did reasonably well. Still not good enough for my father though. College was a different kind of struggle in itself. I was desperate for any kind of human connection. Some friends maybe? But nobody in college is looking for friendships. They want relationships and sex. But what did I know about those?

Some guys rejected me because of how hopelessly inexperienced I looked. It‚Äôs almost as if they could take a look at me, and read it on my face. I had poor judgement of character and always got entangled with the wrong kind of friends. I guess I attracted the wrong kind of guys because I got molested by a few of those.

I finally found a good guy who I felt liked me for myself. It felt like paradise for a few years. Finally, for the very first time, I had found a human being who loved and cared for me. I felt so free with him. He didn‚Äôt judge, he listened, he was compassionate. He learnt my likes and dislikes and made efforts to accommodate me into his life.

And yet, my happiness was short lived apparently. He had a series of personal tragedies in his family which led us to part ways. He needed to move back home and now, I find myself back where I started again. I still have the same unsympathetic family, except now they really don‚Äôt have to care since I‚Äôm an adult. Adult friendships are difficult, so the few good friends that I made are busy with their lives. And now I‚Äôm just working, eating, and sleeping. It all feels so hollow and meaningless.

It will be the song that she never heard, and that's okay.

Just want to vent about frustrations I've been feeling for last 3 years. I don't know how I got here but holy frick, why am I so scared/anxious of attractive people? I was always somewhat anxious but I feel this specific fear has gotten worse recently. I'm a 30 year old male who has a decent gig and just got a place of my own and in that sense I feel good and accomplished. Yet I've noticed about myself I still have crippling anxiety around good looking people especially women. I'm awkward and silent, and I know people can sense that but man, I just don't know what to say. Like if some friendly clerk tries to joke around with me I feel like I should also respond with something clever or witty but my mind is completely blank. I either say something awkward and kills the mood or i just smile and laugh. How do people master the art of small talk? Clealy not my area. But back to my point, i have this unnecessary fear of attractive people. It's like they're part of this world I'll never be included in. I know we all put up needless boundaries and everyone's got issues but I just wanted to vent some of mine as well. People tell I am attractive as well. I am also athletic and I have been known to be quite extroverted in my early 20s. Seems like things were just easier in general when we are young. Like I said I've always had some anxiety but at least when I was younger I was more popular especially with the ladies. Me and most of my friends from school pretty much have all gone our separate paths in life. Now it just feels like people look at me strange and its hard to make new friends. I know a lot of this is in my head but if anyone has some advice that'd be appreciated. Or if you just wanna share your frustrations, that's cool too, i know a lot of us are in a similar spot emotionally.

1946,y0ia7j,MyAltForBeingSad,"Sometimes I feel like cutting all ties and moving to a place where nobody knows me would make me feel *less* lonely. Sounds counterproductive since it would mean being physically cut off from everything and everyone I've ever known, right? It might be a misguided daydream, but I weirdly believe that it'd be preferable to my current situation of existing on the periphery of everyone else's lives. 

I currently live in the same area as a couple old friends, but they've all moved on and formed new circles with coworkers, roommates, etc. Whenever they're making plans for the weekend or find an activity they want to do, I know I'm not the first, second, or even third person they'd choose to include. I know that's true because when I do talk to them, they're always talking about their past or upcoming adventures with their new friends. Then they ask me what's up with me and it's always the same answer: ""same old same old"". They know that they're my only friends in the area, and they know I don't have anyone else to hang out with, and they choose to leave me out anyways. I tend to get invited to big events--like birthday parties--but casual activities and get-togethers? Never. 

It's as though they like me enough to occasionally chat and catch up, but don't actually like me enough to include me in anything. I do try reaching out and scheduling things occasionally, but it's always a struggle because of how often they're busy with other people. I hate this feeling of constantly having friends just out of reach.

1966,y0lflj,kumguzzlor7000,"Im that guy who will always answer the call. Any invite to whatever it may be, from a party to a funeral ill be there. From doin heroin to making christmas sweaters i dont care what it is but im there. Cause im always looking for something to do with people.

Ofc im being a lil bit dramatic with that but what im trying to show is that im using all available options to meet new people and to show that im a guy to invite. I always make an effort to enlarge my social circle. But to no avail,

Like I make a friend at work or school or wherever else, and we make plans. And thats it. We hang out once and they never reach out again. When i reach out its always a no, and i dont wanna come over as desperate so im not gonna ask 20 times. But it makes me wonder, what do i do wrong?

Am I rude? Am I a narcissist? Egotistical? A jerk? Am i just plain weird?

If i make all the same moves as all the other socially rich people that i know, but end up with these results, then something has to be wrong with me right? Something that I just dont seem to notice myself, but that is blatantly obvious to others.

Went to my first real party hosted by a buddy of mine a few weeks back, and it was great. Booze, drugs, girls, and much laughter, the whole nine yards, I got people talking, got em laughing, met alot of new people and hit it off with them. Overall I seemed to be liked. But thats kinda where things once again just end. Its always months of radio silence from all my friends, while they do shit without inviting me, and i cant help but wonder why.

I think my insecurity mainly roots from me being very introverted as a child up until 15-16. I always stayed at home, never made an effort, never wanted friends. But thats changed, and im just not really seeing any major results in these past years despite my efforts.

I dont wanna keep going into town by myself, i dont wanna go to movie theaters alone, i dont wanna go to bars alone, i dont wanna go to clubs alone, i dont wanna go on vacation alone. But i literally have no other options. Ive done all the things above on my own with the best possible mindset and im always miserable. No one wants anything to do with me, and i dont know why.

Im in my prime years to experience these things, and i worry about missing out on important memories. sure i could do all of this in my late twenties or early thirties if i do make good friends at that point, but ill never be this age again, and i always hear people talking about their wild experiences when they were my age.",2022-10-10 18:00:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1564688252,5,/r/lonely/comments/y0lflj/wondering_what_im_doing_wrong/,,0,2,Wondering what im doing wrong

so I (19F) have two best friends, A (19M)  and R (18F). I can tell them anything and everything and they will always understand me and be there for me, no matter what. 

A and I had the kind of online relationship where we'd text or call every night for hours but rarely meet up irl. We've been friends for nearly two years. R is someone who I met irl often and spoke with for hours about everything. We've been friends for 4-5 years I think. They are both people I can be completely open and vulnerable with.

they started talking because I introduced them online and we quickly became a very close trio group of friends. it was amazing and even to this day I believe they are two friends I can count on for life, I can't think of anything that could ever truly separate us. relatively recently they started developing feelings for each other and eventually they started dating. honestly I was so so happy for them because they're both amazing people and they're perfect for each other and I supported them both through the whole process. I love them both so so much and they're two of my favourite people. 

however, I had a mental breakdown over the fact that soon they'd be much closer to each other than with me because that's the nature of romantic relationships. they'd talk to each other at night instead of me and they wouldn't need me as much anymore. this was back when they both were at home in the same town and I was being worried about the future. but now they've both moved to uni far away and I'm really starting to feel it. I don't talk to him every night anymore, and I rarely speak to her either. they text me here and there and we do talk a little bit but it's no where near as in depth as it used to be. I used to know everything that's going on with them both and now I know next to nothing. and I know they both love me loads and care about me, they send me pictures and updates of their lives.

I know there's nothing truly unhealthy or unusual about any of this. it's normal and its how different relationships work and there is a hierarchy to them. I get it. but as someone who doesn't have a lot of friends and who treasures them over almost everyone else, it just hurts. I don't know how to cope. I feel like I'm no use to them anymore and they don't need me like they used to. I feel like I'd be intruding if we ever hung out like before. they wouldn't ever do anything to make me feel like that I know, but it's just me. I'd be lying if I said there was no jealousy involved, I don't like either of them like that, but I do have a small feeling of jealousy of the romantic relationship they have, as I could never see it for myself. this makes me extremely guilty even though these feelings are pretty small. 

I can't help but feel this way. I feel like I'm already mourning the relationship we used to have. what makes it worse is I am really insecure and don't believe I'll ever find love like that and so I value friendships very highly. I feel like any friends I do make, I will lose in some sense when they get into committed relationships and I will always be left alone. I don't know how to deal with this. 

I think this is the single thing I can't talk to them about because I will make them feel bad and I'd hate to do that. it's just the way things are. I guess I'll just have to get used to it. 

does anyone else understand these feelings? how does one cope with them? is it a good idea to talk to them about this even though there's not really much to change?

TLDR: Used to be a trio, now two of them are dating and have less time for me. they still love me and I love them both very much but finding it hard to cope with the changes and not being a priority anymore. do I talk to them about this?",2022-10-10 18:41:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630441800,26,/r/lonely/comments/y0mgv2/two_of_my_closest_friends_started_dating_and_it/,,0,14,two of my closest friends started dating and it hurts

She moved back in with her parents so she'd have some support from her family and I quickly found a job down here so I could remain close to my son.

This meant leaving behind all my friends and family and moving to a place where I knew no one. I thought with the hobbies I have which are quite social (LARP, D&amp;D and warhammer. Yes I'm a total nerd) that I would quickly find a new friend group down here but unfortunately then something happened that I couldn't predict.... COVID. Lock downs pretty much as soon as I moved down here forcing the various clubs I knew about to shut down and now with the cost of living crisis I've been priced out of allot of the stuff I do. As the years have gone on I am receiving less and less contact from my old friends and family back home. If I contact them they eventually get back to me but very few of them reach out to me first to see how I am.

2003,y0rhze,exapism,"I (24F) am feeling incredibly stuck. I live in Toronto, moved back home with my parents during the pandemic. My family loves me, despite the dysfunctional environment, and I have people close by. I have a desirable degree from a good uni. I work a really good job with high pay, no debt, sizeable emergency fund. Some travelling under my belt but nearly not as much as I‚Äôd like. Basically I‚Äôm doing well on paper. But inside I feel like I‚Äôm crumbling and every day is chipping at my soul. 

I‚Äôve hated Toronto for as long as I can remember and I hate living at home. I want to leave but I am too scared and there‚Äôs just so much work involved and I don‚Äôt have the motivation for any of it. 

- I suspect I have ADD and display autistic traits (not sure if that‚Äôs the right language). I‚Äôve been meaning to get a diagnosis for months now but I can‚Äôt even get myself to my GP for a referral. Testing is covered under my insurance so it‚Äôs not even a financial reason I‚Äôm not doing it. I am also on anxiety meds. 
- my parents have been pressuring me to apply to masters programs, but the thought of having to write essays and reach out to references is exhausting and anxiety inducing. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to do a masters and if it‚Äôs needed for my career (data science/product analytics)
- I‚Äôm so unhappy in my job. I‚Äôve been working by myself for so long (remote + no partner on project) while all my colleagues have a partner. There‚Äôs not enough recognition for my work and my promotion slipped through the cracks and I have to wait for the next cycle of promotions. I‚Äôm not productive at work at all and just stare at the screen. 
- I want to travel but my parents heavily discourage solo travelling and going against their wishes is so terrifying. Most of my friends in other cities don‚Äôt have the space or the time for me to come visit. 
- I don‚Äôt have any close friends. I‚Äôve always been a loner but it just got worse during the pandemic. I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs #1 and it‚Äôs always me initiating plans which I‚Äôve just gotten tired of. I‚Äôve tried making new friends but they all have their main friends circle. I just really want a tight knit group of friends or even 1 close friend :( not a single person I see every few weeks
- went through a breakup last December where he cheated. I‚Äôve taken the past 9 months to really work on a lot of things I hated about myself and started valuing my own presence more. But that also meant that I lost a lot of people, including my ex who wanted to be friends (before I found out about the cheating). 

I just feel like all my friends are getting their dream jobs and moving away to all these cool places and I‚Äôm just stuck in Toronto. I feel like my life is at a standstill and I have no one to share my struggles with or to motivate me. Just a friend who cares to be spontaneous with me and will accompany me in all my bad/good decisions. 

I think all of this is coming to head because I recently reconnected with a friend from first year uni about 1.5 months ago. He and I hung out a bunch of times, and eventually hooked up, and agreed it would be casual. But he actually just moved to the USA this weekend because of a new job. I think I‚Äôm just grieving losing him and finally accepting this feeling of abandonment. There‚Äôs probably some jealousy in there too. 

A friend would be so nice. 

Having the courage to leave Toronto would be so nice.

When I was younger I always thought that I had all time in the world, and my significant other will somehow come my way. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. Vast majority of my female acquaintances are married, and I can't understand what is wrong with me. It's hard for me to involve with someone, because I was betrayed several times and I don't trust people. But recently it became worse for me, when the night comes I just lie and think about how come that almost every girl is loved by someone and I'm not. It almost physically hurts to see all my classmates wedding photos, while I never have been intimate with someone. I can't even imagine myself in a normal healthy relationship. Sometimes I think about one person whom I liked, but he rejected me, and it just hurts. Maybe I am a difficult person to love and be with. I want somebody who would like to hug me and kiss me and say that I'm beautiful, someone who would like to sleep beside me and touch my hair. It's just those little intimate things.

2010,y0s5ce,Mr_E940,"  Hello there, as the title says I wanna make some actual friends rather than a one off conversation. 
  I'm a bit of a jack of all trades kind of guy so I can usually relate to alot of different topics fairly well. I like anime and manga (super excited for Chainsawman), cooking, video games (Xbox and very little PC, this is where I'd put multi-player games if I had friends to game with ü•≤), I'm an amateur myrmecologist and I like to get outdoors like hiking and being in the middle of nowhere in general.
  I've lived all up and down the east coast so I've never really had the lifelong friends alot of other people have had growing up. On top of that I have my own fair share of anxiety and paranoia (I know alot of people do) so it makes it hard to open up to people.
  I typically don't post as I have before with little to show for it. I like helping people with their troubles but I'd like at least one person to chat with daily if that's not too much to ask.

2018,y0tgg9,[deleted],"I'm looking for a unique type of friendship. I'm tired of putting on a mask and not bein myself. You know the feeling, I'm sure. Whether it is for work, for our family, for those around us, or for significant others we all put on some type of face, act a bit different than we wish we could, and have to hide our true selves. Well no longer, I am looking for someone to write with, someone to befriend where we can be our true selves. Where there is no fear of judgement, no worry about what the other person thinks, just honesty and acceptance. 

There are things in all our lives that we think, that we want, that we hope for that we have to keep to ourselves. I am hoping that this friendship that develops here pushes all of that hiding aside and we can come out and hold nothing back. Talk about the topics you've always wanted, try new things, share stories and secrets you've keep locked away in your mind, and just get them out in the open. It will feel so freeing, like a weight lifted off of our shoulders. What is something you've been holding onto. 

This isn't just about finding new friends, although getting to know someone at this deepest level is so rewarding and a whole heck of a lot of fun. No, this is getting out from behind ourselves and being brave, putting ourselves out there, and enjoying being out of our comfort zones. I feel like reddit is a perfect place for this as the likelihood of meeting or having any overlapping circles is astronomically low, so why hold back. And being penpals and new internet friends is the perfect medium because it lets us get the words out that we've never said, but always thought. We all need that friend, we all need that outlet. The stress just builds and builds, and it becomes so blinding, that we start to not feel ourselves at all.

It is a big ask, I know that, but it is a bold ask as well. We all say we are an open book, but are we really? This is a call to find some friends to write with and open up our books to pages that have never been read and share parts of our lives with one another, building foundations of trust, and enjoying making a new life long friend!",2022-10-10 23:30:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/y0tgg9/holding_nothing_back/,,0,0,Holding Nothing Back
2019,y0th8f,Responsible-Camp5834,"Now, it's not like I'm an absolute loner. When I first entered college, (I'm a freshman), I met some people but you know that you don't talk to half of them ever again. At first, I ate with people, but I kinda stopped. With classes piling, I ate alone frequently, 

However, it began to eat me alive. I rarely hung out with people. Sure, I had people I talk to, but none that I truly consider my friend. My roommate is fine, but we have conflicting schedule, and we like to eat at different times, so we don't eat together that often. I'm so tired of eating alone. Everytime, I just go in and sit alone. I wish I can just eat with someone.

I know I can go and ask to eat with other people beforehand, but I think that would come off as weird, and one on one may give off the wrong vibes, especially to girls. I just want to eat with someone. Just two days ago, at lunch, I ate with someone (he just happened to be there, so I sat next to him because we talked before). We barely talked but it was alright, I just want to eat with someone. Fuck college man.

And I wish I had a group to hang out with. Maybe I'm just finding the wrong people. I prioritize my academics a lot, and I spend a lot of time studying, working out, and practicing piano. I dislike partying, drinking, and all that crap. Yet, the people I meet are generally the opposite of that. Maybe I just haven't met the right people. I even got made fun of for being studious and working out, because I ""never socialize."" I mean I just don't want to end up a college dropout and I wanna graduate yknow.

The fall of 2021 was especially tumultuous when I was beginning to endure an identity crisis, which did lead to me changing my career path for the better. It wasn't easy though as I also attended a film festival for a weekend in October and it was one of the most torturous weekends of my life. I dealt with loneliness due to watching films that my colleagues were involved in, including a few former colleagues whose associations I had ended badly.

I‚Äôm not the guy at the back of the classroom with a hoodie, I am not a so called ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù (no that that is bad, I actually really like those kind ok people), I don‚Äôt have a mental disorder (at least not from the ones I mentioned)‚Ä¶.. I just truly don‚Äôt fucking know what the fuck is wrong with me.
Every time I try to interact with people I just feel so fake, like I don‚Äôt even want to do it. Like if I just did it for commitment. But it‚Äôs weird cause I force myself to those interactions. I just can‚Äôt make them feel natural, I feel like a robot talking to humans. Even when someone approaches me to have a conversation and we are having the conversation I just can‚Äôt feel 0 empathy from neither of us, like if when someone started talking or coexisting with me they completely felt some kind of depressing energy, I really don‚Äôt know how to make this shit stop. Is it my personality? Is it my mental state? What is wrong?
It‚Äôs been like this for a few time till now and it just keeps getting worst. I‚Äôve been from one psychologist to another, I‚Äôm even on pills. It can‚Äôt be my physical state, I eat healthy, and exercise 5 times a week just cause I like to, so what is it, I just want to feel normal, I feel weird, weird between the weirdest, I don‚Äôt even know if I feel at this point, and I can‚Äôt call for help because I don‚Äôt know what is happening, I‚Äôm pretty sure this post will sound pretty stupid ones I reread it.

2042,y0wtte,CthulhusIntern,"A few months ago, I felt really connected with a lady from my dance group. I started to become attracted to her. I wanted more. Then she didn't show up for a little over a month, which I later found out was because she was out traveling for weddings. This just made me grow fonder. I began to get way ahead of myself, I started fantasizing about moments with her and being with her. Eventually, I did see her again and she did start coming back. I wanted to ask her out so badly, but I got too anxious and nervous to. But talking to her more made me feel even closer and even more into her. Finally, last week, with the help of liquid courage, I brought myself to ask her out at the end of a house party with her, and she told me she strongly prefers women to men. I told her that's alright, but I felt so much pain there.

I feel like a fucking idiot. If I had just asked her out, I wouldn't have built her up as the perfect girl in my mind. I would be hurt so much less. Now, I'm crying every night.

But here's another thing, during those months I was thinking about her, while I had my ups and downs, I was mostly actually happy. Normally, I'm just constantly down, because I feel unlovable and undesirable, but during that time, any problem I had was minor, and happiness didn't feel fleeting and temporary. But when she rejected me, I fell back into my old hopeless feelings hard. Now I cry every night.

Will I ever be loved? Will I ever find someone who makes me feel the same way that will actually love me back? What kind of woman would want to date a guy who's so pathetic that he can only be happy when he's hopelessly infatuated with someone who won't ever love him back?",2022-10-11 02:09:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1392179942,1,/r/lonely/comments/y0wtte/i_just_cant_get_over_someone_who_cant_love_me_back/,,0,1,I just can't get over someone who can't love me back.

2054,y0xtdl,RegretMoist5473,"22/f, a lesbian 

Had my first serious relationship about two years ago which ended up leaving me hurt. On my behalf I could have handled the discussion a lot better and could have been a lot more mature. Luckily, I got together for lunch with my ex earlier this year after I ghosted her for a year and we cleared things up. Although we haven‚Äôt talked to each other really since. It feels good to have that closure and not be holding a grudge. 

I‚Äôve dated a number of girls afterwards, unfortunately caught feelings for one that moved away about a year ago. The last person I sort of dated was about 3 months ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been talking to girls on tinder and social media, but I feel like I‚Äôm getting bored. I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm not meant for hookups and situation-ships. I like having genuine feelings towards someone- passion, intimacy. However, being a lesbian in the south east kind of makes the dating pool a little bit more selective, and honestly I don‚Äôt view anyone as of right now someone I‚Äôm interested in. I know that true connection isn‚Äôt searched, rather it is found. 

I‚Äôm happy with the progress I‚Äôve made on my mental health as well as my life in general while being single. At night, when I go to sleep, I realize I just want somebody to be next to me. I know that I‚Äôm only 22 and that can change at any instant. But waiting for it sucks sometimes. I just crave intimacy.

All my friends are either married now or are in a serious relationship and it's honestly making me sad that I'm the only single person in our group.

I've tried dating apps (tinder, bumble, ect.) but they have never worked for me. One day a few weeks ago I started talking to this girl and we went on a date and before we went our separate ways, she mentioned about doing it again but that was the last I heard from her.

We played mini golf and had dinner afterwards. She ended up paying for dinner because she grapped the check before I could get it because we were talking went it came and I didn't want to interrupt our conversation or anything. We both seemed to have a good time and enjoyed each other's company but she didn't seem to be giving off the same vibes the next day compared to before. Could me not paying for dinner have effected it in any way?

Also, I'm always being teased for being too nice by my friends, even the girl I went in the date with was teasing me about it at dinner. I wouldn't say I'm being overly nice but I am as respectful as possible unless they give me a reason not to be.

Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to get this out there and hopefully someone will have some advice or other help.

Why? 

If you call it relationship, I‚Äôd call it a petrified wood floating on a water. No life, no meaning, aimless. 

Real meaning of love, care about other person, let alone the world don‚Äôt even let your left hand to know about you are in a relationship. What does she/he need in the time of their vacancy. Try to fill it up. Love isn‚Äôt easy. 

How would you rate me, would you go on a date with me, I have got expensive things, the measurements, 

You call this love? Love is the meaning of fight, care, sacrifice, bonding, grudge, share your affliction, complacency. 

Ex is an auspicious word to execute or to use. Provide your soul, body, mind, precious time, affection to the person who can utilize that. Propitiate your life.

Things have changed since I went to the Navy and got sent home from boot camp. I was sent home for mental issues while I was there, so I never finished basic. I got sent home after being there for 6 weeks and I can tell I have changed. It feels very weird from everyone being proud and all theses positive emotions towards you to do something and them seeing you be sent back is weird. I feel as if I failed everyone as this wasn't for me. I never told anyone I got sent home and people slowly figured out and contacted me. Some were very rude and some just were kind of nice but did not understand why I got sent home. Family Members give me looks now and some don't really talk to me anymore. I feel great deep shame and embarrassment for being back. This feeling of shame has made it hard for me to talk to people and be the person I used to be. I only go outside for school and when I want some Diet Coke(lol). All I do now is play videogames and watch anime myself. I now avoid people and socializing and I cant break it. Even with new people, I feel like they are judging me all the time and look down on me. It just sucks to not be able to talk to people and I hate how I cannot shake these feeling off of me.

It‚Äôs still a brand new channel so look forward to more content in the near future! We‚Äôd also appreciate any ideas you have on what our next video should be about.

This year has pushed the limits of everything for me and it feels even worse when i've made so many posts expressing my pain and feelings of hopelessness and i doesn't get a single reply.

2138,y1b1d4,cheeks_cake,"I remember posting here a year ago on r/lonely with how I wanted close friends or best friends irl. Well...Life listened and was generous enough to give me that. A number of people have been opening up to me this year which labeled me as their ""close friend"" and ""best friend"". 

I'm not a saint but I try to be as helpful as possible. I listen to their problems and rants, give them comfort, offer them solutions, treat them most of the time even though I have barely any for myself, lend them money which I don't expect them to pay back because I know life is tough for them.

I just feel like none of this is being reciprocated especially by my best friend. Let's call her Sky... When I tell something I'm passionate about to Sky, she seems uninterested and isn't listening fully. She'll nod and agree but those all feel empty. I tried telling her about my problems and she tries to comfort me... By trying to divert my attention with her talking about her love life. Sky doesn't have much but that's okay... I'll treat her as long as my budget allows it. I even give gifts to her family whenever I come to her house because I want them to know that I love and respect them and that I see them as my family as well. I ask Sky if she can maybe visit me at my place and she promises a lot of times that she would... She never did though. She often tells me about how she'll treat me to this and that once she starts working... But I know they're all empty promises and that she'll forget about me once she starts working... I mean she can't even keep the promises she makes now what else should I expect? But despite all this I still liked hanging out with her.... 

All of that changed though when she got into a relationship. I was fine with her being in a relationship and even let her BF come along when we hangout (which is once in a blue moon for us to do). When they fought I even tried to help them make up by bringing her to the mall and him surprising her there... What made me upset is when he asked if I could leave them and go home. I understand that he wanted some alone time with her but wow... after all the trouble I had to go through because of her strict parents he's gonna ask me to leave. Sky says she doesn't want me to leave but I can see how much she wanted to be with him so I bought donuts for her family and told her to give it to them as a present from me so she doesn't get scolded once she goes home. I left the mall. I felt like shit... On top of all that her aunt texted me... Scolding me on how I shouldn't have left Sky because she might go see her suitor (she did not know that Sky's suitor was already her boyfriend). 

A few days after I was feeling really bad because of a personal problem I'm dealing with. I really needed someone... I texted Sky and asked her if she could come over. She said okay and asked if she could bring her boyfriend over too so they can spend time together and cuddle and stuff cause they have to act civil and distant in her house cause of her strict parents. I honestly was really turned off with that and told her to just forget it cause I was having a bad day and didn't want her aunt to scold me again and think that she's using me as a scapegoat to see her boyfriend.

I also experience this with my close friends but I just mentioned Sky cause her's is the worst one. 

If this is friendship then I don't want it. I'd rather be alone and lonely than have company but still feel lonely. 


Edit: I have good friends but they're mostly online and my former best friend who I used to hangout with a lot lives really far away now (we only contact each other once in 6 months)

**Trigger Warning** : **Mention of drug abuse, Death, Rape, Self harm.**

Names have been changed: 
Ava: younger sister (23) 
Jade: older sister (25) 
Zoe: step sister (35) 
Me (25) 
Cole: Older brother and my Bf (27m) 

    January 15, 2022 rolls around. My sister, Ava (23F) came over to our place that day. I'm dating Cole, her older brother(27m) but She had recently broken up with her long term boyfriend that day over an argument. I picked her up, with her cat and 7 kittens (this is important later). We placed the Momma cat in a room where the door doesn't properly close, because its an old trailer and it never lined up. 
Now, i have two cats. Both male, neutered etc. Yokai, a male black cat who turns 2 yrs old in 14 days, is a curious cat especially to other cats. Now, we all suspect that this batch of kittens are Yokai's kittens, before he got snip-snip. So he was extra curious, and kept trying to go into the room the kittens were in with the momma cat. I was keeping on eye on it,and playing game with my sister who was drinking and tipsy; so not exactly all there. 

Not even half an hour goes by after my BF comes home from work, that Yokai (black cat) managed to sneak past my eyes, and get into the room which followed by Momma Cat very possessive growl. Ava and I leap out of the chairs to the room, she attempts to hit Yokai on the head. I say the first thing that came out of my mouth "" you will not hit my cat Or you can get out!"" Obviously poor choice of words, and actions. This then turns into almost a 2hr screaming match... She's drunk, upset about being broken up with and just having a shitty night. She left eventually, and took up shack with her coworker. This is where it begins where we dont have contact for 5 months, i wanted her to apologize for what was said and that id apologize for kicking her out. 

Well We still see each other daily, as i often help out with her parents or help jade. Not even two weeks after our fight, i got a horrible text that i need to take their dad (62m)  to a hospital over 3 hrs away. Of course i do it, as he has been complaining of chest pain for days and he has a peacemaker. 

Eventually Zoe, the step sister comes along to stay at the mothers house where ava is at because her eldest child is staying with grandma. Now, Zoe lost custody of her children and she can have supervisied visitation on the discretion of the grandparents. Zoe is also into the hard drugs (meth, cocain, etc) and has been for most of her life. Ava was in addiction recovery, and had been clean for roughly a year. Having Zoe around was a big trigger for Ava because Zoe would bring drugs like that in the house even when the mom has explicitly told her not too. Eventually Zoe got Ava to relapse, and she relapsed hard. 

Zoe takes Ava back to where she stays. Its a drug community, gang violence and dangerous. Zoe is jealous of Ava for whatever reason, because we had to find out what was happening through texts and what Jade talks to her about. Its been mentioned that Zoe has left Ava in the hands of a drug lord, gang leader who has repeatedly hurt her and possibly drugged her up. She own him a lot of money, and would borrow off of her friends and family because of him. He would lock her up in the house with deadbolts on the outside. 

June 5, 2022. 

A bitter sweet memory. My parents anniversary is this date. Cole and I were invited out for a mountain cruise. We went for a few hours, got ice cream then came back to service. Where my phone was being blown up by several family members on my Boyfriend side. His moms friend found Ava... Ava passed away.  Cops say by suicide but further investigation suggests its murder staged suicide. Then the investigation goes cold and we never hear anything back. 

Since then I have been having a hard to accepting her death was not my physically fault but that the fight we had 5 months prior was a contributing factor to why she left.. It was my first time seeing a body, first time touching a body, first time crying and chanting over a casket. How do I forgive myself for the fight? How do I forgive myself in general? How do i even heal? 

I understand its time, but i cant help but always think about this. Its always on my mind, and one of my biggest regrets. If you asked me to go back in time, I'd go back 5 months and stop myself from ever saying those words. 

TLDR: Struggling to forgive myself for something That happened 5 months ago, because i cant apologize to the person, and rekindle our relationship. I have deep seated regret, that even therapy isn't helping with.",2022-10-11 17:37:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612993218,10,/r/lonely/comments/y1f6pc/25_f_how_do_you_forgive_yourself/,,0,3,25 [F] How do you forgive yourself...

Ever since I was a teenager I had this feeling in myself that I won't ever be loved cause of my gender. The people of the other gender got appreciated more, people wanted to be friends with them, they got treated with more compassion and in terms of dating they kinda got something which would feel like a fairytale to experience for me. Everything which I heard from my friends and which I experienced myself in comparison felt so...wrong. As if I would have to give another person what I want while the other person gives me something, which can be valuable for people, but which I just don't feel. I feel so unseen and unwanted in datingsituations and even in relationships where the other person genuinely likes me and the fairytaletreatment which the other gender receives feels not achiavable for me. The thing is I can't feel connected to anyone if I don't get that specific treatment. Neither acquaintances or friends, now matter how good they are. 

I feel so deeply isolated and hopeless cause the only thing I actually crave from life since my fucked up childhood are genuine warm human connections. The world feels so insanely cold and dismissive. I feel so wrong and hate myself and people of the other gender cause of this, but I can't change anything about this cause I can just change my outlook on things and not the world. But my outlook on the world is a result of how it treats me and as much I try to remain positive it will always revert back.

Then came a point when I was not happy with the way I naturally was, I thought being introverted and shy is not going to lead me anywhere, but changing myself too much was not doing any good either. I became this person who I didn't even connect with. Over slow realisation, I made it clear, I should be happy with the way I am and if others can't accept you the way you are no need to keep them.

I have found peace with the fact that I am this. I do feel lonely from time to time, but being someone else will only distance myself from others rather than connect with them. Being you, yourself gives you strength and confidence and you can use it to uplift yourself from whichever situation you are in.

2208,y1lcnm,Cotton_Skies,"I've suffered from social anxiety all my life, depression for at least a quarter of it and in June this year, I found out I'm also on the autistic spectrum. All these factors leave me feeling a mixture of emotions. Often isolated, lonely and ashamed of who I am.

Lately I try to reach out to other like-minded women but very few seem interested in chatting to me. Men are the ones who will put in all the effort, send good morning and good night messages, call me to see how I am REALLY doing etc which just leaves me suspicious of what their real intentions are. I feel as a woman on the internet as most women will feel, if not all, is how sexualised and romanticised I am. I often feel like I have to entertain this expectation they give me, otherwise what am I good for? I don't want to be that person though, I don't want to be insincere. I do not want to entertain that idea or live up to their expectations. I am quite a straightforward, upfront person and I try to do that in a gentle manner but I am now questioning if my vulnerability and transparency is pushing people away? Being wired differently and all that or in other words, trying to fit into a neurotypical world.

I crave friendship, an in depth friendship yet whatever I do, I do not seem to achieve it which then makes me think dating is the only route I can take which leaves me feeling even more isolated.

This is something that I have been juggling for years. Finding a boyfriend feels easier than finding a friend and I am not entirely sure why as shouldn't it be the other way around?

2214,y1mcl5,dannysurrogate,"I don't know why. I got rid of it today. Some moments I'm fine, other moments I'm eaten alive by anxiety. 

I don't actually want to kill myself, I just want the discomfort to go away. And it did. And then it came back. And then it left again. And on and on.

It's getting worse. It's because I don't talk to people. I can muster the courage to engage with people when things are going well, but they aren't. And that makes things go worse. Which makes it harder to engage with people... you get the idea.

I feel trapped. I thought I moved past this. This is a problem I haven't felt since early high school. I was worried about it coming back. And now it has.

Caffeine withdrawals aren't helping anything, but there's no way they're responsible for all of this.

I just want to give up. But I can't. There's a lock on my thoughts that stop me from going too far. But I can feel it getting chipped away. Another couple of months like this and I don't know where I'll be.

Everything feels insurmountable. And I've started feeding the feeling. I want to wallow. It feels pointless to do anything else.

2234,y1p0rm,Minister_of_Joy,"Today

I go for

a walk

in the woods.

There is snow on the ground.

Not much

just enough for mice

to get stuck in traffic.

Except the ones that

ride the metro

unless the entrances and exits are blocked by snow.

That would be

bad.

Someone would have to

dig through the snow.

Do mice have firefighters?

I walk for

a long time.

After a while, pine trees all look the same.

I like how they smell. It reminds me of my

childhood. A more carefree time that can never

be brought back.

A woman comes

my way.

She walks a dog on a leash. She looks

grumpy.

So does

her dog.

Do mice ride skateboards?

Really small ones?

Probably not

in this snow.

I'm so sad

because no one wants to feel me.

I'm only a ghost. A dark thought. People step right through me.

I greet the grumpy woman.

She doesn't respond.

Her dog lifts its hind leg.

Now my trousers are wet.

When I think about my life

I feel a profound sense of

disappointment.

I always tried really hard; worked diligently, treated people with 

kindness, sought to overcome the challenges that

were thrown in my way.

Already as a child I was

so mature and industrious. 

I wanted to make sure that despite the

bad hand I had been dealt in life, I'd do well and experience 

happiness.

Somehow

it still all went to shit.

I want to cry

but I can't. There are

no tears left.

Or maybe it's because I'm scared

scared of what's to come.

Do mice like to go skiing?

I finally arrive

at an old TV tower.

I used to bring my girlfriend here to

watch the sun set over the vast green woodlands.

I'd hug her from behind, one arm over her stomach, the other over 

her breasts. Cheek on cheek. I'd feel her warm body through her

furry coat.

My girlfriend is no longer here. She left me for

another guy.

Now that guy probably hugs her from behind

among other things.

I want to die.

Do Asian mice not eat cheese because they are

lactose intolerant?

They're starting to drive me insane.

There's a metal chain

blocking the stairs leading up the tower. There's a

sign.

It reads

Danger. Do not ascend.

I lift my leg.

The one that's wet with dog urine.

And climb over the chain.

Slowly

I walk up the steps.

Although I tread lightly

my shoes produce a clank that

can be heard for half a kilometer.

Only

There is no one

to hear it.

To be lonely means to drown

in nothingness.

Someone once told me

people come

here to kill themselves.

I suppose he was right

because I'm here now.

Though he never told me about

the mice.

How can I jump

without even having figured out how

they date.

And whether they too

get catfished.",2022-10-12 00:24:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622276562,3,/r/lonely/comments/y1p0rm/a_poem/,,0,1,A poem

2247,y1r4ct,[deleted],"This will possibly be the first post of many. I want someone to know my story, even if that person only exist in the vast space of electrons known as the internet. After all this time, I don't even expect that person to care. I lost my wife in the spring of 2017. 15 years of marriage, 3 years of dating, 10 years of cancer, 1 deployment, 2 daughters. I buried my mom later that same year. I had long since buried my dad, my grandparents, several friends, and sadly I would bury the thought of friendships as those quickly vaporized after my wife's passing. I honestly can't remember the last time I had an adult conversation, out side of work, with someone other than my daughters, with a friend. In that time I've also moved to a new town and neighborhood. The people here are all imports and the neighborhood is very unfriendly and has no personality. I tried to make new friends with my new neighbors, but I have since given up on that possibility. I've given up on friendships, happiness, or anything beyond the task of trying to raise my daughters and give them a good life. Even that no longer provides happiness. I love them dearly, but the task of being a single dad and trying to give daughters emotional support that doesn't and no longer exist in my body is exhausting. I find that I look forward to them growing up and moving on. I won't blame them a bit if they never look back. I remember my wife daily, hourly. I still talk to her. I still ask her when she is coming home. Yes, I know this isn't logical. Yet she is my only source of conversation. When I dream of her, and she speaks in my dream, it always wakes me up. If it's only 1 in the morning, too bad, I'm not getting back to sleep. I would probably still cry from missing her, but the tears are just dried up. I'm completely dead from the inside out. I fake it for my girls, but I know they can tell and it just makes me believe they got stuck with the wrong parent. They will never read this, but I am sorry girls. I love you and it's not your doing. You never deserved the life you were given. I'm just so lonely, tired, dead, emotionless, isolated. I miss my wife, mom, dad, and others.

2253,y1rdei,SamadhiBear,"It‚Äôs gotten worse and worse as I‚Äôve gotten older. Not only do I not have any real friends, but my family, who are the only people I talk to, are toxic and codependent. I spent most of my life trying to deal with their drama.

It‚Äôs even superficial too. I went on vacation and I spent time taking cool pictures and so did my brother, and when we came back, he posted his on his Facebook and got like 100 comments and likes and I got one. I know that‚Äôs stupid to measure, but he‚Äôs just as shy and awkward as I am, and yet people at his work cared about him enough to want to congratulate him on his photos and wish him well. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve made efforts to join activities and socialize with the people there, and I always go up and talk to them, and make sure I remember things about them to ask about, and yet they never seem to wanna come up to me, and say hello. 

I have people I know through a group I joined, and they all talk to each other outside of our class together, but even though I talk to them, no one ever invites me to do stuff. When I invite them, it becomes like a one hour thing, but no matter how many times I do it, it never signals them to reciprocate by asking me to join them in something, or reaching out to me. 


The only people I talk to are my family, and sometimes talking to them fills me with so much anxiety, it sets me into a stress spiral for days. They can be so negative and antagonistic.  

I‚Äôve been repeating the same hobbies and activities that used to be fun over and over again for years trying to fill the hole in my life, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work anymore. Now I just don‚Äôt see the point. I don‚Äôt just want to be some lonely person writing stories that no one will ever read, painting paintings that no one sees, writing songs no one listens to, learning skills I‚Äôll forget in a month anyway. They say do those things for your enjoyment, but after a while, it becomes stale. If you want to create, you hope that you can share that with people. 

My sister reads every book that her mother-in-law gives her because she is afraid to disappoint her, but she wouldn‚Äôt even read a short story I wrote that I asked her opinion on before submitting it to a publication.  

What am I supposed to do when I get older and I need someone to help me, or my family is gone and I have no one left to talk to. 

Why don‚Äôt people want to talk to me or be around me? I try to be a good person, I try to be a good friend, I join all these different activities, but for some reason, people just don‚Äôt want to get to know me in that way. I wish there was an adult equivalent of a friendship, bench, or I could just go sit, and people would realize that I have a hard time making friends and reach out to me. But instead, when you‚Äôre an adult, people think that that‚Äôs pathetic, and all the more reason to reject you because you‚Äôre needy. 

I have read dozens of self-help books about this, I‚Äôve gone to several therapists, I have definitely done everything that they recommend and more. I just can never scratch the surface with people. 

I try so hard to like myself, and find gratitude in the things I have, but day after day if begins to wear on you, and you realize that you‚Äôre staring down this bleak, empty future with more of the same, and when you‚Äôve been trying for as long as I have, and still not succeeding, even trying so many different things, you begin to think that there‚Äôs no solution.",2022-10-12 02:14:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1560003816,7,/r/lonely/comments/y1rdei/trying_so_hard_after_35_years_of_trying_to_make/,,0,2,Trying so hard‚Ä¶ after 35 years of trying to make friends ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just tired of it all.

Now I am at the loneliest I have *ever* been in my life.

I have no family. At least no parents. Because they are horribly mentally ill and dangerous to even be around or talk to. My dad has literally assaulted me and my brother multiple times. My mom has verbally abused *everyone* in the family, so much so that nobody in the family is on speaking terms with her anymore.

2264,y1sofs,si2tv,"""Hi, \[redacted\].""

***TLDR****, My childhood sexual abuse is tied to my codependency, despite feeling I ""overcame"" that years ago.*

***Prologue:*** *I'm a screenwriter. If you want to ""experience"" this long-winded scream into the void, then listen to Edith Piaf's La Vie en Rose (on repeat if you need) as you read. Is it healthy to paint an ""experience"" out of my trauma? No. Definitely not.*

32M. I was sexually abused multiple times from about the age of 5 to 6. It was the teen daughter (about 13-14) of a family friend. It was always whenever we had get-togethers/parties and everyone was too busy to notice anything, always ending up in my room. The first time I didn't know what was happening, but I grew to like it and was a willing participant whenever she wanted. It makes me sick and breaks my heart to write that. We moved and I never told anyone. Not til years later.

From 2014 to 2016 I frequently abused alcohol, falling hard for three women, each with their own circumstances but were not available. I opened up to the second one about being a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. This motivated me to see a therapist and finally tell my parents. I approached therapy with an ""I'm tired of this shit, let's fix this quick,"" attitude and my therapist obliged within reason. I had my breakthrough of ""talking to her."" I told my parents and it was a cathartic healing experience. They didn't know how to help, but I felt them closer than ever before.  I then stopped seeing that therapist as we both felt I didn't need it anymore.

Years later (start of the pandemic) I see another therapist cause ""I'm in love with a past flame/will they won't they/it's complicated because we're codependent through this pandemic"" but realized I had other underlying trauma I needed to unpack: my first heartbreak as a kid.

We were 8, we were best friends, played video games and rode bikes all the time, walked to and from school (over the bridge and along the sealine). I was the fat and ugly but funny one in school, a key role in the next part. Others found out, she found out, she was made fun of, and she was disgusted. School was done and I looked all over for her, saw her along the sealine, ran after her, and she ran away. I cried out for her, and she kept running. I used to joke about how sad and pathetic it was because self-deprecation is a HUGE part of my brand of humor. This therapist made me realize it was actually trauma I never processed, not so much in forgiving the girl for breaking my heart (which I did), but for **APOLOGIZING** to my younger self for exploiting a vulnerable moment for comedy. That kid didn't deserve that, not from anyone, let alone me. I said sorry to my younger self and worked to forgive myself.

Now we're here. This morning I cried in a gym parking lot because of this overwhelming void that's been consuming me for the past couple of months. ""Pandemic"" girl and I don't talk to each other anymore (it's my fault), and honestly it's for the best, but that made me hate myself even more, and because I'm stubborn in believing that you need to love yourself before loving others, I've kept myself from any form of intimacy or connection (not that I've had people barking up my tree....except for one, but that's for another time).

I don't love myself because I'm codependent. For years I struggled to see why. We saw it with pandemic girl, the three that were unavailable, my first heartbreak.

Her.

I was happy when she was there. I was sad when she wasn't. Something that's commonly associated with love, it was not. But to my naivete it was.

It took 25+ years and listening to La Vie En Rose on a sad lonely night to realize that my codependency is tied to her.

&gt;[Directly translated to ""life in pink"", ""La vie en rose"" essentially means seeing life through rose-coloured glasses. Living with an attitude or outlook of positivity, trying to see beauty in the everyday; like you do when you first fall in Love.](https://www.jenandjennifer.com/art-blog/2018/7/11/la-vie-en-rose-the-story-behind-the-art)

I had a good cry at this realization. It's what I needed. Now what?

Onward and up, I guess.

2268,y1t0nm,thefantasticalhoopla,"Hi everyone,

Loneliness is something I've dealt with for a long time now. As a young man (27) I realise I actually find it extremely easy to bond with others if we have a shared project or are trying to achieve something together. It's just the endless small talk of the modern world that's impossible for me to navigate.

This hardly seems surprising? I think most young men, rather than post on here, just play online video games with a team, and so they get exactly this. I'm really not a video game person very much so I'm thinking there *has* to be some way for me to connect with others like this. I'm wracking my brain trying to figure out what kind of shared project I could work on with others.

Any of the good friends I've had is because we worked on something together. I even joined the army for a while and got exactly this experience but had to leave because I found it so badly run.

Does anyone have any ideas? I actually already implemented this idea a few months ago to quite a lot of success, but unfortunately I was the one running the group which was just far too much for me. This has actually happened multiple times before, where I ghost a group I myself started and was actually going kind of well just because I have so much paranoia about being disliked and being annoying to people.

I've been doing everything by myself. Shopping, going out to eat, going to the games, going to events, etc by MYSELF.

I've never been invited anywhere, never attended a wedding or don't know how it feels to have someone hit me up for coffee or brunch.

At first it didn't bother me because I was stubborn and ignorant back then. I felt like I didn't need any friends, I hated people,  and only needed myself (capricorn) but as I gotten older I feel more and more lonely, afraid, and bored. 

Yesterday I went out to a bubble tea shop and two big groups of kids walked in and they were all chatting, smiling, with eachother etc and deep down inside I felt like shit. I felt lonely and once again, afraid. I just wanted to go up to them and talk. Just talk. That is how desperate I am for human interaction.

The only person i've ever interacted with these past 5 years is my ex boyfriend. Even when we were together, I didn't have any friends of my own so I was literally up under him 24/7. To this day, I still talk to him because he's the only person I have. Without him, I would've probably killed myself by now. Jk. I'm not suicidal. Never was. 

I've been avoiding romantic relationships for this very reason because I highly doubt any man will want to get with a woman with no friends and someone that's super quiet/shy.

Having 0 friends has been hitting me real hard the last 2 weeks because I recently moved to a new city and I have this big ass apartment with no one to share it with. All I do is go to work, come home, order a bunch of random shit, and watch Youtube.

I literally bought hella halloween decor, mainly for myself because I LOVE halloween, but,  I would LOVE to be able to host parties or plan get togethers some day.

Another thing i'm scared of is: going crazy. I talk to myself. I've been talking to myself since I was a kid. And when I say talk to myself, I don't mean repeating stuff so I could remember them, i'm talking having whole conversations with myself. I don't have anyone to share these things with so I just talk to myself while at home. I'm kind of scared because I don't want to end up mentally ill.

I'm also scared of falling in love again one day and not having anybody to invite to my wedding besides family.

I see people traveling and they're with someone. They have someone to create memories with and have take their photos but when I travel, it's difficult and i'm stuck using a tripod.

Anyway, I hope you guys get where i'm coming from.

2288,y1vglf,tarksin,"Let me, first of all, disqualify myself: I am a guy, over 70 years old. That ghost over in the corner, behind the philodendron.

I've been a lawyer and then a computer programmer. Along the way, a fairly serious cyclist, journalist, photographer, et cetera....  My ""work"" now is studying and writing poetry, and doing some translation of Spanish literature.

To the point, of loneliness:

I was married for 25 years and I have three beloved daughters. But I don't have now, and have never had, any friends. Two or three guys over the years wanted to be go-get-a-beer friends. I even said, ""Yes, sure, let's do that."" But I did not do my part, however small, to make any such relationship happen.  I have learned over the last decade or so that I am a textbook case of (adult) attachment disorder.  The story of my infancy and childhood is not much different from that of a lot of people. But it was my nature to be greatly affected by it. I am not at this point regretting or lamenting or miserable. Just longing, without hope now, for a connection.  It's a case of ""She (the mother) did the best she could.""

The functional basis of my loneliness was revealed to me a few months ago:  Because of the complete failure of loving attachment in my infancy, I don't have the psycho-whatever apparatus for recognizing or registering or feeling that I am loved.

I now realize that some people (I am pretty sure, rationally, that one or two people, plus my three daughters) have loved me. But I have never been able to feel it, to experience ""I am loved.""  I only believe that there is such a thing as ""feeling loved"" because I have heard and read about it.

fwiw, as we say.

If my posting has a purpose, it would be to remind others about the real existence and affect of attachment disorder, which has to do with earliest-days mother-child (failed) interactions. You can google the term, or start with ""Bowlby attachment theory.""",2022-10-12 05:42:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1536380653,14,/r/lonely/comments/y1vglf/got_it_figured_out/,,0,3,Got it figured out....

2290,y1vm8z,boar9,"Some outside forces that might be affecting me negatively:

\- I've been spending way too much time at my job and I'm getting burnt out. My workplace is a lonely environment also who doesn't help

\- The job above deprives me of sleep. I also don't exercise. This just makes my depressing nights even worse

\- I've been watching too much porn. Feels good in the moment but makes me feel unfulfilled sexually in the long run

\- I still live with my parents. This is fine and I save some money (still pay rent) but I feel like I'm undeveloped socially at 27. And moving out doesn't automatically improve my social life. For all I know I could be sitting in my room alone, but without the company of my family and replaced with roomies I hate 

\- I live in the suburbs where all the young people have moved out

My loneliness

\- I have some friends but I'm entirely reliant on them to invite me to stuff. Inviting people is vulnerable and scary, as I've built this image of being shy/quiet/boring among my friends. Breaking that image scares me

\- I guess I can invite friend to go out, etc. But really I want to have them over at my house to watch movies and play board games. Can't do that while I live with my mom :/ I'd literally rather make new friends than be vulnerable with my current ones or setting myself up for rejection with them

\- I'm getting old and have low self esteem

\- My friends are growing up ahead of me. I still like videogames, my friends not so much. They don't like anime either. I don't get what these people get into, or how they find friends to do it with so easily

\- I'm poor. Moving out scares me.

\- No bitches :(

2291,y1vxto,wt_anonymous,"Years ago I joined a discord based around a certain game with its own server and everything on a whim. I don't know how, but I ended up getting extremely involved with the server, and I met a lot of cool people whom I played with a lot. I'm not sure we'd say we were friends, but at least good acquaintances and that was good enough for me. Outside of that server, I didn't really have friends or anything to be honest. Definitely not a friend *group*, and this felt like a good substitute for that. I remember when Among Us came out, it's just a big meme now but it was genuinely fun with friends for a time. One day we all got together for a day to play it, it was my first time using voice chat in that big of a group. It was honestly some of the most fun I've ever had, and I think about it a lot.

But that server has since died out. At some point interest just sort of died down, and once a couple people started leaving, it just had a snowball effect until I was one of the few people still even in the server, let alone checking it. It's been dead for 2 years now, and I still haven't found a replacement. I'm sure to everyone else on that server it was a small footnote they hardly remember, but it meant a lot to me to feel like I had a place to belong and be accepted in some capacity. It wasn't perfect, far from it, but it was the best I've had in a long time and since. I miss it a lot, and I'm not sure I'll ever find a place like that again considering I don't even really know how I got to that point to begin with.",2022-10-12 06:10:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1539402411,2,/r/lonely/comments/y1vxto/i_miss_being_in_this_discord_server/,,0,0,I miss being in this discord server
2292,y1w29a,livinginnowhere,"I (f 18+) recently moved with my boyfriend (m 18+) to his homestead in South Dakota. I'm not a city girl and love being outdoors and living off-grid style but in short, I'm essentially stuck. He always takes the car and expects me to take care of our RV, full time. I want to work and maybe get out to town a bit more, but here's the catch. I have severe PTSD/ depression that has been a problem for my whole life. I haven't let it stop me as I still want to interact with people and ""do things"", for a lack of a better word. However, while dating him I was freshly coming out of abuse and hard drug use which made me emotional and unpredictable. As such, there was a multi month period where I was completely out of control. I don't excuse these actions, so please don't feel obligated to place any sort of ""pity"" or other similar emotions to me or the situation I suppose I caused. But my boyfriend ended up only doing the things he wanted to do that also he though would help. So, I ended up feeling worse about the whole thing unnecessarily because he gave up so much that I never in a million years would want him to have given up. I was looking for comfort and didn't know how to ask. Which is a bad mix when you consider his ""love language"" is not touch. However, he holds it against me now, despite me agreeing to throw out my apartment, get rid of my cat (emotional support), and throw out all but a duffel bag of stuff to go with him to South Dakota. Now I live and hour drive from any city (all dirt roads) in an RV that's in need of repairs. He works from 6am to 7pm and basically ignores me when he gets home. This is due to that multi month period I assume as well as for this one particular thing... He wants me to ""owe back"" that time and ""show to him"" that I care about him. This means missing meals, skipping college classes/assignments (I even had to switch to online so we could make the move), and anything else he asks for. But here's the real kicker! I can't complain, ask questions, or try to negotiate. This means I can't say anything pertaining to myself in these events. Which I agreed to, but am quite bad at. 
Most of my time is spent filling up the RV everyday with well water, cooking him dinner, emptying the tanks, and doing repairs (Basically making it so when he comes home he doesn't have to do anything). But he said none of it matters despite wanting all of it to be done. So I do additional things like make him art, talk to him about things he wants to, ya know, the basics! Make him feel loved. But he doesn't even look at me half the time. And he also spends the small window of time we have together doing other things. Now I normally wouldn't mind because he does work so much and needs some time for himself, but it feels like he's intentionally ignoring me. Worst of all, he doesn't reciprocate in bed if you catch my drift. So all in all, I feel completely alone and feel guilty for that multi month period. I'm doing everything I can to ""owe it back"" despite what he says and even getting nothing in return. But if you put it together, I live on a mountain away from everything, with no one to talk to and a boyfriend I suspect hates me. I have no money, no car, and no family/friends. I even lost my cat. As such, the gun by the door is calling my name.

2301,y1xm2g,Significant_East3242,"I think I've made a huge mistake. Originally, until recently moving to a big city I lived in a small town. I really enjoyed my job there. I was in a community library. Most of the customers were nice, and I got in really well with my coworkers. I had no idea how lucky I was. 

I had always dreamed of moving to a city, somewhere with more job opportunities and stimulation. The small town I'd been in was fine. But I'd been there for over a decade. I became depressed because I needed more. 

So I moved to a big city. Hoping it would energize my life and challenge me. 

It certainly challenged me. But it hasn't re-energized me yet. My new job was at a university library, and I found it to be awful. There was basically nothing to do all day. I might talk to one or two customers a day. I was really lonely, and wasn't clicking with any of my coworkers much in my team. My new manager was unfriendly and didn't even pretend that my job mattered. 

I let the loneliness and impatience get to me. Now I'm in a job that is genuinely awful. I'm a beauty advisor at a chain store. I can't believe I gave up a stable career in libraries for this. I let an interest in makeup blind me to the reality of what working in retail can be. 

My manager seems judgmental and distant. I can tell my coworkers think I'm weird. We aren't allowed decent breaks. I wanted a faster pace,  but the pace there is relentless. 

I am afraid this new job will burn me out and I'll have a depressive relapse. Just like I was afraid my university library job would underestimulate and bore me into another depressive episode. I'm afraid I won't be able to go back to working in libraries. Basically I have the movers blues, I'm extremely lonely and confused. I just want someone to tell me I'm going to be OK and I haven't ruined my chance at a library career. That I can and will cope. 

If anyone reads this, thank-you for doing so. I know it's a bit long.",2022-10-12 07:50:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593502437,15,/r/lonely/comments/y1xm2g/i_think_ive_made_a_huge_career_mistake/,,0,9,I think I've made a huge career mistake?

2303,y1y1pk,kialiten81,"Life gets lonely and until recently I had a super close friend that I talked and texted every day. We covered everything from ridiculous jokes to talking about serious traumas. He then changed jobs and now we never chat or see eachother at all (time zone issues) and I really miss having someone to just text and talk to, just another soul as company. Someone who cares about my day and wants me to care about theirs. 

Maybe I got lucky and he was the one good friend I could have but I'm hoping that's not the case, I'm hoping there are other people out there that have the same desire for human connection as I do. And that we are able to find eachother. 

I'm married with a teenager and definitely not looking for romance, flirting, sexting or anything along those lines. 

Since I'm older (or it feels like it by Reddit standards üòä) I would prefer people who is at least somewhat around my age. Maybee 35 to 45 or something like that. But that's only a guideline and if you are outside that range and feel that you definitely share my interest in friendship you should absolutely send a message. 

I enjoy books, crafts, gardening and my current obsession is Elden Ring on PS. I'm not a fan of large groups of people but talking to one person or in small groups I'm very talkative.

Maybe already ridiculously obvious but English isn't my native language but I mostly do fine in both text and talk. 

Please just remember that friendships are like any other relationship, it takes time and effort to work. If you feel that you want a friend and are willing to actually put in the time and effort to build that just send me a message and tell me about yourself and we will take it from there.

Exactly five years ago, when I was 16, I had the worst and best year of my life. I just wanted to be loved, appreciated by people who really cared about me. Everything around me was so strange. In that year I had my first love and yet it broke my heart. I hate that period. I listened to Wolf Alice's Silk and Blush every day. I was a little Mark Renton. For a while, I skipped classes. I didn't like being in class. I was in love but no one was in love with me. I suffered so much, in silence and waiting for a judgment. Every morning I passed by a very tall skyscraper (the only one in my city) and stayed there to observe. A boy from my city had a motorcycle accident and died in the operating room. The woman who operated on him had a son, who a few days later jumped off the same skyscraper I observed every morning. People say it was the Blue Whale, others are plotting. ""He was a good boy, I didn't expect it,"" they said. They always say it. Who knows if they will say the same about me. Only a few months later, a ferocious flood broke out against the city and killed families. Yet, in all that pain, I met the love of my life. Or at least, the former love of my life. I decided to end the relationship because I know very well that I would never be able to give her what she wanted. She cheated on me with a roommate of hers and I felt nothing. I knew it was a mistake and I forgave her, but it is as if something said to me ‚Äúhaven't you suffered enough?‚Äù. I don't know if there is a limit to pain and I don't know if it's okay for me to feel this, but I would like to kill myself. Dying in my sleep in my bed away from everything and everyone. I think it would be the only thing that could make me happy. Still I hope that someone comes into my life, slaps me and tells me ""I'm here, stupid"" but I know it won't happen. Therefore, here I am. To write disastrous poems before throwing myself to the bottom of the sea.

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.",2022-10-12 10:25:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/y20836/how_can_i_find_the_strength_to_continue_to_live/,,0,5,"How can I find the strength to continue to live, if every day I consider myself an eternal mistake?"

2330,y236r1,cherryvanila,"I can't believe I'm writing about it. She was well a week+ ago, beside some senior issues. She passed away at 16.

I lost her yesterday to chocolate poisining. It's so frustrusting. I wish I could return the time back and to prevent it.

I did everything I could to save her life, I had hope until her last momemnts...

It's so painful to lose your pet, it's a source of UNCODOTIONAL LOVE which is so rare in humans.

She was always there for me and I did everything I could to make her happy, healthy, satisfied with life.

I used to see her everytday, to take her for a walk, to play with her, to have her stting next to me when I'm reading or doing something... Since age 11, since my childhood.... I used to take care of her, to feed her, to give her medications for her heart issues, take her regulary to the vet anytime she felt bad.

I miss her. I miss her smell, her voice, barking, scraching my door to let into my room, the noise she made when she wallked... I miss the way she stared at me, with love, I miss cuddeling with her in winters... it's going to be the first winter without cuddeling with her... without her. Home is so empty without her.

I saw her suffer and I saw her dying, it's so traumatic. I took her to the vet 3 times before she passed away. I had some hope that she survives. In the end her suffer was so intense, she cried out of suffer and she was about to pass away... I didn't want to believe it, I hold her huged her, kissed her, smelled her, said her that I love her... I took her to the vet for the last time and he said that there are no chances to save her and she's about to die...

I burried her with her favorite blanket, I hope I burried her good enough, I hope no one would find her and detroy the small grave I made. It was so painful to see the dog who was your best friend for 16 yers dead, The dog who was so active and playful, and now is so still, so lifeless. Forever.

I feel her loss in each breath I'm taking, my body is aching. EVERYTHING I'm doing reminds me of her loss. Reminds me that she isn't alive. I can't eat. My life with her was perfect and now my life seems dull, empty... I don't know what to do.

At least I have familiy, yet, my relationship with her was unique and it got better as she got older.

I feel so lonely in the world without her.... without her presence, love... I lost a soul friend.

My familiy also broken hearted. She had a different special relatinship with each of us.

Everytime I was stressed, mostly by other humans at work or my personal life, she was here to comfort me. Now I'm in pain because of her loss and I want to hug her and get comforted by her out of habit but I can't.

I believe this loss will be less painful with time and I will get used to living without her at some point, yet, I will never forget her....

Now the pain is unbearable.... this world is so cruel and it's so painful to lose such a pure 
beautiful angel.

But she is in a better place, without the earthly suffering. She isn't in pain anymore. It's only my heart which is in pain because it's deeply attached to her. 

I'm grateful for having her in my life for 16 years, for growing up with her, for experiencing her unconditional love, for the awesome memories, presence, meaning and laughter she brought to us.

2347,y260fo,painnogainforever,"TL;DR: I‚Äôm having a quarter life crisis, I have no friends and I‚Äôm moving away from my family. I feel more alone in my life and questioning everything. How do I deal with all these emotions? Does anyone have tips? 

I went to two high schools. First HS, I had friends. Then I moved to a different time zone and they started to not respond to my texts and eventually it stopped. The second HS I was the ‚Äúfat American‚Äù. At lunch, I sat alone, with my sister, or went to the guidance counselors office. 

Towards the end of my time at the second HS, I did make friends. But it only lasted a short time. Once again, we split up and went different ways and the communication stopped. By this time I was in college doing my prerequisites for my degree. 

Group projects, many different classes, and I still couldn‚Äôt find friends or hold down friendships. At this time, I met my boyfriend. 

At the college specifically for my degree, it got worse. I started to notice the other girls already had groups of friends from the previous college and even HS. My depression was at an all time low. 

During my first semester I was crying in the hallway and a professor noticed. We went to her office to talk and I told her my feelings. Next thing I know, I‚Äôm in the deans office, I tell her my feelings, she said she‚Äôs got to leave the room for a minute. She doesn‚Äôt come back. But the police do. 

They handcuff me, put me in the back of a patrol car and I‚Äôm taken to a hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment. I was sent to another facility and I spent five days there. Here is where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. Because of this, I failed my first semester. While at psych facility, surprisingly, I made friends. We followed each other on instagram. 

One night, I was out at a bar with my boyfriend and I saw through instagram that one of my friends from the psych facility was in the area. I invited him to join us at the bar, and he said he would come. My boyfriend and I waited and waited but he never showed up. That was the last time I communicated with him. The same thing happened with a girl. I messaged her and told her I was going to be in her area. I saw she read my message but didn‚Äôt respond. Again, that was the last time I communicated with her. Then, another girl did the exact same thing to me a few weeks later. I told her I was in her area and we should meet up, she reads it, but doesn‚Äôt respond. This has happened to me three times. 

Throughout the college specific to my degree, I  made one friend and that was in the last two semesters. We texted everyday about homework or projects. Slowly, the texting got less and less. Again, we split up to work at different places and in the past five months, we‚Äôve only texted a few times. We still text on and off but it‚Äôs less than twice a month. 

Earlier in 2022, I reached out to a guy from my first HS, and we decided that we would meet up at a bar with another guy from that HS and I would bring my sister. So there were four of us. We talked, had a great time, took some group photos, and after, I texted both of them and said ‚Äúthat was so much fun. We should meet up again!‚Äù And they texted back saying, ‚Äúyeah we should! I‚Äôll reach out!‚Äù They never did. That was the only social experience I‚Äôve had with a friend so far this year. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what I did wrong. It‚Äôs been months since that meetup. 

Now at my new job, I work nights and everyone I did make friends with during orientation, work days. I can‚Äôt believe I was the only one on night shift. I didn‚Äôt know they were ALL day shift. The three of them work days together and once again, I am alone on nights. 

I do chat with my night shift co-workers but as I‚Äôve stated before, they all have a group of work friends and I see them texting and eating lunch together. 

I‚Äôm at the point in my life where it feels like everyone I know is getting married. On social media, I see people I knew in HS posting engagement photos or wedding photos, and at work I hear them talking about weddings and bridesmaids. Once I heard a co-worker say she couldn‚Äôt decide who she wanted in her bridesmaids group because there were so many to choose from. I felt horrible. I don‚Äôt even have one friend to do that with. 

On top of this, my dad lives in another country, my sister is moving to a different country and I‚Äôm moving out of my moms house and into a place with my boyfriend. 

I am having a quarter life crisis.

What am I doing wrong? Why can‚Äôt I keep friendships? I can‚Äôt figure it out.

2371,y2a7bv,ilpok123,"Been feeling really lost lately. Had a non existent childhood spent most of high school at home browsing reddit like a loser did nothing outside of school and had no phone or social media so no way to talk to any ""friends"" I made at school. All I knew was to get good grades to get into the uni I wanted which I ended up getting into. Was a program that I really wanted to study. I just kept looking forward to starting uni cuz i had hope that maybe things will be better and I can turn my life around which is what got me through high school.

Parents don't want me to live alone so we move our whole family closer to the uni so they can basically keep watch over me the whole time. In the process I basically lose whatever connection I had left with whoever I was ""friends"" with in high school. Going into uni I thought of it as a clean slate where I can do things the way I want to. Well first semester was online and I was unable to go to campus at the time so I had no friends other than whoever I was able to find on discord. I had hope again that the next semester will be better which is supposedly supposed to go back to in person.

Next semester comes along and they had to delay in person due to a surge in covid cases so back to struggling. Campus opens up and im finally able to meet my peers in person but it mostly looks liked people already made their groups and everything so it was hard for me to try and fit in with any of them since all I had were a couple people that I talked to on discord. I try my best to be friends with some people but it doesn't really lead me anywhere since it was hard to hang out with them cuz of studies and my mom constantly calling me to get home as soon as classes end. Midterms come around and I do the worst i've ever done in my life I failed them all horribly except one. I had to excel on my finals if I wanted to pass the term so I tried my best to keep up with content. Finals come along and I perform just as bad on most of my exams and it wasn't enough for me to move onto the next term. I will redo this term at the start of next year. This was the first time I had ever failed this horribly. At least I wasn't alone cuz my year had the most failures out of any year. Anyways I get in a lot of shit from my parents cuz obviously im now a failure.

I did an internship over the summer where I had to move to a different city for a couple months. It was nice to be away from my parents who are always fighting and yelling everyday so I finally got some peace and quiet. Though it got awfully lonely and I cried myself to sleep every night contemplating everything that has happened to me in the past. I have my next semester off since I have to have a 4 month period where I can't take any classes since I failed. Even though being hopeful of the future never helped I was hopeful that I would at least be able to see my friends more frequently when they go back to school and since I lived nearby I would be able to hangout with them. Well I haven't been hanging out with them much and no one bothers to message me at all unless I start a conversation. This wasn't something from just now this was happening before too. Its just so exhausting asking everyone how they're doing but no one ever asks about me or to hangout. No one can seem to make time to hang out with me but can for other people. Been feeling even more lonely cuz of this like im just being left alone.

I told my brother that possibly im depressed and he just yelled at me saying that I have nothing to be depressed about since I have so many things that other people dont have and that its all in my head. I guess he is somewhat right I have everything that ive ever wanted cuz I worked hard for it but I realized that those material items just dont bring me the happiness that I hoped they would. More like they're a coping mechanism to distract me from myself. I have almost no one to talk to about how im feeling which sucks and im lost on what to even do at this point. I have no hope left and feel like I will fail the term again which will get me kicked out of the uni which fucks my future over. I cry myself to sleep cuz my thoughts just overwhelm me idk what to do at this point anymore.

I left out a lot of details cuz i was just typing as i thought but heres a quick summary of my life for the few people who would even see this :)",2022-10-12 17:37:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/y2a7bv/lost_no_hope_left/,,0,2,lost no hope left

Covid lockdown forced me to quit college and my job. Worst years of my life. Lost contact with everyone. I just existed and that's it.

I'm trying a new college career now and hoped to start fresh and make new friends/classmates to work with throughout these coming years.

At first it was great bc all these kids (mostly 18) took me in as some kind of cool uncle - big brother who didn't judge and listened and offered advise. They did actually asked me a few times to go with them to parties and what not but it was just a big no from me (grown ass man sharing drinks at night with barely legal girls?? Are u kidding me?) But I think that was a big trigger in my distancing from them.

They still say hi to me and make small chat but I can't fit into any work groups anymore and I'm deeply ashamed of going to class, even the teachers asked where I've been (I'm usually very outspoken and used to give many insightful remarks on many subjects).

I'm not exactly begging a bunch of kids for attention but it baffles me how overnight everything changed. I thought it'd be different this time but oh well... I guess I'll just work by myself and just have to settle with ocassional small talk while I see them totally get it going and hang out and stuff...

2388,y2crdu,Slight-Dimension1729,"Just looking to talk to someone out there. My loneliness is just unbearable lately. I went through a hellish couple of years- psychosis, severe anxiety and depression, nonstop suicidal thoughts, and I‚Äôve lost count of the number of breakdowns I‚Äôve had üôÑ lol. 
Despite this Ive been working really hard on improving my mental health and it has improved significantly. I‚Äôm proud of getting myself out of that place, knowing I did it alone. During these years I found out friends and family I did have weren‚Äôt really there for me at all. One would make jokes that I should just kill myself, another said they were just too busy to be there, and most everyone else just couldn‚Äôt seem to handle me being honest about my health. My parents and siblings would just change the topic immediately when I finally opened up how bad my struggle was. Basically I saw I was always in this alone and they aren‚Äôt my ‚Äúpeople‚Äù. It‚Äôs taken me a long time to come to terms with that but I am ok with starting again. 
But now what keeps breaking me down is that nothing changes, I can‚Äôt seem to find any new connections. Nothing past superficial conversations really. the most frustrating thing is I‚Äôm trying. I put myself out there often enough and it‚Äôs been years. My job is (literally) a relationship manager and I meet with people/network at least 2-3 days a week. And I enjoy it but it‚Äôs all professional and often feels ‚Äúfake‚Äù. I am always up for anything so I go to concerts, attend dance classes, attend acting and writing classes, wander to new towns and find random activities. I actually get to talk to strangers on occasion and I enjoy it, but still nothing really comes from it. I am a single mom of three kids so I am busy but I do try to be out often. That being said I don‚Äôt mind being alone and I am SO sick of people saying ‚Äúyou need to love yourself more‚Äù or your not lonely if you like yourself, or ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be lonely if you have a relationship with god‚Äù blah blah. That‚Äôs bull****. I do love myself, I have a ton of things I enjoy alone and I‚Äôve done countless things on my own. What I need is deeper human connection. 
It‚Äôs funny (almost) because I get along well with most people I meet. I enjoy meeting people and I connect easily but no one seems to want to genuinely connect. No one wants to reach out to me, ask me questions about me.  I‚Äôve tried to stay positive and let things evolve or keep doing my thing etc. But every-time I do meet someone and it dies off it cuts more and more. 
I met someone a few months ago- they actually reached out to me and we hit it off right away. We spent a good amount of time together every week, would talk for hours each time for weeks. Then suddenly they went silent and when I reached out they said they have career goals they want to focus on and they don‚Äôt have time to also have a new friend. I just let it be. But losing this person felt like a punch I can‚Äôt get up from. I can‚Äôt keep putting myself out there because I don‚Äôt feel strong enough to handle the loss anymore. But having no one to talk to is just as painful. I‚Äôve seen a therapist, I have a personal coach - I‚Äôve done everything I know to do. 
I‚Äôm doing my best to just go with the flow. I‚Äôm far too aware that I can‚Äôt control or force anything. But it hurts. I wish it didn‚Äôt. I wish it didn‚Äôt make me cry.

2402,y2eaeh,That_damn_devil,"Hi y‚Äôall like my title says I‚Äôm a 21 year old man, have never been in a relationship nor any real dates. I did go on a date when I was 19, to get ice cream. The date went well I just didn‚Äôt feel we really clicked, and it kinda made me realize dating was stupid and I put it off. 

I‚Äôve struggled with loneliness since(and long before) then but it‚Äôs been getting to me recently. I have plenty of both male and female friends (given most of them are my male friends girlfriends) I‚Äôm decent at communicating, holding a conversation, and I like to think I‚Äôm on some level interesting. I‚Äôm not ugly, my face is nice as I take pride in my skin, teeth, and hair, but I‚Äôm overweight (I know it‚Äôs an issue and I‚Äôve struggled with it since I was 6) and I know weight alone isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for a lot of women, but years of being picked on, being the butt end of jokes, and seeing and feeling the hate because of my size, I‚Äôm not very confident.

I‚Äôve tried to be more Confident in dating/meeting people, I won‚Äôt lie and say I‚Äôve ‚Äútried everything and can‚Äôt find anybody‚Äù because I haven‚Äôt, hell the only effort I‚Äôve put in is various dating apps with 0 matches. And that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm busy, I work 45 hour weeks, I write as a hobby, I dm for a dnd group, I sometimes participate in sports, and play video games with my friends and brothers (just because it‚Äôs not productive doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be busy) so the actual amount of time I have for a relationship isn‚Äôt a lot. And because of that I know a relationship probably isn‚Äôt in the cards for me right now. So I feel kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place (possibly another rock).

On one hand I‚Äôm not confident, I‚Äôm self conscious about myself and my body, I have anxiety and panic attacks, and I don‚Äôt really have the time or energy for a
Significant other.

But on the other hand I‚Äôm extremely lonely most days, i see my other friends happy in relationships and marriage and feel inadequate lacking that, or any experience with it, and I find it hard coping with the idea of dying alone.

I know it happens when it‚Äôs meant to, to ‚Äúwork on myself first‚Äù, and that I‚Äôm not entitled to anything or anybody. But that‚Äôs not what this post is about. I just want to vent about it because I feel I can‚Äôt communicate with my friends or family about it without feeling like they‚Äôre minimizing my feelings as I don‚Äôt know anybody else who ‚Äústruggles‚Äù with dating, and they just don‚Äôt get it.",2022-10-12 20:18:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596064194,9,/r/lonely/comments/y2eaeh/21m_never_been_in_a_relationship_stopped_trying/,,0,1,"21M never been in a relationship, stopped trying at 19.

2405,y2ekvo,PrimateOfGod,"""Common symptoms of a quarter-life crisis are often feelings of being ""lost, scared, lonely or confused"" about what steps to take in early adulthood.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis#cite_note-6) Studies have shown that unemployment and choosing a career path is a major cause of stress and anxiety in young adults. Early stages of one living on their own for the first time and learning to cope without parental help can also induce feelings of isolation and loneliness. **Re-evaluation of one's close personal relationships can also be a factor, with sufferers feeling they have outgrown their partner or believing others may be more suitable for them.**""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life\_crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis)

I am personally one who's going through a QLC, I regret having been introverted my whole life and not making relationship connections at an earlier age - maybe then I'd have better social skills, maybe then I wouldn't be so lonely, maybe then I could feel love.

But then again, maybe I could've been just as socially inept - I've only recently started working on improving my social skils, and it's definitely a work in progress, but it's something I want in life - to be more friendly and start bonding with people: friends/partner. So I might as well try when I have some time.

Maybe I would've stilll been lonely. People can feel lonely in relationships if there is no true connection.

Maybe I would've been unable to have true love, maybe I'd fall into a crush on a different girl but I would feel obligated to stay in the relationship I chosen when I was younger and less mature. At least now that I'm single I can ask out any girl I'd like, and if they reject me so be it, it's better then not having that choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe being single all my life was the best option for me. I've developed my true personality, I know who I am, and I have opportunities not chained down by a partner.",2022-10-12 20:29:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1480309243,3,/r/lonely/comments/y2ekvo/optimistic_perspective_something_that_made_me/,,0,0,Optimistic perspective: Something that made me happy to be single in my late 20's

You ever feel like an accessory friend? Like, if theres a movie or party to go to, and you're always the one left out? Or you ever walking with who you consider your friends, and everyone else is talking, and you're just listening? Just embedded within your own thoughts because there's nowhere else to be? If we were about to go on a rollercoaster,each cart sits two people, there's 7 people in the group, and you're ***always*** the one by themself? You have someone who you'd call your best friend, but at the end of the day, if they had to pick one person to only talk to (not including family) you know it wouldn't be you? You're just another person to them. The worst part is feeling the slight warmth as if you belong, only to get home and realize those people wouldn't answer the phone if you called them. They wouldn't call you, and now you're just lonely again, craving that desperate warmth you felt a sliver of earlier that day. At home by yourself, parents at work until late, just laying in your bed and maybe doing some last minute studying because you can't find the motivation to do it when you get home. Then you check instagram, see on everyone's stories the pictures they take of you and your friends! Oh wait, you're not in any the pictures. Or getting tagged in the posts. Wait, you're in one photo! No, you're just in the background, not even noticed. Replying to everyone's story just to feel like a slight connection is there.

No one is thinking about me. Surrounded by all these people, and yet still so alone. Just delivered/seen text messages, dimly lit rooms, sad dinners alone, and dreadful schoolwork. Nothing to look forward to, so close to the life I desire yet so far. By myself, by myself, by myself. Alone. And I don't even wanna get started on the girl I have a crush on.

I'm from India and already people have a fucked up mental health here. The suicide rate rise like 26% in the recent years and still no one is concern but you will literally find every third person depress here. It is more like a common thing and no one wants to willingly work in it. 

As a kid, I was highly intelligent. Spent like 6 hours to study, overachiever and thing. But it didn't last longer and at this present day I'm left with nothing but as a failure. And yes, I'm a failure. And it's not a bad thing to accept it. 


I didn't had a much traumatic life but a boring life for sure. My parents never support me to participate in any activities, never encourage to invite my friends or socialize. They just make me live, live, and live. I won't say I never had any potential, I had alot of them. But they are wasted now. I have also wasted my childhood by exposing to the dark side of some effed up things. 

I spent my most of early teen years in lockdown. Almost two years. I shifted my school before that so never really got time to socialize much. I go to school now, but it's no better. As I'm in the supposed-to-be-higher standard, we are made to study straight up for hours. Without any activity, with really bad teachers, and no opportunity. 

What hurts me more that it's not just me who feels it, but the whole class. The whole class. 
I know I'm wasting my teenage years, but what else I can do? I always thought and still think getting into a romantic relationship will make me absolute happy but life isn't a highly capitalist idea movie. It's so hard to maintain healthy relationship. In fact the idea of getting happy is just a false idea created by those who enjoying every part of their power. Even I do belong from the elite class, which makes me sad. Not because of me, but because that how some people have just the worst because they don't have money. I get professional care, only because I have money. It's not free. 

I can't focus, have no dedication, and no it doesn't work like ""oh try to find, do this that"" I can't. We live in a such a daily system that everything is just a competition. Nothing I do feels like I'm doing for fun or myself but for a competition because why? Capitalism. Call me a fucking communist because I'm but hell yeah. We arw made to fuck ourself so more. 

Now that I'm 15, after few years I will be 18. To get enroll in a good college I have to study my ass off in the year 16-17 because so high competition. I know the field and college/uni I might be going will be full of people who have been exposed to urban life or atleast a social life. And will definitely be better than me. I will left way too much overwhelm. Also I won't be getting any support from parents because I'm not going to become who they want me to so job in early life for hours just to get money. Then what? Everything will be same. I will slowly become old if I survive, and I will die.
I'm honestly scared to face life, I don't have any guts to face it. The one who made life was cruel, the system we made life is cruel. I don't think so we were meant to be happy ever, and if there's anything after death it will just be nothing.

I know other people feel like me but we're just not in the same world, we live different lives, even if it might just be my neighbor
It's just so hard to communicate 
It's like there's this social etiquette, things you can do, things you can't do because it's ""weird"", + social anxiety makes things so much worse.. and even if you don't care about breaking the weird, you just don't know how to do it.
There's all these people in my life or that were in my life that I would like to speak to but even the ones I could get to it's just too weird I've got nothing to say except hey I remember you I think about you, it's so difficult to go through life and see everybody, or because you're the one that's leaving, I just have no idea how to cope, people leave and people change and things don't come back to the way they were, change is good but it also sucks that you can't go back and forth.
We can have so complexe emotions but we can't really share them, you can say you're sad but there's a million different sad and the other person just can't really feel it (I mean I guess it's better if it doesn't spread !?ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) Still I wish there would be a share button so other people could understand, even for just a few seconds, because there are things that are just too hard to express. 
I guess I could easily find other people on the internet, but the thing is honestly I've got nothing to say.. and we'd just be staring at a screen still and living worlds apart, might as well watch another millionth movie. 

I've got a couple friends I'd like to be with and that I think would be okay with it too but it's just too complicated, I wish we could teleport, it would make things so much easier, you'd be alone in your room at night and feeling lonely and you could just snap your fingers and not be alone anymore

I never really share anything on the internet, I never comment on YouTube, my last FB post was like 8 years ago I think, when I was just a kid, even though FB is a bit out of breath now, and I'm also a lurker on reddit, this is my first post.
So there : I don't know why I'm sharing this, I don't know what to expect, I don't think there is anything I can expect, it's been a long time since I have this feeling and I'm often reading things on the topic but I guess I just didn't have the revelation yet. I struggle a lot with social anxiety and general anxiety disorder, and depression often..  and adhd.. and probably a couple things more. I'm surprisingly functional in all fairness, I get on with life and I do what I need to do, I make plans for the future, but there's just this emptyness and this anxiety and insecurity that follows me everywhere, loneliness catches up with me every day, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what to do and so I'm just not really happy. 
I still feel things and I'm joyful at times,  there's things that I love, I really like when people interact with me even if I dread interacting with them. I'm really trying to live, but right now I'm really half alive. I don't think I'm made for this world. My brain is unable to process it

For one to give up 
Is not a choice one wants to make
It‚Äôs a choice they feel 
Is the only option left they have

Taking their life 
Versus those that hurt them
Affecting themselves
Verse those around them

While both choices have different outcomes
They both affect others
In a way unintended

For one to give up is not easy
It‚Äôs not a weak move
It destroys the person 
Until their is nothing else left to choose

I was once him, I chose death
now being saved I am forced to deal 
With those that  where not
And remember those I loved 
I respect life for I know death
It‚Äôs not something I wish on anyone 

For life and death are lovers
Life gives death gifts
And death keeps them
Forever

My best friend was murdered earlier this year and it... its hurt every single day since. I almost drank myself to death just to stop feeling lonely. I had my girlfriend, of course, and she was as supportive as she could be and she still does her utmost to be supportive now. It just isnt enough and I can't tell her. I talked to David every single day, all day long through text, to the point we both almost lost our jobs because of it. And now... its gone. Only one thing got close enough to even making up for what I lost, a woman I will call Dreka, simply because I don't want to give her real name on here. My girlfriend and I are poly, she has a girlfriend but I never did anything with it. I had David to fill any part of my life my gf didn't, which was just the constant presence. But Dreka came into my life in Feburary, before David died but she was just a coworker then. Worked with her for a day before I got moved to a different school in the same system. She was a manager at different school than the one I worked at but she  needed help that day we met and I volunteered. I didn't see her for a long time and in that time i lost David. Then in June was sent Dreka's school to learn how to be a supervisor as that was the job I was going to take on once the 22-23 school year started. Over June I fell in love with her and in July I told her. She was receptive and in the time since our relationship has grown. My gf is completely fine with this and has even pushed me to ask Dreka to be my gf as well. I haven't yet but thats neither here nor there. Dreka has... she became what I needed in my life again. We talk almost everyday, but there are times where I don't hear from her. And I understand, she is an adult woman with a child and a full time job, I can not and will not believe that I take up as much of her mind as she and my gf do of mine. And it... kills me to understand because I don't know how to be alone. No one talks to me the way David did, no one texts me every day, multiple times an hour, building a world that only means something to us. I don't have the strength to be alone. I work out so i don't think, i still drink so i don't think. I cant stand being alone like this. Its killing me.

I just want friends. I want to be like all the other girls and not stand out. I want to hide. I want to just sit in my room until the end of time.   


Why should I eat? Why should I be a real person? Why. Why. Why.   


Some kids at school don't even know my name and hate me. They don't know my gender. They don't know what I think. They don't know I want to hurt them.

2466,y2lshu,you_are_pushing_it,"I'm so weighed down. I am in the middle of a battle with cancer. I'm on oral chemo and I still have 75% of my hair so I don't get the sympathy or leniency that others seem to get. I'm sure that comes with its problems but it'd be nice sometimes to get a little help with things. It would feel good to know that someone recognized my pain.


I'm going through a divorce that we both wanted to be done with a year ago. I need the medical benefits so, for now, we are still legally married. We both have new significant others. Which is fine.


My current partner has been going through a mental breakdown for 7 months. Broken up for 2 days here and there‚Ä¶maybe 5 times. It's put me on eggshells. I think he loves me but I don't think he cares if I'm in his life. He has told me as much.


My 9 ¬Ω year old daughter is struggling to read. I've read to her every day since she was in a crib. Tutors. Fancy schools. Practicing phonograms. Nothing has worked. It's killing me.¬†


My mom, whom we live with at the moment, is in her late 60s and is leaning toward dementia. She's forgetful and anxious to the point that I have low grade panic attacks when she unloads on me at least once a week. Self-medicating with leftover muscle relaxers, benadryl, or anxiety meds from friends.


I worked my ass off to support my soon to be ex while he went to school and then worked even harder when I went to college. Taking the least amount of student loans. Missing out on internships because I had to work or take care of my kid. I graduated 2 months before the covid lock downs. My kid stayed home, so did I. I'll never get a job in my science/tech based field. I tried to pick something useful and universal but without up to date experience, im not worth much. Glad I worked so hard for the 3.9 GPA.¬†¬†


My oldest sister is an alcoholic with the maturity of a child. I get calls from her when she's in the car, lost, drunk, crying. The right thing to do is call the cops but I just want to get her home. She used to be an outlet for me. Now it's not fun to be with her. More like being a babysitter.


My Dad and middle sister died about 7 years ago. I am lost without my Dad. Not that he would do things for me or make my life easier but he would help things make sense. He somehow made things clear so I could make decisions and progress. That feeling lingered for a few years but it has faded now. The whole family leans on me to take up his rock-like position in their lives. I'm not strong enough. The cancer killed him too.¬†


I just want something to get easier. I want to feel loved and secure with my partner. I want my kid to be able to read her math problems. I want my car to run smoothly. I'm at a breaking point where all these wants are turning into needs. It makes you desperate for goodness. Or desperate for the end. Sometimes I don't take my medicine for days because I don't see a point in beating the cancer down.¬†


If anyone is still reading and wants to talk, I'm really not that big of a downer. I'm smart and clever. I know movies and music like a mthrfkr. Idk. I needed to say this.

2472,y2m6cv,KINGIN4K,"The title explains it. I just feel like i dont fit. Im always the one who is a side character, an NPC that nobody really loves and cares about but is still there bc it has nobody else to be with except with the main players. I have no friends, nobody to talk to or play games with. I havent even had any real friends before. Im 17 now and never had anyone who was a real person near me wether it was irl or online. Those from middle school just left and u could see that the friendship was forced, and now highschool, i feel like all other kids are dumb, act dumb and childish, prase alchohol and smoking and sex too much than they should for their age... Like I would rather lose my V card with some a bit more special than just a one week partner in a fake and cringy relationship. I dont consider myself that ugly... But i do look worse than 90% of other people around me. I think my personality, my bad traits, my unfunny and unsocial ass is the problem along with looking worse than most people around me. Like im sorry i dont act how u expect me to! If people like you gave me a chance while at younger age meaby I would act diffrent and would follow the social rules without even thinking of them. Im sorry that i have diffrent opinions in my life than you do! I dont wanna follow the social standard if i see that something is bad for my personality, bc i dont wanna be like others! I really like chess, and many dont know how to play and hate it! We dont have chess club or group in school! And I love tetris!  I wore a tetris shirt which was black with tetris letters in one of its cubes and the letters were in diffrent colours just like tetris is, and everyone thought it was a shirt for LGBT!!! They dont know what tetris is! And their music taste! Why is this world so plain and unfair and boring! Why cant i find someone inthereasting, someone who will understand that even if what i say might sound rude, that they will get its sarcasm or joke or that i dont really mean what i said! Or someone who will understand that if i make a racist joke that im not racist! Like wtf? People all around the world are racist and now you are judging me bc i told a racist joke? Like dude chill out! I love everyone equaly! I wish i had more friends online! Like i wish i was also in a server in which i hsve fun! But im always nervus to say anything bc i know when i do say something, 99% of the time no matter how much i pay attention, i say something in a way people will take as insult or something negative. And if its not that, im sfraid that i wont be funny, bc im not and im sfraid that nobody will like me and be happy to see im online like i saw in some servers! Im just not comfortable but wish to be! And i need time and i need people to stop ignoring me! I hate those servers where people people say its perfect for introverts and crap, and when u join, boom, bunch of people talking and spending time together not even noticong I joined and i feel awkward to say even a word! And somebody else joins and the whole damn server greet the person and make them have fun with them. Like wow, perfect for introverted and sfraid people (sarcasm). I would love some relationships, even if they are online. And i hope they last more than a month... Does not need to be sexual and with pictures and reveal  or whatever. Just someone who i can point my feelings of care and passion to. Idk what to do anymore. Im lost in this world. I just feel like i hate everyone bc the more i try and meet people the more hurt i get. I really also like games and history, cats, i love furry stuff, i love winter! Its my fav part of a year. Idk... I just wish i had friends. Any friends who i can be comfy with, so i can show that im not really that bad as i may seem and that my personality is not as it may seem like, and that my huge ego is just there to make myslef feel better for having nobody to talk to... I really hate when im texting someone and they just ignore or take ages to respond. Like i know u have a life, and other people, but if you are talking to me try not to also talk to 10 other people at the same time... Like wtf... Thats what i hate, when people just reply late or dont reply at all... And dont even try to have convo...
Idk what else to say. As i said, im lost and i have no hope. If any of u have a server or wanna be friend or something else please dm me. This is more of a vent than a seach for friends, but i would never reject a petentional friend. Thank you if you read all that.

2473,y2m9kg,[deleted]," I'm looking for a unique type of friendship. I'm tired of putting on a mask and not bein myself. You know the feeling, I'm sure. Whether it is for work, for our family, for those around us, or for significant others we all put on some type of face, act a bit different than we wish we could, and have to hide our true selves. Well no longer, I am looking for someone to write with, someone to befriend where we can be our true selves. Where there is no fear of judgement, no worry about what the other person thinks, just honesty and acceptance.

There are things in all our lives that we think, that we want, that we hope for that we have to keep to ourselves. I am hoping that this friendship that develops here pushes all of that hiding aside and we can come out and hold nothing back. Talk about the topics you've always wanted, try new things, share stories and secrets you've keep locked away in your mind, and just get them out in the open. It will feel so freeing, like a weight lifted off of our shoulders. What is something you've been holding onto.

This isn't just about finding new friends, although getting to know someone at this deepest level is so rewarding and a whole heck of a lot of fun. No, this is getting out from behind ourselves and being brave, putting ourselves out there, and enjoying being out of our comfort zones. I feel like reddit is a perfect place for this as the likelihood of meeting or having any overlapping circles is astronomically low, so why hold back. And being penpals and new internet friends is the perfect medium because it lets us get the words out that we've never said, but always thought. We all need that friend, we all need that outlet. The stress just builds and builds, and it becomes so blinding, that we start to not feel ourselves at all.

It is a big ask, I know that, but it is a bold ask as well. We all say we are an open book, but are we really? This is a call to find some friends to write with and open up our books to pages that have never been read and share parts of our lives with one another, building foundations of trust, and enjoying making a new life long friend!",2022-10-13 01:56:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,,7,/r/lonely/comments/y2m9kg/34mus_a_friendship_that_goes_all_in/,,0,1,34\M\US - A Friendship That Goes All In

2480,y2mwwh,nopnopnopBE,"I'm in the latest year of university now, and actually only have a few courses left and am planning to start working soon. So I'd argue I'm not even a student anymore

I'm very sad right now.. until secondary school, I always got along with everyone really nicely but never had a ""friend group"" to do stuff with outside of school. Going to university was the same story to be honest. I had a friend group but only ""in"" school, and this time I didn't even get along with them so well. Now 5 years later and I'm 24 years old, and I feel like I completely missed out on the ""partying"" and ""socializing/making friends as a young student"" part of my life. And it's fully on me, it's not like I never took initiative, but it wasn't succesful and I definitely didn't do enough.. Covid did not help either

I can't stop thinking about it. I wish my head was full of fun social experiences (like festivals) right now like everyone elses, because honestly I very much like going out and drinking (I can count the times I did it on 1 hand though). But instead, it's so empty and I feel like I missed out on the entire thing. I have a lot of regrets

At this point I feel like there's something very wrong in my mindset. Why do I care so much about missing out on this, isn't the future what's important? I really wish I could somehow flip this around but I can't. I've been laying awake in my bed and been down for a while now.

I know I can be a fun person to hang around with, but it does get a while for me to get comfortable with a group of people. I don't know how I can find new friends at this point and build this up, and it feels like im too old anyways now and it's too late. I also would not know where I could find them

I'm not sure where to go from here. How can I move on from this, and could this void inside me be filled up? I have no idea. People must think I'm fine like this, but I'm absolutely not.

Despite using all their ingredients i am unable to make good coffee at home so I headed towards an employee/store manager to ask him what I could do better. Trust me, my only intention was to ask him about COFFEE!! 

We started speaking and i told him my issue with making a decent-tasting coffee. He asked me where i lived so i told him. He said he lives nearby. So this is how the conversation went. 

ME: ""I have tried everything, can't make a good coffee at home. Nearest Starbucks 10 miles from my place so cant come everyday""

Him: Where do you live?

ME: I live near XYZ

Him: I live there too. 

ME: Yeah thats the same area, still you live about 7 miles away

Him: If you want, i can drop the coffee at your place. 

ME: Wow really? Its so far away from here. That would be very  impractical. But thank you though, that was very thoughtful

Him: No really, I am not kidding. I can drop your coffee to your house. 

Me: That would be very unnecessary. You can however help me make a good coffee at home

Him: Yeah for that i will have to come to your house and see all the equipment.

2537,y2svft,betznerb2018,"Hi, im a 26 year old male. Just to get that out of the way. 
I don‚Äôt know where to start this. I feel like ever since I graduated highschool (2015), I‚Äôve kind of dissociated from everyone I knew growing up. I tried to be everyone‚Äôs friend, but I always felt truly close to a handful, 2-3 at most usually. The year before that, in 2014 my best friend passed away, and 2 years before that was the end of the last relationship I‚Äôve had in practically my whole life. 
I constantly blame myself for how it ended, like I feel responsible for what had happened in the breakup, but I‚Äôve never been able to grow past it, because I‚Äôve never had a relationship since then. I try to get with someone I‚Äôd consider a partner and always get rejected.
Now, im trying to reestablish connections with people I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years on facebook hoping something will come out of it, but it never feels like anything changes.

I‚Äôm always distant. I never feel like I can reach out to anyone. If I do, its fake or im just being desperate. I can barely even reach out to the people I do consider my friends. I always feel like if I don‚Äôt put in the effort, they would just leave and the friendship would just end.

I‚Äôm afraid to open up, and I feel like no one would care even if I did. Which is almost more alarming, trying to surround yourself with people that care about you when no one actually does. 

It‚Äôs like no one see‚Äôs me for who I am. People see me for what they want to see.

Meanwhile, I just feel alone. I want genuine connection, but it feels like no one believes in that these days. 

I think I‚Äôm okay with being alone, but it‚Äôs not always easy.

I‚Äôve realized yet again that I have no friends. I know that people like me, but they aren‚Äôt real friends. My two best friends never text me first. They actually are both pretty mean to me too.

Tonight (Oct. 13, 2022) I‚Äôm up at 2:30 AM and was watching videos of cancer fighters ringing the bell. I cried out of joy for them, but then I cried because nobody would be there for me if I rang that bell. When I watch those videos sometimes I wish I was fighting cancer, that might make me a horrible person, but the thought process goes like this; if I had cancer people who felt bad might be nice to me and then be my friends. It‚Äôs so horrible to think that, cancer is horrible, but I‚Äôm envious of the love and support people get. 

Even if that happened to me, nobody would care. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt alomst a year ago. Nobody cared. People weren‚Äôt sad at the thought of losing me. Nobody thought that I mattered enough. Not a single call or text saying ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

No romantic partner. A few 'transactional friends'. I feel they dont like me at all.

We had a board game night in the hope we might get chatting again and she hardly spoke to me. I felt I was always trying to make conversation only to get nothing back.

The morning after I killed myself, I woke up.
 
I made myself breakfast in bed. I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.
 
The morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.
 
The morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.
 
The morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors‚Äô yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.
 
The morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.
 
The morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.

As you know, Halloween is approaching, and what I surprise, I'm probably gonna spend it alone. It's the first time I have no one with me during my favorite holiday, and damn, it hurts. The worst is that all of my friends are going to a party, and of course I'm not invited. Even if it's one of my closed friend who's hosting it. 
I told my ""friends"" that I'll be alone, and they couldn't give less of a fuck, to be honest. They brushed it off and started talking about how awesome the party's gonna be. In front of me. I'm really tired of being all nice with people who don't even like me. But I gotta stick with them so I won't hang out completely alone. I'm kinda just here, switching between friend groups and being ignored.
I heard I'm not invited because I'm always on my phone all quiet. 
But when I try to interact or talk with people, they either ignore me or look at me like I'm a disgusting creature coming right from hell! What am I supposed to do?
I guess I'll just sit on bed, watching jojo for the four billion time while crying.

2612,y37a3q,QuizzyP21,"22M‚Ä¶ Yesterday after a doctors appointment, I decided to drive up to my old community college since I was in the area. It‚Äôs about a 20 minute drive from my house and the latter half of it is on a road surrounded by trees in the woods. 

I used to make this drive everyday just a couple years ago, and it was so meditative. I would just get lost in it. Yesterday, I put on the same album I used to always listen to on the way up and back, and I recreated the drive perfectly.

All the feels came back to me. I wanted to get out and walk back onto campus. During the drive and since, I‚Äôve just felt kind of empty. I honestly didn‚Äôt even like my life much at that point in time, but today I would do anything to go back.

I‚Äôve completely wasted the past two years of my life. I‚Äôve been doing school remotely, made no new friends, and my current relationships are getting less and less satisfying.

2626,y39up1,Treehugger1221,"28F (29 in December) this is really embarrassing but idk what to do and hoping maybe someone can help. 

Essentially I‚Äôve had anxiety since I was around 6, depression since 19 but didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what was happening until failing some classes in college. I got help (therapy and medication) at 22 and needed it off and on to eventually graduate college then vet school last year. When I was 26 I discovered I‚Äôm asexual after my first relationship failed at 25. (So obvious late bloomer) My therapist at the time also helped me figure out I dealt with some mild sexual abuse as a child too. 

Fast forward to now and despite figuring these things out and graduating school‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still struggling a bit more than I care to admit. Not nearly as bad as when I was in school because I have time and money to devote to some hobbies. In the last year I‚Äôve lost 40 lbs (antidepressants and an endocrinopathy screwed up my weight) and still want to lose about another 30 but I‚Äôm losing motivation. I also don‚Äôt have any friends. I‚Äôm involved in church and go to meetups occasionally and plan to start volunteering but overall nothing concrete has come out of it despite having several acquaintances. I‚Äôve also online dated off and on for years but only dated 2 guys and both lasted 1.5 months before things ended. 

Being so lonely all the time is causing depression/apathy. It‚Äôs pathetic but I cry at least weekly now sometimes for hours. I have a couple online friends I text daily, I lead a Bible study every 2 weeks, and I see my personal trainer twice weekly. I also try to do things for fun even if that means going alone (last weekend went to movies and art festival). But living like this is really wearing me down. I don‚Äôt even know if this is something a therapist can help me with. I did talk to one back in June for 2 months as I wanted strategies to cope better but she essentially kept saying just be patient and I‚Äôm doing the right things. 

Idk what to do. There‚Äôs a new therapist I think I‚Äôd mesh well with. But idk if it‚Äôs even worth it at this point. If you got this far thanks for reading. Like I said I know I have no reason to feel like this.

2630,y3a0s2,thrdisposable,"Sometimes when it's dark outside and I'm completely on my own, I wonder just how many of the people who all vaguely remember that I exist will lie about prioritizing me in their lives if I suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth. Dying is not something I'm worried about ‚Äî I have plenty of things that people can try and remember me by. But provided that I'm not in a freak accident or get sick from a terminal illness, I can only ever see myself dying of my own volition, preferably in a way that doesn't leave behind some awful, gruesome mess. It's definitely not happening anytime soon, but somewhere down the line, when my life inevitably gets darker, because I don't see myself getting out of this or mending this in a reasonable way, that just might be the moment.

I resent people. I resent them for being better at meeting people than I am, for not caring about what I can do for them, for always having someone else on their priorities further up their proverbial social ladder than I am. Every single time I find myself in a new environment, I try not to repeat my mistakes and I try to be more proactive in socializing, but I'm always too late, because everyone ‚Äî *everyone* ‚Äî finds someone they deem more important than me, and it just keeps continuing. I spend so many days alone and convince myself that this is better for me, or drown myself in my work, only for everything to suddenly turn dark and remind me that no one is rushing to be here with me, or that no one cares enough to be anywhere with me. The funny part is that this doesn't even upset me. So many people here talk about crying when they feel this, but I've felt this for so long that I just quietly feel like shit. The last time I broke down over this was nearly a year ago, when I wanted things to change desperately, and nothing did, so it's not like having an emotional response to anything that has to do with my loneliness matters anymore.

I think of disappearing sometimes. Nothing¬†‚Äî being in nothing, feeling like nothing ‚Äî probably feels better than constantly being reminded of how needless I am to everyone else.

I know there‚Äôs got to be someone out there that I could be with. But I‚Äôm just so defeated feeling, because nothing ever works out. The closest I‚Äôve come to an actual relationship was a two and a half month situationship this last summer with a guy who I now realize was a complete asshole and I shouldn‚Äôt have stayed with so long to begin with. I‚Äôve gone on so many first dates and then the other person isn‚Äôt interested, a handful of second dates before the loss of interest, and only twice have I had 3 or more dates with someone. 

A month ago I went on two really good dates with a guy my age who I felt really compatible with. But he ended things between us because he said he was just too busy to sustain anything. Even though it was super early on, I just felt super compatible with him, in a much more genuine way than I have with any previous dates. And I just felt like he was exactly the type of person I should be looking for, especially in comparison to my (a lot of the times awful) past partners/dates. 

Idk. I‚Äôm just really bummed still about that. Like I finally felt like I found someone good for me, not just that I was putting blinders on and infatuated with for no reason. I usually become infatuated with people and it‚Äôs such a toxic cycle for me of obsessing over guys who I think are hot but are jerks, and then being distraught when things end and I get hurt.

I have a few friends and majority of them are fake.
One of these friends was really depressed and suicidal, one day i got a phone call from the suicidal friend (who i had liked for around 2 months) and she was on the side of a bridge ready to jump. I was around 2 or 3 miles away from this bridge and i knew i wouldnt make it there in time so i stayed on the phone with her and managed to talk her down from jumping. Afterward i imidiatly told her i loved her and she felt the same way. We started dating and 5 months later i found out from a friend of mine that somebody raped her and thats why she finnaly tried to kill herself. I soon found out who did it and threatened to beat him half to death. My girlfriend at the time stood up for the rapist and dumped me because i was ""too violent"". The rapist has since moved so i couldnt find him and the girl whose life i saved picked a rapist over me then ghosted me for almost a year.

Im not entirely over her because she is the person who made me the happiest man ever and i loved her soooo soooo much.

Recently i tried to contact her and she is ignoring me.

That's all I ever feel nowadays, like a waste of someone else's resources, whether it be time, money, energy, I just feel they could've used them for anything else but me. I know it's just mental illness. 

Shortly after turning 16 I reached out for help for the first time, I got put on anti depressants and went to therapy once every 2 weeks, that only lasted for 4 months, then I suddenly stopped taking my meds, and just dealt with whatever I felt on my own. Smoking excessively everyday after school. Then at the start of the 21/22 school year, I was living ""alone"" in the city at 17 and very depressed, the first month of school was okay, didn't miss a day or a class, and the month after I started skipping a class once a week until it progressed into staying home all day smoking, missing class, and then it happened, i was in trouble for missing so many days and I had to move from the city I grew up in to stay with my mother and grandmother in the middle of nowhere. And this move has been a blessing and a curse. I tried to keep in contact with the very few friends I had through social media and video games, but that kind of connection has never been my thing, I always preferred hanging out in person that  online, but this was the only way. After 2 months of no school in the the new year 2022 I started going to the local high school, which has a tenth of the students going there than my old highschool and this new school is k-12, and grade 12 classes had like 2 other people in it. My self esteem is rock bottom so I don't even try to talk to the other students, i just do my work and leave. After failing grade 12 this year and trying again now, idk if I'll make it, I've completely lost hope for myself, and I feel like I have nothing going for me. How will I ever move out? How will I make money? I live in a place with 1 gas station nearby and that's it, and I couldn't ever get a job there. Fuck this I dont even know if this makes sense, I am not in a good headspace

Dating is different for me and that is the reality. Not just because I‚Äôm bigger but I also don‚Äôt want kids. But my friends refuse to acknowledge this. Denying it and saying all dating is the same regardless. Then why am I still single and the rest of you are happy and in love? I know I sound bitter and I am. I‚Äôve been comfortable alone. I do everything alone from traveling to events. But it‚Äôs exhausting. 

The past year has been a vicious cycle of my friends setting me up on blind dates. Trying to get their siblings into me. And I hear the same thing every time ‚ÄòI actually just got out of a serious relationship so I‚Äôm not looking for anything at this time‚Äô and I think that‚Äôs just the polite way of saying I‚Äôm not into you.

Quick background: I came out as a transwoman over 5 years ago. At the the time, my partner and I were already not doing so well and we split up. I have been alone ever since. I am in my very early 40's now and I have no biological kids. 

I do have some friends, but not very many and almost none that live here in town. Over time we've all moved to different locations. I've made a couple of friends here, but none that really hang out with me regularly. I miss having a partner. I miss telling someone about my day and listening about theirs. I miss cooking and having dinner with someone, going to the movies, playing games with, cuddling, holding hands, kissing, etc. I've joined different groups around hobbies that I like and do, but I haven't had much luck there. I joined the groups for the hobbies, not specifically to meet people. I've tried dating apps, but people only seem to have one thing on there minds there so I got exhausted trying to deal with that.

I guess I'm just venting. I don't feel like I'm doomed to be alone forever or anything, though some days it is much harder to deal with like today. I wish I had friends to game with or go to the movies with. I hope someday to find that right person as well. One can hope.

I'm a 36 female living in a small rural town. I have a lot of social anxiety. My two best friends both live on different sides of the country, and I only see them once every few years.

Even when I was working and going to school I didn't make many friends, and they didn't last once the pando hit.

I live alone. Recently my cat died. I had her 12 years and she was like a best friend. My only 2 friends in town died of covid within the last 2 years.

I don't know how to meet people here. I've lived here my whole life, and I quit hanging out with pretty much everyone a few years ago when I got clean from drugs.

ok so first off I feel like women need to understand that, most men as children were shown unconditional love by their parents and or siblings.

Now imagine your 17-18 year old man, you just left for college or you just moved out and started working. But the reality is that once you step outside the comfort of your home as a man your emotional and mental well being ceizes to matter. Because from the point on your on your own.

everything good thing you do will simply be boggled down to to the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù or simply just be expected of you. and every mistake you make will be reminded by everyone for the rest of your life. And according to a-lot of ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù we have nothing to complain about because of our ‚Äúmale privilleged‚Äù and this just to make friends

as a men if your seeking to have a sexual or romantic relationship with a woman, its becomes 100x lonelier.

I dont like to compare male and female in general but i had a guy tell me that when it comes to dating/sex majority of men are like desperate starving people that will eat almost anything offered to them, while women are like the picky eaters, that only likes specific type of food and that majority of women also pick out this specific type of food. He said he knows this from experience because he made a social experiment where he picked out 10 single average day to day men, and 10 single average day to day women. he asked the guys how many women dms did they slide under, or how many, women did they go up to talk to them in person at a party or a a bar or whatever, in the last month, And the average was 20 women and out that he asked how many were even interested in just having a conversation? and the average of women interested in even a simple conversation with them was 0.7 of them.

Then he went to the women and asked how many guys either slid on their dms or just walked up to them to strike a conversation with them in the last month, the average for these women was almost 50. and he asked them how many of those guys were they even interested in having a simple convo with. And the average was 1.2.

In conclusion for most of those guys 0.7 out 20 women were interested for atleast a conversation (most of which probably went nowhere). and for women they were only interested in atleast having a conversation in 1.7 out of 50 men that went up to started talking to them, Or slid in their dms.

at first i didn‚Äôt really understand the point of what he was saying but then he told me the reality is that majority of men will always be lonely nothing will change that fact. But then he says ‚Äúbut you can get more women to want you but your gonna have to put in extra work, by going to the gym, and getting fit and work your ass off to be coming extremely successful to get women to want you.‚Äù he said that 10 years ago he use to be the type of guy that was ignored by majority of women until he started make better money and was more physically fit. But now he can have have almost any woman he wants. so I asked him isnt he worried that they only want him for his money and status and body and he says ‚Äúno because i already know thats why they want me for, thats why i have to keep working making more money, becoming better getting more fit if i Dont she will leave me for someone with more money who is stronger‚Äù. He said it to me so casually like its not a big deal. I honestly felt sad and was worried that its the only way to get women to want you. because at the time i was in a friend-zoned with a girl i was absolutely in love with but stuck around her but not because i was hoping or expecting her to love me back but because the attention and affection she gave me was better then being alone. And i realized that their are three types of lonely men. 1st type of lonely men are the ones willing to work their ass off to offer women in exchange for affection attention and ‚Äú love‚Äù 2nd are like me who ware willing to remain in the ‚Äúfriend zoned‚Äù with someone who they they are in love with because they feel thats better then going back to being alone and last but not least, they 3rd type who just accepted that they will die alone, and their cool with that.

am i the only one who feels that way as a man?",2022-10-14 06:05:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651442958,0,/r/lonely/comments/y3lra3/i_want_to_share_some_information_to_other_people/,,0,3,"i want to share some information to other people out here specifically women because while i acknowledge the hardship you guys face on a day to say basis, but I genuinely don‚Äôt think most of you don‚Äôt understand the struggle of men when it comes to being alone."

Ever since the breakup my life took a dive for the worst, I loved her so much and made sure she was happy and cared for.
I didn't have much friends but when I was with her I didn't care for that.

Now after the break up I feel so alone, my only 2 irl friends never want to meet up ever, and the other friends I have are all online. I want to meet up physically with people, go places and do fun things but I can't. I'm alone in this shitty fucking world.

I'm doing well academically but that matters little to me, whats the point of finishing my studies to get a good paying job if I'm gonna be coming back to an empty house every time.

People always say: ""Focus on yourself, life doesn't revolve around relationships"" and yeah I agree but god damn I don't even have an irl friend to hang out with and talk to.

I honestly feel like giving up at times, my days have become so mind numbingly boring that I can't take it.

2774,y3zk7t,DepressedSamurai,"Don't really know what I'll end up doing, I've fucked up my college entrance, my mind is fucked, everyday seems a drag, I feel like a weight to my family and as I continue to live, I always wonder if it's time to give up.

With every thought of giving up comes an unbearable chest ache which won't stop for hours, will hurt my chest constantly no matter what goes on before I finally just get my mind off.

Every time I get up, my mind is bombarded with what next and at the end, there's 0 things going in my mind.
Even the thought of giving up makes me feel how helpless and awful I am to be thinking of an end rather than trying.

There's no more on my mind, just a wish to get distracted before I turn myself off. I'm not sure honestly what it means to be breathing with a purpose as now I am mostly thinking I should reap what I've sown and maybe all these thoughts are the results of the mistakes I've made in my past.

In a way, I love to get these chest aches as I realise how stupid and insignificant I am for the mistakes I made in the past without realising how big of a mess those were.

Sadly tho, I won't ever get to kill myself, maybe am a coward when I say I wanna die but don't have guts to kill myself but at the same time, I wanna see my body and soul burn till I can't even bare the pain as maybe the punishment for the mistakes.

There's no life on the road when you're walking a path while trying to curse every reason to exist just to feel the pain and continue to suffer without helping yourself or get helped.

And sure ive met a few people by doing this, but none actually stuck around as friends, none wanted to hang after the fact.

I tried accepting that maybe thats not reality. Maybe even those of who you'd think have these great social lives and weekends that feel like movies, spent most weekends at home, or atleast not out doing stuff.

But when i check these people's social media. Even those i know, its always filled with these great fun things they do. Large group of friends, heading into town to paint the town red. And all with a hangover to share the next morning. Or they go to a concert, a festival, Oktoberfest, anything they want. Every single week, without fail.

And you scroll a bit further and see their lovely vacation that they shared with their friends. Grand Eurotrip all packed in a little hippie van touring through the country side of France or Spain. A summer to never forget.

And you sit there, behind that screen, and you realize just how pathetic your life is. How you have never had an experience like that. What you thought was a facade, a rare occurence, what you long for, theyve already experienced and will continue to do so for the time being. While your clock runs out.

     Recently I have been thinking a lot about my connections with people and my life. While doing this I‚Äôve started to struggle with the fact that I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. Or people to talk to in general. A little background to my situation is that I haven‚Äôt lived a necessary normal life. I dropped out of high school at 16 and was put in a rehab that was more of a cult. I was in that program from 16 to 18 until I was old enough to not have to worry about getting sent to another rehab for leaving. I did struggle with minor substance abuse issues during my early teenage years party because of my home Situation. I got my GED when I was 17 and have been employed full time and living on my own since 16. I did eventually move back in with my family reluctantly at 19. After leaving the program that forced me to stop talking to anyone from my life before the program. I was exiled and nearly everyone I talked to had blocked me and stopped talking to me simply because I was no longer in the cult program(enthusiast sobriety you can read about it online). I‚Äôm now 20 and work at an auto restoration shop with one other man who is 63 years old and a mentor of mine. But outside of work I have a fairly non existent life. I got home eat food get ignored by my family and watch tv for an hour before going to bed to do the same thing the next day. Weekends are especially hard because there is nothing to do other then wait for the week to start again so I can go back to work. I have no friends and don‚Äôt even know where to start looking for friends. I don‚Äôt even see people my age in the world and the ones I do are so consumed by the internet and their own life‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt even think twice about meeting other people. I have this awful feeling of being alone and not able to share any of my emotions with other people or enjoy the presence of like minded people who are of a similar age and understand the world I live in. I want to move out again but with how expensive the area I live in is it is impossible without atleast 1 roomate and still hard without 2 Roomate‚Äôs. I feel as if I‚Äôm stuck and unable to do the things I want to do because I have no one standing in my corner there to support me or help me or even just be my friend. I hate the internet for ruining the social skills of everyone in this world. I just want to know where I can meet people who aren‚Äôt completely self consumed and want to be friend with people and help people the way I wish I was able to.",2022-10-14 19:14:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637913324,3,/r/lonely/comments/y42l80/20_year_old_m_with_no_friends/,,0,4,20 year old m with no friends.

The man thought of the stories, where lone wanderers would eventually find their light in others, that reaching arms of hospitality should lift him from his desolation as it is often told. Yet no one came, as of course, it was mere fantasy. Love? ""Love is a fool's tale"" thought he. As far as he knew there has only ever been the superstructure of each society and civilization: this is the essence of all laws and ethics subject to each individual. ""It cannot exist"" and even if it did, It was no matter. He could not see these laws, for it was too dark far out in that wilderness and he was too far gone from the embrace of his village. He was in effect: removed from the laws. From all stretches of the horizon he could see dunes and swept sands atop the remains of old paths. Day and night he awaited salvation only for the cold bitter irony of damnation to make itself present with a cold embrace of malice that would reach for him like arms of shadow from each corner of the horizon -- as fleas in the nearby desert terrain, manifestations of hellish thoughts would swarm the man, digging to his very soul with great relentless fervor in the quest of extinguishing his remaining faith, faith in himself and in humanity.¬† The small entities would return in onslaughts under the curtain of each twilight -- tormenting him. 



Another night had fallen in place of dawn as it had many times before and about came by some strangers with faces of disdain as if they were disgusted with the sight, as it had boded a bad spirit among them. They uttered: ""O woeful thing, can you not look above your ridge and see that tree? It is dripping with the sweet taste of honey! Enjoy what life hath provided thee! Drink and be merry, for tommorow we die. Forsake your yearning for salvation, you shall never find it, taste and be at ease"".¬† And they wandered off to find a tree of their own. Though still shocked by their words, as he found it unusual for the passer-byers to ever interact with him, he granted their advice some merit, and without dragging his decaying carcass too many inches, he stuck out his tongue as to taste of the drippings above the corner of the ridge, and indeed it was good. For a great many times it had become his escape, to enjoy the simple¬† offerings of the tree. This had harkened an age of escape. An escape from the night, and escape from the lonliness, and from the despair, for once the man had felt fulfilled. He had given an oath to himself that would spend the rest of his life under the ridge tasting of the sweetness of the sap and remain conformed. Yet inevitably what was once intoxicating and seemingly pure for a little time more, had eventually become bitter and stale. The pleasure had passed and the sap would no longer satisfy the thirst. The thirst ran deeper. The sweetness had become stale and the man despaired as the seasons went by.¬† The tree above had lost it's purpose and decayed even quicker than he, it blackened and withered away with the winds of time, and so had the man's heart at the distraught. ""From whence shall time judge my spirit? O terrible fate that is to live, can I not even taste the purity of thy pleasures O nature my mother?"" He cursed the men who had sold him hedonistic delusions, he cursed the stars above, and the Earth below for his newfound betrayal. The silver crow which had always been standing faithfully by, then began singing as it usually would at the sight of such an episode, the man was deeply offended by the sound, the sound produced a sense of dread in him and he flung a rock at the blizzare thing nearly striking it. It scoured away. Nature, man, and fate had further and further became the bane of his existence. The night came and he had felt despair as never felt before. And fell into deep slumber.



Far away from that time the skies became incandescent once more, seemingly ages had passed his skin had grown pale and the sunlight would now burn him in excess fury, yet his heart had become like solid iron as if it were cold and untouched for ages burned instead by the blizzard of the dark abyss which lied at his center.¬† He thought: "" I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false."" The passing of time had become convoluted and the sun and the moon had become a single wheel of damnation going about and about prophesying of his death. ""Do even the heavens testify against me?"" Again and again, the same story was told, with each celestial orchestration further instilling madness in the man with endless repetition of it's torturous symphony. With each carefree steps of the bystanders passing by, with each footprint marked in the sand as a monumental print on his sanity. The dance of the heavens had become a death clock, the mere steps of his kind had become a dagger to the heart. Round and round went the celestial stage. ""I have grown sick of the honey of life which have only diverted my eyes from the dreadful truth around me!"" Echelons of time passed and the melancholic scourges of his nihilistic despair had picked to his bones and skin little by little. Until eventually nothing was left, and deep inside beyond the bones, blood, and flesh, lied his soul -- not beknown to him -- being forged by his passing death. He never gave in. As all other things were lost to decay and the rot, one thing was still untouched by the dark. One thing barely defied it, growing spiteful, growing bolder, growing courageous by each nightfall.¬† Though the grace of fresh water had not touched his lips, for he no longer had lips, or the company of allies his sight-- he no longer had eyes, he cried one last time in rare boldness as he spited even death as he gazed a last glimpse towards the sky and succumbed to his last breath, yet for once, with faith. Deep in his mind he moaned for a God he did not believe in saying: ""I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood the sand below with tears; I drenched my bed of rocks with my weeping. My tears had been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, ‚ÄúWhere is your God where is your solace, where are your loved ones, where are your allies? Where is your home?‚Äù¬† Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?‚Äù¬†As with a deadly wound in my bones,¬†the abyss whispers ""where is your God?"" Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Why do the heavens make a stage of my torment? Why do even the angels forsake their gaze at my cries?""



Then came a bright flash of white, as though his body were shedded away from his thoughts. Then as he could somehow perceive his surroundings once more, in a matter of seconds he became accostumed to the environment around him. He recognized he was still under the accursed ridge, yet he could now feel the Earth below and the heavens above, the heartbeat of every star, their movement, the mass of every molecule around him. Everything -- quantified to the smallest level, he could see, he could comprehend. The desert around him had miraculously flourished and become a lush forest, he could feel the grass itself embrace his feet with compassion as each individual strand would speak incomprehensible wisdoms, and the wind which brushed against the branches of the endless expanse of trees were likened to a crescendo in harmony. Everything was embued with a brilliant light -- with incomprehensible purpose. He emerged spooked and disoriented and stood out from under the ridge, then looked above where the tree once stood tall. Then he heard a voice, stupified -- he felt the words of that silver crow which had always been beside him time and again, it directed towards him. It was standing in place of the place of the old tree with wings like branches and talons as roots, now as large as an oak and it spoke:¬† 

"" I grew up before you like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; I had no form or majesty that you should look at me, and no beauty that one should desire me. I was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces I was despised, a King was I yet I wore a crown of thorns.¬† Bourne was I of humanity's griefs and carried of it's sorrows; yet man esteemed me stricken, smitten even by God, and afflicted. I was wounded for man's transgressions; I was crushed for their iniquities; upon me was the chastisement that brought you peace. With my stripes you are healed. All men like sheep have gone astray; have turned‚Äîevery one‚Äîto his own way; towards chasms of indviuation, to worship of their self and of mammon, and laid on me was the collective iniquity of it all. Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I AM; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Know that the world hated me before it hated you. I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. Man shall not live by mammon alone, but by every word that comes from the spirit of the logos. Blessed are ye poor in spirit, for yours is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are ye meek, for ye shall inherit the earth. Blessed are ye who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for ye shall be satisfied. I will wipe away every tear from your eyes, and¬†death shall be no more,¬†neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.¬† Behold, I¬†am making all things new.¬†I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.¬†To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. And thirst nevermore you shall."" 

A veil was lifted from my sight and saw the figure manifested there above me, and I saw clearly a cross with a man hung upon it.¬†¬† ""Son of man, can you make these dry bones live?""¬† asked I. 

One man had died that sorrowful night, and another was born not of flesh or of bone, but of spirit.",2022-10-14 20:41:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604584944,2,/r/lonely/comments/y44ny4/peace_is_on_a_razors_edge/,,0,1,Peace is on a razor's edge
2807,y44srh,47462i474o1,"For the past 18 years of my life I have never once opened up to a single person.

My parents never amused the sense to stimulate a want to associate with them, let alone talk to them about anything.

Moving countries also made it quite difficult to fit in with people I do not share anything in common with.

Being a lonely teenager who liked to play video games in a place without a single person sharing my interests was quite boring tho I never pitied myself, quite the opposite, I always thought I was cool since I hung out with people online who didn't even know my real age.

I'm luckily not the most unattractive looking person, but I've created a pattern that never lets anyone truly interact with myself and somebody who regulary ignores others on purpose.
That has led to quite a number of potentially wonderful relationships/friendships never truly forming in the first place.

Only after being in a dorm have I truly begun to realize the scope of my loneliness, as I never talk to anyone unless I have to.
I don't use social media nor do I consume any meme or trendy content so relating to me is (imo) quite difficult and boring.

When I'm not at the dorm, ¬æ of the year, I usually spend days on end without interacting with other people.
Obviously you might assume that my parents must be an exception, tho I am unsure if our total conversation time would add up to 5 minutes throughout the week.

I'm unsure how I feel about my current state of being.
This has been a standard for me for my entire life.
I am not physically unhealthy as I regulary go to the gym and excercise.

I just wanted to let this out of me as I'm laying in my bed.

2809,y456px,TheBiggestBootlegger,"Yesterday I was lucky enough to get tickets to a film screening where the director and an actor from the film (who happens to be my favourite actor btw) will be present for some sort of Q&amp;A, and maybe there even will be time to get an autograph afterwards. The event will take place tomorrow. You probably think I'd be completely overjoyed with the prospect of seeing my favourite actor, and I know I should be - and in a way, I'm genuinely happy. 

What puts a damper on my happiness however is the fact that if it weren't for my mother, I'd have absolutely no one to go with me because I don't have any friends. So I'm going with my mom because someone has to drive me there (my vision is so bad that I can't drive a car at night).

2817,y46vj9,yogabear312,"I left my husband two years ago and moved back to my hometown. I hate everyone here. I‚Äôve been sitting in my room alone for two years straight, watching endless tv and playing video games. It was a mind-numbing escape for a while, but recently it‚Äôs just not enough.

I miss intimately knowing someone, and I yearn for someone to intimately know me. No, not sexual intimacy. Personal, emotional intimacy. I just want to someone to care about me. I want to tell someone how much they mean to me, and have those feelings be reciprocated. 

During these last two years, I‚Äôve worked really hard to learn to love and accept myself. I‚Äôve learned how to physically be alone. But being emotionally alone is a whole different game. I have so much to say, so much I want to talk about. But there‚Äôs no one to call, no one to text (besides my mom). I‚Äôm ashamed to admit I have imaginary conversations sometimes, just to remember what my own voice sounds like. I‚Äôve bought so many plushies and squishmallows, just to have something to snuggle at night. Please don‚Äôt judge me. 

I built up the courage to make a dating profile on Hinge. Got a match with a guy who has shared interests, and we were both looking for a long-term relationship. We talked for a week before making plans. Good morning and good night texts. Instant replies. It felt right. So I went on my first date in over 7 years. We had great conversation and tons of laughs. The next day I was at his house watching Hocus Pocus 2 and we were cuddling. He was giving me little kisses on the nose and forehead. He ran his fingers through my hair and scratched my back. It felt surreal. I was blinded. 

We got together again a couple days later, and we slept together. This was my first taste of physical intimacy since I left my husband. And yes, he knew this. He asked me to spend the night at his house, and I did. The next morning he was acting different. Basically shoved me outta the house. He had to get ready for work, I understood. No kiss goodbye. This was 4 days ago. I can count on one hand how many texts I‚Äôve received since then. 

I got conned with sweet kisses and cuddles. Gave up the cookie and now I‚Äôm back to being lonely. I feel like a fucking idiot, falling for the oldest trick in the book. 

Either that‚Ä¶ or I fucked up somewhere. Maybe my breath stunk. Maybe I‚Äôm too awkward. Maybe I farted in my sleep, idfk.

Maybe he just doesn‚Äôt wanna commit to ‚Äúused‚Äù goods. I mean I was only married for 5 years, but somehow that still makes me ‚Äúless‚Äù.

i only have 2 friends and we‚Äôre all supposed to be best friends with each other, but i‚Äôve never felt so far away from people before. they don‚Äôt tell me anything, like when they get a new job or a new s/o or a promotion. they just kind of let me find out for myself and then act shocked when i didn‚Äôt know. aren‚Äôt things like that supposed to be communicated between best friends? and we never talk unless i text first, and when they do text it‚Äôs only about drama happening in their lives, but a friendship to me is being able to talk about any topic at any time. i‚Äôve told them this before and they said that they just don‚Äôt see the point in talking about mundane stuff because it‚Äôs not important. we haven‚Äôt hung out in months and i feel so alone cause they‚Äôre my only friends. we don‚Äôt hang out unless i ask to so i stopped asking to see what would happen and we haven‚Äôt seen each other in person since.


one of my friends said the reason she barely talks to me is because she was jealous of my friendship with our other mutual best friend but we never even hang out without the other so i didn‚Äôt understand why she was jealous, and she also has 2 more best friends outside of me that i don‚Äôt know. she told me she would try harder to be a good friend but she doesn‚Äôt even make an effort so again i didn‚Äôt understand why she said she was jealous.



both of them have best friends besides me and i feel like they like them way more than me. i always make myself available for them and offer advice the best i can when i can. i try not to be mean or rude and we all get along well, and when we hang out in person our conversations are never dull. but when it comes to outside of us hanging out in person they‚Äôre bad at communication but it seems only with me? with their other best friends they mention how they call/facetime them but tell me they don‚Äôt like to talk on the phone. it makes me feel so shitty and like i‚Äôm a bad person or they‚Äôre just staying friends with me out of pity. ik i‚Äôm nd but i don‚Äôt want to be treated as if i‚Äôm being babied for the sake of my feelings. we‚Äôre all adults. i wish if they didn‚Äôt like me anymore they‚Äôd just say so instead of ousting and alienating me.",2022-10-14 23:58:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/y496k5/i_dont_think_my_friends_like_me_as_much_as_i_like/,,0,4,i don‚Äôt think my friends like me as much as i like them

2849,y4ao0t,Ashamed_Cut731,"Does anyone else get lonely, especially around holidays/ halloween. Well, I know I am friggin miserable. Lately, I¬¥ve noticed a pattern that the only times me and most of my friends would hang out and talk, it¬¥d be because of my initiative. Ever since I stopped reaching out to them quite a few people haven¬¥t talked to me since summer. Other times, some of my friends invite to me stuff, because I said I was sad ( this wouldn¬¥t usually happen), or say stuff like no one else is going to do fun stuff with me, which makes me feel as if I¬¥m only invited because I happened to be there, no one else would go and just for the sheer convience. Goddamn, it has happened that we¬¥d be on our way somewhere, and they¬¥d make other plans, leaving me behind. This completely broke me. I¬¥ve never felt this fucking disposable of a person, as if I¬¥m nothing more but a clump of cells to fill in the space, and a number on a tax report card. I kept telling myself that I could just do things by myself, which may be nice, but holy shit do I sometimes wish I could share certain experiences with someone. 

I¬¥ve already had to spend some holidays alone, which fucking sucked, and may be the reason why I¬¥m overly sensitive to being alone on holidays. Im almost 22, and I¬¥ve never been to a halloween party, the part that sucks the most is that halloween is my favorite holiday, and yet most of the time, I¬¥m by myself. This year is no different, I wish someone geniunly wanted me to come with and dress up together, instead of only inviting me when I say that I¬¥m a bit sad about not being invited, which makes it just sound like pity.

2850,y4aqqd,[deleted],"Over the course of the last 6 months I have had a falling out with every single person in my life I deemed a friend. I've been struggling for years now with myself. I feel like people always leave me no matter what I do, and I do these irrational and horrible things to people to try and get them to stay. The ultimatums, the lies, the manipulation and eventually it all caught up with me and they all realized the kind of person I am. Now for the past couple of weeks ive been in complete isolation. I come home from work, say hi to my parents and tell them work was okay when it never really is and then I lock myself in my room from that point on until I work again. I'm aware of these destructive behaviors that have been tearing apart my relationships and friendships for years now and I keep trying to change but I just cant. I mean well at the core but I say hurtful things to people I love in these spurs of anger that feel completely uncontrollable and they make me feel so weak. At this point forgiveness from my friends is out of the question. I need to find a way to survive alone so I dont keep hurting everyone I love and turning them into people who hate me that I watch from afar. Some people have told me im sick, others have said im just a shitty person. I miss my friends but most of them were very reasonable and in their best interest to cut me off. But being this alone just doesnt suit me well. Its my birthday in 13 days and im finally going to be of age to drink and most of my friends were older than me. We all had plans to go out the night after my birthday and go to a local bar and then the club afterwards and now my only birthday plan is to sit alone in my room smoking and drinking and to be honest I think thats going to be my plan to get me through life for a very long time. I cant cope anymore. Being this alone and angry and full of regret is just too much for me. I feel alienated and alone and it just doesnt end. I want friends. I want to feel like a real person not an empty shell of my own thoughts that I don't think are normal thoughts to be having. I cant keep living like this hopping from person to person hoping they'll fill my emptiness but I have no choice.

2851,y4asqy,TitaniumNeuts,"This might be a long post but I'll try my best to summarize everything in the last paragraph if you're in a hurry. So just a couple days ago my family moved abroad to Uganda. My Step Dad got a job with the US foreign aid service (USAID) and it's required that you move abroad to a different location every two to four years to help different countries governments become self sufficient (and to establish them as trade partners with the US, go figure). I'd lived with them up until I was 19 years old when I graduated high school and moved away for college, about six hours from home. However, I had been hiding a plethora of emotional issues (including at the time undiagnosed depression) I had before I moved out and I didn't last long out on my own. After about two months I had to move back in with my parents for my mental health. After moving back in I went through a really rough rut in my life. For almost nine months I had no job, no girlfriend, lost interest in my hobbies, and only saw some friends very occasionally. For those nine months, my family was my lifeline. I've always been incredibly close with all of them; so close that they feel like a piece of my very being. They're not just my family, but also really really good friends if that makes sense. Yes, they did raise me and always tried to guide me, but they could also just talk to me like a friend. I could tell them anything and joke about anything with them too. I think it's safe to say that if I hadn't had a family like them for those nine months then things could've turned out very differently for me, and I'm forever grateful for that. Anyways, my Step Dad found out he got the job for USAID about a year ago at this point and told us the news that the family would have to move abroad. It made me a little upset to hear it but it was so far away that I didn't really think about it and everything continued on like normal. I got a new job and started work again, I applied at my local community college and started taking some classes I enjoyed, I met a girl I really liked and started a relationship; everything seemed to be looking up. Cut to these past two weeks, and the move is creeping up quickly. I had already made a decision that last year to stay home and try to find my own place because I felt a fair amount of guilt for basically doing nothing at my parents expense for nine months and thought it was time to really try to become independent and prove that I could tackle life on my own. It all made sense in my head. I have a significant other who I feel incredibly close to, work and class to attend, other hobbies to take a shot at- it would be easy, and now was a better time than ever to try this, because this time I don't have a safety net. However, I severely underestimated just how much not having my family around would change my mood. To put it simply, the day my family left was agonizing. I'd been spending the last week straight with them, just trying to soak up all the time we could get together and also continue working on clearing out the house. It all happened so fast, and it felt like there would never be enough time for us. Finally they had to leave, and we all said long and tearful goodbyes. After watching them drive off, I went back into our empty house and just cried my eyes out. I could see the house with all the furniture and my family in it clear as day in my head, and then snapping back to the reality in front of my felt like a nightmare I needed to wake up from. The feeling of loneliness was overwhelming. I just paced around the house crying, walking from room to room. Suddenly, having a totally clear day ahead of me was terrifying. What would I do with all this time? How can I go from having such a loving bunch of people around me to a bunch of time alone? It just felt terrible, and for the next two days every little thing reminded me of them and made me feel starkly alone. Now, let me just clarify right now, it has gotten a little bit better. I've settled into my apartment a bit more, I've been seeing my girlfriend which has helped a lot, and I got to keep one of my family's cats with me which eases the feeling of loneliness when no one's over. But there are a couple things I'm still struggling with. For one, I simply don't have a lot of friends where I live. My best friend lives about two hours away and visits me (and vice versa) every now and then, but other than that I don't really hang out with anyone outside of work or school. I've had a lot of trouble making friends since my depression started at 19 and it hasn't gotten much better. I just feel like I need a larger social support system where I live if I want to make it on my own and feel okay in the long term. Second, as of now, I simply can't envision a future where I just can't see my family for months at a time. I'm just too damn close to them. If I had to move out but they were staying in town that would be one thing, but the fact that they're completely absent from my life outside of texting and FaceTime makes it a whole other ball game. 

(To summarize: family moved away to Uganda, I feel I don't have enough friends where I live and can't cope enough without them to make it in the long term)

So, what I want to ask everyone here is: Do you have any tips for how I can ease the feeling of loneliness without my family here? Do you have any tips for starting to make more friends and hanging out with people outside of obligations like work and class? Has anyone gone through a similar experience and found a way to make it work?

2863,y4bw18,[deleted]," I'm looking for a unique type of friendship. I'm tired of putting on a mask and not being myself. You know the feeling, I'm sure. Whether it is for work, for our family, for those around us, or for significant others we all put on some type of face, act a bit different than we wish we could, and have to hide our true selves. Well no longer, I am looking for someone to write with, someone to befriend where we can be our true selves. Where there is no fear of judgement, no worry about what the other person thinks, just honesty and acceptance.

There are things in all our lives that we think, that we want, that we hope for that we have to keep to ourselves. I am hoping that this friendship that develops here pushes all of that hiding aside and we can come out and hold nothing back. Talk about the topics you've always wanted, try new things, share stories and secrets you've keep locked away in your mind, and just get them out in the open. It will feel so freeing, like a weight lifted off of our shoulders. What is something you've been holding onto.

This isn't just about finding new friends, although getting to know someone at this deepest level is so rewarding and a whole heck of a lot of fun. No, this is getting out from behind ourselves and being brave, putting ourselves out there, and enjoying being out of our comfort zones. I feel like reddit is a perfect place for this as the likelihood of meeting or having any overlapping circles is astronomically low, so why hold back. And being penpals and new internet friends is the perfect medium because it lets us get the words out that we've never said, but always thought. We all need that friend, we all need that outlet. The stress just builds and builds, and it becomes so blinding, that we start to not feel ourselves at all.

It is a big ask, I know that, but it is a bold ask as well. We all say we are an open book, but are we really? This is a call to find some friends to write with and open up our books to pages that have never been read and share parts of our lives with one another, building foundations of trust, and enjoying making a new life long friend!",2022-10-15 02:11:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/y4bw18/34mus_a_friendship_that_goes_all_in/,,0,0,34\M\US - A Friendship That Goes All In
2864,y4byrr,givemethetea87,"I'm 27 and find myself very lonely. I feel like a big issue I have with making friends and meeting people, is just the area that I live in. I rarely see anybody outside, the few people I do see are always older couples and families. I never see anybody my age, let alone someone who I'd have something in common with. Nothing is really walkable here, everything is very spread out and car-centric with a lack of public transportation. The weather is really bad with long, bitter cold winters that make it damn near impossible just to be outside for more than a couple of minutes. Things are mostly rural with some suburbia mixed in, the closest city is like an hour drive and I hate going there anyway as the crime is really bad and the city is ugly. There's never any interesting events, and definitely no events targeted for people in my age or demographic. I've lived here my whole life, so I can say that there are no interesting places to see or visit around here. Probably the most interesting thing in my town is the grocery store and that's not an exaggeration. It's just really depressing here and I feel that most people I do come across are even more miserable than I am. 

Obviously this makes it really, really challenging to meet anyone. I just have nowhere to go. I've been thinking lately about just moving somewhere else, to a different part of the country with nicer weather, better people, and more things to do. I'm so tired of living here. However I'm also reminded of the fact that I'll be away from my family, and also it's a lot of work to move somewhere else, trying to find a job and locate housing in a place you aren't familiar with. And there's also no guarantee that things will be different...but I really want to try this out anyway.

Most of the time we talk, then after a while they just stop responding that much even though I try to initiate a conversation. so I just stop texting  and then the cycle begins again with another person

So I downloaded some dating apps(Tinder,Bumble, and a useless one called MeetMe) and so far it's made my anxiety worse.
I keep checking the apps with no matches and when I eventually match w someone they don't talk
Even Bumble, where the Girl messages first, is worse. I've had 2 matches and none of them talked to me.

I know I'm not definition of tall, dark and handsome, believe me, I know. I'm not the tallest, the most handsome, and I'm definitely not rich...yet..hopefully, but damn. I just feel kinda stupid.
Some people might say I'm self-depreciating but I'm just saying the truth. What most girls want is a big dick or money. Or both. It's pretty sad considering that what I'm looking for in a girl, is that she's a girl. I know. That's low. But it's where I've gotten to.

In my mind I've even said ""hey maybe I'll send nudes(without my face) and they don't even need to send back"" but still nothing.

2899,y4fik6,PresentationAfraid64,"I am below average in the looks department. 

I know because I've overhead my parents talking to each other about how I'm not the good looking but would probably be fine since I'm smart and have a good job. I had a breakdown over my looks last year and my own parents console me with ""You are not hidebous! You are average! Don't worry, there are girls who will see you're self made, what you've achieved and find you attractive!"". Context: I am 23 and my first job is in big tech. I outearn my father by at least 5 times after just 1 year into my first job.

Been using dating apps for a year now. I've gotten the premium version so whenever somebody likes me, I can see them. I've had 5 matches in total. 2 never replied, 1 matched but she wanted just a referral and 1 unmatched so I guess would've been an accidental swipe. The last girl just responded with ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Not that much"" and ""Yeah I guess"" to pretty much anything I asked. After 1 day of this and me asking all the questions, I figured out she was just being nice so stopped bothering her.

All of the above times when I got a notification that I have a new like, I felt a rush knowing somebody found me attractive. Even after those bad experiences, the rush from just getting a literal flash on my screen has not decreased. I can only imagine how I would feel if I could see people look at me with a twinkle.When I was waiting for that girl who replied, albeit with dry answers, I felt good about myself for an entire day. When she stopped replying, that went away. I can imagine what people who do actually get attention would feel all the time.

I can honestly see why it gets to their heads sometimes. I don't think they should be held accountable for that though. I would literally trade anything I have for looking good and getting all that attention. It's just such a good feeling to have somebody ""want"" you if that makes any sense. I recently came across a reddit comment where they mentioned that they pay somebody to send them occasional morning texts. I seriously considered signing up for that.

Just between you and me, I tell people I switch off internet on my phone before I go to sleep so notifications won't bother me but the real reason is I like to have that moment of hope in the morning when I wait for a notification or a text to pop up after I wake up and switch on the internet. The same kind of feeling you get when you buy pokemon cards hoping to get something good.

But really I'm just tired of the same thing always happening over and over again whenever someone catches my eye and my heart. 

Whether I'm crazy, not good enough, not of any use, not worth the time, or only worth it if I provide something in return it's always the same. 

When I say ""true love"" I'm not talking about fairytale bullshit, fate or anything like that. 

I'm talking about a truly mutual relationship where 2 people do really want and need each other. 

A relationship where both parties are willing to sacrifice everything in order to be with each other. 

All anyone's ever done besides make me see my own faults is look me in the mouth and toss me aside.

Everyone I've ever met has only seen me as a novelty, plaything, resource and in general just disposable and replaceable.

I've recently been reminded of just how deeply I want to have that kind of love, just how much I need that.

But instead I'm running away from and trying to bury my feelings while saying that I'm focusing on myself. 

There's nobody in my life right now I'm interested in, and to tell the truth I'd probably just be a cold-hearted jerk if someone did come in.

But I get it, nobody can really appreciate someone else without taking advantage of them. 

The heart is a lonely hunter, and the soul is easily corrupted by the desires of the heart which in turn poisons the mind.

I'm someone who is deeply scarred, cold, and feeling empty and alone. 

I fear being alone, I fear being unable to feel the warmth of a deep and romantic love. 

I have a black abyssal void where my heart should be.

No matter how hard I get angry at myself or try to say that I am aware I made multiple mistakes in the past, this does not seem to change her mind anymore. 

I am feeling restless, hopeless and downright exhausted from all of the anxiety and build up to when she will break up with me (tomorrow) despite multiple conversations to try to mend our relationship. I have had literally no more words, and this moment of feeling unable to control anything has taken any positive feelingaway from me. 

I am just in deep sorrow, going through all of the things I did wrong, and I am extremely terrified I will lose myself once she leaves me. Even in these feelings of anguish, I cannot even seem to shed a tear anymore. Just sitting here in complete silence; going through the situation over and over. 

I would trade it all that I have experienced just to not make the mistakes I made before. I have always carried the burden of these choices that even though they happened years ago, I have never completely forgiven myself and these continue to haunt me even though I have had sincerely apologized and spent a big amount of time in regret, trying to change my ways. But this all feels worthless, and it feels as if I am such an evil person because of her fear of me relapsing. It‚Äôs like all of these years of effort to try to be a better person has amounted to nothing. 

I want her to be around. I have told her that living with her and seeing life through is a dream for me. A dream that wants to have a good home, a simple life, making happy memories despite the difficulty and my flaws. A home built on love. Even this, cannot seem to convince her to stay. 

I cannot imagine having her love someone else, nor can I imagine myself loving another. I refuse to accept, but it seems there is nothing else that I can do. I am just so saddened by this; and it has already affected other aspects in my life and I dont know what to do anymore. I am so surprised at how easily she can say that I will be able to find someone else, but no matter how much I try to convince her that she is all I ever wanted, she just doesn‚Äôt believe this anymore.

2936,y4ks63,Ilalu,"The long short of what I want to share is my experience with the famous advice every lonely person has been given, it goes along the lines of ""learn how to be happy with yourself  and focus in bettering your life and everything will be fine"" or something similar, in my experience  such advice is probably incomplete or misunderstood, I have worked long and hard to get to the point where I can say I am content with my life and by all objective metrics, except the social one, I am doing pretty well .Still I have come to realize that the advice probably doesn't mean if you do this then your loneliness will disappear, what I think it means is that if you improve yourself and do stuff you enjoy you will get to a point where the loneliness becomes unobtrusive, it turns into the background, always there but most of the time unnoticed and while it remains unnoticed you can be happy and feel at peace.

As I said while my loneliness remains unnoticed I can be content but when I do notice it I feel sad, I know it's simplistic but sometimes it's better to convey the meaning just with a few words, loneliness attacks might happen for any reason and when they take place this low level sadness takes over, it's not enough to make me stop or reconsider my decisions, As I said everything is going well in all other fronts but the feeling of emptiness I carry around while it lasts is hard to endure. Eventually the loneliness goes back to the background and life is peaceful and I can be content again doing the things I like and knowing I am working towards my long term goals.

 So my point is, the advice does help but not in the way you thought it would, it's not to eliminate the feeling of being lonely from your life but rather a way to live a decent life with it, accept it and move forward, yes from time to time you have to deal with the occasional sadness but most of the time you get to be content.",2022-10-15 10:47:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617905453,11,/r/lonely/comments/y4ks63/learn_how_to_be_happy_with_yourself_is/,,0,6,Learn how to be happy with yourself is misunderstood advice

I don't know . I don't feel like a human. I feel like I am something else. I look in the mirror and I think I am seeing a human cause what I'm seeing there looks like , for the most part, a human. I walk the streets or I'm on a train and nobody really stares at me all that much so I have guessed they are seeing me as a human too... 

But i don't think I'm a human...i'm ...something else... i don't know what I am.  

I haven't genuinely talked to anyone in any kInd of conversation in so long that I don't even remember the last time I genuinely talked to someone about anything in person. Every conversation I've had in the last probably 15 years was me just puttin on a fake smile to land a job, or to get a person to agree to a deal or a short hi-bye from a neighbour.   It feels like all these beings around me are existing in a different dimension, speaking a different language I will never understand.

And forget the idea of being seeked out,  caringly touched, hugged or held. Or anything like that. That was decades ago. I don't think I'll ever be able to recall what THAT feeling feels like. My parents didn't even give me An idea of what that feels like. 

Now I will admit that every once in a while I will encounter someone who I'm sure is just as ...alienated... as me. And I will admit I'm guilty cause I  rarely have the courage to ' connect ' with these other beings but I almost always get cold shoulder treatment when I do... nice!

It feels weird. In a bad way kind of weird like my life is about to end kind of weird 

It feels like an ...ostracization...an alienation...   

At this point I just want to be happy cause I don't know if this ostracization will last forever.

2999,y4wnl1,Alwaysalone117,"So yesterday I was hanging out with my friends and they've found new words to call me. 

The b word, the r word. I'm actually at the point where I'm very pissed about all of this. It's just constant ""yeah your a bitch ass hoe"" saying how easy it would be to kill me, joking constantly about me killing myself. 

They left me at Walmart and thought it was so funny I had to walk home. Then have the nerve to tell me to buy them pizza, when I buy the pizza they bitched how it wasn't very good as if it was my fault, not even a thank you. 

They make fun of me for not having kids yet, and laugh at how I never been with a girl. 

The r word is constantly used to refer to me. 

I'm in college and they make fun of me for it. Constantly telling me I'm an r word for going to school and pursuing an education (they are both high school drop outs) saying I'll never be shit and I'm a loser. 

There day usually consists of sitting around smoking weed and watching YouTube videos. 

I'll try to have deeper meaning discussions, I'm into politics, the labor movement and philosophy. I'm also into technology. 

If I talk about anything that isn't ""yo look at this Instagram girl damnnnnn!"" I'm a r word. 

All their conversations are about sexualizing women, and even to the point they sexualize girls under 18 and say ""they don't care"". They even told me how they sexualized a 16 year old in public, and she told them she was only 16, and bragged about how they told her to shut up and they do what they want. 

They even claimed she must of been talking to me (because I tell them to stop sexualizing women 24/7) and that's where she got the nerve to stand up for herself. 

I'll even attempt to call them out and they always say it was just a joke, but to me joking about fucking children isn't very funny, maybe I'm not the norm though. 

They make fun of me for saying women are human beings, literally a bare minimum stance to have and they say that's why I'm a virgin. 

Even when girls are around, the bullying cranks itself up to 11 and they begin calling me a b word and r word even more and talking down to me every single time I open my mouth with giggles and laughs from the girls. I'll never understand why women have sex with them.",2022-10-15 19:38:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661031282,9,/r/lonely/comments/y4wnl1/friends_basically_bully_me_constantly_what_to_do/,,0,31,"Friends basically bully me constantly, what to do?"

My husband has a form of dementia that left him without any short-term memory and very poor executive function skills.  He has lost the ability to steer his brain and cannot access language well anymore either.  It‚Äôs like he is there but also not there.  He has no initiative, cannot hold a conversation or make choices, is unable to provide feedback about his own needs, etc.

We love each other but I am basically all alone in his presence.  He seems fine to outsiders, like maybe he is just quiet, but I have to do all of his thinking for him and he can‚Äôt give me anything back.  He is locked in the perpetual present moment all the time.  He gets up to do his own bathrooming independently (thank goodness!) but is unable to tell me if he feels hungry or cold or bored or tired.  If I ask him what he would like to eat he cannot tell me. He looks at me and I know he is in there, but if I ask him if he wants chicken or beef he can‚Äôt tell me.  He no longer has access to the brain tools/skills needed to form a response.  If I set him up to watch a movie, when it is finished he does nothing.  He just floats inside an uncontrollable brain, observing his own thoughts as random windows floating by as if he lost the keys to his own mind.  He can‚Äôt use any technology or kitchen appliances. He does not understand that he is broken.  

I can give him love and joy and happiness and have been doing so for years, but he cannot give them back to me.  He doesn‚Äôt reach out to touch me. He doesn‚Äôt comfort me if I feel sad.  He is like an adult-sized toddler who does not interact the way we expect people to.  If I tell him my thoughts he cannot comment thoughtfully or in any way that makes sense.  He is easily confused so he cannot be left unattended.  I must manage everything for him.  I am with him 24/7 but I am the loneliest person in the world.

3018,y4zp2g,tinyjedii09,"Hi. I didn‚Äôt expect myself to ever seek help or express myself like this on reddit but hey, there‚Äôs a community for everything.

I‚Äôm feeling very depressed recently, my life is not exactly where I want it to be and I am working on it as much as I can but money is a big and scarce factor in this. Usually I try to make the absolute best out of my situation but honestly I think I need let myself feel a little shitty about this for a second. I‚Äôm thinking of taking a leave of absence from work which I have mixed feelings about. I so badly want to move out of my current living situation and if I take a few weeks off, that‚Äôs money I may never see but I really think I need to be prioritizing my mental health instead of feeling like a machine and trying to work in the midst of my depressed condition.

And I guess this is when I‚Äôll talk about my loneliness. I recently had a falling out (I don‚Äôt even know what to call it, there‚Äôs a lot of complexity there) but I basically lost two friends in one and I‚Äôm dealing with that and the possibility of not speaking to either of them ever again, sadly. I didn‚Äôt have many friends to being with so this especially hits hard. In addition, at work I am the youngest person there so it‚Äôs very hard to make a comfortable and genuine friendship with anyone there. I try my best but there are times I know it isn‚Äôt reciprocated and I don‚Äôt feel much from my efforts. 

I am a bit jealous of my cousin, (her and I have very close relationship and are very close in age) she‚Äôs been having great luck in her school and work environment making friends and I can‚Äôt help but wish that were me too. I‚Äôm happy for her and I think this jealous feeling is coming from my depression because I don‚Äôt often let this feeling stick with me like this. 

I will end this on a good note. I am worth good company and friendships. I am deserving of friends in my life despite my past mistakes and I can be a pleasure to be around.

My partner of 7 1/2 years asked to put a pause on our relationship about a month ago. I‚Äôve always been a very rational person, so I took the time apart in stride. It was and is super painful and lonely, but I‚Äôm getting by. I moved out with our dog, and my days are now filled with long work commutes and working two jobs to scrape by. 

Last week my sister was admitted to the ICU and has been there since. For so many major and tragic obstacles I‚Äôve leaned on my boyfriend for support, and it feels so lonely to not have him to talk to or help me get through this new challenge. I have a few friends, but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt ease the loneliness. 

I‚Äôm not even too sure what I‚Äôm looking for at the moment, maybe just someone to air my sadness, frustration and hurt to. Maybe someone to offer company because I feel so incredibly alone.

Heya, searchin for friendship :)

I'd be thrilled to find some like-minded people here as loneliness seems to be the most consistent/chronic and urgent problem I'm facing, so this is another babystep towards finding a way out.

To give you some clues on whether or not you'd get along with me:
I enjoy hiking,  forest walks, sauna, swimming, puns/goofiness, thunderstorms, reading fiction novels, self-development, learning about history/linguistics/psychology/astronomy/neurology and learning in general, pancakes, hugs, crocheting, all sorts of ball+net sports, biking, empathy, authenticity, curry, language learning, imagination, exploring new areas, lost places, stargazing, twosomeness, boardgames, tea, active breathing, patience, the scientific method, eye contact, leeway,  creative narration, playfulness, sharp minds, perseverance, movement and most importantly strong emotional bonds.

I however don't like:
The chinese communist party, wet socks, misandry, censorship and human rights violations in general, excessive alcohol, smoking, gender, depressive spirals, extreme ideologies (both religious and political), manipulation, collectivism, logical fallacies, malevolence, pettiness, radio music, astrology, 30¬∞+, dead animals, mold, superiority complexes, coffee, strict hierarchies, speech that doesn't reflect the intentions, my procrastination, wearing identity labels and mental illnesses like fashion, one-sided relationships, loneliness and alienation, superhero movies, apathy, focusing on differences rather than connections.

Feel free to text me if the above resonates with you ‚ô°",2022-10-15 22:47:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663338338,1,/r/lonely/comments/y50xck/searching_for_weirdkind_friends/,,0,3,Searching for weird+kind friends :)

Love language is physical touch.

Never been in a relationship.

Never kissed.

Never been with someone in any sort of sexual way.

The closest thing to being with a  I have was when me and my friend(18F, not going to do anything with her but physically attracted to her) were both feeling like shit and we just got into my bed (fully clothed) and just started talking and venting about how shitty things were. there was some touching. (she laid her head on my arm, I put my head on her shoulder etc..).

one time that same girl gave me a kiss on my neck (IDK why, seeing as she was in love with someone else at the time). That one kiss was exhilarating. it felt amazing and whenever i think of that moment i am both happy to be reminded that it happened and frustrated of how much such a small act got me excited.

It's not even that I'm horny. I just want to be with a girl. have someone to talk to about mine and her day. Have someone to spoil with gifts and crap. have someone to kiss and show my love to. Have someone who I can look at and be happy I'm with.

it just sucks

so many of my friends are either in or were in a relationship.

many of those that weren't, did that by choice.

I'm a relatively good looking guy and yet every once in a while i feel like absolute shit just thinking about these things.

That's it. That's the post. If you read it and feel the same way comment how you feel. I know just typing it out help me out so I highly recommend it.",2022-10-15 23:04:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619598771,3,/r/lonely/comments/y51a0g/i_want_to_be_with_someone_so_badly/,,0,7,I want to be with someone so badly.

3125,y58yt5,linkerman300,"So, the story begins in 2009 i met a guy by the name R and him and I started to hang out. three months into our friendship I got hit by a car while I was walking. I hurt my hip and back, two days later he gave me some drugs to fix it ""he was hard in to them at the time"" He was the one with the job and was the kind of person who didn't want to do stuff by himself so he supplied my drug habit for the next few months till i got a job of my own. 

  fast forward a couple of years later he moves to another state and i'm still working at that the job still doing drugs, he gets put into a rehab and i call him to support him ""not talking about my drug use at all with im mind you"" and then we stop talking for a bit because the rehab had stricked contact guidelines . 

 My other friends who dabbled in drugs also stopped doing drugs as well because they got girlfriends, or one had a bad experience with a gun being pointed at him. anyway they all stopped but i was stealing from my parents and other family which got me in trouble with the law yada yada ""i never stole from them mind you."" hell one of them i didn't do a damn thing at all and he still had done drugs with me the Christmas prior to him ending the friendship asshole. 

  anyway, frowardness a couple trips to jail and one trip to rehab. my friends where barley talking to me the one i said that did drugs with me the chistmas prior to me stopping drugs didn't' talk to me at all during my rehab stay. I finally get out of rehab ""early"" mind you and slip up once. since i was in a program they had to technically put me in jail for a week. when i say i slipped up i had maybe one pill instead of like 10 pills but a slip up is a slip up. ""they always say relapse happens in early stage of recovery"". 

  But that didn't' matter to all my friends or at least one of my friends i called him up on my birthday/ or well day after my birthday and asked why he didn't say happy b-day to me. i knew he knew it was my b-day the day before. he said ""oh sorry man, happy b-day"" i asked him if he wanted to hang out some time. then he sends me this ""sorry man i can't be friends with you any more you are fucking up to much and gone to jail to many times. i don't want to be associated with someone like you anymore."" something to that effect. i argued with him and told him it was just a slip up and they had to put me in there for process reasons. still not dice, i got in touch with the other friend that didn't talk to me the whole time i was in rehab. The one who did drugs with me the Christmas prior to me going to rehab that was five months later. he sent me this raging message on FB stating how i was a degenerate and not a good person and didn't want to deal with me and not to contact him again or he will get the law involved for harassment."" mind you i only messaged him a couple of times after my rehab stay and he sent that and blocked me. 

 Both those friendships were 20 year and 10 year friendships and they barley talked to me when i was in rehab getting my shit together. then end our friendship saying im the bad guy cause i did drugs longer then they did. O and the R guy who was my friend for 10 years who got me into drugs that also went to rehab but got support from the other two friends the whole time he was there. barley called me after this happened between the ex-friends and I and would make excuses saying they are in a different part of there lives or i don't know when i would call him or ask him why they would do this.""  so that friendship ended as well another 10 year friendship.

  So, i lost three of my so called best friends, who all went through a drug phase in there life as well,  because they didn't' like i went to jail and stole from my parents a couple of times. they didn't even bother to check in on me i always had to call them. 

 Its been 3 years since this happened I've been clean and don't even think of using drugs, but now, now i am super lonely because i have no real friends to go hang out with or chill with or play games with all because they were stuck up and thought they were better than me. 

 also, i knew I did bad stuff, but i repayed  my parents and fixed everything in my life. I'm clean, have income, savings, but not friends to enjoy this part of my life.

3126,y592bt,Exciting-Ant-9580,"I (18m) started college a little over a month ago, and I was already not in the best mindset after going through a break up from months before.

I was in the music rooms playing the piano in our dorm when this girl (18f) walks in and listens to me. At first I didn‚Äôt really think much of it and I got her number. 

Though over the next few days of texting her I started to feel something, for the first time in over a year. One night at 2 am she was sitting outside our building and I decided to join her. We had the most amazing conversation I‚Äôve ever had with anyone. And when I looked into her eyes I instantly knew I had fallen for her.

I decided to tell her I felt as soon as possible because I didn‚Äôt want to get friendzoned. But it happened anyway. She told me about how some frat guy she knew for a week played with her feelings and that she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship right now. 

I asked her if this meant that something could happen in the future and she said, ‚ÄúSince the day I met you I always saw you as a friend, and I don‚Äôt think that can change. Believe me if I could make myself like you I would‚Ä¶ but I just don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Those words pierced my heart. It shattered it into a million pieces. I went through a sort of stages of grief but without the acceptance part. This is the first time I‚Äôve felt this way about anyone in so long and it feels so painful that this is what happened instead.

And now I feel so insecure about myself. I keep asking myself why she liked that asshole frat dude and not me. 

Was I not good enough? What if I was more like him? Maybe she would‚Äôve liked me more. 

Everyday that hole in my heart grows more and more. And I know I‚Äôve only known her for a month but she completely ruined me and my self confidence. And I‚Äôm still in love with her, no matter how immature that seems. 

I keep thinking that I‚Äôm over her but then she‚Äôd come and say hi to me and we‚Äôd talk for an hour and bam I‚Äôm back being obsessed over some girl who thinks nothing of me. I feel like I‚Äôm nothing and it‚Äôs affecting school and my mental health. 

Recently I drunk texted her at 4 am asking her why she had to like him instead of me and how I could treat her so much better. She ended up leaving me on read and me apologizing didn‚Äôt really help either. I think it‚Äôs the end of it but I don‚Äôt want it to be. I want to be with her and date her and do cute stuff with her. 

I don‚Äôt know how to deal with these feelings. I don‚Äôt know how to move on. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm hurting myself even more as the days pass. Yet still I think about her (I see her) through this rose tinted filter. 

I know I sound dramatic but I genuinely have never felt so insecure about myself. I have a history with depression and I feel like no matter what I keep going back in the old hole I dug myself into years ago. So maybe it‚Äôs not her completely‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.

I feel so lonely all the time. Not just with this time but my whole life all I wanted was to have a girlfriend and to be loved. All I want is to be loved and to be held and to feel like someone actually wants me. I know college life is all about hook up culture and stuff but I don‚Äôt want that. I want something real. Something lasting. I can‚Äôt love myself without knowing that someone else does first. 

I have abandonment issues and i seek for people‚Äôs approval for my own happiness. And I guess this is one of those examples. My happiness relies on her actions. It‚Äôs goddamn pathetic. But it‚Äôs me.

That‚Äôs who I am.",2022-10-16 05:56:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594071201,2,/r/lonely/comments/y592bt/i_cant_deal_with_my_feelings/,,0,4,I can‚Äôt deal with my feelings

I've been in online college for almost 3 years now. While my classmates made cliques in the first term, I'm still here struggling to find anyone to talk to. I've reached out to multiple people, did my best to stay in touch, but they either transfer out and never speak to me again or they just lose interest. Am I boring? Am I annoying? 

Meanwhile, my friends from high school are all able to make close friends or at least a group of casual friends in college. I feel so left out and lonely most of the time. Even though I make an effort to reach out to people, it's never reciprocated. Makes me wonder if something is wrong with me. I tell myself that when in-person classes begin, it might be a different story. But considering most people around me can make friends just fine whether online or not, maybe I really am the problem?

In the past I've argued that if you feel sad you shouldn't listen to too much sad music. But I've eventually realized that when you're so deep down in the pit of darkness, you can find but a taste of peace by embracing the sadness and loneliness in your heart.

I can't help but listen to sad heartbreak songs now, or sad songs in general. It's like I'm going back to the 2006s when we all had our little emo phase. Only that instead of looking for attention and trying to fit in, I'm now truly lost in this sea of loneliness. And this time there's nobody to even watch me cry in my corner during class or make fun of me.

By embracing this sadness, I feel like it's hugging me. And I desperately try to hold on to its dim warmth, as it's the only hug I'll ever receive. Maybe I forget I'm the one suffering from loneliness while I'm listening to these songs, but when the music stops I'm back to real life, and I realize I have no one but myself, and this darkness, to keep me going.",2022-10-16 08:14:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649217389,4,/r/lonely/comments/y5b9gk/embracing_the_sadness_with_music/,,0,3,Embracing the sadness with music

3159,y5bris,MyLifeMyTale,"I feel hollow, I feel empty, I feel lonely, I feel lifeless, I feel souless and mostly I feel like a living invisible corpse in this world.

Imagine a plant kept under the sun, it grows, it survives, it becomes stronger, brighter, fuller, happy and shiny. But as the sunlight disappears from its life as if it never existed or turns out it was just pure artificicial sunlight, the plant slowly becomes weaker, loses its girth, its density, its shining properties, its inner system slowly dies out slowly killing it until it is lifeless and no more but just yellow, dry, wilted, crisp and stiff. Just pure dead which cannot be revived anymore even in pure sunlight.

That plant is me, and that sunlight is love. And I feel like I'm fading away without it. Life is empty, meaningless, boring, sad, lonely and miserable when there is nobody out there whom I could call as my person, like this is my family, this is that person I know loves me and will continue to do so and care as much as I would love her. Someone who becomes the air to my lungs, the soul to my body, the comfort to my heart and soul, the rhythm of my heartbeat. Someone with whom my life will be full of life, adventurous, funny, sweet, cute full of love, giggles, humor and cuteness. Just pure joy, comfort and happiness. 

A soul can only live until it's lifeless and it just, ....eventually breaks. Just like that saying, everyday I wake up, work or study, then watch a movie and series by myself, fake a laugh or two, eat, go back to sleep, sometimes I write novels, songs, poems sometimes I watch something. I do my best to keep myself occupied but lately, it all feels like of no use at all because you can't run away from loneliness, you can do all these to keep yourself busy and feel like you can distract yourself from it all but you know its just a lie and you cannot and your realization makes it all crash down faster than ever before and nothing works anymore at all, you feel like doing nothing, feel so sucked out of energy and life that you're laying on bed, tearing up, lifeless just like that plant was when it was dying without sunlight, losing its life slowly. And you feel like making this post to talk about how lifeless you're feeling right now wishing there ever was that sunshine of love that made you feel brighter and full of life. 

You know I've seen a lot of videos of Male cats almost dying of a broken heart syndrome without love until they find love. When animals can't go that far, then how far could a hopeless romantic human go until his soul gives up on him and he passes away or just continues to exist lifeless, dead from the inside beyond repair like that dry leaf even in sunlight.

If you read this far, I hope you're getting what I'm trying to say. Do you feel the same too?",2022-10-16 08:45:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,,6,/r/lonely/comments/y5bris/23m_a_soul_can_only_break_until_it_cannot_be/,,0,0,23M A soul can only break until it cannot be fixed anymore...üíî
3160,y5c6cu,wylaxian,"Nobody likes me that much. Nobody really chooses to be around me except for older people who don‚Äôt have many friends. I‚Äôm a low-ranking person; if you can‚Äôt have others, you could always have me. I am less valuable than other people. They see less worth in me because I don‚Äôt dress well or talk well enough. I don‚Äôt hate them for it, but it‚Äôs a quality that I see in everyone. Only the loneliest people seem to care what I think, because they have no one better to talk to than me.

If you feel the same way, I have good news. In my senior year of college, I bought a stuffed animal shaped like a highland cow. I take him along with me on the picnics I would‚Äôve had with other people. I can take him with me on vacations. I can take him with me to the doctor‚Äôs office; I can even use him like a pillow. Sometimes, I talk to him like he‚Äôs a real person. It feels like he‚Äôs listening, even though he can‚Äôt talk. It‚Äôs so much more fulfilling than having a conversation with someone else. It‚Äôs better than the few awful relationships I‚Äôve tried to have. It‚Äôs better than talking to my family.

3168,y5cvro,minetasballss,"My ex was a Christian. We met online before we met irl. He was 21 and I was 16. He was all I needed in a man. He was caring,generous,well behaved,confident,hard working etc etc. I thought he was perfect because he said that he wanted to be like God who was obviously..perfect. He said that he would never leave me no matter what. I was extremely insecure because of my past relationships and I'm not Christian. I knew it wouldn't work out between us since it was kinda a long distance relationship..I tried telling him that even though I'm pretty sure he knew but he always love bombed me and I had no other option but to stay. I also started noticing that he was very friendly with other girls but when I asked him he just said ""oh they are just my sisters in Christ"". He wanted me to change my religion qnd follow Christianity as well but I wasn't so sure so he would say things like ""You're in the dark"" .....it was almost as if he was trying to fix me like I was some filthy object that needed to be cleaned and he was doing me some kind of favour by being with me.

Despite so many obstacles he told me that he would never leave me and I believed him. He told me that Christians shouldn't do ""that"" before marriage but we ended up doing it anyways even though I didn't want to. He was so obsessed with me that he would ask me what's wrong with me if we didn't talk for 2 hours. Whenever we met we talked less and did that more and if I didn't do it he would force me to do it because ""it was very important for a relationship to last""yet I  trusted him. One day I saw that he posted pics with someone's dog. He didn't have a dog so I asked him whose dog it was and he said it was a friend's. I checked his following list and it was a girl's pet dog. I talked to him about it and he was so annoyed because of that and said to me ""I can't be with you in the dark anymore"". I was naive so I convinced him to stay but he wouldn't listen. We broke up. After 2 days I see him posting pics with some other girl and the caption was""keep seeking and you will find the right one"". I had no words. 


He said he would stay..he promised 
.but he still left...I don't think I'll ever be able to trust a man again...like I know that I will be cheated on or lied to. I'm not sad anymore because he left me but I'm sad because he fucking gave me trust issues and made me even more insecure. How am I supposed to love anyone ever again? He ruined it for me. 


I can't be in a happy relationship ever again no matter how hard I try. Idk what to do. I don't have any emotional needs anymore as a person. I have become totally numb and believe that I don't need to infact I can't feel anything anymore because grief is the only thing I ever feel.

Well it looks like after 2 weeks a clique has emerged of about 16 people. The other 8 who were left out I tried to be friends with but was consistently rejected. 

Last night was truly the straw that broke the camel's back. I was stood up for dinner plans then later on, it became obvious that a party was going on (everybody lives in the same building of apartments). I could hear laughter, music, and even recognizable voices. I texted one person who was clearly at the party who I considered a friend about grabbing a drink that night and was basically told ""I'm at a party but I'm not sure if I can invite more people,"" I then saw my flatmate (another person I had previously considered a friend) about to leave the apartment while carrying several bags of chips and sort-of jokingly asked if he was going to a party to which he lied and said ""no."" Of course, I heard his voice at the party later. I also found out that among the five people I share an apartment with, I was the only one not invited. 

I just feel heartbroken over not just not getting invited to a party that I could hear going on but also being flat-out told I wasn't welcome and being lied to for the purpose of being excluded from a social event. I feel like there's something horribly wrong with me for this to happen and its too late to fix anything now that the clique is formed and I can't drop out. I tried talking to my family about this but was told ""you're there to study, not make friends."" Is there anything else that can be done short of just giving up on the idea of making friends anymore?",2022-10-16 14:10:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610821854,3,/r/lonely/comments/y5hru7/dealing_with_cliques/,,0,2,Dealing with Cliques?

I couldn't see the sexism of india towardd girls so i got bullied for talking with girls, i couldn't understand racism, casteism and religious stuff of people so i was always singeled out. My friend's parents thought i was weird, so they made them break their friendship with me. My dad is abusive. I am just 16 now and turns out, i had adhd. People dont love you if you dont follow their standards. So i went online playing games to make friends. Again singeled out every single time because i played differently than the current era? Or meta of the game, still carried everyone because no one expected my playstyle since they arent used to it, eventually i made two friends. Both were sort of similar to me, one of them healed themselves and now does better, the other still suffering from the amount of work and discrimination because she is a woman in India. Her life gradually getting worse and worse. In the end the friend who got good got too busy and now works till 8 and my other friend also busy and now deleted every contact app after saying her good bye today. Tho before this when they were both busy i have been getting too lonely, just alone hearing insults from father all about not working, peer pressure from school.

I‚Äôm also alone as well in this journey I‚Äôm going through. Whether or not you all believe in God, He will always be there regardless of our circumstances. It‚Äôs up to you to seek and have a conversation with God about your loneliness. I know God because I have a relationship with him and he knows me better than I know myself. Long story short, I had a childhood trauma that consumed me to the point that it mess up all my relationships up. This is when I was in my teenage years. I jumped into relationships that weren‚Äôt healthy at all and have anger/trust issues caused by my childhood trauma. I didn‚Äôt care if the guy rip me off, I refused to stay alone. I got my heart broken so much that I thought about suicide a lot. Looking back, I was a fool. I should of gotten help  instead of depending on men for to fill that void in my heart. The void has been fill by having Jesus Christ in my life. I‚Äôm not here to force anyone into my belief, I‚Äôm just sharing my testimony of the goodness of God about how he saved me from suicidal thoughts. I began reading the Bible more so that I wouldn‚Äôt feel alone and be reminded that God knows what I‚Äôm going through. Even though I‚Äôm alone, God is with me through it all. I do want a family of my own but for now, I need to take care of my mental health before having a relationship with someone else.

Well then at 12:30 yesterday they wrote me that they were getting ready and we would see each other later. But then hours went by and hours went by and they didn't show up, and then they turned out to post a story on Instagram showing that they were already there, and I left in rage. Then at 7 o'clock they answered me with pure excuses, that they didn't have time because they were in cosplay (they're otakus and I was at a convention) and people were taking photos with them (well, them explain why they had time to post a story on Instagram and make posts in Facebook), that there was no cellphone signal (BS, the internet was slow but you could use the internet) and they haven't talked to me since.

I am feeling right now abandoned, excluded, and lonely. Worse thing is that one of these people is autistic. I don't know what to do. Am i repellent?? Do i drive away people when they know me?? Am i a bad person?? Is it my fault all of this??

anyways, i‚Äôm 16 and i‚Äôve never had any real triumphs in my life. yea i‚Äôve been on four cruises, been inside the white house and have every material want and need but i‚Äôve always been missing something. from a young age i‚Äôve always been sheltered by  my mom. she had three miscarriages before i was born so she really shelters me. and she had me when she was 42 so she really considers me to be her joy. from that point i‚Äôve always been her baby but i‚Äôve never been able to have my freedom. in elementary school i couldn‚Äôt watch spongebob, i couldn‚Äôt make a snapchat or instagram account without her knowing my password and following me and for the longest time since we‚Äôve moved i couldn‚Äôt close my room door. i just feel like i‚Äôve never had any freedom. 

also being a mamas boy hasn‚Äôt made me feel liked by my peers either. i haven‚Äôt had real friends since elementary school and now i‚Äôm a junior in high school, i haven‚Äôt been to a party, i haven‚Äôt had anyone like me and i haven‚Äôt kissed anyone because people think i‚Äôm soft.

in probably about every post i make on reddit i get kids and adults saying that you should just go out more, fix yourself or wanting nudes from me because i had a problem with them. i don‚Äôt talk to anyone at school because everyone there hates me because i‚Äôm not like them just because i listen to madonna, wear bandanas and i‚Äôm smart. i don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to at my music school because i‚Äôm one of the few black people there. so i really just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i‚Äôm so fuckin tired of the bullshit at school, the bullshit at home and the bullshit at my music school. 

yes i‚Äôm a boy who likes boys and girl, yes i‚Äôm a boy who sings instead of playing sports and yes i‚Äôm a black boy that like madonna and bruce springsteen rather than kanye and the weeknd but you don‚Äôt have to shove it in my motherfucking face about it.

And I hate this part even though it's a pretty nice part, because there I see so many people who're watching this with their friends. They always look so happy, while I sit here alone and nobody cares.

So I have SEVERE Fibromyalgia and moderate arthritis at 25, probably have had them since age 12 (really, really fucking rare in men my age. So rare I needed the best PCP my hospital has on staff and a senior rheumatologist to even diagnose after 1.5 years of weekly testing). It makes it extremely hard to work and function as is. Meeting people, especially potential romantic partners is near impossible. I have a friend who cares a shit ton about me. For that I'm really thankful. But due to my hair just falling out, being half there mentally most days, and the insane levels of pain it's hard. I've given up hope I'll meet someone.



Going out on the weekend is hellishly exhausting if I'm not hurting. Being bi I always joke I have the most options but I really have none. If they do like me I'm delegated to plan B in case nothing better comes along, or I feel absolutely nothing physically/emotionally. I'm just meat, a handsome lay worth nothing more than what satisfaction I can bring in the short term. It's not like I have high standards of what I find attractive physically either. I just want someone who is healthy because I cannot be. I will die around age ~65 my care team guesses based on my medications slow damage to my liver and kidneys.(yay gaba analogues.) .
 



I'm adored by people who know me, as inhumanly selfless and kind. I'll sit with a complete stranger and let them shell out how rough it's been. I'm just that kind of person, I drag myself through hell for others so they may never know the pain it entails. I get told a lot I'm far too kind for this world. I probably am.



So I know it's not a matter of looks or personality. I have a plethora of hobbies also. I'm just cursed to be lonely it seems. Being swallowed up by chronic depression. The hole in my soul grows in passing and it's eating me alive. Craving intimacy I'm never going to find. Longing for a partner I'll probably never meet. Being trapped in a personal prison riddled with so much pain and fatigue I feel violently sick to my stomach constantly. Unable to cook myself food most days without collapsing from exhaustion halfway through. I'm not only lonely but not in control of the things that make this worse. Therapy didn't help, antidepressants make me suicidal, and distracting myself just pushes the feelings away for a moment. Honestly I can't tell what's worse, the way my health eats at me or the way loneliness has ground me up. Online dating made my depression way worse, meeting in real life is fruitless. However if you read this and think you have it rough, YOU DO. Loneliness hurts more than nerve pain, that has rendered me unconscious. It exhausts me more than my own illness or any activity.",2022-10-16 18:10:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,,16,/r/lonely/comments/y5nkku/at_this_point_i_think_im_just_cursed/,,0,9,At this point I think I'm just cursed.

Then tgere was a guy that always sent me meme and funny things, tbh i didn't like him but always tried to talk w him n be good, lately he storied something and i thought he is nice guy and i replyed w short funny story about myself but he just sent me emoji. Which in other situations like that we had conversation. Anyway an other one is someone else i thought i could be myself and start talking too much :(    he ghosted me.  

I never had friend, never loved someone but i loved the first person i told, it hurted me alot and when i tried other ppl saw it seems the problem is me.

3245,y5qjeg,Capital-Shower9360,"The title says it all. Im 19, male. I made a post in r/heartbreak but I want to make another one that is a notch more understandable. 

We met at some school study camp a year ago and we were inseparable ever since. I had feeling for him from day 1, the moment I saw him I was thinking 'he is soo perfect'. Of course, he is not, and I don't mean the part that he is apparently straight or whatever, but as any other person he has flaws. I have learned to accept and even love them.

He gives me mixed signals all the time. He hugs me longer than I deem comfortable for a straight dude (he hugs no one else), he is different when we are alone... We lay next to each other and stare and soo much more romantic stuff that makes me fly over the moon... With his friends around he is kind of cold. He knows that I like him. I have confessed and shot my shot like 4 times already... He doesn't back off, he is not ashamed (which is weird cuz we are in a mostly homophobic county), he keeps beeing him. My friends think he is definitely gay and I think that too but he just says he isn't. (No my friends haven't asked him anything like that but I have)

Back to the present... Right now he is hooking up with a girl and it makes me soo angry and jealous and it just breaks my heart... He knows that it hurts me, he knows I like him and he still does it. Just imagine the pain of liking someone and knowing they are having sex with someone else right at this moment. I have no idea how else to describe how painful this is for me. What should I do? I'm scared of loosing him I don't want to tell him to back off and I don't want to back off myself. I want for us to be together but he might simply be incapable of loving me that way.

3246,y5qvsp,Affectionate_Hat494,"Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of falling in love. He didn't have to be super good looking, rich, or popular. All that mattered was that I loved him, and he loved me. I admit, I clung onto this fantasy tighter than the average person because I had no one to turn to. I was bullied at school for my introverted personality, and if I told my parents about it, they'd blame me for it. They hated that I wasn't more popular. On days that were extra hard, I'd cry myself to sleep and sing to myself ""someday, my prince will come"".

I met a guy, who I had a genuinely good connection with. Everything was so easy. Our conversations flowed together, and time moved both fast and slow, but in the very best way. I wanted to be next to him forever. Three days after meeting, he told mutual friends in secret that he liked me. I wasn't supposed to know, but they went and told me. I asked him about it, and he told me that he had a girlfriend.

After that, he cut off all contact with me. I understand why; it wouldn't have been right for him to cheat on her with me, and it was best to be safe than sorry. Still, all my hopes and dreams were shattered. I know it should give me comfort that they only broke up two months after he and I met. It should comfort me that literal days after the breakup, he started looking at my social media videos and posts all the time, despite not following each other on anything. It's been years, and he still is always one of the first people to see my posts.

But it doesn't comfort me at all. People who know the situation speculate that he thinks that he's ruined things. If that's what he thinks, he's not wrong. Ruined, destroyed, obliterated. They might as well all be the same word. When I was presented the hope of something romantic with him, I was walking in the clouds. Finally, the dream I had been hoping for all my life had come true. But he let me fall. He let me hit every branch on the way down. He knew full well that I did nothing to him, and still, he let me pay the consequences for his actions. I want a fairy tale, and he could never give me that. I will never be able to date, let alone marry him, knowing that at one point, despite having genuine feelings for me, he still preferred someone else over me.

That's the nightmare that happened to me. The nightmare is, my first love was a guy in a relationship who threw me under the bus to preserve that relationship. Even after breaking up with her, he still doesn't pursue me. Even though I have all the reason to hate him, a part of me still longs for his touch, for his smile. I have to live with that. Every. Single. Day.",2022-10-16 20:24:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642055763,2,/r/lonely/comments/y5qvsp/the_nightmare_i_live_with_every_single_day/,,0,1,The nightmare I live with every single day

3265,y5swtd,mrjackass321,"What is a friend?  A question i had to ask myself a few too many times....

The one thing for me that always determined if someone is my friend is trust. How much i trusted them, how much i felt they trusted me. But with trust comes expectations. Expectations that are not always met.

Trust is a weird thing. It takes years to built and youre never really done, yet it can shatter in mere seconds. From one moment to the next its gone. And people somehow expect that a simple apology will fix all of that.

My expectations for people i call ""friends"" lowered over the time. Every time i got disappointed, lied to, used, ignored, manipulated, made fun of,.... they lowered a bit. And i began to distrust most people. I would just keep to myself and not tell anything i wasnt specifically asked about.  I still tried to be truthful but i would be lying know if i said i was always 100% honest.

But this creates a problem for me. You see usually the difference in trust from a friend to a stranger is gigantic. But as this difference shrinks you begin to wonder. Are these really my friends or are they just strangers i happened to see a bit more often. It sounds a bit weird while i write it out but this represents how i feel at times. 

I dont really know what kind of responses to expect here, but i just wanted to write it out.",2022-10-16 21:47:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659457758,6,/r/lonely/comments/y5swtd/trust_issues/,,0,1,Trust issues

3267,y5sy95,WildDevilOfTheTurf,"I mean there is people that like me.

But only my bird truely loves me. And I love her so much.

She is a shiny yellow cockatiel with a red circular color pattern around her ears. Her name is Aykiz (turkish name, pronounced a bit like 'I Kiss')

I took her in and adopted her from a family I used to know. I was birdsitting her whenever they went on vacation.
They did not treat her well, she was always dirty, did not know basic bird things like taking a bath, because they took her away too early from her parents and she couldn't learn much. She did not know what to do with seeds that are like still on the straw, did not know they are edible because they only fed her basic food and white bread which is too sugary for birds if you feed it too much, which they did.

Her cage was so small too, she couldn't turn around without her tail feathers getting caught in the bars, not to mention that she wasn't even able to spread her wings even half way.

She did not fly a lot because they did not want her to go everywhere, and you know. Birds poop, and you gotta clean after them which was too much work for the family. So all the bad food, not flying a lot or basically not at all, not beeing able to move properly in the cage so she became overweight as well.

Whenever I was birdsitting I tried to improve her live to my capabilities. I gave her fresh seeds, showered her with a spray bottle because, like mentioned above, she does not know how to take a bath. Let her fly around my place and all. I even bought a slightly bigger cage from my little carpenters-apprentice wage. She was now able to turn around without her feathers bending.

Then one day the family told me they were going on vacation again but did not say anything about me taking care of Aykiz, so I asked if anything happened to her or if they do not want me to take care of her anymore.
They said they do not want to keep her anymore and before the vacation they'll either let her out of the window (wich would've been her death sentence, remember she did not know basic bird stuff and was in bad shape) or give her to an animal shelter, and they aren't really known for treating birds well either because most people want cute cats and loyal dogs.

So I said I will take her if they let me. And they said yes.

Before they went on vacation they brought her to me like they always did, but knowing that it won't be their bird anymore. They did not even say goodbye to her...

I placed her on my sideboard in her cage, gave her some better quality food which I bought earlier and headed out to the pet shop.

I bought her a new cage again, which is the one she still lives in today, even bigger than the one she had and when I got back I relocated her to her new home.

She stood in the cage kinda in shock, looked at everything with her head wiggling up and down in disbelieve and then she did what from that day on I would always call 'doing an angel'. She bent forward and spread her wings to full extend, even her tail feathers. She was able to do that the first time in her life since taken away from her mother.
She proceeded to do that in every corner of the cage.

That's when I heard her first ever tweet. Like she was thanking me.

I tried to get closer a bit by holding my little finger between the bars and hoping she would come to me, which she did. But only to attack me and bite my finger.
I did not pull back and she was so weak that it did not even hurt a little so with time she got used to my finger beeing in the cage and one day even came and rubbed her head on my finger.

She does that ever since. She loves when I scrath her head.

I let her fly almost every day since then.
She is in good shape now, learned that you can eat seeds directly from the straw which was a hard thing to teach her. She also comes flying on my shoulder on command which was an EVEN HARDER THING TO TEACH HER! And then she rubs her head against my ear it's so cute.

When I leave the room she shouts after me because she does not want me to go.

That bird is my everything, I could talk about her all day, really. And I could go on but this post is already so long that nobody will read it anyway.

If you did tho and you came to this point. I am willing to show some pictures of Aykiz as she is a real model, you know :D

Thanks for reading, or at least for not downvoting, lol.
Do you have any pets?

Its a silent sunday night, not a single noise. Just me sitting alone in the dark. I just wish i could have a gf. I want to hold someones hand, get hugs, cuddle, kiss. I dont even care abt sex, i just want someone to be happy to see me, i wanna care for someone and make them feel safe, but i have nobody who loves me (romantically) and nobody to Give my love to. At this point my standards are so low id literally date everyone, idc where theyre from or smth. I had my last gf half a decade ago. To this day i regret being a dumb fuck and not trying harder to keep the relationship working. Instead we ended it.  I cant remember who it was that ended it,  but i do remember her instagram. And when i looked it up i regretted it even more. I forgot how gorgeous she was, like a billion times out of my league, and her having a new bf is killing me. Meanwhile i dont even talk to any girls. I cant complain to much, afterall i made 2 friends in college. Thats actually good since i have no social skills, and im awkward af. Everyone tells me i need to socialize more and i really want to, but my friends arent keen on partying and such, so i just sit home alone, theyd rather play video games instead. I dont have the courage or whatnot to approach an already existing friend group or just a random person in my college to befriend to even have  a chance to get more social. I mean im 18 so i could use Tinder etc. But i know alr it wont end well, I look shit in selfies (probably not the fault of selfies), and i dont have any to begin with... i cant see how things can improve. Shit just keeps getting worse, not only in my non existing social life, but also just other personal shit constantly keeps happening, and i probably dont need to mention the current world news. Ppl say life has its ups and downs, but there is no ups. Ppl say it will get better but it only gets worse. I dont know what to do, i try to be nice and helpful to everyone, have good karma and nothing comes around for it,  instead i just waste ""the best time of my life"" at home while others have fun.

3317,y5yeu0,althrowaway6789,"Sorry for this vent almost just want to say my feelings the only place i can think of at this time of night + it's anonymous. 

Hey, I'm 19 in a week or so. I have friends i think, a loving, nice family. I am a decently handsome + funny guy, nothing crazy just enough to get by. Going to the gym 5/6 times a week, finally taking care of myself, eating good, taking care of my body for probably the first time in my life. Down 8kg from where i started, at a good weight. Got a job, going to uni in a year, all going well. From an outside perspective i should be the happiest guy around. So why am i not? I almost feel guilty that i live this life, yet i seem to be the one who can't appreciate it :/.

I get incredible bouts of loneliness, especially once my friends + family are asleep. It's numbing and i just can't help it, like a bottomless pit forms in my stomach and i just want to end it all and stop my suffering. I suppose I just feel like although i have these friends, am i truly someone's best friend? My best friends i think all have their own top best friends that aren't me, i feel second best, like the friend people have but never anyones closest. No one has ever loved me (not platonically), the girl i like, treats me like a good friend. I get obsessive, jealous over her, when i know i have no right to. So why do i do this? I feel guilty. I try not let my thoughts get known to her, but sometimes i can't help it. And i know i'm wrong which is even worse. 

I also feel, there is no one in my life who truly would take me serious if i wished to have a chat and spew out all my feelings. And if they did, they would not speak to me again, who wants to be friends with the guy who is obsessive, jealous, selfish + sad.

I spend all day doing nothing, i work, i go to the gym, i message people, i go out. I enjoy none of these activities, bar going out as i finally forget my feelings and just live in the moment. Hence why i am just getting addicted to taking anything that keeps me out of my thoughts. When i am sober, i enjoy nothing, i don't have any hobbies, i don't find anything interesting online. I just sleep as much as i can, anything to avoid the boredom i face daily. I feel like a robot just living everyday emotionless, except for negative ones. And if i am happy, i cant help but think to myself, how long will this last, and almost try find any reason to be unhappy. I push my parents away, hardly spend time with them. And it makes me sad, why am i like this? why can i not socialise with them, why do i avoid them, they are nice and loving yet i treat them badly and entitled. 

Just any advice, for this loneliness i feel, anything will be taken. Even if you are here to criticise my actions i will listen. Please just anyone.

Sorry for the lack of structure to this, i am just letting my thoughts out as they come :(.",2022-10-17 01:59:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/y5yeu0/what_to_do_in_life/,,0,4,What to do in life

It doesn‚Äôt help i feel like i fucked up my life by deciding to homeschool after my first semester of high school(I‚Äôm a senior now). I‚Äôve had one relationship that i fucked up by being clingy, paranoid, and acting embarrassed about having a girlfriend to my friends even though i really believe i cared about her. My parents are divorced and even though I barely have spoken to my father because of how my mother constantly vented to me when i was younger and even now about how horrible he is and how horrible men are. I think my mother tries to be there for me but she treats me like I‚Äôm a toddler or doesn‚Äôt give me any independence and i feel like I haven‚Äôt matured enough to function in the real world. Part of me really feels she‚Äôs not given me the experience i need to trap me with her for the rest of my life and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve gotten so much uglier through the years and i don‚Äôt have any talents or skills that I‚Äôm good enough at to market myself for a relationship with, and I don‚Äôt see why a woman would want anything to do with me in a romantic way. I‚Äôm alienated from all my friends because the overarching group is something I‚Äôm really not apart of and it makes me feel like a zoo animal. I have one friend that is willing to listen to me vent that i think really cares but i know his overall life has been harder than mine and i don‚Äôt want to be a pussy and talk about it too much and ruin that relationship. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm supposed to talk to him about wanting someone to hold me or wanting to feel loved when one, he‚Äôs been in a relationship for over six years and two, without him looking at me like I‚Äôm a bitch. The most socialization i get is at work and even though the job is as easy as it‚Äôs gonna get i hate every second of it watching happy couples shop and helping them pick out clothes for their wedding, and then i feel guilty because i shouldn‚Äôt be jealous. I‚Äôve been trying to quit using weed because every time i have it I‚Äôm high 24/7 but now it‚Äôs near impossible to sleep. I probably blame my mother too much for how my life has gone and the fact I don‚Äôt have a network of people to do things with even though so many people i see do. I‚Äôve gone to a few parties but I‚Äôve never met anyone with similar interests as me or who doesn‚Äôt outright say that it‚Äôs weird when i talk about video games. I hate being a pussy but sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to not just drown out how i feel with alcohol or pot and I‚Äôm terrified to go meet new people because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to truly be open with them and that‚Äôs what i want more than anything.
I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm ashamed to feel this way because my life isn‚Äôt horrible and I‚Äôm not in poverty and i don‚Äôt have to worry about violence happening to me. I don‚Äôt want to be a man who‚Äôs just a spiteful incel but sometimes i have those feelings even though i know i have nothing to provide for a partner and I don‚Äôt put myself in many situations at all to meet people so i have no right to feel upset about that. I know I shouldn‚Äôt look at having a partner as the solution to everything but it feels like having someone whose opinion of me isn‚Äôt going to change when i show how i feel in even an ugly way would motivate me to keep going and do what i need to do even if it‚Äôs just to not disappoint them, and even though this is something i want I‚Äôm not sure if i could ever trust someone like that.

3378,y65zki,AnalysisSubstantial1,"
After being in therapy for a year, I found out that the root behind my awkwardness around guys in my age range can be linked back to when I was assaulted by my male cousin. My therapist was the only soul I told 12 years after it happened. 

For as long as I could remember I‚Äôve feared guys in the same age bracket as me. I had no problem forming strong bonds and close friendships with girls in school, but guys were a totally different story. It was almost like this thick bullet proof glass wall between me and my interactions with the opposite sex. I got unreasonably nervous around crushes and would have a hard time befriending guys. I can count on my hand how many guy friends I‚Äôve had in my life as a 21 yr old. I‚Äôve always felt safer around girls and could connect easily with them. 

When I was 8 yrs old I went over to my uncle‚Äôs house with my parents. So all the adults went to the other side of the house to talk and watch football leaving me and my cousin who was four yrs older than me alone in the living room. Before the assault I was totally comfortable around him and liked spending time with him. We would play video games, talk about school, he would show me his mean ass pet turtle that tried to bite me one time and‚Ä¶every once in a while ask me questions about kissing. One time he made out with his hand in front of me. I thought it was weird but never paid it too much mind until the day he assaulted me.

So everything was normal until he started asking me questions about kissing. He asked me if I‚Äôve ever kissed anyone and I said no. Then he asked me if he could practice with me. Obviously I was like eww no that‚Äôs gross. I went back to playing with his toys and somehow we ended up playing tag. Next thing I know he catches me, grabbed both of my wrists, pinned them above my head holding me down on the couch while on top, and tried to make out with me.

The worst part about the whole thing was feeling completely powerless. I tried to fight him him off with all my strength but that‚Äôs really hard to do when you‚Äôre a tiny 8 year old girl with a 12 year old boy holding you down on the couch restraining both your arms. I was ferociously whipping my head from side to side saying stop. No matter how much I said stop he wouldn‚Äôt until he was satisfied. He got one kiss on my lips and a few pecks on my cheeks. After several minutes of trying to push off me like a cornered rat he finally stopped and acted like nothing happened. 

I remember feeling so embarrassed and ashamed after what happened. Did my cousin steal my first kiss? I felt so violated and was bewildered. After that I never looked at him the same. 

I never told my family because I didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat. So I would give him a side hug every other year at holiday gatherings and feel my blood boil whenever family gushed about how good he‚Äôs doing. Even worse he‚Äôs now married with a baby girl. I would love to think he would never do that again to anyone, but if he did what he did to HIS OWN FUCKING COUSIN AT 12, I can‚Äôt help but envision the worst case scenarios.",2022-10-17 09:01:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597859627,3,/r/lonely/comments/y65zki/my_older_male_cousin_assaulting_me_has_affected/,,0,2,My older male cousin assaulting me has affected how I connect with the opposite sex and it makes me angry af.

I (57M) was a happily married man with 2 kids, 6 foster kids, 3 dogs, a cat, a nice home, and a career l loved. Then in 2019 things came crashing down. Early that year my wife said she was not feeling well and died 4 days later. We had been together for 30 years. I was suddenly alone. My kids were all grown and were living on their own. The cat and 2 dogs died that year. Frankly I don't remember most of that year. 

I thought I could rebuild in 2020 but Covid shut down the University I used to teach at and teaching online is horrid. My consulting practice dried up. The year ended with a heart attack. While laying in ICU alone, I decided it was time to retire. The cardiologist said a broken heart is a real thing.

I sold my family home, helped my kids out, moved to a small city with an affordable cost of living. But with Covid, it has been hard to meet people. I have tried dating but have not found a good connection. 

At 57, I have now lived alone for a few years for the absolutely first time in my life (went from parents to army barracks to roommates to married). I fight depression and lonliness but am learning to live with it.

I know that I was lucky to have had a good partner for so long and miss her every day. My kids are nice people and I like seeing them when they are not busy. I also know I should push myself to meet new people but so much of my identity was tied up with my career and being a husband and father, I am not sure who I am supposed to be.

3396,y691oo,[deleted],"So over the years of my very lonely college life my older sister visited me every once i'm a while. And she always asked me about how is my social life going. Do i meet up with friends or go on dates. I didn't because nobody liked me. Never put in any effort into talking to me and always turned down my date/hang out invitations with some chrap excuses. Over the years i found out they always considered me an annoying loser. But obviously didn't tell my sister that because i didn't want to humiliate myself. So i just made some excuses how me or they are too busy with studying or ""personal stuff"". My sister would then roll her eyes and tell me to put myself out there and just talk to people. 6 years passed like this,  i never managed to improve my reputation and was still as lonely as ever. I did manage to get one friend who i thought cared about me because she put on more effort than everyone else. But she didn't, and eventually straight up told me to my face what everyone was saying behind my back. So during my sister's next visit i just gave up and told her everything in full detail about how my life looks like. Her response? Roll her eyes and tell me that i hang out with shitty people and should just put myself out there more and change my social circle.

3432,y6foan,Arcadia28,"So I talked about relationships with some close friends, and as much as I would like to stay positive about potentially finding a husband and settling down with, I have to be realistic. If some of them are already thinking about becoming single mothers or even potentially being cheated on cause that's the norm now, then I probably won't have that romantic bond or even being fully loved cause my generation is messed up. It pains me to think that loneliness is what going to end up happening. It's hard finding someone that could match up to my ideals like improving career wise like I do, or someone that wants too live comfortably not really lavious or luxury cause it would be nice but definitely not entirely needed. Like I don't need expensive things in life, I just want to add to my family and have good careers where money isn't always the issue and give my kids a decent life and education. To being able to go places together and experience life here and there cause trips can always be saved for. But I may never have partner that wants that. My generation can't wait for anything, they just want to hook up and leave, no talking really,  no relationship, not wanting a family, no nothing. Just this incel mentality. When what I want the most is companionship/friendship with a potential partner, to want to feel loved and wanted. To think that all I'll have is just my career and parents and nothing else. They may never have grandchildren or walk me down the aisle that special day. Not necessarily ""married"" cause I would be happy with common law, like having the rings, calling each other husband and wife but not in paper. 
Maybe I was dumb thinking that love was out there, but I truly think it died along time ago. I don't know if anyone can tell me how to fully accept loneliness, cause if someone can't be a part of my peace then I don't want it. Like it shouldn't be a battle or games to get someones attention. Like I've said earlier that I gave up on dating apps and it's been 2 months, nothing but men that were extremely rude to me when I did nothing wrong to deserve that. Or getting ghosted or having to wait for days having to respond. That's not talking or dating. 
I wish I had a cold heart to feel nothing cause then this would be so much easier. But there's no right man out there. I'm not granteed that I have soul mate, for all I know he could very well not exist or just not meant to be this time around, or not meant to be loved this time. Billions of people, but wasn't meant to be with anyone. I don't want to be a single mom or to expect at some point that I might be cheated on. I'm not okay with that. I just want normal, but may never fully feel it. At least once would be nice even if it doesn't last, I would like to be wanted and to feel love once by someone else.
But I don't believe I would ever have that.

I see that no matter how hard I try, although people can seem to bother when I'm actually there, but that's it. Even if I put effort in a group chat, I don't feel memorable enough. Like, is it me? Do I have a vibe, because I usually do try my bestest to be open and caring. I guess it doesn't show much?

Also, I have a friend group of four. One is overseas and the other two have their own lives, but I feel that no one's interested in one-on-ones with me, but somehow the two mentioned going out together. After that they suggested a group tattoo for the four of us and I know that if I agree - which I don't think I am going to - that although I would convince myself otherwise, the imposter syndrome will keep reminding me of these little things, which would really break my mental health. I wanna mention this to one of them if this tattoo things comes up again, but don't wanna seem like a b, hoping for sympathy. I don't, I just want some understanding, and honesty of how they really feel.

Lastly, (sorry :') ) I am content with how I'm living, and I don't wanna live the lives my friends are (they really are all out), but I want to be out more with friends. In uni, as much as I try, the same thing, I don't feel as memorable, and am worried that my whole life will be like that. Ik I'm only 20, but seeing others having groups and stuff just hits a little.

3457,y6i74a,_meowoof,"I have no friends. Everyone I know is either busy, lives on the other side of town, or has moved to a different city. I spend way too much time with myself.

Earlier this year, I was in a really bad mental space. Part of it was running into someone who had abused me years ago, the rest of it was depression due to hormonal medication for a medical condition.

A few months ago I started feeling like myself again. After living alone for a little over a year, I had my sister move in with me. I finally managed to break up with someone who clearly wasn't good for me. I started running, working out, and eating healthy again. I started dating someone who I really like. I felt like I had hope again.

Things don't seem too good anymore. I'm literally always alone. It feels like the only ones who ever really cared about me were my ex and his dog. I honestly don't miss him at all, but I do miss how much he'd be there for me through literally everything. He was someone I could call in the middle of the night after a panic attack or night terror. I guess I just miss the sense of security I had with him. Also, his dog was beyond specail to me and I can't see her anymore. The few people around me have their own lives while I have no life or social circle of my own. I lost my best friend of 15+ years cuz turns out he wanted to see me only to fuck me. My cat who was at my parents' house died and I don't want to visit my hometown anymore. I don't know who to talk to when I'm having bad days. I used to love spending time with myself, but now I'm constantly stuck in my own head. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel like eating, I don't feel like moving, I don't feel like stepping out of my house. I've stopped reading, I've stopped playing video games, and I barely bother making art anymore. I don't know who to turn to. I stay up till 4am talking to strangers on reddit nearly every night just so that I can feel less alone. At this point, I have more reddit accounts than friends. I force myself to get out of bed every morning only because I don't want my sister to suspect something's going on with me.

I don't want to bother the few people around me with my issues so I keep everything to myself. I'm afraid of being needy. I have so much love to give but no one to share it with. I have no one to share my joys or my sorrows with. Hell, I don't even have anyone to have a random conversation with.

3459,y6i9b0,Puzzleheaded_Sort962,"So yeah, sorry if you already got your share of venting and of ""I'm all alone and sad"" today but I just can't stress this enough; why the fuck does this feeling comes back so fast ???
I just saw my buddies today and not even an hour after they left I felt the loneliness kick in, for real is something wrong with me or is it just common ?

I'm trying to socialize more and more, talking to people and trying to integrate groups, the best part is that I'm currently a college student and my class is full of girls, who are probably single and that's great but there are some steps you know, I can't just barge in and say ""Hi so how's your day ? Huh, huh, nice, and so do you mind if you keep me company late at night ?"" Fuck no that can't happen, it's a fucking dream and it's impossible for things to move this fast, I hate how slow the process of being a social being is and it makes me rage even more than when I was completely alone in my apartment for days.

In the end, I just needed to vent a bit, albeit I also want to deliver a message to everybody who struggles with socializing:

You don't need to be beautiful, you don't need to dress all nicely and to put perfume on to get someone to talk to you, of course that might work at night in a bar but it isn't the best option. If you're a guy, you have to work on yourself, mainly to start looking around in your workplace or around your classroom, identify some people who have similarities with you. For example I try to speak to people who have a nice English accent and as an excuse to talk to them I just say I'd like to have such a nice accent in the future.
It takes guts at the beginning, you might sweat a bit but it will be so worth it the thing is, it's gonna take a while so being patient is required here. I believe that everybody who gives themselves a chance can achieve a lot. I am diabetic, I have a shitty immune system making me sick more often than anyone, I am fat, yall, you can fucking do far better than me and that's why I tell you that, it's because I believe in you.

3460,y6iafn,Lemontree02,"So, let's point the event which lead me here

\- I fail my psychology master due to a mix of lack of stage and law. Ok

\- I r√©oriented myself, found a job in IT ! 

\- I started evening classes to get an IT bachelor.

\- I lived with my mother to save money. It lasted 3 years.

When i started 2022, i was 27. i had a job since 2 years. I had to do a years to catch back some second years course i failed. And i still lived with my mother, but with good savings to buy an house. 

&amp;#x200B;

During 2022:

\- I got a task simply awful (not an exageration, the colleague they finally send to help me turned crazy). I spent MONTH on it. Missing courses to work 12 hours a day. Doing dozens of errors because the test report i received was a 4000 pages mess. Destroyed my reputation to the point they put me in an evaluation period and i still risk to get fired ! 

\- I of course failed all my course, because i don't have the presences. So i register again. Little issue, it's the 4th years of bachelor, it's limited to 5 years. So i won't have the paper. 3 years of my fucking life in ash 

\- I learned my mother has a cancer. Yeah. Already in second stage so chemo en'all

\- When my father learned i couldn't keep his dog because i had to take care of my mother, he broke contact with me (yeah).

\- I tried to buy an house, but the current situation in europe make the price skyrocketed, so i kina had to give up that.

Now i have no house, no degree, no friends, nobody to love, a father that doesn't speak to me anymore, a sick mother and soon no job.

3470,y6jmrz,Jurez1313,"I just don't think I'm the kind of person who's able to socialize with people in a way that facilitates friendships, at least not anymore. I had friends in high school and college, but only 1 or 2 do I see even once a year anymore. The few friends I have now that I didn't have then, were made on reddit. Don't get me wrong, they're all great people and do their best to help me through tough times, but the reality is I'm never going to meet them IRL. To be truthful, that's just a requirement for me to not feel lonely - physical presence.  

But, for meeting strangers? I'm not witty enough to think of very many conversation topics on the fly, and I'm certainly not confident or comfortable enough to ""initiate""/""implement"" the conversation topics I *am* able to think up in the spur of the moment. So I end up listening too much and talking too little. This makes me an excellent conversation partner - who doesn't love talking about what they want to talk about constantly? - but not a great prospective friend, it seems.  

I can go to a meetup and fit in fairly seamlessly with pre-existing groups, for instance. It's just, at the end of the night, I've likely not made any impression at all, as I likely said maybe one or two sentences the entire time. This makes it hard for people to justify inviting me to future meetups, or more importantly, gettogethers outside of the meetup groups.  

On the flipside, it is impossible for me to initiate conversations with people when there isn't a pre-established reason for us to be talking in the first place. I will always, always, always be able to talk myself out of approaching someone unless I believe they know me or want to talk to me. Which, in day to day life, is never.  

So sure, I can just go to meetup after meetup for the rest of my life, and maybe there'll be familiar faces there every now and again. But to have a true friend, someone I can call up out of the blue to hang out with, catch up with over coffee or dinner, see a movie with, rely on to help move furniture or give a ride to the airport (and in turn, be there for them)?

3495,y6ms62,Affectionate_Hat494,"Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of falling in love. He didn't have to be super good looking, rich, or popular. All that mattered was that I loved him, and he loved me. I admit, I clung onto this fantasy tighter than the average person because I had no one to turn to. I was bullied at school for my introverted personality, and if I told my parents about it, they'd blame me for it. They hated that I wasn't more popular. On days that were extra hard, I'd cry myself to sleep and sing to myself ""someday, my prince will come"".

I met a guy, who I had a genuinely good connection with. Everything was so easy. Our conversations flowed together, and time moved both fast and slow, but in the very best way. I wanted to be next to him forever. Three days after meeting, he told mutual friends in secret that he liked me. I wasn't supposed to know, but they went and told me. I asked him about it, and he told me that he had a girlfriend.

After that, he cut off all contact with me. I understand why; it wouldn't have been right for him to cheat on her with me, and it was best to be safe than sorry. Still, all my hopes and dreams were shattered. I know it should give me comfort that they only broke up two months after he and I met. It should comfort me that literal days after the breakup, he started looking at my social media videos and posts all the time, despite not following each other on anything. It's been years, and he still is always one of the first people to see my posts.

But it doesn't comfort me at all. People who know the situation speculate that he thinks that he's ruined things. If that's what he thinks, he's not wrong. Ruined, destroyed, obliterated. They might as well all be the same word. When I was presented the hope of something romantic with him, I was walking in the clouds. Finally, the dream I had been hoping for all my life had come true. But he let me fall. He let me hit every branch on the way down. He knew full well that I did nothing to him, and still, he let me pay the consequences for his actions. I want a fairy tale, and he could never give me that. I will never be able to date, let alone marry him, knowing that at one point, despite having genuine feelings for me, he still preferred someone else over me.

Tl;dr: my first love was a guy in a relationship who threw me under the bus to preserve that relationship. It didn't matter that I was deceived, whether he meant to do that or not. Even after breaking up with her, he still doesn't pursue me. Even though I have all the reason to hate him, a part of me still longs for his touch, for his smile. I have to live with that. Every.

I've been here a year and a half and don't get me wrong I love Europe and being able to travel, but I'm fucking lonely. Shit hurts. Mega ouchiez. I had spent the last 2 years recovering from a failed engagement and I finally started to feel like myself again. 

I went on a TDY to Portugal for a month and met an amazing guy in my unit. Hit it off really well and dated for a month and then things fell apart. Although we were together for such a short amount of time it really hurt to cut things off. I guess after spending so much time by myself  I was really excited to start something new with someone. But I'm not understanding why this almost feels as bad as breaking of my engagement to the other guy. Why?

I was basically having a mental breakdown so I did a solo trip to Paris (I have no friends here btw) to keep my mind off of the breakup and the suicidal ideations I was having. I had fun and it felt like I had a reset. Then afterwards I flew back home to the States to see my parents. I was kind of over being home after about 4 days lol. As I've gotten older I realized that my parents aren't great people. I feel so uneasy whenever I home and around them. 

Now I'm back in Germany again sitting at my computer posting about my ouchiez to strangers. Feeling this deep pit in my chest again. I mean what do other people do to combat this feeling of loneliness and isolation? I keep pretty busy i.e. playing games, going to the gym, taking my dog on hikes, and traveling.

3553,y6v13h,[deleted],"You know that saying that in life you can lose everything in a single moment? That happened to me, and I still don't know how it happened.

In short, I used to belong to a very large group of friends, I always hated that, but it was all I had. 

I've been with that group for a couple of years and I've always had friction, especially with the ""Leader"" 
And I think there came a point where a few members were looking for a way to get rid of me.

It turns out that a few days ago I shared a joke I made about my roommate who is Asian, he and I have a very black humor between us, but for some reason my friends They took it personally, in bad taste, something very to heart, I apologized of course, but they didn't give me the opportunity, they called me racist, they separated me all week, without removing the racist label I got angry and responded in a bad way being condescending, I'm not saying it was okay, I recognized my mistake ando i apologyse , but I don't think that warranted telling the entire classroom that I was a racist.And twist the story, to leave me as if I attacked all the Asian members of the group, when I only shared a joke with my roommate, jokes that he and I have all the time. I never wanted to offend my friends, I just wanted to share something that is funny to me, and even when I tried to apologize they never gave me the opportunity 

After apologizing and groveling for forgiveness realizing my mistake, they rejoined me and accepted me into the group, being totally condescending and treating me like trash. After that, I complained about the unfair treatment I received, only to continue to be treated like trash, and we got to this point, where in front of everyone, the ""Leader"", of the group told me not to talk to them anymore, in front of the whole room he told me that I was a fucking racist and that my behavior was toxic and disgusting, even when I wanted to redeem myself, I apologized and asked for forgiveness and all because of a prank on my roommate, many of my classmates made horrible comments about me, especially since my grandfather is german so you can imagine what happened, t

They ended up doxxing me, putting my data on 4chan, and laughing at me, all for a joke that was not directed at them, and according to them, my complaints about this treatment was defending racism, I don't know how. At the end of the day, I was treated like shit, they told me to go to a strip club because that was the only function I had, that I was a slut, a racist whore and not happy with that now I'm scared to go to school, I feel miserable, it's not like I'm a person with feelings right?

The hypocrisy reached the level that today the leader of the group said that if they give me a month to reflect on my racist acts and if I have a changed attitude, maybe they will give me a second chance.

I discovered that the other girls in the group laughed at me, talked about how unattractive I was, were glad this had happened to me, and all because this guy's crush is Asian and took All this personal, I know the joke was wrong, but I just said ""Hey I said this to my roommate"" and that was it, does that justify ruining my life? Put my data on 4chan? I don't stop receiving .Pictures of dicks, messages of harassment, and I'm afraid to go to study,

3589,y71e0m,Add9E2Gamer1,"My best friend of 7 years just moved in less than 3 months ago for college, one month I wasn‚Äôt even here because my job took me away. She told me over the phone just yesterday that she decided to move back home (where she was currently supposed to be visiting for a week). I had a suspicion that this may be the case, quite honestly she‚Äôs been a bit of a chore while been here and when my family heard the news they were all cheering. I told my mother that it hurt tho, because we never even really got just a couple days to do fun things or just plain simply hang out. She went home for a wedding, and my mother pointed out that she likes fixing herself up and posting pictures of herself hanging out with people online on her social, and it really hit hard that we did none of that. We‚Äôd had no time to situate ourselves or get set up and I‚Äôd finally done it, the room was finally done and I was doing the finishing touches when she made that call. We got a bunk bed specifically for us, and it represents a lot of repressed emotions for me, but now she‚Äôs leaving, and now that bunk bed is torture. I was looking at it and thinking what of the other matching different colored spare sheets I was gonna put on it, how I was gonna fix it up for spare guests. I then wondered if she would leave or take the matching duvet we got her, I then wondered about the matching winter sheets and about making both beds up for the holidays and having both bunks set up‚Ä¶then I remember that no one will ever use it. That the beds purpose is just to look pretty, comfortable, but never full. I felt happy, I havent felt lonely or depressed in so long, and I hate that she did this to me.

3601,y759mq,StevenKiryu,"This might be a long rant, so bear with me.

I know that this is a group about being lonely and all, but you know what one of the biggest issue about trying to solve the issue is? Because I think for some of us, it isn‚Äôt actually all that hard finding people to chat with Online

The real issue is finding people online who can hold a conversation outside of ‚Äòhi‚Äô and ‚Äòdunno‚Äô however, because that‚Äôs a different story‚Ä¶like seriously, if you want to find some decent chats anywhere, why are people so lacking in substance? I get that this is a world of either swipe left or right but COME ON!

Sure, you can put all your info on your profile, but these days, nobody reads them, rendering all that effort pointless! And those who have next to nothing on their profiles are the equivalent of a dab squid, since you‚Äôd get far more out of a turnip then you would them.

In fact, in chatting them, you can almost HEAR the lazy 16-17 year old working the store checkout who clearly can‚Äôt be bothered to do their job &amp; is only their for the work experience, in their replies (‚Äòhi‚Äô - ‚Äòok‚Äô - ‚ÄòI dunno‚Äô only really missing an ‚Äòuhh‚Äô really)
COME ON PEOPLES, put some effort in!

If that‚Äôs how conversations online are going these days, we all might as well be lonely since humanity will become locked inside the biggest stalemate of all god damned time (unless sex is involved, that seems to be the real grease on the wheels)

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like boobs and butts as much as the next guy but really? What‚Äôs the point? Sex chat just gets real monotonous after awhile &amp; also annoying because trying to find out what sort of things a person likes seems about as hard completing a military training obstacle course, yet finding out if a woman‚Äôs bust is either a 36D or DD‚Äôs easy as pie (kinda takes the fun out of it though really)

Lack of confidence/anxiety aside, one of our biggest issues with online communication is 80-90% of people having a complete lack of substance and being totally unengaging.

I still wish you luck in your searches though

1. We‚Äôre not really entitled to companionship/support.
2. Even if someone was willing to invest their time and energy into being there for us, you might not be ready to accept it.
3. People are there for us when it suits them, and there‚Äôs predominantly nothing wrong with it.
4. There‚Äôs a lot to be grateful for, don‚Äôt take those for granted because they can be taken away at anytime too.

Keeping the above in mind, one must learn to pick themselves up, no matter how long you‚Äôve been doing it on your own. Friends and family are great and can make things easier or serve as a temporary distraction‚Äîbut not everyone has that luxury, not all the time at least.

Today I [20m] sent my final goodbye to my best friend, after months of trying to fix things, she finally has someone better and I would only get in the way.

She was the most amazing, wonderful, and beautiful person I've ever met. 
We have been friends for 3 years, talked everyday, and we were extremely close. We met online but we met in person a month after she decided to stop being friends with me (almost 4 months ago). 

Ever since January, I've been searching for friends online, even in person. And have found nothing.
I hate that I've been looking for female friends, but I don't want anything bad. I just miss that void she left. 
I can't find anyone I can feel close with, or feel anything even close to what I felt with her.

I just want a friend or something better than what I had, but I've lost hope.",2022-10-18 14:42:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1498868088,30,/r/lonely/comments/y78y8v/i_miss_my_friend_i_miss_being_close_with_someone/,,0,15,I miss my friend. I miss being close with someone. I wish I wasn't so lonely.

3622,y7b2v0,Easypeasy29038,"25, I'm studying to be a doctor but I hate turning up to hospitals with no drive, the environment there, and the process. Today I couldn't even get up out of bed to go in. Can't maintain friendships, don't have the self esteem to even try something like Tinder again (which I have yet to meet someone from to this day despite trying quite hard when I was younger). I've had a few relationships in the past and they've all ended for unhealthy reasons, whether it's my issues or theirs. Been depressed for as long as I can remember and although that's been better when my life habits have been good, I can never maintain them due to my baseline being so in the gutter.

A big issue of mine right now is that I'm addicted to ketamine, most likely to escape being lonely at this point, and have recently been to rehab because it was making me physically ill, struggling to stay in recovery with it (1 day clean sober this is day 2). Just super grateful it's something like this and not anything that causes dependence.

Family loves me but other people who know me on a personal level don't stick around. No wonder I'm lonely who the fuck would want to be around all this, I obviously can't let on about all of this shit but people can detect vibes and I'm just not there atm. I'm going to keep on with attempting recovery because the alternative I have learned is very shit but I had these issues before drugs and I can't work out the underlying reason for any of this, haven't had any significant trauma I can think of.",2022-10-18 16:04:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644868264,6,/r/lonely/comments/y7b2v0/fuck_im_lonely/,,0,1,Fuck I'm lonely

3632,y7cfnf,Affectionate_Hat494,"My crush and I have known each other for over a year. I'd always come to school with a full face of makeup, and I know that he finds me attractive. I have more sharp, refined features, and I have an hourglass figure with a small waist and big butt. I'm Hispanic with some Asian descent. He'd do all the little body movements that indicates attraction, like eyebrow raising, feet faced in my direction, etc. He even said to me once ""so you were just hanging out looking pretty the whole time?"" 

But he's been seeing this other girl. Y'all are going to say that obviously he finds her prettier because he's dating her. And you're not wrong, but he was set up by his sister. His sister and this other girl are close friends, and that's how they met. This girl isn't bad looking. She's Asian, and has delicate features. She doesn't wear makeup, and she wears Harry Potter style glasses. She's really skinny. Regardless of how attractive he considers her, they've gone out on six dates already, so they definitely enjoy each other's company.

I know overall, I'm better looking, but what mattes is what he thinks. Like I said, I know he's attracted to me, and I'm 95% sure that even if he's not into me now, he liked me at one point. He'd flirt with me from time to time, saying ""you're perfect"" and ""I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?""

I'm one of the major causes for my loneliness unfortunately, and I can't do anything about it, things are very hard around me, I can't blend in and I can't ever, the crowd that's similar to me is far out of reach.

I extremely despise a good portion of our culture and traditions, people are extremist bigots and it's hard to justify any of their views and opinions or just accept it like before.

I can't leave this place and I can't find people to talk to regularly who wouldn't eventually ghost me.

I have been single for 3 years and have not felt lonely up until now. I'm worried that my time to fulfil these dreams is running out. A big factor in this is I'm traditional, I don't want to have sex unless I find the right guy who would be okay with waiting if you get what I mean.

I feel embarassed and ashamed for thinking that a long-distance relationship would work.

What's worse is I have 2, maybe 4 people I talk to alltogether - but we barely talk.

Now that I'm single I have nobody to talk to. It makes me feel lonely, but also numb? I'm not sure how to describe it.

I just wish I had a friend group and someone I can give all my love to for the rest of our life. Someone that I can trust and share happy moments with. And especially someone I can be phisically affectionate with.

Seeing so many couples my age being all cute and happy, or seeing friends laughing together makes me feel hearbroken.

However,  my therapist has recommended me to keep some type of journal only meant for the good things that I have experienced my life which I do plan on trying to do. Keeping a journal is hard for me because I don't really like to write so I made a second Instagram so that way I could also have photos of the good times and I can write whatever i would want in the caption. I do have a good life. I travel very frequently, I have been to all of the states west of the rocky mountains, I have been to most countries in Central America, I have a supportive family and I get along with all my siblings despite the large age gaps I have with them, and I am getting a degree in a subject I am passionate about. But these feelings of being lonely and inadequate truly cripple me into long depressive episodes where I don't always feel like the things I have done hold any meaning. I only have two friends, but they are both in committed relationships and it is honestly so hard for us to even attempt to get together, not to mention we don't always talk to each other as frequently as we used to.

3788,y7vjl0,kelsietiger,Since my husband is doing it i mine as well. I usually just post to the masses just to get it off my chest but since we are telling coworkers now mine as well. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even acting like this i love my husband but fuck. I did snoop one time and freaked out because this woman he was talking to (another coworker) he was trying to convince to threesome with us. We fought and he apologized for not telling me about that person yet (because the threesome thing isnt the problem it‚Äôs that i wanted to know exactly when he was talking to other females about it is all) and then it was fine. Tonight i was just going to plug his phone in because he left it on the bed and boom. Messages right up on his phone. Its like he didn‚Äôt even try. And there was shittalking about me right there. Like cmon now. At least hide it. Because i havent even tried to snoop since the last incident because i trusted my husband And i knew it was wrong. I wish i never saw these new texts. Its not even the fact that he was talking to someone about our marriage. He doesnt really have friends. I actually kind of want him to talk to someone. Because he wont talk to me. But the prettiest female coworker you have? Cmon now. And extra points for complimenting her teeth again like the last chick (my teeth are fucked and he has mentioned braces a lot and im going to get them soon but its my biggest insecurity ). Him and I both have severe mental health illnesses. When we got together 3 years ago he mainly focused on me. Granted he acts like i never try to ask him about him or help him and thats not the truth at all. And i did lean on him a lot in the beginning but i dont even do that really anymore. He doesnthear about my panic attacks. I stopped waking him up after my nightmares. I definitely didnt tell him i started purging again. But he still tells everyone that he has been focusing on me so much and i dontfor him. Its so false!! I revolve my whole life around him. Everytime he is upset i ask and not rudely  like he be doing to me. Ive been trying so hard to help him and make it so he doesnt have to deal with me. And then the affection thing he is saying a lot now that i dont give him any affection. I try to cuddle kiss hug him constantly. He avoids it half of the time. I have to initiate all the sex. I have problems with sex due to a health condition so i can usually only do one round a day. But other than that i thought our sex life was fine. On days where it hurts ill usually even fake it so he can still get his pleasureand hewint think im rejecting him. I know thats prbably toxic but im so scared of him saying that i dont want to have sex with him because thats so far from the truth it just hurts so bad sometimes and nothing helps.. sorry for the tmi. We also have had this argument about affection and him being able to talk to me over and over and fucking over again. But everytime it ends the same he says he has already told me what he needs and then i dont understand him because i swear im doing everything right. I make him breakfast and lunch and set up his morning i do most of the household tasks i startsex i tell him how proud i am  of him and how much i love him frequently i ask him about how he is feeling i do random acts to show him i love him like buy his favorite candy and shit like that. He didn‚Äôt do that shit for me. He hasnt been like that for a long time since he gave up on me. This was YEARS ago.  Im so confused. Im so upset. I want to kms.

I am 25F and relatively ""simple"" (aka complicated) person looking for people of the same nature, or at least someone who is known to be a good friend to others, especially at a low point in their life. If you're down to become part of my circle for what my life is about to become, let's talk!

**Note**: ***I sometimes take some time to reply! Usually few hours. Mainly because my social battery expires or because I end up distracted or something, you're free to message me again but if you'll get upset with me or remove me, I'm not for you.***

With that bein' said:

1. Most of my hobbies are centered around programming/web development and gaming, not pro though. I'm also known to die in an FPS game so I can eat.. don't judge me.
2. Send me memes, songs/playlists; I will give you things I find funny, selfies or whatever else i find on the internet that day - it's a love language.
3. Vent to me. idc what it's about - let me be there for you. heartbreak? tell me about your first love, tell me about the crush you have rn. tell me about your parents. your best friend. vent away.
4. I'm a severe introvert, only looking for online friendships.

***I will ask this: since I wrote so much here, can I please get more than a ""hi, how are you?"" in your message to me.

I recently went through a job transition in July where I left a company that had a lot of people I enjoyed spending time with, people I considered my friends. 

Once I left the company, I hardly ever heard from anyone again. Not even on my birthday via social media. 

Then this new job was a total bust and I lost it two weeks ago. And then I got COVID really bad. I live alone and it was horrible. 

None of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù even checked on me. No one seems to care if I‚Äôm around except my parents, which I am grateful for. But I‚Äôve never felt lonelier. 

I know that making your job your life isn‚Äôt smart but I don‚Äôt even know how else to make friends. I can‚Äôt go out to social events because I either freeze up and say nothing or I drink too much and am obnoxious. I feel like a repel people at this point.

I think I always have been in a way. I have no one to comfort me or even vent to. If I were to die today, no one would know or care until I start to stink up the place. I'm extremely lonely. 

I have no family. I have been distant from my family for as long as I can remember. I have never met my extended family and the last time I spoke to any of my siblings I was too young to remember. I have no father. I don't know where my mother is. I have no friends. Although, I can completely blame myself for this. I never learned how to properly navigate relationships, and the few I have ended badly. I don't know how to be anything other than alone.  I've been so used to pushing people away before they could get close that I do it to strangers. I feel like I'm just an NPC with rotating voice lines that I feed to anyone that I meet. I'm disingenuous to the point of not even knowing what it would look like if I were to ""be myself"". Could someone even be aquatinted with me if nothing I say is genuine?

But I'm so comfortable with that. My happiest moments have been by myself. I actually feel more lonely when I'm around other people. I don't know how not to be alone. It scares me now that I'm sitting here thinking about it.  I cannot relate to anyone. I don't understand how to make or keep friends. Networking is a mystery to me and I'm lost to most trends. Social media and online interactions are too daunting. I've never even thought about romance. I feel like a child hiding under their blankets to flee from the world.

I have a boyfriend which helps A LOT. I feel guilty typing this because it feels like having a boyfriend should be enough to ward off the loneliness. 

I moved to a country where I don't speak the language so that makes it more isolating, so going out and making friends would be impossible right now. 

Being a teenage girl, looks definitely influence your friends; how many friends you have, etc. Atleast in my experience, I'm definitely not saying that's how it is everywhere. I'd say my face is attractive, however I am physically disabled so I think that prevents people from wanting to be friends with me. Looks wise, and the fact nobody wants to wait for me to rest my arthritis hips and knees while we're out walking somewhere.

&amp; since she has so much on her mind as of late, in example; Grandpa is getting dement, her boyfriend who cheated on her &amp; doesn't even want to fight for her, a lot of the dogs we had previously died because they became too old.  I feel for my mom that i just didn't want to bother her with my problems so i kind of just didn't. 

But today, i said that i wasn't. I'm just lonely &amp; I frankly just sit here because i have nothing to do. Until the feeling goes away. I already asked her a couple of times before if i could have a dog but the answer was always no.   


But today i asked again &amp; she said that we'll talk about it. Which kinda made me feel better because i've been wanting a dog for so long now because i'm genuinely convinced it's going to help me get better &amp; i just miss overall companionship.

‚ÄúYes it‚Äôs true. You haven‚Äôt met all the people that are going to love you yet.

But also, you haven‚Äôt met all of the parts of yourself that you‚Äôre going to love yet. 

You haven‚Äôt experienced all of the sunsets that are going to light you up inside yet. 

You haven‚Äôt read all of the books that make you feel seen yet. 

There‚Äôs still new songs to be discovered. Movies that will secretly make you cry. Snacks to try that will become your new favorite. Birthday presents you haven‚Äôt opened. Nature trails to be walked and photographs to be taken. Recipes that will make you fall in love with food again. 

Next year you might be living in a completely different place. Or you might just find a new coffee order in your hometown that you love.

Show me! Because I really wanna know. I forgot what that feeling is like and since I just became a working mummy, I really wanna change that.

Someone I can like just be happy with. 

And i in no means mean in a romantic way! Simply platonic. I do have friends but they seem sadly distant and I have the feeling that we drift apart which is really sad. I have one friend I really value but I wanna make that 2. I always see all these friend groups on the street and I‚Äôm like: wow i miss having that even those and I‚Äôm not that outgoing. So what about just being friends with someone who feels the same way! Maybe it‚Äôs you? I don‚Äôt know but i would be over the moon finding someone.

3842,y854i4,camjs_transcendence,"I had two best friends, A and B. I was friends with them for years on end, and I shared literally EVERYTHING with them, from embarrassing experiences to cute boys to makeup. We could have a whole conversation about cheese and enjoy ourselves. We would fall asleep on Facetime together and wake up together. We would walk to Target, we would go out to eat, paint, have picnics. And it was mutual, if I listened to A and B's problems they would be happy to listen to mine. Its stuff many people on here would only dream of. But I felt like I was going in a different path than them, and they were the best people I met in my whole entire life. They still are, they didnt do anything wrong. The problem was, I wanted to meet other people and lessen my social anxiety because I used them as support so I didnt have to move forward, and I was B's support too. I wanted to go forward in life, but it was impossible to do so in that friend group. I ended up removing their number, and call me a bitch or someone who doesnt belong on this subreddit. Part of why I did it was my mom, she couldn't stand either of them. But I decided to do it because I found myself becoming B in the flesh. Her hobbies became my hobbies, stuff she was doing became stuff I wanted to do. We talked just like one another. It was mirroring but on a whole other level. I lacked an identity. I didnt want to be anyone else, I wanted to be me, but who was me. Now, as someone who has zero nada zilch friends, i understand my hobbies and likes a lot more clearer, but I miss them a lot. I vowed to talk to them again, well if they even want to talk to me again, once I achieved my goal of overcoming my social anxiety.

Not just the constant use of the R word but basically anything deeper than ""look how big this girl on Instagrams boobs are!"" 

Anything deeper and more meaningful than that gets made fun of. 

They were watching a meme compilation where someone started singing ""this land is your land"" by Woody Guthrie. 

They were making fun of the song and I brought up it was made by woody Guthrie. 

""Woody? From toy story!"" ""Yeah woody from toy story!"" 

And I'm like no... woody Guthrie. 

They immediately called him the R word and me the r word. Saying me and him are both worthless and not even worth being memorized. 

Wtf. 

My argument was obviously someone found worth in memorizing his words if it's sung in schools, national events, and holidays. 

One of my freinds thinks he's a rapper too so to make fun of another musician for... whatever reason I thought was silly. 

Same thing happened with Oppenheimer the nuclear guy. They were watching a video of a nuclear detonation and Oppenheimer saying the quote about being the destroyer of worlds. They questioned who the quote was from so I said ""Oppenheimer"" and they went ""gayheimen? I heard gayheimen!"" Then again said he'd be remembered for nothing, that I store useless information in my head and that I'm the R word and so is Oppenheimer. 

What is going on here? I'm not even saying I'm particularly smart but I know who Oppenheimer and Woody are. I have deeper thoughts than just thirsting over Instagram girls. 

Constantly I'm called gay for not thirsting over the girls they look at. They literally follow underage high school girls on Instagram.

3867,y8978t,Diabloexo,"It has been on my mind lately. To create my own website and help people who are dealing with loneliness on a daily basis especially during these times.

I have been inspired by a Japanese man who gets paid to be a buddy/companian to somebody, all he does is listening, not judging, and just be there for that person and what that person needs.

For me, its not about the money. I have been through a lot and i still struggle sometimes but i have a social work/psychiatry background and i know the mental and physical devastation loneliness can do to a person. We are not meant for that.

From my perspective doctors/psychologists/psychiatrists just do their job and thats it. And sometimes it works out great and sometimes it doesnt. Its more formal in my opinion.

I had previous jobs in logistics and office for example but i didnt fit it. I just want to help people, its ingrained in me as a sensitive, compassionate person to help others. 

What do you guys think of this idea, be bluntly honest please, i can handle that, i am Dutch :p

3868,y89e3k,Arkotract0137,"This is going to be a pity party, so, if you don't want to hear it, you don't have to... Basically, this comes down to a few things... I'm a very unattractive guy, with a thin build and no real physical strength, even after spending a year at the gym doing what a former friend of mine was doing, I couldn't match his gains, so, that's just another thing that makes me inadequate... I'm an inadequate, sub-human man, and always will be...

That's because I'm weak, short, ugly, and poor... the worst part is, I have a disability, so, to everyone out there, I am sub-human, I'm less than garbage... I'll NEVER have a relationship or family that is meaningful, my only use to anyone will be as a wallet and social brownie point generator. I won't be seen as equal or acceptable, and the world will render me lonely. I have no social ability, so, I can't make friends either... My whole life story, the whole two decades of it, has been endless misery and loneliness... Every friend I ever had was a bully, a liar, or a coward, or, traded me in for more lucrative friends once they had the chance... High school friends? Fell out with the only one I had, the other one hung me out to dry when I was cornered by 10 guys all bigger than me, and the next... dead...

Now, I have no ability to formulate a conversation or make friends in real life... I rely on Discord and online gaming to communicate, because at least then I can hide my appearance and voice, I don't have to be \*me,\* online... I can be whoever I need to be... The only friend I've ever had, I don't even know what they look like, we just write a story together... But, that's going to end someday too, just like everyone and everything, I'll be traded in for someone better... a group of friends, or, people I thought were my friends... they were all happy to have me come along to an event, to have me pay $2000 of my MINIMUM WAGE PART TIME JOB to travel across the country, only to ignore me the whole time and pretend I didn't exist... Every attempt to get their attention was ignored, and, even when I joined in for game nights, everyone would leave or make me leave...

I'm just... I'm so sick of it... I'm so sick of being worthless, of being replaceable and inadequate... I have severe thanatophobia, so don't worry, I won't commit, I can't, I'm just... just tired of not having friends that actually care about me, for me... and, coming to terms with the fact that every single person my age I might want to try and be with, will see me as this worthless, ugly, sub-human half-man because of something I can't control...

Essentially, due to my shy nature, boring life, uninteresting hobbies, and overall unattractive demeanor, combined with my inability to ""put myself out there"" in ways that actually foster new relationships, it's no wonder I haven't made any close friends IRL.

That's why I came here and joined the forum in the first place. However, I am a little put off by the number of creeps that are predatory toward people who post.  When I first joined the community I was na√Øve to Reddit in general, so I entertained some of these types of conversations when I should not have. I wish there was some type of ""this is not a dating site"" type of rule that could be enforced. I'm not saying that romance could not evolve between some people. However, in my opinion, saying ""I'm lonely"" and saying ""I'm Horny"" are two different things. If a person reaches out ""to support"" or offer connection solely for the purpose of romantic exchange this feels ridiculously deceitful. It also adds to the idea that the only worth a person has is in their value as a partner.  I am so sorry for the rant. Honestly, if it was just for myself. I am a big girl and I'm fine with moving along. However, I read a post from a sweet-sounding gentleman the other day who seemed to be hurt by the lack of support he found because he was a man.

3875,y8amtf,Electronic-Pension13,"Majority of the posts on this Reddit is negative and depressing I get it that‚Äôs the whole point of the sub to share our problems with being alone . I just want to lighten some people up on the page. I am no way an expert on dating in-fact I haven‚Äôt dated anyone and I‚Äôm 21 m . However I do feel that I am okay with it and not depressed about it .I am happy and comfortable in my skin. I do long for someone to love but I won‚Äôt let that limit me. 

After reading no more mr nice guy I changed my perception on life . Dr Robert Glover (He) spoke about how we need to be plain and simple in communication. Tell your crush how you feel and don‚Äôt covertly indicate that . He also spoke about time by yourself is important which is powerful. In being alone you get to be comfortable with yourself. You become a better person find a morale compass , grow and thrive. 

So I tried it I went to the mall and spent time by myself and it was liberating. I felt free to do what I want . I made small talk with the cashiers. Walked around saw new people spoiled myself with shoes and clothes . It was actually fun to do this alone.  I was in control of my emotions which is big theme in no more mr nice guy. 

In loving yourself and taking care of this body you feel important. You make your needs a priority. You do not wait for someone else to make you happy you do it on your own. So I maybe alone but I am not depressed I am a social animal. I take care of myself. So Love starts from within when you truly love yourself you will begin to see happiness. 

I know I waste no time in taking care of myself. I know that who ever falls in love with me will have found a great treasure. For happiness isn‚Äôt found in your loved one it is found in YOU and your LOVED ONE reinforces it. So good luck in finding that person and don‚Äôt give up.

3887,y8bzx5,Short-Possible2316,"I (22M) struggle with anxiety and depression and it makes me feel incredibly isolated. About a month ago I started talking to a girl I met on social media who goes to a university near where I live. She was really funny and attractive, and I thought we clicked really well. We both discussed early on what we were looking for and we both said a relationship. She said that she had been used a lot by guys who just wanted her for sex and then ghosted.

We arranged to meet, and all of a sudden she stopped reading my messages. I sent her a couple of messages asking whether I should just drop it and leave her alone, and then she replied saying that she had stopped taking her depression medication and it was making things hard. I‚Äôve dealt with that feeling before so I had empathy for her, I was very understanding and wanted her to know that she could trust me to talk about that stuff. I said that I thought she had lost interest but she said she doesn‚Äôt lose interest that easily. She seemed very appreciative and things picked back up. We called each other for hours and texted quite often. She said she missed talking to me.

Then, last week I got sent a snap of her guy ‚Äúfriend‚Äù from her phone. I brushed it off and laughed about it but her replies got more and more blunt. I left it for a day, and asked her if we could talk. She sent a chat at 3am saying ‚Äúno‚Äù followed by a voice note from her guy friend talking about going on rollercoaster rides (presumably talking about my height - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8). I replied asking why she did that after I was so kind to her and everything. I got left on read.

I sent another message to get some stuff off my chest. I said that I was upset and kinda hurt about what happened, and that I wanted to show her that I was different than the guys she had been with before because I genuinely liked her as a person. I was sad that she never really gave me a chance to show her what I was really like in person or go out and do cool stuff. I had been there for her through her tough time and I expected more than just being left on read. 

That was 5 days ago and she read it with no reply. I‚Äôve thought a lot about it because she‚Äôs the first girl that I‚Äôve felt a genuine connection with for a very long time, and I don‚Äôt know what I did to make her want to act like that, especially after I was nice to her about her mental health issues. And we got on really well for a few weeks, it all just went silent with no explanation. 

She hasn‚Äôt blocked me on any social media, which makes no sense to me because if she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me then why not just remove me? And I keep thinking about what it is that that I could‚Äôve done wrong to make her lose interest that quickly. I just don‚Äôt get it.

3890,y8ctl4,Talusi,"TLDR; Health issues suck

So forgive the hopefully short life story.  Growing up was difficult, I've always had a certain level of anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have fairly bad ADHD which was not diagnosed until I was 20.  Elementary and Highschool were a bit of a nightmare to say the least. It seemed like all the other kids were given an instruction manual on how to interact and be social, but someone forgot to give that to me.  I had serious trouble making friends and was more or less bullied on a daily basis.  I also struggled with the work itself, if I was interested in the subject I was the top of the class, if I wasn't I'd be the bottom of the class, but of course because I wasn't hyperactive, ADHD never crossed anyone's mind. 

Enter my 20s, I finally start to figure out how to be social. Yeah, I'm a bit quiet, yeah I still suck at small talk, but I have friends, I'm dating, and I'm self-employed and actually doing fairly well for myself, I've also found hobbies that I'm passionate about that also bring in a bit of income. Depression is minimal, but anxiety is ever present. Still, I'm doing okay.  

Well here come my 30s, making decent money and fairly happy. I've got enough money saved for a decent down payment on a home with one caveat. It's become so expensive to live where I am that I can only afford a place an hour away from my current location.  Well, so be it, I won't see my friends as much but I can make new ones in my new area right? So that's what I did. 

I've got my new home, and shortly after I start having health issues in the form of intense and unpredictable abdominal/stomach/intestinal pain and pressure. I've been seeing doctors about this issue for 5 years now with almost no improvement.  Done all the tests, done various food trials, been poked and prodded and scoped to no avail and been told by doctors that they don't know what's wrong, are happy to just call it IBS, and that I should learn to live with it. Ha-ha. 

It's bad enough and unpredictable enough that I can't work a normal job, have no real way to make friends anywhere other than online. Money is slowly becoming a real concern, and with the current rate of inflation and looming recession I have no clue how I'll even survive.  It feels like my ability to live and do the things I enjoy are being taken from me.  I spend the majority of my days alone and in physical pain with just my dogs for company.

3898,y8eenx,PrimateOfGod,"Not to say it'll always work, but I've noticed a lot of people talk to me, smile at me, and make eye contact with me more:

1) Trusting my intuition - it takes a lot of effort, and it'll always be a work in progress. Nobody has perfect intuition, but trial and error is what teaches us things.

2) Smiling more - not a huge gaping grin, but just a slight, barely noticeable smile that feels unnatural until you get used to doing it more often. It's the cure to ""the resting bitch face""

3) Sense of humor - taking myself less seriously, changing my perspective on things, trying to laugh more often and come up with humorous things to say (and I'm not the most witty guy, but just to be able to laugh and try to make jokes has been enough it seems)

4) Being shameless/calm/collected - trusting my actions, containing my nervousness. My nervousness, i sense, is a natural reaction inside of me. my mind is like ""oh please, please, forgive me. i'm just so nervous, i don't know what i'm doing, please don't hate me"" - I decided No, I stand by what I say, I stand by what I do. If I want to make eye contact with that person, if it feels right to me, I'm gonna do it. I know better than to stalk them, I know better than to be a creep, if I want to say hi then I'm going to do this - and if they think I'm an axe murderer and they walk away, well there's no controlling that.

5) Loving myself - I know who I am, I know i'm a strong person who's been fighting this social anxiety and depression for years. I know I am a man with hobbies and passions. I am a man with dreams, with love. I am a good and kind person. I love myself and I don't need anyone else's love, I only desire it.

I'm now 22 and have BPD and GAD... there aren't a lot of people willing to form relationships with someone like me.

Had an off and on again type of thing and in the end we short of just called it quits at friends. She was going through some financial issues and I was living alone. She couldn't afford her bills after her break up and I could always use some extra money. It was her idea and I didn't hate it tbh.  It wasn't long before my job was going to put me on nights and nights can just breed depression. Figured the company would be nice and extra money in these times would be great. Fast forward a month and a half and our comfortability is fine. She'll change in front of me before we go out to get something to eat, talk about how shitty our bodies are getting, ect. That's it for the pros tbh. She can't seem to do a single fucking chore. No dishes, no sweeping, no mopping, cant even take out the trash. My place is only 1200sq ft. Doesn't take long. Ill wake up 4 hrs after a 12hr shift (happens for what ever reason) and knock out some dishes before going back to bed. She'll either use depression as an excuse, and I say excuse because it doesn't stop her from going out with 5 different people each week, or she'll just take offense to any request I ask.  I knew she was broke, I knew she had issues, but I mean she only works 15-20hrs a week delivering food. She's home 3-4x a week, all day. We agreed on $300 a month for everything, with some negotiation. Now i'm getting the ""I dunno what I can pay this month.."" after I told her not to worry about the first month, she's still short. But plenty of money for tattoos and nipple piercings. Ever since she started dating someone new, its like a massive step backwards between us. So there goes the company along with the money. I make decent money so it isnt like ill go broke, but we had an agreement. The only thing keeping my spirits up at this point is the fact her daddy bought her a place (its literally a shack in the woods falling apart) and shell be gone in the next month or 2. Cant help but sit here thinking why am I getting fucked like this and why I feel lonelier than before after trying to help someone. 

I think the reason im typing this out is one, i just woke up and this has been eating at me. I needed to vent and 2, I think we all tend to crave some form of company or friendship and it can get a little...desperate. Unless its quality friendship and a genuine connection, it just sucks. We have a solid connection, but In the end i'm feeling used, isolated and lonelier than before. Yet this has made me resent people just as much if not more.  My trust for people has reached a new low. She's burned me before in the pass, but i assumed being near our 30s she'd mature. However I stuck my neck out for her in a time of need only to get bit in the end.

3937,y8jqny,big_rig77,"I (19M) every now and then feel very alone. I am a homebody mostly, but I go to university a couple days a week. I don‚Äôt mind the people there but they‚Äôre not really my kind of people. I‚Äôm from the country, they‚Äôre from the city. It‚Äôs a bit of a barrier to break.

Before I graduated my main social outlet was school. All of my friends/acquaintances were there. I miss them, in a way. I always kept my distance though ‚Äì I was what I called a ‚Äúdrifter.‚Äù I had a few friends in every friendship group and would bounce between each of them. I always had someone to talk to, but I no longer have that luxury.

I was almost always busy whenever I was asked to go out with people, these invites were rare anyway, but now they barely come at all. I go sometimes. I don‚Äôt think people don‚Äôt like me, quite the opposite, but everyone went on with their own lives and their own friends, and I was left behind, I suppose.

I know I did this, I keep people at an arms length and am not too fond of closeness, but that may have ridded me of a shot at sustainable friendship. 

Over the last year too, my social skills have deteriorated. I‚Äôve shed my charisma for what I really am, which is quite shy.

I tell my family it doesn‚Äôt bother me, which is true 90% of the time. But sometimes, like in this moment, it aches a bit.

Thanks for reading this, if you have. Felt therapeutic to write it down.

Most people here have little to no social life or worry that their social skills aren't good enough to make friends. I've been there before, so I know that when you are in this situation you would do anything to have people to talk to. I also know that when you suffer from extreme loneliness you feel like you have nothing to lose.

So why don't you guys make a kind of club ? When you're a loner, it's always much easier to socialize with people who are just as lonely as you, because you know that they don't judge you and that they are probably interested in making new friends.

If only a few of you guys get out of your comfort zone and work together to organize an event, you could all have a great opportunity to meet new people. Reddit is the perfect place for this.

Instead it's just me sleeping in a empty bed by myself not even really thinking about anything sad in particular just crying. Instead it's just me seeing everyone I know happy with someone at social events im not able to go to, while I'm drowning in my feelings at home.

I have so many regrets so early on I just feel like even a lifetime wouldn't be enough to solve them.  It's so cold, my chest aches at night. I see videos of people living on the street that would love to be in my shoes and worry about the trivial problems I'm facing in the grand scheme of things, and hate myself for feeling self pity. 

How the fuck do I have the right to be sad over not being with anyone when people are out in the cold streets with no place to call home. How the fuck do i have that right when there are people that are in their 40s all alone but pushing through life. I know my problems are nothing. I know a portion of the population would love to be in my situation. I hate myself all the more for it. Only to me, these problems arent trivial, they are my whole world.

Everything feels so superficial. It feels like even the friends that I have are only friends out of pity and needing something from me. I hate that I can't do more for my few friends that I am close to.

It was an accidental overdose. We had doctors appointments today, and when I went into mine, she waited in the car.

When I came back out 45 minutes later, she was completely blue in the face, her hands were purple, she couldn't recognize who I was, she was vomiting through her gtube, and she was convulsing uncontrollably.

We were lucky to only be about 6 blocks away from the ER.

For the next 4 hours, I was crying. She thought she was dying. She hugged me with the weakest hug she had ever given me and she just kept saying that she loved me and to not let  her death lead me to suicide. (She knows all about my mental health struggles and how much she means to me. She really is the person I go to for everything)

I just got a call from my mom, and it was my sister's voice on the other side of the line. She was apologizing profusely about scaring me and that she never wanted that to happen. When I heard her voice, I broke down. She had survived what I thought was her final day on this earth.

3989,y8rmfa,Glenquagmire61201,The past year has been absolutely terrible. I hurt my back and was hospitalized. Got to the point I wasn't able to walk. So I ended up in a nursing home for therapy. In the meantime I wasn't able to work and got evicted from my apartment. I lost absolutely everything I left with the clothes on my back and my phone. Didn't even have a pair of shoes. Lost all my possessions and really lost my hope and will to live. I have waited 17 months to see if I qualify for disability. So basically I am homeless with nothing and nowhere to go. Basically all my so called friends have abandoned me. I haven't been in a relationship in over 5 years and miss having a female in my life that cares about me. Or really the feeling that anyone truly cares. Not having that true human interaction. Nurses and CNAs only care to a certain point but Its 99% about getting that paycheck and going home. I even started a GoFundMe hoping to get some support and assistance and not one dime. I know most will skip this for tl-dr and the simple fact I'm a male but I can definitely use someone to talk to.

3991,y8s9w0,Daambanaan,"Last night was the most difficult night I've had. I'm 16, and still got a ""whole life"" In front of me. My parents keep telling me to focus on my future, but I don't want my future. The future i see myself in doesn't look like it's fun. 
I can say I have friends. Multiple friends groups but I'm not that important in any of them. 
I'm in love. Yeah... I've loved people but not like this. She is different. I am her friend though, nothing more. 
But last Friday, she came over to my house and we watched movies and had fun. The whole night she was touchy. She wanted me to hold her and cuddled up to me. I let it happen I think, but to be honest I didn't understand anything of it. I knew she didn't love me and I already had a hard time trying to get rid of my feelings but not letting her notice or changing our friendship. She kept steering my hand to her private parts and later that night she kissed me. It was my first kiss like that. 
The following days I've been living like I'm the main character like I finally figured out all my problems. 

Last night I talked with her. Opened up over my problems a little bit, and it felt great... Because I thought she had fallen in love with me. I thought a wonder had happened. But than I started thinking about it all while she was sitting beside me. I decide to ask her the one thing I was afraid of. She told me she didn't love me. 
The fact that I'm saying I was shocked makes me feel like I'm about to throw up. 

I feel so used. She knew I loved her, and she needed somebody that night. It's impossible she didn't know. 
I've had a situation before that in which a girl just wanted me close because it made her feel good that somebody loved her. It made me so insecure and I know it fucked me up a lot. And than... This. 

I don't have anybody to talk with. My friends are school friends, and I help them if they have problems but we don't open up to each other.
I have mental issues, I found out. I probably have anorexia, and last night was the first night in a while where I cut and beat myself. I don't want help with it. I just need someone to actually hold me. ME. Not just a guy. Me. I need someone to listen. Why is no one there.

4005,y8uvul,Anxious_Unit_1817,"I know friends and family are busy with their lives but I feel like I am only valued to a connection to them as someone they can borrow money from or giving them money.

For example, I have this friend who is pursing a labor job because he found out he can make a lot of money from it than his part time job but on his off days, I have asked him if he wants to hang out or go somewhere to eat. I have always hanged out with this friend but recently he hasn't been talking or hanging out with me. I know he's busy with his job but like come on, even on his off days he doesn't want too....A couple days ago he messaged me and I got so happy and excited but when I saw the message, it was just him asking if he can borrow $200 and if I am going to need that money back anytime soon. He has borrowed money from me before and payed me back but during those times he was hanging out with me a lot. And its not just him...

I let me brother borrow money 2 years ago for some things and even for a concert ticket, he owes me nearly $500 and hasn't made any contributions to paying me back for 1 year. But I don't hang out with him much anymore, he is usually with his girlfriend and never invites me to places with them....

My brother isn't the only sibling that is like this with me. My older sister is the same way, borrows money but doesn't bother hanging out with me or inviting me anywhere....

And I made a friend through here on reddit, used to have feelings for her. I known her for a year now, she told me she was going to give me a chance if her current relationship wasn't working just to pull a ""ha ha ha got you bitch, you thought I was going to give you a chance"" type on thing on me and instead dated some dude she barely met just because they spent all day long talking and gaming together. When she went to that new relationship, they started having financial problems and asked to borrow $200 from me. I was also drunk and my feelings for that person was starting to come back and thinking I should help her.  My dumbass let her borrow the money. I mention the money from time to time when I talk to her to remind her that she borrowed money and that I need it back. I don't think I am getting it back because she hasn't mentioned anything about giving it back anytime soon... \*sigh\* its not the first women to do this to me. An ex did the same thing before breaking up with me.

Also made friends on reddit in which I talk to a lot and also buying them things. 2 of them are from another country and of course my currency is like rich money to them. I didn't mind it at first because they were talking to me a lot but I noticed when I stopped buying them things that they slowly decline in talking with me...then I would start buying them small things again and then they would talk more with me then stop giving them things and  then they slowly declined in conversation with me. 

There was one other redditor I made friends with whom seemed genuinely being friends with me. Told me that they aren't using snapchat anymore so we moved to discord. I of course bought this person something as well for their bday because I felt this person cared and really wanted to be friends with me. Recently haven't heard from this friend, they are busy in school which I understand but it seems I am blocked from them on reddit. Or that they deleted their reddit account. But if this person did delete their account they would have told me just like they did with snapchat....At first I kept messaging this person on discord because they weren't answering or online so I was genuinely worried so I went on reddit to message them to find out i was either blocked or they deleted their account....I feel like I was blocked....Of course I was....

&amp;#x200B;

I give up....I give up on finding human connections. I only seem valuable to people when money is involved. I hate being human. I just want to feel connected. I don't want to be left out. I don't want to be alone! But what can I do when the people that ""care""(family and friends) don't seem to want to be around me unless I have something to give them. I remember I had to bribe that labor friend for food and drinks just to hang out...my heart was alone in the darkness and I kept trying to show my family and friends that I am reaching out for them. Reaching out to not be lonely. 

I just give up on human connections. I give up on reaching out.

I have a ton of things I enjoy. I am a huge video game player, love to learn about history anytime I can, am Into politics (my master's is in poli sci), and listen to a lot of folk music, like football etc. 

The problem is that I have no one to enjoy these things with in my life. LITERALLY, no one I know does any of these (aside from watching the NFL, but everyone does that). 

I get a new game and beat it, and no one to celebrate or discuss a level or weapon or how hard a boss was. 

Find a new history podcast, I get all gitty, but when I talk about it, no one in my life gives a shit. The same goes for anything politics. 

I've always wanted to learn things like D&amp;D but have no one to play, my BIL does be he is out of state, and when I asked if I could zoom in and learn, he said that ""you wouldn't fit in""...

4026,y8ywdx,[deleted],"My partner of 7 years ended things earlier this year, my first relationship and I am a very emotional/mentally unstable person. We ran a gym together so my job/life revolved around the gym, the community etc and I didn't really have a life outside of that at all. 

I don't agree with alot of his reasons for ending things, a lot of the blame was put on me (and I wasn't given a chance to fix anything), but im 99% sure he left me for my friend. 

The breakup has left me having to live with my toxic parents for the last 6 months as I am unable to get a rental as I lost my job, I have no social circle and friends, I did go a bit crazy once I found out the truth and lost a lot of people as a result of this (she actually took out a VRO on me lol). To make things worse I have a medical condition which requires me to have kids ASAP if i want them. 

I know deep down I am still in denial about the breakup, and I am putting off taking proper action because it will mean things are actually REAL, and I'm terrified of having to essentially start my life from nothing and eventually get to a place to feel fine dating again (yuck). I just hate he decided to wait until 31 to do this to me, when he tells me he's been unhappy the last 3 years and I had no idea.

4035,y90nbm,pessimisttears," I don't know how to start because I have a lot to say but it feels so hard to do it. For background information I'm 22/M. I used to get bullied and left out from an early age throughout kindergarden, elementary and high-school. My whole youth was about me being infront of my PC. I always hated the way everybody was looking at me with the same eyes as if I was an alien or sth. It went so far that I always wanted to thank the cashier or any worker at the shops for not trashing me. I even remember when some of them showed support for Amanda Todd when she committed suicide but none of them cared about my well being eventho they witnessed it everyday and kinda even were part of it. I'm bad at having normal conversations and I have a hard time with making friends. I don't how to improve my social skills as I don't have many people to socialise but I would for sure love to be more social yet I have no option. Obviously I managed to make 2 friends but I rarely see them because both have gfs. I never had a gf and was never close to a girl in my life and I even don't know how to talk to them in the first place. I remember when the pandemic happened and people started complaining about the fact that they can't meet with their friends or go to parties meanwhile it didn't change much for me. That's another reason why I have a hard time relating to people around my age after all I don't know how it is having a friends group where you do sth together, meet new people and be invited to parties. One of my only friends told me once that he can't help me out with my problems. I been falling out with him lately and I don't know if I should cut my ties with him or not. I think I just wasted my childhood, teenage years and now even my early twenties. That's why I'm always stuck in my head and think about fake scenarios to cope with my loneliness. I think about people appreciating me, being happy, having fun, being loved by girls, being successfull and talented. All these things that I always wanted. I feel like I'm a good for nothing. Nothing really catches my interest. I'm bored out of everything so quick. Not even games satisfy me anymore so I keep scrolling on reddit or twitter mindlessly for hours. I used to have couple mutuals on twitter but I stopped talking to them as I saw no point in that anymore after all they live far away from me. I don't seem to be accepted there either. There is no hobby nor sport that I want to do because I don't have the motivation for anything. I don't seem to get out of my head nor of my pessimistic mindset. If I had the chance to return back in time I would do it because I would do so many things differently. I hate being invisible like no one is going out of their way to have me in their life nor did people I used to know before contact me once to check up on me if I'm still alive or if I'm ok. I don't know what I want in life and honestly I don't have any desire to continue pursuing anything because I'm not getting out of my current state. I faced so many challenges yet I couldn't share them with anyone. I'm still alone and I still don't get excited in anything I do. All I want is a couple of people around me and someone who loves me because I know there is a whole world I haven't discovered yet. Everyday I wake up with the hopes of change but those are just empty thoughts because I live the same cycle everyday and I really have no encourage to keep going on. I don't know what I need to do. It's like I haven't been crying out for help the past few years but no one cares anyway. I'm sure that there are many people like me on here as I already read a lot of other threads about it and I could relate to many of them.

They said that sex is awful, and relationships are awful. That no amount of freinds, family or romantic relationships will make life better and in fact only make it worse. 

They claimed that everyone dies alone. And the pain of losing all your loved ones is worse than just being alone forever. 

I of course disagree. I see people talking about sex and relationships so casually it's not even funny, was on a sub talking about struggling to pay bills and someone randomly brought up their FWB and how she payed bills, lol just bringing up sexual relationships everywhere.

I was aware the entire time that she‚Äôs not available, yet by being friends, we grew too fond of each other. Never did anything physical, but the energy was there. 

This is the first time my feelings have been this intense for someone. It‚Äôs rare for me to be told that the person I‚Äôm attracted to feels the same way towards me, and it hurts accepting the reality of this situation; that we can‚Äôt be together. Since I‚Äôve never been in a relationship (I‚Äôm in my mid 20s), this feels like the universe slapping me in the face. 

I‚Äôm writing this post here bc I don‚Äôt have it in me to pursue feelings of love and acceptance anymore. Given all my past rejections and experiences, I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm on my own and that any energy I‚Äôd be exhausting on someone else I should be using for myself. 

I‚Äôm really trying to train my mind to reject the notion of romance. It just hurts too much. 

Lastly, we‚Äôve agreed to stay friends and we‚Äôve established boundaries.

it also makes me annoyed at them easily. imagine if you had someone who you didnt care about at all constantly trying to make you laugh as if their life mission is to follow you around. it gets so draining being with people you consider friends just because its the way you see other people‚Äôs friendship work.

they deserve so much better than me. i literally dont care about any of them at all and i dont trust them but i see others crying into their friends arms at any minor inconvenience and being emotionally venerable and actually siding with them even if their wrong, like some sort of emotional bias because they like that person more. i just dont bond with anyone. i used to be able to kind of trust people as a kid, but bonding has always been an issue. how do i fix this and what is wrong with me???",2022-10-20 21:17:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611415821,8,/r/lonely/comments/y9a9ie/how_do_i_socialise_fr_advice/,,0,4,how do i socialise fr? advice??

You can‚Äôt quit after setbacks, if you want to succeed, you must keep working, but each attempt is a number and learning experience that will get you closer. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt fly, run, if you can‚Äôt run, walk, if you can‚Äôt walk, crawl, but by all means keeping moving forward.‚Äù - Martin Luther King. If it gives you any hope, I had to talk to over 50 females until I finally found someone who was willing to go out with me. It‚Äôs definitely feasible for anyone. You just have to continue going for it. Develop your speaking skills through practice and work on the areas you can to build attraction by learning and self-development and then putting in the work. Be kinder, get stronger, gain confidence. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone because we all have certain setbacks but I can tell you that there are over 7 billion almost 8 billion people in the world. With our phones and planes and billions of people are yet to be met every single day and the technology for positive change is improving. The largest thing that might set you back and it‚Äôs hard because I unfortunately am a victim too is that you allow yourself to be lonely because you want too much from a dream person and life isn‚Äôt a fairy tale. There‚Äôs people lonely like you right here. And that implies that you aren‚Äôt.

Here are some apps and/or strategies I recommend trying:

- Simply introduce yourself to someone or ask them a simple question such as ‚ÄúHey, how are you? ‚Äî- ‚ÄúMy name is ‚Äî‚Äî. What‚Äôs your name ‚Äî‚Äî.‚Äù If you stumble or forget something be honest and if they judge you negatively then they are probably not right for you, then just go to the next person.

- You can do this at bars, clubs, coffee shops, libraries, restaurants, the grocery store, anywhere really

-You can also do this online here, on Tinder, Bumble, and many other sites

-Whisper is a particular app you can use if you‚Äôre looking for a hookup

-Therapy, doing well at work, the gym, reading, and meditation are also an option you can seek if you need to work on your self esteem or have mental setbacks

-Drinking enough water and taking deep breaths are helpful for easing anxiety before talking to someone 

But there are so many options and mentors I couldn‚Äôt list them all.

4125,y9exjh,aworldofhopes,"I graduated about a year ago(May 2021), since then I started my online Master's program. I made a small group of friends at college but lost a lot of time and bonding with them due to the pandemic turning everything virtual. After, I regularly talked to 3 of them via text and video chat. For a while, I was okay with that, mostly because of how far we all were from one another. I've started to notice how my friends and I were at different points in life, which I knew was going to happen, but I'm not quite sure how to 'catch up'. One is moved to another state, living with their significant other of a year. Another just started a serious relationship and is already talking about moving out, asking me if I'm ready to move in with them and such, dropping hints that they want to do this soon. A third has been working a steady, WFH job for the past 3 years. 

I just feel like I'm miles behind everyone. I'm still at home and don't really see a way where I can move out within the next year or two, due to all of my money going toward school. I am not in any sort of relationship. I haven't been having any luck in jobs lately, working crappy job after crappy job since graduating. 

This isn't my first being lonely, as most of my elementary and middle school years were also lonely. I just thought that maybe I was done with that, but now I see that I'm starting to go back to old habits. I'm an introvert, and a huge homebody(something that was only worsened by the COVID pandemic). I guess that I was looking to vent and possibly get some advice on this transition in life(besides go out more----planning on doing some more of that soon).",2022-10-21 00:35:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608422175,3,/r/lonely/comments/y9exjh/loneliness_postcollege/,,0,2,Loneliness post-college

So long story short I don't feel like I'm getting on with my flat mates, they all seemed to of clicked but for me at least I havent.

About a week and a half into moving in i had a brief few days where I was depressed (ongoing previous issues) which I kept to myself but let them know about, but since then I felt like the outsider of the group somewhat.

Like now if we're all in the same room I'm probably the last anyone will talk to, even a girl who is doing the same course as me won't really speak to me unless it's urgent or its like just us two, even then its like brief.

When I got out my depression slump I went back to my normal self tried talking more etc doing jokes which went well, but two days ago four of us (Theres like 9 in total in the flat) went to a restaurant but the whole time they didn't really speak to me unless it's like a one word answer or something, they were more interested in talking to eachother which I can't argue with as again they're closer friends so they open up to each other where as they don't to me.

I spoke to one of my flat mates about it previously as I wanted to ask if I upset anyone etc, she said to her anyway she doesn't think there's any issue at all and that me feeling not liked wasnt the case, but I still can't help shake this feeling honestly. Since our night out I've been a bit more reserved to my flat mates as again I didnt feel fully welcome so I got demotivated, which prob set me back a bit getting close to them.

How can I avoid getting demotivated over this?",2022-10-21 02:27:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1559942338,3,/r/lonely/comments/y9h9l1/feel_like_shit_as_i_dont_feel_like_i_get_on_with/,,0,4,Feel like shit as I don't feel like I get on with my Uni Flatmates

4157,y9ieqi,Fire_to_Ice,"2021 and 2022 have been nothing but ruthless and cruel to me not constantly but it's hit me where it hurts most. 2020 and 2019 sucked too but not exactly like how 2021 and 2022 have. 

I won't be recounting everything chronologically because so much shit has happened. I've had a family member who I currently disown and hate take back child support checks intended for my sister and I. She used it to buy yet another car as this bitch can't handle money worth a fuck. Tried to screw my sister out of her half with a car that was leaking something since she can't take car of her cars either. I had planned to use my half to pay to fix for the tub and the kitchen sink along with getting our cat, Starfire to a vet. This relative knew the tub was broken and even said she would get the cat to the vet if she had the money, well, she got it and blew it on another piece of shit car she won't take care of.

I never got my stimulus checks because they say it's already been claimed and won't give me any details on it. I figure something got fucked along the way or said greedy relative took it.

I don't have any friends in person or online and I'm totally at a loss anymore with it. I'm growing impatient and I just hate this. I have no other options because MySpace died in the early 2010s and VampireFreaks is gone and all that's left is that shitty online store of theirs. I also acknowledge that it's also my fault. Aspergers fucks me up socially. I don't socialize in person unless someone I feel comfortable around is with me, I don't like phone calls or voice chats with people I barely know or haven't talked to in a long time... it all just sucks.

As for what I'm dealing with right now other than the lack of friends, I found out a few months ago I can't see the eye doctor I had seen before because they won't take my medical card so I'll have to switch which is so fun. Also, my sister's cat, Starfire, has cancer and is probably going to be put to sleep tomorrow which has been real hard on me. I've had moments where I cry and other moments where I'm just dealing with the cards life dealt me. I fucking hate that this piece of shit year and fucking cancer is taking my only friend from me. Starfire is a special cat as out of all the cats we've had over the years she's the one I've bonded with. She's my best friend, my family and my baby. I'm going to be so lost without her and the house is going to be so empty without her as it will just be my grandma and I when Star is gone. My grandma tends to do a few things that involve leaving the house so I'll be truly alone when she goes to bingo, runs errands and other stuff when Starfire is gone.

I also am not the type to go out and get another animal after losing one I just see it as a rebound and it's gross. On top of that I can't deal with death in general. I can't deal with Starfire dying, I won't be able to deal with my grandma eventually dying and I still can't face the fact that I too will one day die. I don't want another cat or even to try again with rats despite loving rats so much. I can't deal with an animal passing it destroys me. And before anyone can say it, I know. I know I need a therapist. I've known for a long while now and for some of that time I was afraid because I've seen therapists here and there as a teen and even a couple as an adult. The ones I saw are shit and honestly I'm willing to bet they got their degrees by doing the following: cheating on homework / tests, buying a forged degree out of the trunk of some dude's car in a back alley, dumpster diving outside a Walmart for it or finding one in the Goodwill bargain bin.

I've reached a point where it's better to risk running into another shit therapist than to just sit and stew in this mess. I've also since learned that when getting a therapist you take things slow by talking about small things to build up enough trust and familiarity to talk about the bigger things. The only issue now is the above mentioned medical insurance switch. Speaking of which America's problems have started fucking with me. Won't go too deep because politics is probably the touchiest it's ever been but this country needs to get better for the people living in it because this is not what we deserve as we deserve so much better.

I'm sort of conflicted to hit post on this because a lot of this is personal and I still have some stuff on my mind like how my sister doesn't know about Starfire's declining health and how I'm not even sure if she should know right now because I don't know how she will react. I also don't want her and her boyfriend capitalizing on this to try and move back into my grandma's house. Spoilers I **hate** living with them, it's like living with two dip shit teenagers who think they can do whatever they want in someone else's house. Also, I fear if she doesn't know she will get pissed but honestly... I don't give a fuck or I don't want to give a fuck. I have been giving Star her medicine and now I've only laid off if she won't take it after some trying because her comfort is more important and the medicine isn't going to save her. It's just going to ease her pain, give her more of an appetite, make her drink more water than she other wise would have and slow the cancer growth down. So, I really don't care if someone gets mad because they didn't know. Plus, a while back she made a fucked up comment about giving us another cat when Star passes because she wanted to get one of her other cats pregnant. Personally, she shouldn't be allowed to own animals as from what I heard the two (her and her bf) don't really clean the box and they smoke pot around those cats (not sure how good or bad that is for them).

I guess at this moment I'm numb. I don't care if she sees this and figures out it's about her. There's a lot of people who I think shouldn't be allowed to own animals for the fact that aren't giving the animal what they need. I'm also not going to put up with any drama from this as I've been at a point where I'm done with all the bull shit in the world and in my personal life. Starfire having cancer and dying from it is the last straw for me. She had her eye removed only to have a lump pop up on her back left leg and her third eyelid swell and cover her other eye.

I don't expect anyone to read this mess or even find me to be approachable. I don't know what you, who's reading this might think, I just fear nothing but bad things will be assumed about me **and** brought to my attention. I just needed a space to let shit out where others can see it and maybe relate to it and want to talk but if not that's fine. I just need to get it out to the world because it gets old doing voice recordings on my phone to vent. Plus, I don't think I'd be able to talk too long in a voice recording before I start sobbing again about how fucked up my life is at the moment. It was bad enough I was nervous about Star making it through surgery because of her heart murmur and when she came out fine I thought that this was going to be alright, everything was going to be okay. Nope, not at all. It made me sad when Starfire surprisingly came into my room earlier tonight partly because this will be the last time and because it makes me think she's doing because she know it will be her last time. She's not in my room currently but I did enjoy the time she spent in here with my with the exception of her trying to go under my bed. It's so hard losing her as she's been around for about half of my life. I'm also not the type to cry in public and not looking forward to crying at the vets office again but I don't want the cancer to be what takes her because I've seen how bad it gets in humans and how bad she is now.

If you made it this far thanks for reading bits of what made 2021 and 2022 suck for me. If anyone cares to send me any messages my DMs are always open so if you can relate don't be afraid to come and talk and don't worry if you don't want to dwell on the mess as I understand. We can't stop and stay stopped just because life wanted to trip us out of no where and then beats us while we're down. I just wish I had friends to keep me company for the loneliness I may experience again once Starfire is freed from her suffering.",2022-10-21 03:22:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599450626,1,/r/lonely/comments/y9ieqi/the_past_few_years_have_been_rough/,,0,1,The past few years have been rough

4159,y9irgo,poopiedookie999,"Me and my girlfiend met when we were both in a really bad place, for me physically and to a lesser extent emotionally. We fell for each other pretty fast I'll admit but we understood each other so well. She helped me make it through my illness and I helped her with so many emotional and mental health problems. I never felt like she was a burden, it brought me so much happiness to see her grow and heal as a person.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I can tell she's going through a rough patch again. I had been having a really hard time at college the last year or so and hadn't been able to be there for her nearly enough. Finally we sit down and talk about our issues and the struggles we've been going through. Then she hits me with some fucked up news but I honestly felt we could get through it. She was shocked that I wanted to stay and tried to push me away but I wanted to fight. I was willing to work on myself and us, go to therapy individually and together to work through our issues.

At first, she agreed. Lots of emotions were running hot though and I did break down a few times thinking about what had happened. After the initial shock, we had the most in depth and reflective conversation I think I've ever had in my life. I felt closer to her than I had in a long time despite what had happened.

After a couple days she finally decides that were over just like that, after having me convinced we really could fix things. She can't move past what she had done and I don't even know that she really wants to. On top of that she said that things I had been doing were bothering her for a long time. She had tried to fix them on her own but never told me about them and just wants to give up now. Then she dumped the spiel about how good of a person I am, how handsome I am, how ill find someone better for me. 

I guess more than anything I'm confused. If I would have known what was wrong sooner I would have done anything I needed to. 

I feel really alone right now. I have friends and family that care but she was the only person I could really talk to when I was feeling this bad.",2022-10-21 03:39:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/y9irgo/blindsided_by_6_year_relationship_ending_22m/,,0,3,Blindsided by 6 Year Relationship Ending [22m]

4162,y9j82j,hiyoyoyoyo,"I'm so alone at uni. I have no friends. Don't know anyone on my course. My only acquaintance dropped out. So now I'm already in second year and my future looks grim.

If it was her other friends or her crush she would reply in an instant. It hurts. I'm still living at home currently since my uni is close to my home so I don't even have flatmates or anything like that. But we're poor so I live in an area where most students rent houses and live together, so I always hear them laughing at night outside my window. Just reminding me of how alone I am. I don't have anyone to go out with and talk to. Anyway my depression is getting worse so I don't even know if I'll make it through this winter. Last year was hell. And knowing that I'm going to have to go through that feeling all over again it just doesn't seem worth it. I tried to hold on last year because I still had my best friend who was there for me.

I've been dealing with this feeling of loneliness for a pretty long time, maybe even since I was a little kid. Mind you, I'm married, and I'm happy about that. I just feel lonely no matter who I'm with. Like, deep down, I feel like I've never had an actual deep connection with another human being.   


That's to say, I feel connected to my spouse. I just don't feel like they get me; I guess that's the actual problem. It always feels like I'm on this island. People can pass by on their boats and wave, but no one can actually get to the island. - It takes me to a pretty dark place sometimes.   


As I said, it's been this way for a very, very long time. Sometimes I wonder if there ever wasn't a time when it felt this way. Almost all my attempts to connect with people feel like failures and I'm just bothering folks when I talk. Sure, I do it anyway. If I'm known for anything, it's that I'm a chatterbox.  


I know I'm strange. People often say I'm strange. I can't ever seem to understand why I'm strange though. My spouse says it's partly how I talk sometimes or what I talk about. It just doesn't make sense to me though.   


Anyway, that's pretty much it. It made me feel vaguely better to dump this stream of consciousness for strangers on the internet to read.",2022-10-21 05:14:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1340589186,10,/r/lonely/comments/y9kmzi/hi_just_want_to_vent/,,0,3,Hi. Just Want to Vent.

4200,y9p2iq,jayanmylove,"I am a high school student, 16F. Ever since I was a child, I never really enjoyed going to school. Why you ask? I was pretty much bullied by my class teacher when I was in 1st -2nd grade. Afterwards it became kind of like a habit to skip school if a minor inconvenience happened. If I couldn't be with my friends, I would dread going to school. Ever since I was a child, my friends meant the world to me. But sadly in most of the cases they didn't adored me as much I adored them. Then from 6th grade to 9th grade I had a really toxic friend. Because of her I lost many of friends and circles. She made me come to a point where I wanted to unalive myself. But things got better during the lockdown. I started doing good. I became good in studies. I started to discover myself. I became confident and soon I was happy. ( although I still felt lonely sometimes) but sadly, I had to change schools for my higher education. And since I have moved to my new school I have not been the same. I feel the loneliest in my school. I made like 1 friend there. Although some of my friends from the previous schools are with me, I feel lonely. The inability to make any friends has deeply affected me. I am losing my previous friends too and I can't even keep up with them because I am just so depressed. There's no connection in my new school even if I try to approach people I get ignored. I really wanted a friends group where I can have fun. I really wanted to make memories in my new school. I wanted school to be memorable for me. I can't move on from the fact that school will never hold any happy memories for me. I probably wont have/make any deep connections with people. And because of this I have been crying for the past few months. I have been severely depressed.  The thing that hurts me so much ( I know I am immature and selfish) is seeing my friends from my previous school doing good. Creating many many memories, growing, having a good friend circle. And even my previous friend in this new school are doing way better than me. They made friends, they interact with them. But when I try to do that I am ignored. I am literally invisible and for them. How do I cope up with this? Accepting this situation would practically mean giving up on hoping something good will happen here. I am so lonely. I am not even able to share things with my present friends cause they are not so close with me.",2022-10-21 09:31:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/y9p2iq/how_do_i_cope_up_with_the_fact_i_will_have/,,0,4,how do I cope up with the fact I will have another bad year in my school

Anyways when the first flight started to board that was landing to New Orleans, these 3 older ladies sat right next to me for the entire flight , I told them I was nervous because I never flew before and I was really nervous. Soon as the plane found moved out of its gate and into the runway and started to ascend and takeoff , I felt the speed and the plane suddenly tilt which instantly , I panicked in front of everybody like a three year old , a twenty six year old man panicking and crying because he was terrified of how the plane feels , I legitimately cried the entire first flight and the people sitting nearby was trying to calm me down , the lady was super nice and gave me a whole box of gum for me to chew on my next set of flights to help with my ears popping and bottled water, the flight attendants offered me snacks and even though I offered to pay for them (because I just feel bad when I am offered free stuff when I should and could buy it from them) they said it‚Äôs fine.

When friday comes i know everyone is going home to someone or they are going to have fun, but i have no money..a shitty job, no friends or girlfriend, never had one either (even though i am 29M). I don't want to drink anymore just to feel some kind of joy, i am so tired of crying every weekend..i work out a lot just to avoid drinking but my body can't take this much physical effort and i feel it breaking. So when i can't work out i drink. I feel like i entered in a series of dark rooms and i can't find a way out.

4241,ya046h,Samismo,"I don't feel lonely all the time, but when I do it's very unpleasant. The problem with most of the suggested solutions though is that they change even the parts of your life when you don't feel lonely.

Get a girlfriend, they say. Well, that's supposed to be for life, right? If not, what's the point? That's kind of a huge commitment, and will probably be a nuisance when I just want to be on my own and focus on my own stuff.

Get a dog, they say. Great, that's another life that will be demanding my attention pretty much 24/7 for the coming 15 or so years of my life.

Join a group, they say. Great, that's probably something I'll have to go to once or a couple of times a week. I can't deal with that kind of commitment.

Like, how do I get something I can whip out on Friday night only, when I'm feeling the most lonely?",2022-10-21 17:57:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613757231,1,/r/lonely/comments/ya046h/the_problem_of_permanent_solutions_to_a_temporary/,,0,1,The problem of permanent solutions to a temporary problem

I'm this lonely trans guy in my mid-twenties who has been single for almost six years now. I have friends, but due to being bullied for pretty much all of my school years I really struggle to connect with people. My home life was disordered and abusive. With all of this going on, I developed compulsions and became really weird. Strict rituals, addiction, weird superstitions and black-white thinking dominated my childhood and early teens.
I was fearful, I did not trust people, I was terrified of being ostracized. Due to me being trans and bisexual, I did not fit into the traditional small village I was born in and have a lot of baggage to deal with because of that. I felt like no one could help me. I felt unloved and ugly most of the time - I was only ever asked out as a ""prank"" from my peers, because they thought it was funny to see my reaction. 

My first kiss was at seventeen with a woman I met online, and she was my only ever (long distance) girlfriend for eight months. She was however severely depressed with a difficult family, so it was hard to bear. I did not have anything going on ever since, apart from a handful of dates that did not go anywhere. Also I had a really big crush on a guy for a while that totally destroyed me mentally for reasons I will not detail, but that certainly was another nail in the coffin of my romantic life.

Today, I'm doing fine on paper. I'm in a place where a lot of people are like me. I am doing a job I love. I'm successful and doing relatively well financially. I've also got a therapist and antidepressants to help me during dark days.
And yet, I feel so terribly, soul-crushingly lonely that I want to rip my hair out. I can't seem to form intimate relationships with people. I don't get calls from anyone unless they are business related. I am rarely invited to Birthday parties. No one goes on vacation with me. I feel like people only talk to me to be polite, but no one really wants to be my friend.

I am not social I'm withdrawn and who on here doesn't have some good reasons to withdraw like past trauma and simply being afraid to open up to another.

I wish someone existed that could unconditionally understand me and won't think I'm weird or boring. Because I feel like I have so much to give but I'm afraid of giving it to the wrong person.

I was/am very introverted,i hate people most of the time but here i am wondering if maybe i should have asked out that one girl i kinda liked (nevermin i'm to scared of rejection)or if i should have made more friends or idk just done more.
First year of college went preatty much like high school i kept my friend circle at a minimum,no girlfriend no nothing (i mean who would like me anyways,i'm insecure asf and holding a conversation in general is hard for me so yeah no experience virgin (haven't kissed a girl yet) preatty much got no chance) and the year vent by very fast frighteningly so.
And now a reality check just hit me and made me wonder if i'm vasting my life or if i should do more (i don't feel like it,usually but sometimes i get moments when i think that i should've done more).
It got me wondering what if i could stop time and think maybe plan for the future idk just take a brake from all the stress that comes with college and parents and life.How wonderful would a break be (even though i'm probably undeserving of it),it would feel nice for maybe once in my life to not walk blindfolded.

And what I hate the most is that statistics say you were more than likely molested too. I hate that I can't hate you because your were hurt too, but fuck why me? Why anyone else? Fuck whoever hurt you but goddamn it, god fucking damn it, I would NEVER EVER wish this hurt on anyone, so why'd you do it to me? I hate myself for empathizing; yes you were a child too, but far older than me. I filled out the intake form and when it asked about being sexual assaulted, it emphasized a 5 year age gap for minors, and you were well over that gap. I was a fucking child child. Fucking hell.

How are you? Do you get crippling anxiety when it comes to relationships? Are you even in a relationship? Cause I'm not. Haven't been in years. And even then, it was always me that would push them away because of you. You gave me horrible codependency that scares anyone off. I'm clingy. I'm too much. I'm too available. I'm too eager. I fall too hard and am quick to give all of me till I have nothing left. You fucking made me this way. Are you happy? Does it haunt you as much as it haunts me? Does it overlap into every aspect of your life? Does it give you horrible imposter syndrome? Cause it does for me. I was at a work outing and my awesome fearless boss shared the story of hiring me over the other candidate despite them being the FAR OBVIOUS better choice. I COULDN'T TAKE THE PRAISE. Even when everyone was repeating words of encouragement to me, I COULDN'T TAKE IT. I WAITED TILL THERE WAS A BEAT IN THE CONVERSATION SO I COULD LEAVE. That's how fucking bad it is. Fuck you and fuck whoever hurt you. FUCK. SHIT, I'D PROBABLY ACTUALLY BE IN MY DREAM FIELD OF WORK IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU. HOW ABOUT YOU? ARE YOU WORKING THE JOB YOU STUDIED FOR, LONGED FOR, DREAMED OF? DO YOU HAVE THE LIFE YOU ALWAYS WANTED?! ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY?! CAUSE I'M HERE WITH A FUCKING BURNER REDDIT ACCOUNT JUST TO ""SCREAM"" INTO THE VOID, WHEN I COULD BE OUT LIVING THE LIFE I WANT BUT NO, YOU FUCKING TOOK UP SPACE, NO RENT OR ANY GODDAMN MORTGAGE, JUST PITCHED UP A FUCKING TENT TO FOREVER LINGER WITH A PAIN AND FEAR THAT I'LL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T DESERVE IT. AND NO, IT'S NOT ME GIVING YOU ENERGY, IT'S NOT ME ALLOWING YOU THAT CONTROL OVER ME, BECAUSE YOU'VE FUCKING ALWAYS BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS 6. FUCKING 6. THAT SHIT FUCKING STAINS HARDER THAN ANY GODDAMN WINE.

I hate you. And I'm sorry someone hurt you too, but you fucking hurt me. You taught me at a very young age that hurt people hurt other people. Now I'm fucking terrified to love and be loved, because I will always fear them leaving me. You did that to me. You fucking did this. I will always assume the worst for me.

I'm 32 and I'm scared of falling deeper into knowing I don't deserve to be happy; I don't deserve to love and be loved, because I am hurt people. And hurt people hurt other people. But if there was any selfish plea I could ever make, why me?

4342,yac6ph,Kyle_Krafter,"I sat here for a long time. Deleting what I wrote. Then starting again. Stopping to light a smoke, while I truly contemplated. Being anxious and confused on exactly what it was I wanted to type. I've never met anyone in my life that would actually listen to me. I know they hear what I am saying, but no one is listening. If that makes sense? Like it matters so little to whoever you are telling, they would rather start talking over you. Instead of listening.

I am 36 years old. I had a lot of friends growing up, even up into my twenties. Over the last nine years something changed, where I literally have no one to talk to. To the point I'm making a random public post to strangers, no offense to anyone. I was that one friend that would help everyone. You needed a hand, a ride, food, or place to chill. Anything within reason obviously. I was a part of all these people's lives growing up. Valuing their friendships. Just being happy to be there and included. To being pretty much forgotten.

Even with me understanding that everyone moves on with their lives. Whether I am a part of it or not. When I reach out to say your friend is still here, multiple times over the years. Just for it to be ignored. It hurts. I was there for all of them when they needed a friend. Then turn around years later, add me on social media, to not talk to me. Bumping up that friend count I guess. Not really sure why people do this. It's like if someone don't see my life through posts, and pictures now. It doesn't matter to them. The world ends if you can't like or comment on something....I don't know.

I sit here and think. If my friendship, my companionship, my willingness to help wasn't good enough for people I've known my whole life. Is it worth my time to waste other people's time with myself and how I am? I am not overbearing either. I understand boundaries, and others schedules.

I always thought it would be nice to have friends or a friend I could sit down with, and talk over a cup of coffee. I built up my home so I could share it, and now I sit here alone.",2022-10-22 02:52:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1380320572,2,/r/lonely/comments/yac6ph/im_just_not_sure/,,0,7,I'm just not sure.

so i go and find out the event wasn't happening... I stg it said it'd be happening today at this time but nope. now it says on the website it'll happen tomorrow lol. so that was a fucking lie. now i'm at discovery green seeing all these people talking and having fun in the park and nearby restaurants which of course makes me super jealous and triggers my sadness/depression.

i just say ""fuck it i'm going home"" and do exactly except more sadder and depressed than before i came there.

damn shame because this was supposed to my attempt at ""putting myself in social situations to get used to it"" but it just served as a giant reminder as to why i don't bother. i just feel more fucking hopeless and more of a loser going to these places by myself when because everyone else is seemingly there with a friend or family member (and i'll never invite my family with me cuz i lowkey hate them lol).

4353,yadois,Yamaeiou,"Me and my friend decided to go skating at our local skating rink. Personally I didn‚Äôt want to go but she forced me anyway, anyways‚Ä¶ it was going well until this guy started smiling and taking glances at me, my friend noticed this and got in-front to block his view.. I didn‚Äôt really care to be honest! It was alright she wasn‚Äôt doing anything to ‚Äúmuch‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt make a big stink over it but when my friend decided she wanted to sit down and take a break in the resting benches outside of the skating rink and I wanted to sit down on one of the resting benches inside the skating rink, I was fixing my skates and then I see the guy that was previously making eye contact with me and smiling came up to me and started talking about random stuff like skating and asked for me name and he told me his, he asked me to get up and skate with him but I kept making all these excuses until me convinced me to skate with him. It was fun skating while he skated around me while we had a conversation and laughed but then he went in-front of me and asked if he could hold my hand and I said yes thinking nothing of it, so he took both of my hands and we skated for a couple of seconds until my friend came running into the skating rink, YANKING me away from the dude and forced me out of the skating rink, she told me that he was disgusting trying to ‚Äúflirt‚Äù with me. I told her he was just being friendly and teaching me how to skate but she wasn‚Äôt having it so she forced me out of there and I couldn‚Äôt complain since she was my ride home. The whole ride back to my place she was ranting about how he was wrong for doing that and how he looked WAYY older then me and he should know better and a bunch of other stuff, she even told me to be more confident and not let dudes ‚Äútake advantage of me‚Äù like that! I argued back AGAIN that he was just being friendly!

4354,yaeepl,Status_Fly_5654,"I don't have anything special to say that anyone else has not said but the idea of being heard does appeal to me. I feel like I'm in a bad dream, except there is no escaping it. In a nightmare you can simply wake up, but the only way out of this life is death. I really do not want to die in any way, but I am truly scared for my life. I do not believe in god in any way, and when I break down in the middle of the night there is nobody who knows or cares. I have a loving family and daily things to accomplish, and that prevents me from killing myself. I think I resent my family for loving me because I just want the pain to end, maybe? I've been so isolated and alone for over a year now, despite having opportunity to interact with others everyday. I tried so incredibly hard when I first started college. I sat down to eat lunch with random people, I went to every last event and club that I could, and I did my best to put myself out there and I made a fool of myself over and over again. I did some things that were really embarrassing, got rejected a couple of times, and most of all felt like I couldn't establish a solid friendship with anybody. No matter how hard I try to get people's numbers and to initiate hanging out, (sometimes for romantic reasons but 90% of the time it was just to make a friend or have somebody to talk to), nobody seems interested in talking to me past ""how's it going?"" and ""what's your name"".

I'm a pretty boring person, and pretty awkward as a result of anxieties I guess. A personal philosophy of nihilism/absurdism has really freed me from a lot of my small social anxieties, but it's opened the door to making me realize that none of this matters.

There is always a carrot on the end of the stick dangling right in front of me, but it will always be out of reach. For some reason, I always have hope. I think ""maybe if I go to the library today I'll run into a great future friend and we'll really kick it off"", or ""if I just put myself out there one more time it'll work and I'll find that special someone"". It's been over a year like I said, but I stupidly keep thinking I can do it and make just one true friend. Sometimes my phone will light up during the night, and I'll excitedly check it only to see it's just a battery reminder or news alert. I have not been texted or contacted by a single friend since the early stages of the pandemic. I keep thinking ""just a little further and it'll get better"" but it actually keeps getting worse.

My goal I set for myself was to graduate college without succumbing to these things. I figured it was a fair goal, and if life got too hard in early adulthood I'd just end things there. Now, I don't even think I can make it to my graduation. Loneliness, for me, is not a stinging in-your-face kind of pain. It is a constant never-ending anxiety that makes my chest physically hurt and makes me feel sick knowing so many awful things: I am at the most fit and free point in my life and I have nobody to do anything with no matter how hard I try. I will be alone and I hate being alone so much. Sorry for rambling, but I'm the least eloquent person ever and I don't really understand how I'm feeling well enough to explain it, but I figured most of you guys would get it. If you read all of this, congratulations you are the first human to listen to me since 2020. I'm at such a pathetic point in my life that I need to let out my anxieties to absolute strangers to feel that small sense of social belonging again. I hate myself and my life so fucking much.",2022-10-22 04:49:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/yaeepl/yalp_yet_another_lonely_post/,,0,2,"YALP, (Yet Another Lonely Post)"

Everyone has preferences. Everyone wants to be with someone that they find attractive and that finds them attractive. There are many people out there that choose their partners strictly based off of ‚Äúwill my friends think they are attractive‚Äù. I have been alone for all 34 years of my life and during that time I have observed many people and relationships. You are probably thinking ‚Äúwhy would I listen to someone who has never been in a relationship?‚Äù. Well,  maybe you shouldn‚Äôt but I do have a lot of experience being invisible. People say ‚Äúyou have to love yourself before other people will feel attracted to you‚Äù. In most cases that can be true because self confidence is an attractive trait. When you have been alone as long as I have, it‚Äôs almost impossible to have any self confidence whatsoever. Life is too short. People are greedy and selfish. I know nobody wants to lower their standards. I have very few standards. I have tried every dating app and website in existence. I never get any messages or reply‚Äôs from people that I message. I know if you are coming to r/lonely then you share the loneliness that I feel. It may be a different level of loneliness than mine but you came here for a reason. The only way I can stop my pain is by losing myself in video games or movies. Also by overwhelming myself at work. I purposely procrastinate getting tasks done just so that I have a different kind of stress. I buy things from the internet that I don‚Äôt need. I listen to music and cry. The days all blend together and everything seems grey. I still wake up every day because I have hope that one day I will find my soulmate and all the pain I‚Äôve lived with will be worth the wait. I will keep trying to enjoy the little things in life, like listening to the wind blow through the trees and watching the stars. Sometimes the best distraction is no distraction. I listen to music and meditate. I watch the clouds float by and just focus on my breathing. I focus on my chest rising and falling as I breathe. I cherish all the moments I have with family because I know they will not be there forever. I take it one day at a time. Please don‚Äôt give up. The wait will be worth it. You will find your soulmate. Just breathe.",2022-10-22 05:00:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1574041638,8,/r/lonely/comments/yaem0r/everyone_is_so_picky_and_judgmental/,,0,3,Everyone is so picky and judgmental.
4356,yaeubz,SpiteElectronic796,"I‚Äôve always felt lonely growing up. I felt disconnected to my family and classmates when i was younger. I never related to people and people never related to me. I was always able to make friends, but never keep them. They cycle out within 2 years max. Im 22F now and ive just accepted that people come and go in and out. I pretty much expect people to not be here for long. I don‚Äôt have a long time childhood friend, all my friendships now are superficial. Never been invited out/ to a party or even to someones house. No one i can really text when I‚Äôm down, no one who actually cares how I‚Äôm doing. There are times where i don‚Äôt speak to anyone, like right now. The loneliness feels so heavy on my body sometimes. I just feel so jealous when people post their friend groups online or when i see them at the mall laughing and having a good time. It makes so fucking sad. Every friend I‚Äôve ever made did me dirty and i always had to be the one to step away and remove myself from situations. For no reason too! I try to come up with reasons as to why, at one point i was straight up asking them and at another point i was blaming myself. A few times people have told me that my ex friends were talking bad about me too. They apparently would say im a show-off or im too busy or that i think I‚Äôm hot shit. But on the contrary, I believe none of those things about myself. I do try my best to be the best version of myself to people, and i really am a lover. But here i am, lonely as fuck on a Friday night. 
I have a boyfriend but hes not really great when it comes to me venting. He just tells me I‚Äôm fine, but I‚Äôm not fine. Its why I‚Äôm venting in the first place. He tells me i have plenty of friends but can‚Äôt even name one. I tell him that he wont understand because he has a lot of friends! He retaliates by saying he has none and thathe doesnt consider anyone a friend. But His ‚Äúfriends‚Äù call him often, vent to him, play video games with him.. i dont even recall the last time someone actually texted me first. And i know what youre thinking, ‚Äúwhy dont you text first?‚Äù .. i have been, for like 22 years. But at some point getting ignored gets tiresome. I wouldnt call myself ugly, in fact i do think im somewhat pretty, and i have a good personality. I have my own talents and skills, and some interests. Just no friends to share things with. 
My family and I recently moved to a bigger house and i wanted to turn the basement into a nice hangout place for when i do have friends and i did. It looks great. However, now i just sit there alone thinking about how much better it would be if i had a friend. It doesnt help that i moved 25 minutes further than my old house cause apparently its too long of a drive for anyone. 
Its just weird cause i always felt this lingering loneliness. Even when i did have a ‚Äúgroup of friends‚Äù , they weren‚Äôt really my friends. They were just a group of people that were friends with the one person i was trying to be friends with and forced me to tag along. At some point, every time i wanted to see my friend.. i had to see everyone else too and i just got buried away in the back. 
Anyways, i just wanted to vent a bit just so i don‚Äôt lose my mind. 
I just wish i had a friend who wants to see me, makes me happy birthday posts on Instagram, do stupid tiktoks together and just go on adventures. Alas, it is not my fate.

I‚Äôm a sophomore in college who struggled with being fat and bullied almost my whole life. Over the past year, I started on a good path to be healthy and hopefully happy. Flash forward to now I was 250 pounds and now I‚Äôm at 194 pounds. But I‚Äôm at an all time low mentally. 
1. I feel so alone. My grandfather recently passed and my dad doesn‚Äôt talk to me that much anymore. I only talk to my friends over Xbox and even then, I still feel so distant from them. I commute to college so the only temporary friends I have are the ones I meet in my classes. 
2. One thing I‚Äôve realized in my life is that I have never had a friend stick up for me. No one has ever had my back. When I‚Äôm in trouble they look the other way. The ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that do this are the only people I talk to right now and I‚Äôm afraid to stop talking to them because I fear I won‚Äôt make any new friends. 
3. This is a big one. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I feel that I will never find love. I‚Äôm not the best looking guy, so girls always turn the other way. It sucks because I always feel like I‚Äôm the problem. I have no social skills it seems because of my anxiety. I know this is a frequent thing on this subreddit but it‚Äôs a horrible thing to think about. I want to have a family someday but I fear it‚Äôs not going to happen because dating in 2022 is the worst. 
Mentally, I‚Äôm in a horrible spot. My self-esteem has somehow gotten worse, my stress from school is constantly growing, I have severe anxiety and the list goes on and on.

Just looking for a place to belong.

I've been stuck in a rut.  For most of my life.

The only place i've ever been accepted is with addicts and alchoholics.

Found out that people just wanted to hang out with me because I was the one who peddled the drug or bought the booze.

Long story short, ex additct, current alchoholic.  Married, father of 3, hating my life.  Not cause i'm married or a dad, just the person I married isn't the person I married.

Ex mechanical engineer, current IT field tech.

Only other place i belonged was FFXIV.  But got too busy to be able to be in my world there.

4366,yag4vb,VeterinarianNo4461,"I fit no where. I feel as if I can't be with people simply because I can never measure to their standards. Everything I have ever tried in life I normally suck at. I don't really have any natural talent, and I suck at talking to people. I try to cover it with comedy, because I solidly believe that if I can make the people  I hang out with laugh then there is an even exchange. I know deep down that this isn't true, it will never be perfect. I feel like I can't contribute to anything. My grades are trash, my social skills are trash, I am incredibly unathletic, I suck at playing any type of game. I feel useless in every setting I am in. Always, unendingly uncomfortable. Even in my own home, I feel like a disappointment. My parents do care for me, but I feel like I don't deserve it. I have done nothing to earn anyone's respect or reverence. I don't deserve to be cared for. I have tried looking for a relationship, but numerous attempts have taught me that I will probably never be able to find one. Maybe I am just not meant to have that either. I can't tell anymore. I don't want to be uncomfortable anymore. I am always ignored. I devote so much time to just masturbating. My rationale for that is that I am trying to find that release, that comfort of intimacy with another being. It might not make sense, but it makes me feel better than not having a reason at all. Even animals don't like me. Will I ever get out of this? I feel as if I am reaching for others, never being able to hold them, grab their hand, anything at all. I have been in a full on downhill ever since I moved schools back in middle school. Constantly ignored. Never taken seriously. Never finding my comfort. Never succeeding. Feels like everyday makes me bleed. My body feels like it can never wear clothes, always something is off. I am fat, ugly, plain useless. I don't want to be here anymore, but I will stay because of my parents. Hopefully it ends soon. A small part of me hopes things will get better, that no one will leave and that I will get that peace and comfort I have longed for. That is probably too optimistic, nothing more than a pipe dream of mine. God it hurts.

4367,yag915,Wise_Expression_3939,"I‚Äôm having so many complicated thoughts and feelings. I understand some of my deep rooted feelings regarding being unappreciated and worthless. From not living up to expectations and having  to let go of those expectations in order to still fail. Being expected to take on all duties of child raising and work full time and support the home. But never be appreciated for it. Staying up late to clean the house went unnoticed as you were never there to see the work that went into everything. Never having a day off. Or if allowed to have time to myself it is met with expectations later, you know, since you were doing me a favor.  My feelings of worthlessness grew and grew, while I lost aspects of myself because of keeping it all together. I wanted to be taken care of not be the caretaker. I never expected anything grand but even one ask was too much. I let go of my hopes, dreams to allow you to go after yours even with that led to betrayal. Which left me feeling empty and more worthless since you never saw how hard I worked to keep all the balls in the air. Learning to understand how I feel and to communicate that is starting to heal me from all the pain you caused me. But I also still want to be loved, appreciated and worthy of someone‚Äôs time. It will never be yours, you wasted my time and I regret trying to hold it together for so long.

She's smart, funny, supportive, sometimes friendly,

Good news is I won't have to live with her, like ever.

Now the cons

She intentionally goes out of her way to say really bad and irritating shit, really hurtful shit to my mother, and I just don't understand, like.. what are you getting out of making people's lives a living hell? I mean I know the answer I just don't like it, at all.

The good news is I don't have to deal with her but I don't like talking to her anymore. I've tried, so many fucking times, and my end goal really is to cut her out of my fuckin life because I can't take it anymore. My mother can take it, but look, I can't.. I've even threatened to move out of my own house because of the shit that she says. Her moving out was one of the biggest reliefs, like ever.

I get it, siblings are competition, but like, I don't remember anything I did to her, and if I did something, I'm sorry, I wish she could understand. I'm going to make it clear that I'm not going to deal with her after I get a career going, like, she'll be lucky if I talk to her annually. I'm sick of hearing how well she's doing, the colleges she's in

It's like with my ex, I did a hard block on her, literally went into my phone and blocked her number from calling or texting me but that's what you get for what you did to me.

And I'm not that ""life is hard on me so I'm hard on others"" but I have truly given her chances and, one day life is going to kick the everliving shit out of her, so hard that it changes her to become more of a patient person because that's what the real world does to you, it makes you understand that if you continue this behavior, no one will like you, you're gonna die alone, and that's the end of the road for you.

I don't believe in this bullshit that people say ""if I stop getting a level of respect I'll stop treating you like an adult"" - this is bullshit and will always be bullshit, downvote my post, couldn't care less.

We‚Äôd stay up texting late at night and we would walk to the library together and get subway sandwiches on the way.

For me it takes a while to figure out who the other person is. I mean sure, yeah, I get a bit of an idea but maybe that's because I'm not so quick to toss things out.

I'm aware that I might not be appealing to chat with at the moment because I'm currently grieving my cat who was my last living friend... She was and is my best friend.

I wasn't expecting any of this to happen.

I plan on getting therapist though and sooner rather than later because I've known the decline in my mental health.

4399,yal2kj,KINGIN4K,"So, Ive posted here many times already. I always complain on how i try and how it never works. I always visit those subreddits that are meant to find friends, but people almost ever show up and when someone contacts me, we stop talking in just few days. Doesnt last even a full week. I always complain about others, and always say i see what im doing wrong and whats wrong with me. But i never actualy fully show it, I never truly say and realize that Im the real problem... Im M17, and Im the biggest, lonliest, most rude and egoistic loser u can find on this planet Earth. Ive had few friends before highschool that tried to avoid me bc i was so damn annoying. Now i have no real friends and only have 5 ppl i know that i sometimes talk to before class. When i dont, i sit alone in a park and play games on my phone. Ive had many friends online and were in few groups and i just ruined it all. Now every day i try to find new people like i always did, ill find some and again, we wont talk in few days. I never manage to spark the convo, im super boring and have no good sense of humor. My ego is bigger than my own hause i live in and i treat everyone like shit. Plus ive been called dick many times and seems like im always rude to everyone. And when i try to be nice, does not work and ppl then leave not bc im rude but bc im boring. Ive had someone online who i was good with that i met on a minecraft server. Gonna spare u the boring details but bc of my dumb stupid ass we now have a smol relationship... I know these never work. Had 5 before and all ended and i was sad but i could not help it. And they say how they care and all, but ive noticed we talk less and less... I noticed things going down like they usualy do... I noticed they are hanging out with others more than with me and that they enjoy being with other more. I admit im jelaus... I know its wrong but i again cant help it. And i can do nothing about it. Ill be sad if i leave them be, but i also cant confront them about it so much bc ill just annoy them... I always do. I annoy everyone. I do that so much that i litelarly have no ppl who are willing to sometimes talk and hang out bc of my crappy personality and how boring it is with me, and i feel so lonely. I cry at night knowing im usseles and just bother people around me! I cant accept someone elses opinion and always think im right! I think everyone else around me is stupid! My humor is based on nazi and racism stuff. I hate people, and there are so many bad things about me i cant even mention them all in here. I would need to write a book about me. But even with all these things i just want some friends, but when i get the chance i ruin everything. Im ruining my own life. I live in my own world and Im afraid to go out of it. I have awful thoughts with nobody to vent and share these thoughts with. Its all bc of me. Not others, me. I do see why nobody even wants to be near me. Why would u be with someone so bad when u can be with somebody else who makes u happy and enjoy life. I have nothing to offer but the bad things i said in this smol text... Im lost in life. Compleatly isolated. With no good future ahead of me. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks if u read all this crap. Sorry for bsd english and spelling, just dont really care anymore... Dont have the will... Plus im typing all this on a phone with smol keyboard...",2022-10-22 11:16:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600517558,2,/r/lonely/comments/yal2kj/giving_up_on_everything_dont_see_a_point_anymore/,,0,0,Giving up on everything.

4400,yal9cu,_humanERROR_,"I've learned the hard way that people don't want long-term friends anymore.

I know that statistically friends form based on the frequency of people meeting each other (think hobby groups, volunteering and work). And when someone stops frequenting the space in which they formed a friendship, that friendship usually dissolves. I've learned that most of the time people are situational friends. Rarely do people actually have friendships which go beyond environment and lifestyle.

I debate between calling my connections 'acquaintances' or 'friends'. Because what is a true friend if they never want to meet up outside the gym where you first met and spend all your time together?

I'm lonely. I want a meaningful connection. I want the best friendship/intimacy that I had with a person from highschool where our relationship dissolved 4 years after finishing high school. But as I said this kind of closeness nowadays is only reserved for intimate partners.

So for me it makes sense as a strategy to try hard at finding a proper partner. No vagueness or euphamisms. I'm not looking for a 'hook up' or 'some fun' or some 'meaningful connection'. I want an intimate partner period. I want an intimate partner with the full expectations and responsibilities exchanged between us of intimate partnership.

What do you think of my point of view?",2022-10-22 11:26:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582180122,1,/r/lonely/comments/yal9cu/should_i_invest_most_of_my_time_and_energy_into/,,0,3,Should I invest most of my time and energy into finding a partner instead of 'meaningful connections'?
4401,yalifo,JudgementalJester,"Recently, I've come to a few painful realizations after a few traumatic events. Been depressed for a while, but I have to pick myself Here are a few things I've come to understand. 

1. You have no control over what people and you can't make them do anything. 

2. No one is above betraying you. It doesn't matter how long you've known each other. 

3. There is beauty and peace in solitude. I know it's difficult, but you're all you have. 

4. People love for selfish reasons. Just because a girl likes you doesn't mean she cares about you. 

5. You can make your life better. Although it's a slow process it's worth it. 

6. You should expect anyone to help you in times of need. You don't owe anyone anything and vice versa, even if you helped them in the past.

Sure, all relationships are transactional in nature, but that doesn't necessarily mean emotions are just chemical reactions of the brain and body.

Otherwise some people wouldn't spend their whole lives together, truly devoted to each other. 

Sure, love is not at all what fantasy and fiction depict, but strangely some relationships do come close. 

Unfortunately it is difficult for someone like me to find a proper partner who could actually understand and care for me.

Genuinely good partners are few and far between, especially when the price of admission into the relationship is as simple as mutual exclusivity.",2022-10-22 12:13:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628012259,6,/r/lonely/comments/yam6o3/good_partners_few_and_far_between/,,0,7,Good Partners Few And Far Between

4416,yaq8qc,the-hound-abides,"For context: we had to move more than 1000 miles from anyone we know for my husband‚Äôs job 4 years ago. I grew up in a small town surrounded by family and childhood friends. The really good kind that you can ask to go to run really awful errands with and they‚Äôd do it just to keep you company. I moved about an hour away to the next largest town for college and work, but never more than an hour away from everyone. I always had a really big support system, and I never had any intention of leaving the area ever. Well after my husband got laid off, we had to choose between being bankrupt and losing everything or moving. We have 2 kids, so it wasn‚Äôt just us that would suffer if we lost our house or whatever. Being an adult, it‚Äôs really hard to develop those types of bonds with strangers. I have 2 really amazing neighbors who I am very grateful for, but it‚Äôs not the same. They are great, and I‚Äôd really be drowning without them but I‚Äôm still not at that sort of level with them. They also grew up in this area, so they‚Äôve got a lot of family and such around so they don‚Äôt really need us like we need someone here. I don‚Äôt want to feel like we are always asking them for help, but not returning the favor. I get it, though. I don‚Äôt even have a secondary emergency pick up person on my kid‚Äôs school contact list after my husband and I. My neighbor‚Äôs mom‚Äôs live in town. Why would they ask a neighbor to pick up their sick kid, if grandma lives closer to the school and doesn‚Äôt work anyway? My husband‚Äôs not the sort to make friends easily, so he hasn‚Äôt really made any here. I work remotely, so I have made a lot of really good friends but none of them are actually located here. 


My grandfather died yesterday. He was 91 and it was expected, as he‚Äôd been unwell for some time. My husband is out of town on business, but won‚Äôt return until tomorrow. Coming home early wasn‚Äôt really an option. My kids are not really sad about it, which is fair. I remember back when my great grandparents died, and it didn‚Äôt really hurt that much because I was younger and I didn‚Äôt get to know them as well. My biggest struggle right now is that I still have to do all of the day to day tasks right now as if nothing happened. The kids still need to eat. The towels still need to get washed before they get mildewed. The dog has to be fed and let out. I just want to crawl back into bed for one day and grieve but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs things like this that make me hate living up here even more than I already do. I don‚Äôt want to tell my husband how I feel, because he already feels guilty enough about us needing to move. I just want a hug and someone to come take the trash out for me so I don‚Äôt have to go outside. I‚Äôm really struggling, and I hate that I‚Äôm doing it alone.

I distracted myself by trying to be helpful and positive on subs like this. I tried to reach out to so many people. Ignored and ghosted. Some reached out to me. Even said a few sentences. Again, ignored and ghosted. 

I understand this is the internet, and we aren't entitled, and blah blah blah. It's horrible that even self proclaimed lonely people are too good to be considerate, courteous, and decent.

I just spent two years caring for my dad as an unpaid home health aide. He died this week. My whole world is upside down. The whole time, the month he was hospitalized and recovering. He was showing progress. Getting better. A day from finding a rehabilitation center for him, they say he has covid. A day later, he's gone. I didn't even get to the hospital in time. He's never coming home again. 

In all that time worrying about him, I was also worried about you. Reading your stories. Offering friendship. Giving advice. Out of almost 20 ppl, 20 ppl I've messaged, two still reply. 15 of them never replied at all. Now I understand why people are paranoid in these subs. What's the point of reaching out? Point of exposing yourself? What are you getting in return? Rejected without prejudice by people who you thought empathized with your situation, your struggle.

I enter and say good morning. *Nobody responds.* Someone else enters. Everyone wishes the person a good morning or asks they how they are doing.

There are 16-year-olds talking about their exes and their sexual exploits. There are girls comparing the number of guys that have flirted with them that week. Girls take turns sitting on the laps of the attractive guys.

They show each other photos of their SOs. Two girls laugh at literally every single word a hot guy utters and 'accidentally' touch him as much as possible. *They don't react to anything I say.*

They compare each others' progress on online dating apps and text each others' dozens of matches.

They repeatedly ask each other what their names are, but never from me. *Nobody knows my name.* Not a *single bloody person* asks me what my name is, even after I go around the room asking them for theirs.

I just keep my mouth shut and only join in the conversation during other topics to the best of my ability. This is when I am actually treated as an actual human being (only by the guys even at this stage, who actually even find humour in some of my remarks). I become invisible during conversations about anything related to love or sex; I guess its obvious from looking at my face, and they don't want to hurt me.

People discuss plans and invite each other to places. *I am ignored.*

A person leaves and says bye. Everyone surrounds them, reply in kind, and ask them for their social media.

I say bye and leave. *Nobody responds.*

4455,yavcao,topbomlover1,"i‚Äôve spent all of my saturday laying on my bed. i really should start doing my uni homework but feeling kinda lethargic. and also overthinking about my life.

i need to start applying for jobs as it‚Äôs my final year of uni. and also go to the gym where i already bought a membership for but haven‚Äôt been. tho it is kinda tricky as i want to go at night when no one is there but also it‚Äôs a 30min walk and half of it is through a footpath in the woods. don‚Äôt wanna become a missing person just yet lol. but going during the day is so full and i end up getting overwhelmed at the free weights section and just run for an hour which i hate. i wanna get gains not cut.

also been thinking of my friendships and love life. right now i have one close friend but she lives back in the city i grew up in. as we are becoming older now we have more responsibilities. we still text a few times a day and call sometimes but other than her i have no contact with anyone. i‚Äôve tried joining societies this autumn but i‚Äôve had no luck in building friendships. there was one society i was going to frequently but overall i felt like the people there were very unwelcoming and mean spirited therefore i decided to leave. it was a shame as i liked what the society was about. there‚Äôs another one i liked the sound of but it costs around ¬£90 just to join so i haven‚Äôt decided if i will yet.

the people in my classes are kind but we just don‚Äôt have enough in common to hang out after class. i invited some for a night out but there were so many moments of awkward silence because the conversation would end. i still enjoy talking to them during class but idk. i‚Äôve suggested a study group once a week and maybe we will get closer but who knows.

i really feel very empty, i‚Äôm missing some real connections. i want to make close friends who hang out often, maybe have an active group chat or do discord calls, go out together, etc. people who like you for who you are and you don‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone different, which is what i do with strangers so they enjoy my company. i don‚Äôt always want to be the happy go lucky, bubbly girl, i want to be able to be vulnerable to those i‚Äôm close with.

and omg i want a boyfriend lol. i‚Äôm 22 and i‚Äôve only ever had situationships. which i guess is normal, esp on reddit. but irl everyone i know has a boyfriend/girlfriend or had one. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm super ugly although i definitely don‚Äôt conform to the british beauty standards but i am not british.

i also think i try to hard and scare guys off. i‚Äôm always the one to suggest hanging out or who makes the first move, although i wish one day i wont be. sometimes i get rejected and other times it kinda works but they get to know me and that i‚Äôm awkward af and they lose interest. i tend to ramble a lot when i‚Äôm nervous and also i had a really bad experience with sex before so it takes me awhile to get comfortable to have sex with a guy and no many (non religious) people are really willing to wait in my experience. they usually expect on the third date. it‚Äôs their preference and i‚Äôm okay with it but it really makes me feel discouraged to put myself out there.

i used dating apps and went on two dates (one on tinder when i was very inexperienced and didn‚Äôt know it was more for sex and one on bumble but had the same experience) before deciding to never use one again lol. very bad experiences. 

then once i decided fuck it. i‚Äôll get dressed sexy, go out, get drunk and try to get over my fear of sex. unsurprisingly it didn‚Äôt go over very well, i invited the guy over and then stalled for so long and showed him my anime merchandise collection (what the hell was i thinking) before he decided to leave lol . whenever i think of that night i want to crawl into a hole and just hibernate there for eternity.

i would never admit this to anybody but i just want someone i can unconditionally love and care for and who will also do the same to me. if i had a boyfriend i‚Äôd want to hug him all day, make him food or cutely decorated cookies/chocolates and go on cute dates with. 

i don‚Äôt know how some girls get guys so easily, it‚Äôs so hard for me. my friend told me to stop being the one to make the first move and wait for a guy to like me enough that he is the one suggesting a date. but that has never happened to me and i‚Äôm scared it never will. 

anyway this is just a rant. i‚Äôm not really trying to invite reddit strangers to talk to me as i‚Äôm more of a real life connection type of person, i‚Äôm not really good with maintaining online friends. plus my best friend is already long distance and it‚Äôs not helping my loneliness. i would just like to hear if other people relate to me, especially girls. or if anyone has any advice on making friends.",2022-10-22 18:44:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1425763730,4,/r/lonely/comments/yavcao/i_have_been_overthinking_lately_any_advice_on/,,0,1,"i have been overthinking lately, any advice on making real connections?"

I was raised in a very sheltered religion that in a way caused both religious and sexual trauma for me. A little over a year ago, I got sick with an undiagnosable illness. Leaving for university was great because it got me away from my family, my religion, and an overall shitty situation at home. But now at university, i dont know how to talk to people so im alone.

I used to have people i could turn to. But i havent been able to go to any of them for help recently. My main friend i would always go to is in a shitty situation themselves, so i refrain from mentioning anything pertaining to me struggling. My other friends i could rely on, they say i can talk to them whenever, but when i bring up my problems they give me one word responses and leave it at that.

Ill admit, my suicidal urges have gone down pretty drastically since coming to university. There have been a few times theyve come, but usually a session at the gym is enough to help me avoid resorting to self harm. 

I wish it was easier to approach cute girls too haha. I know this feels like pretty disconnected from everything ive been saying so far, but hey im venting. Whenever i see a cute girl around campus i wanna talk to em, make friends, maybe see how it goes. Yes i do want to get into a relationship, but i want to make friends before anything else.

4520,yb2sm6,Drrreamy,"I know I'm lucky cause I have friends and family, they're truly great and supportive, but it's still not enough for me. I know that I'm loved hypothetically, but it feels like I'm not loved right now. Every present moment I spend alone despite me hanging out with somebody/being surrounded by people. 

Whenever I express my true emotions, everyone (in my close relationships) is like why are you doing this, stop acting like a child, figure it out etc. Sadness is okay since it only harms myself, but any type of anger or discontent is not. I probably did this to myself, because I avoid conflict, so people think I'm actually chill with whatever they want to do. But I'm not, I'm just terrified they'll stop liking me.

I've had some instances with expressing both love/anger where I was judged for the way I did it. But I was just being genuine, it was so difficult to get the courage to do it and I still failed. Now I can't be open even with the people closest to me. I just can't afford to go through this again.

I needed to get this out, to get myself out of my system. At the end of the day, I don't feel like I can trust anybody to share this except for random people online.

I'm like at least a 7/10 looks wise which isn't bad, have a masters degree, used to do stand up before life got in the way so I'm great at making people laugh. I'm a huge extrovert, go out and meet new people all the time. I have an adorable dog who is my best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

None of it fills the void. (The dog helps but still). All of it feels hollow cause each night I go back to my studio apartment  without anyone. And I really, really, really don't wanna be that person that needs a relationship to feel whole. I actively argue against it to people. To not settle. To feel complete on your own instead of needing to be fixed by someone. I think the idea of finding your other half is bullshit cause life is full enough on it's own.

&amp;#x200B;

But deep down I am a hypocrite. I really want to be dating someone. When your young dating prospects are abound. Through my early 20's I always had someone. Not cause of co-dependency, just every time I had a break up I would toss a stone and meet someone new that I'd hit it off with. But now I'm 30, and the amount of prospects are fewer and farther between. I hate to use a clich√© but it feels like all the good ones are taken. So many people are so scared of being alone they stuck to whoever they were dating at 20 instead of exploring. So I regularly run into girls who are my type, that I vibe with well, but they're always taken, and often by a boyfriend that people wonder what they see in the guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last time I was in love was 2018. And it's been a long 4 years, with honestly no end in sight. I know romantic love shouldn't be a goal to be achieved and life can be lived many ways, but it's really hard not to get jealous of happy couples sometimes.",2022-10-23 01:38:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645803171,2,/r/lonely/comments/yb4n7t/i_have_and_do_many_of_the_things_all_the_life/,,0,0,I have and do many of the things all the life advice says makes you feel less alone.

The emotional struggle and boredom is very difficult to deal with. My mind is so clouded with negativity that dealing with this feels like untangling barbed wires. The only joy I am feeling now is hollow joy, the one without any real reason, which Is always followed by a pathetic low. 

I'm just really embarrassed about this and pretty much dislike every single thing about myself. I feel so suffocated and in so much pain, which makes me consider things that make me even more embarrassed later. Life feels pointless, boring, and I feel so unwanted and worthless. It's so humiliating to actively make efforts and meet other students, just to be ghosted constantly and never see them again. It makes me want to give up and fucks my confidence. It hurts more that I don't blame them, I wouldn't want to be friends with me either.

Music and drowsy meds are the only thing keeping me happy anymore and somewhat connected. I don't know what to do, I'm a young male in my teens (&lt;18) and I don't want to lose life this quickly and pathetically, but I simply can't find a connection to keep me happy right now. I've tried everything - it makes me panic to feel numbness to nature, my future goals and anything that distracted me from my loneliness.

I spent my last birthday ( a few months ago) alone eating a piece of cake I got myself from a nearby store. I told myself it would be the lowest point in my life and promised myself to pick myself up. I've ended up a weak failure and I'm embarrassed of myself. Given everything on a silver plate but still a loser.

I'm not attractive, interesting, remarkable or anything either. A below average human existing for no real reason. The world could do with less of me and that makes me hate myself so much. Any advice or anything is appreciated.
I plan to start meditating and hitting the gym but it all feels so pointless and I'm losing hope and the little bit of energy I have left.",2022-10-23 02:47:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/yb612t/losing_ability_to_feel_happiness/,,0,8,Losing ability to feel happiness

As soon as the sun rises I know it will be the same day as always, waking up just to know I won‚Äôt be doing anything at all, no friends to talk to, no one to hang out with, just myself. 
I don‚Äôt really have a problem spending time by my own but as days go by, it starts to feel heavy, specially by the fact that I‚Äôm a young man who‚Äôs supposed to be enjoying my youth. 
Whenever you find me on the streets, you‚Äôll always sight me alone or accompanied by my best friend, my loyal dog. She‚Äôs the whole company I‚Äôve got and I feel graceful for having her in my life.
As all of us I‚Äôve got my group of friends but our friendship within time has become meaningless, just holding on it because of how long we all have been friends. We just hang out to party and smoke some weed but I‚Äôm not feeling quite comfortable with it anymore. 
I truly don‚Äôt know what has happened to me. I used to have some success with girls back then but now no one seems to notice me. No texts, no phone calls. I just literally use my phone to scroll through Instagram and watch some YT videos, that‚Äôs all.
I‚Äôm kind nerdy and read lot of things and a film buff as well and I barely meet people with whom I could share my interests. It‚Äôs so damn hard, so damn hard. 
And If you think about it, confidence has any importance at all but how the people perceive you. If you are confident talking or expressing something you like and they‚Äôll react with zero interest it has nothing to do with how much confident you are. It fucking sucks. Like it fucking sucks that nowadays you can‚Äôt be yourself and the only way to have some ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù meeting people you have to play a fake persona.

I'm not fat but I don't look skinny either. My cheeks have always been big and I've always had a belly pouch. My eyebrows are sparse. My nose is large and has a little hump in it. My eyes are asymmetrical/uneven and with one droopy thick eyelid. I have some acne scars and maybe some active acne. My teeth are not all crooked but are not straight either or whiteish.  My mouth is small. One side of my lip goes lower than the other. I wear glasses. Overall, my face does not look pretty. It's like the configuration of my anatomy was not it. Since I can remember, every year in my birthday I wish for the same thing. To be better looking. Every New Year's I have the same resolutions. To try harder this year. And this year I really did. But even when I lost weight it wasn't enough. I gained it back up though. I started treating my acne and still my face looks like a textured mess. I started wearing makeup. I started doing my nails. Christmas is coming up and seeing my family gives me such anxiety. I want to be better for them. So they won't be as embarrassed as I am about myself. I just want to be better so I can enjoy life and not be embarrassed. So I can like a picture of me and my friends. So I feel my face isn't disgusting. But even then I feel like if I work really hard these two months it won't be enough. And my cousin who I love more than life is coming to town but she is too darn beautiful. Everything about her is so cool. And she is two years younger tan me. I feel embarrassed. It's like I self-sabotage. I want to go out but feel too disgusting. I want to party but I'm not there yet physically. I want nice things but won't buy them until I'm pretty so it doesn't look weird. I truly feel like I can't be happy because everyone is watching me. If I were to show you a picture you would probably say I'm not ugly at all but you wouldn't say I'm pretty either. I'm just weird. And I don't want to be weird. I just want to be pretty.

Recently my Best Friend passed away at 26 years old. He happened to be my only friend as well. We grew up together and did so many stupid things, somehow surviving it all, we just grew closer. He was the God-Father to my son. His family even gave me some of his ashes. On top of all this, a few months before, I got out of a 4 year abusive relationship and my dog died. This was my boy idc what anyone says. He was family. I got him right after I lost my first son. Shit has been rough for a while I won't lie. 

I've never been one to have too many friends. I've just always preferred having 2 or 3 close friends. Aside from my back issues, I'm just a reserved person in general. I'm not going to bars or anything like that and people I thought were friends have either stolen from me, were lost to drugs, or hurt me in some way. Which leaves me pretty damn lonely.

I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get out of posting this. I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest, in the hopes that there's someone out there who can empathize with me. I get a lot of ""mhmm""s and ""yeah""s when I tell my family. No eye contact, distracted by anything that isn't me trying to open up about being lonely. They can't do anything anyway I realize this. It would just be nice to feel like I'm heard.

Everyone has been preaching on practicing self-love before seeking for it somewhere else. It's true. I agree. Yourself, then everyone else.

Everyone talks about loving yourself first, appreciating your worth and giving yourself the care and affection you deserve.

But nobody talks about how heartbreaking and awful it feels when you did love yourself wholeheartedly, poured so much into yourself and found home within your own soul, but losing everything when you let someone in and the person broke you.

You loved yourself. You truly did. And with that state of being in love yourself, so content and enough on your own, came another person - someone you were not looking for but welcomed with a heart full of love to give. Because you genuinely love yourself and you felt enough.

And you let this person in into every inch of your being, and their adorations and beautiful words seem to enhance the love you had for yourself. It grew. It blossomed. It ignited a light in you.  the love you had for yourself became even more wonderful when shared.

Then when the person broke you. Everything  became dark. Everything is destroyed. All lights became distant and all you feel is pure terror and emptiness.

Nobody talks about how to live again when you did love yourself first before loving someone else but everything ended up in a traumatic tragedy.

No poets ever talked about how it feels to lose the love you had for yourself and was gladly shared with another person but then out of sheer trust and vulnerability, the love was put in someone else's hands. Trusting them to take care of it.

They all talked how you'd find love once you genuinely love yourself. Not this.

Nobody talks about how to heal after losing the love you had for yourself - the one everyone has been telling you to do and you did. You loved yourself. You built yourself to be confident and courageous, cautious and protective of your heart and only letting good things in. You did everything and became the person you are proud. You let someone in, you felt genuinely happier only to have your heart destroyed and wounded. All is lost.

Nobody talks about this one. I read poems and they talked about loving yourself first before loving someone else. I did. I felt enough. But everything ended up in a tragedy. Now I am empty. 

I read poems and essays about self love but found nothing that can truly portrays what I went through. 

Love yourself first. I did.

But why loving myself first led me here - in therapy, traumatized and feeling so empty and hopeless.",2022-10-23 07:07:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662267305,8,/r/lonely/comments/ybav0s/nobody_really_talks_about_this_side_of_selflove/,,0,0,Nobody really talks about this side of self-love

When we ask for a guide at our lowest.

Where the here and the now cannot tell me to run
It would lift such a burden to know this


Where is the what which we ought to pursue
Which is often assumed to be clear
But clarity often is not ours to choose
Such vacuums are filled up with fear

And those whom we know say ‚Äújust go with the flow‚Äù
Yet life as it is won‚Äôt deliver it so

I've gotten several amazing friends who really make me happy and they're wonderful company, but I just have this.... ""Void"" inside my chest. Like a poor soul missing its half. I don't get it, my friends say I'm handsome and genuinely good looking, apparently I'm cute for my Golden Retriever energy and have been told I'm deserving of so much greatness and that I come in clutch due to me being able to provide for the people around me, also heard that I'm husband material and I'd be a good daddy, but yeah, apparently I'm perfect, but it doesn't feel like it.... 19 years old now, I know I'm young, but still, I want one special girl around my age to experience my journey with me, and I'd experience being in her journey. I don't expect anyone to reply, comment or DM me, but it would make my day. I just want one girl to call ""Mine"" to call her my home, to be there even in the bad times because I know for certain I'll bring good times for us and I'm sure she would too. Future husband here, still on the search for my soulmate. Let me know if you find her. Thanks, Redditors. I appreciate you for reading so far and I wish you an easier time with this love stuff and I hope you'll have a great day, but yeah, let me know when you find her for me.

I was out partying Saturday and I had been drinking from 11AM to 4AM Sunday. Throughout the day I was sobering up and then this girl dm‚Äôed me on tinder. We chatted a little and she told me at midnight that me and my friends could just show up to her bar (she is a bartender) and end the night there. We ended up going somewhere else, but come 4AM she dm‚Äôed me asking if we should sleep together and I obliged. Mind you, I had never met this woman before but I just thought to myself ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. 

She sends me the address to the bar and I am there quarter past 5AM while she is closing it down. We go home to her and do the deed. 

After we were done I was having an internal crisis thinking ‚Äúwtf have I just done‚Äù. I felt utterly soulless, empty and disgusted with myself. We were flirting on the way home but we had in no way build any emotional connection and it all hit me when I was done. I was repulsed and then suddenly it hit me how lonely I felt.

I've been trying to make friends for years. I've always been the one who approaches first. The one who asks and cares about the other but NOTHING literally nothing comes out of it. People simply never care or show the slightest bit of interest in me and just talk to me when they need something.

This has been going through middle and high school and now in college as well even though I tried meeting so many people and I pushed myself to be as social as I can but everything is still the same.

Before you tell me that I need to WAIT or CHANGE myself I will tell you that I had enough negative thoughts in my head about these two things so I don't care anymore.

I just don't understand. I help people, I'm nice and caring and I receive compliments from everyone but when it comes to anything concerning friendship it never happens and even that introverted guy in my classroom got friends without doing even half of what I'm doing.

This is it. It's over. I'm not putting myself in this pain anymore. I'm ending my search for friendship and I will accept being alone instead of ruining my dignity with giving attention to people who won't give it back. Even if someone approaches me after this decision I'm rejecting them. I'm not fate's toy where it gives me what I want after all the pain I felt.

I wanted friendship because I thought it would make me happy but I was very wrong. This made me more miserable than being alone and I finally feel comfortable with my decision.",2022-10-23 14:46:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,,23,/r/lonely/comments/ybjk4c/im_done_ruining_my_dignity_by_trying_to_make/,,0,3,I'm done ruining my dignity by trying to make friends

I do text them but I feel if I do, I‚Äôm annoying and disturbing them. Now my life is sleep and go to my 9-5 job. I don‚Äôt hate my job and don‚Äôt particularly love it, it‚Äôs just ok.

I just had a birthday and I was really hoping that they might reach out since they were my only friend or ex friend ig, I tried reaching out a few times in the summer but I didn‚Äôt get any response. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs really hard for me to make friends since I‚Äôm really introverted and I hate texting people cuz it always feels like I just bother people or I‚Äôm inconveniencing them but with sam it always seemed like I was never a bother and I also have social anxiety which always freaks me out when it comes to talking with people especially strangers even if I just have to talk to a cashier or something at stores. I had a few friends In high school I was especially close with and we would hang out as a group at each others houses and stuff but the rest always made me feel like I was a bother or just taking up space maybe it was just me though cuz sometimes I would bring it up and they‚Äôd always say I wasn‚Äôt but I could never quite shake the feeling and I slowly fell out of touch with the rest of the group, but I always had a special bond it seemed like with Sam. We would sometimes just hang out as just the two of us instead of with the rest of the group and would go out and get dinner or catch a movie. I don‚Äôt get out much anymore if I‚Äôm being honest there‚Äôs no point tbh I live in the country where the closest mall/theatre or any place that has anything remotely populated is about 45 mins away and I also have a fear of driving on top of everything but whenever I‚Äôd go places with Sam they always made the drive seem worth it but they‚Äôd always end up driving most of the time which I always greatly appreciated. I think about sometimes reaching out to my other old friends from high school but it‚Äôs been over 2 years since I‚Äôve talked to any of them and somehow I doubt that they might wanna reconnect with me too. I‚Äôm not here to make new friends please don‚Äôt take me not responding to your DMs or comments as me being rude I‚Äôm sure your all very lovely people but it just takes a lot out of me to communicate with people weather it‚Äôs face to face or just text I just wanted to vent and put this out there and just get a little bit of this weight off my chest.",2022-10-23 17:23:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/ybngt0/lost_my_last_friend/,,0,0,Lost my last friend
4691,ybnh6l,zarchar738,"Tw: mentions of pocd, ocd, and self-harm.

I'm better than I was Friday but life is still the same. My anxiety from my intrusive thoughts have gone down. Pocd and ocd is such a nightmare a lot of the time but I do have these periods of cooling down and understanding how to act.

I hate that I have to lie to my friends at home about whether I have friends in college. I'm alone basically 24/7 (in terms of in person contact) and i dont talk to anyone in person on campus or go to class. It sucks but I'm gonna drop out.

Had some urges to self-harm last night. I didnt even realize until 2 am that i did have some razors in my backpack so I could have, but didn't.

4714,ybq2j9,[deleted],"Last night, I went to this big event hosted by this club that I'm apart of. That's what people always tell you to do when you're lonely, right? Just go out and hang around people and get that social interaction in! It's so much better than just sitting around in your room, right? Wrong.

See, the problem is, people love to give you this advice, never once acknowledging just how disheartening it really is, especially for someone who already feels isolated. Because here's the thing, nine times out of ten, people already have their groups. They have friends that they talk to, and you *don't*, so everyone else groups together, and you're just there. Stuck, with no way to inject yourself into their well established comradery without interrupting their night and feeling self-conscious.

And it *sucks.* Words can not describe how it feels to be that odd man out, watching people flaunt the friendship that you desperately crave right in front of your face when you have no way to reach out and grab it. 

When I'm by myself in my room, my chest aches, and all I want is to talk to a person that will never be there, and I won't deny that it is a horrible feeling. However, that loneliness is so much worse when I do try, when I do put myself out there just to get shot down, again and again because I realize that I am simply not enough.

4744,ybt574,Beyond_Creativity,"Hi everyone,

I saw a video which referenced the many people in modern society who are lonely, and it has been causing me to think about my own situation. More often than not, I've come to the conclusion that I will be alone. And it is that thought that causes me to think: ""Man, there are so many people on this world, yet so many of us feel isolated and alone...""

And it sucks! For so many people. 

Because of my own immaturity I've caused plenty of relationships to collapse, but that hasn't stopped me from wanting to better myself. However, there are plenty of moments where I see my loneliness as inevitable and that it would be better off to be alone, and that thought feels so...sad. 

Without many friends to turn to, I spend most of my days going to work then coming back home. Focusing on things which help get me out of my own head...The people I interact with are either embroiled within their own drama, jaded about life, or too busy. I don't blame them. Not really my place...

To all you lonely people, if you stopped and read through this rant of mine, well, I hope you have a wonderful day.",2022-10-23 21:13:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1559007641,8,/r/lonely/comments/ybt574/confronting_my_loneliness/,,0,2,Confronting my loneliness

4749,ybtikh,LaikaChan8,"So about 10 months ago i made a post on here saying i was concerned for my future and that i didn't want to stay like i was for much longer. After all that time i still haven't made much progress in regards to getting a job, having a social life or pursuing any of my creative ambitions. Last month i finally came off my sertraline tablets that i had been on since 2018 (i think), and the differences to my overall mood and outlook have been quite drastic. I've been feeling a lot of anxiety about my situation and the fact that i've made claims in the past that i want to change myself but have never actually gone through with it, leading to the horrifying thought that i could just stay like i am forever (i.e. socially anxious, no job, very few friends and not fufilling anything i actually want to do).

So yeah i'm not really sure what else i want to say other than i hope i can actually start changing for the better from now on and i don't end up ignoring or supressing these feelings like i've done so many times in the past.

But today I had an epiphany that came as a result of growing discomfort and guilt. The guilt that I'm being talked to like an equal human and treated like what I say matters. And the guilt that it's all a lie. The knowledge that if any of these people actually met me, they'd turn their noses up at me just like everyone else always has. 

And that hurts. That hurts so much that I can't bear the pain anymore. I'm just going to disappear on all of them. The pain of false kindness that I don't deserve and certainly wouldn't get if I wasn't abusing a social media platform has brought me more pain than I could ever imagine. It was a social experiment, and one that has come back to hurt me so terribly. Now I know that I can't interact with others in real life, but interacting with them virtually can cause a very different, even worse pain.",2022-10-23 23:47:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655644628,5,/r/lonely/comments/ybwjma/today_i_discovered_how_much_it_actually_hurts/,,0,1,Today I discovered how much it actually hurts when people are nice to me

4806,yby891,Hazel4890,"So I talked about relationships with some close friends, and as much as I would like to stay positive about potentially finding a husband and settling down with, I have to be realistic. If some of them are already thinking about becoming single mothers or even potentially being cheated on cause that's the norm now, then I probably won't have that romantic bond or even being fully loved cause my generation is messed up.

 It pains me to think that loneliness is what going to end up happening. It's hard finding someone that could match up to my ideals like improving career wise like I do, or someone that wants too live comfortably not really lavious or luxury cause it would be nice but definitely not entirely needed. Like I don't need expensive things in life, I just want to add to my family and have good careers where money isn't always the issue and give my kids a decent life and education. 

To being able to go places together and experience life here and there cause trips can always be saved for. But I may never have partner that wants that. My generation can't wait for anything, they just want to hook up and leave, no talking really,  no relationship, not wanting a family, no nothing. 

Just this incel mentality. When what I want the most is companionship/friendship with a potential partner, to want to feel loved and wanted. To think that all I'll have is just my career and parents and nothing else. They may never have grandchildren or walk me down the aisle that special day. Not necessarily ""married"" cause I would be happy with common law, like having the rings, calling each other husband and wife but not in paper. 

Maybe I was dumb thinking that love was out there, but I truly think it died along time ago. I don't know if anyone can tell me how to fully accept loneliness, cause if someone can't be a part of my peace then I don't want it. Like it shouldn't be a battle or games to get someones attention. Like I've said earlier that I gave up on dating apps and it's been 2 months, nothing but men that were extremely rude to me when I did nothing wrong to deserve that. 

Or getting ghosted or having to wait for days having to respond. That's not talking or dating. 
I wish I had a cold heart to feel nothing cause then this would be so much easier. But there's no right man out there. I'm not granteed that I have soul mate, for all I know he could very well not exist or just not meant to be this time around, or not meant to be loved this time. Billions of people, but wasn't meant to be with anyone. 

I don't want to be a single mom or to expect at some point that I might be cheated on. I'm not okay with that. I just want normal, but may never fully feel it. At least once would be nice even if it doesn't last, I would like to be wanted and to feel love once by someone else.
But I don't believe I would ever have that. 
I do enough self love/care in my own life, I've done so much self improvement, and yet I'm still alone majority of the time.",2022-10-24 01:09:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634955726,4,/r/lonely/comments/yby891/done_with_dating/,,0,9,Done With Dating

4813,ybz2dj,Unnecessary_User32,"So last night I went out with some friends. When we were arranging a meet up spot and other plans I was kept out of the loop unless I asked. When we got to the place that we were all supposed to meet no one was there. I waited for a while until they called saying that we were meeting at this other spot and they had forgot to tell me even though I was in constant contact with them throughout this entire time. I had already had that feeling about not being anyone's first choice but I went and met up with them. When I got there, I just didn't want to be there anymore. Then when we all met up everyone ended up splitting up (we were at this sort of festival thing). The people I usually hang out with the most didn't say anything about me joining them. I ended up going with a friend and his gf and they're awesome but I was definitely just being a third wheel. The entire time I just kept thinking about how I really don't have close friends. I have friends that I sometimes hangout with but not actual close friends. 

I've been thinking about it more lately and it's really starting to bother me. I never have had close friends. I've never really had a *best friend*. Even with my siblings that I consider my best friends, they tend to pick each other. I have a SO that I adore but I also feel like I'm not really their first choice at times. I'm my dog's first choice so that keeps me going lol. But in reality, I sometimes wish that I had that one person that I can rely on, that one person who thinks about me when making plans or when wanting to vent about something, that one person that's like hey let me call them so we can get some food together.

4854,yc46wm,benojedna,"Hey guys and gals, I‚Äôve only been on this thread for a month (which is as long as I‚Äôve been on Reddit) and I thought I‚Äôd just share my experience with my journey through loneliness and how I got out from it.

It started after high school, really. I [22y/o, m]had great friends in high school, was brought up well socialised, even had a gf (for like 2months, but still) and friends I could openly say ‚Äúlove you‚Äù to. I then left to join the Army for a year (gap year program) and I ended up quite alienated from my peers. They were a lot more put together, charismatic and ENTJ type than I was, and as I was also struggling with untreated hyper-somnolence at the time, I had no energy to make friends. This was okay as I knew University would change this.

Come 2020, and I start my first year of nursing school. Ofc, in Australia where I‚Äôm from, this was a bad year to start for me and everyone else. What followed was close to 3 years with no sex, no close friends, no one who would text me to make sure I‚Äôm okay; no one for me to open up with and so forth.

I noticed I was not depressed exactly, but lonely: a disease all of its own. It took me a year to realise it and 2 more years fighting it. After the first year was when I could admit it to myself and say ‚ÄúI am alone‚Äù. This was a relief in some ways, as now I could put a name to the struggle. I notice things change about me too:

- every woman I saw I instantly had sexual fantasies for
- I got agitated at EVERYONE. Why was everyone having a dandy time while I suffering?
- loneliness became a physical pain, right in the chest.
- I became anxious for the first time 
- I cried myself to sleep on occasion 
- my brain because numb from lack of stimulation 
- I felt like I wasted life away everyday I didn‚Äôt have friends and this just made the whole cycle worse.
- I also became more philosophical for some reason, as if suffering makes the artist which can be true.


There‚Äôs other symptoms but it seems we follow these in one way or another. 

Fast forward to now, and I feel back to my old self again from highschool. How? Well it was literally because of one friend who I opened up to about my loneliness and who actually put in consistent effort to help me. I had to drop every habit and routine I had just to fill it up with 10min of small talk. I sacrificed almost anything for those quick social interaction however awkward it was. 

I also started a job which involved a lot of small talk. I was hopelessly awkward at the start but it got better slowly. 

But it was all because of the opportunity this ONE friend gave me. It was nice to know not everyone was a dick and in their own privileged world. 

I‚Äôm better now :) I can talk normally, make friends easily and even land dates. That‚Äôs all to say I didn‚Äôt do this alone. I‚Äôm sorry to say, in my case I didn‚Äôt fix myself all by myself, instead it required friends. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the only answer but it was the way for me. 

If anyone would like to vent and have someone listen to your story please DM me. Everyone has a story, and unfortunately, a lonely story is seldom noticed.

There was about six or seven of us all in the one Xbox live party chat, playing classic games from the ages of 11 to 18.

We‚Äôd sometimes go out, drink a decent bit, hang out after school, get takeaways, etc etc.

We‚Äôd play stuff like Rainbow Six, PUBG, COD Zombies,Minecraft and GTA V. and have the coolest adventures. 

But now every single fucking person around me just wants to get high, binge drink, and go to overpriced nightclubs which have the music volume at an ear drum bursting level.

I don‚Äôt mind alcohol, or even weed for that matter, I‚Äôve done both and they‚Äôre enjoyable when paired with other activities.

But why the FUCK did JUST SUBSTANCE USE become so  popular?!?

I mean those times when ALL YOU DO is sit around, drink, get high, and have absolutely pointless and bullshit conversations which mean fucking nothing.

Which sounds more entertaining?

‚Ä¢Going paintballing or bowling and THEN drinking.

‚Ä¢getting into a high speed bank robbery on payday 2 with the boys, then drinking.

‚Ä¢Or just drinking? Nothing else, just consumption, that. is. fucking. it.

A bunch of our original group has just literally sold their gaming systems simply to get liquor or drug money, and it‚Äôs fucking sad, they sold endless enjoyment for a quick dopamine rush and I fucking hate them for it.

There‚Äôs only really three of us left.

4904,ycdkym,NyraMoonbeam,"TL:DR at bottom

This is a raw idea straight off the dome, so if it seems under-developed, it is. 

Basically, my idea is this:

Internally, I process the world through cause and effect, mapping desired effects to actions that will cause them.

In other words, I primarily perceive the world in terms of what it means in the context of my desired future self. 

This is the sixth Hermetic principle:
""Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to Law. Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law."" - The Kybalion

If I run into a situation where I am unable to determine the cause of a desired effect, it makes me despair, because then I am unable to cause my desired effect.

Like everyone else here, I strongly desire companionship and intimacy.

However, the causes of these things remain unknown to me. 

A fundamental Hermetic aphorism is that: 
""The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding."" - The Kybalion

To me, this means that if the causes of this future which I desire remain hidden to me, then I should recieve the indication that I have held some false belief, which renders me unprepared to understand the truth of the matter.

However, another Hermetic aphorism from the same page of the Kybalion is this:
""When the ears of the Student are ready to hear, then come the lips to fill them with wisdom."" 

I take this to mean that once one is ready to understand something, the hidden knowledge does not waste time in revealing itself to the student. 

All this is to say that perhaps there is some attitude which, once held, naturally develops the individual in the direction of his/her desired state of companionship. 

I hypothesize that this attitude is the combination of self-acceptance and other-acceptable. 

Others deeply desire to be accepted for who they are. So, when the individual provides this acceptance, not wishing change upon them, and the person in question picks up on this, a basic platonic attraction is established. 

This acceptance both of the self and the other, I think means recognizing the other's needs and boundaries, and structuring one's interactions with them in ways which recognize their needs and boundaries while also recognizing your personal sovereignty. 

I hypothesize that the more consistently one manifests this attitude, the more integrated that person will become in their community. 

Finally, I hypothesize that such a community will naturally seek to provide reciprocity, blessing those who bless them. 

If all of this is true, then one who is lonely may seek refuge in their community in this manner, and one of the ways the community may unconsciously seek to bless the lonely one by helping connect them with opportunities for companionship.

TL;DR: 

I hypothesize that much of the pain of loneliness comes from one's perceived inability to cause themselves to find a companion, and that this may possibly be ameliorated by seeking to accept themselves and others for their true selves, and that this course of action may drastically increase one's odds of finding a companion organically through their community. 

The primary utility of this hypothesis is that if true, it would theoretically allow the individual to directly increase their chances of finding a partner through mental practice alone.",2022-10-24 15:03:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641240513,1,/r/lonely/comments/ycdkym/i_have_a_hypothesis_possible_solution/,,0,0,I have a Hypothesis (possible solution?)

I think I lost the perfect person. About a month ago, she and I met online, and as cold it may sound, it was like I'd made her in a computer. She was smart, sweet, tall, beautiful, loved the same things I did; I thought I'd finally found someone who would stick around, but alas, my hopes were unfulfilled. She sent me a message saying she was getting a lot of anxiety with the situation and that she was gonna step away from dating for the time being. I was a bit crushed, but I understood. I left her with my number and said if she ever felt ready, to let me know. She said she would, and I haven't talked with her since, and I still keep thinking about her, and it's recently gotten worse. I doubt she's given me a second thought since that day, I sometimes wonder if she even saved my number, but I'd kill to know if she still thinks of me. I keep thinking about what I maybe could've said to just hold onto her as a friend until she felt ready, or to just keep her in touch, but I didn't. I'm almost twenty and haven't been in a relationship since one very bad one when I was sixteen, and my constant failure in dating after that point has made me feel worse and worse.

4940,ycjg11,WrittenEuphoria,"I feel stuck. I know that I'm too boring for most people to want to be my friend. I know I'm too ugly for most women to want to date me. But I seem to be incapable of changing those two fundamental truths about myself. No hobbies have ever piqued my interest except gaming and movie-watching (and reviewing both). I'm not physically active save for walking or playing VR games for an hour or so every day, not nearly enough to start playing in a rec league or joining a hiking group. I'm the least creative person in the world so art and music are out of the equation.  

And no matter how much I try to focus on hygiene there's always something. I shower and brush my teeth daily now, use beard wash and such, I'm bald so I shave my head and trim my beard every week, but there's still zits on random spots, dry itchy spots under my eyes (and in unpleasant areas), my beard still looks like a mess despite my best efforts to tame it (and I can't go unshaven because I'm a fatty).  

So it seems like despite the most effort I've ever gone to in order to improve my life over the past *year,* I've basically made 0 progress, which to me means that it's pointless. I'm still going to keep trying, because what other choice do I have, but I know deep down I'll never make any progress. Which means I'll be lonely forever.

She is very close to me, and she considers me her brother as well as a best friend, shares every little thing with me. (She do have a boyfriend) and I am her only male friend except him. When I asked her why she don't have much male friends.. She said every other guy talks to me for a month Max and then asks me out, and you are the only one who never asked me and never cracked a double meaning joke.It has never been a problem from past 5 years but from last few months I am really stocking her on Instagram, checking her last seens and waiting for her reply desperately and I don't know why. What's wrong w me. (I am helping her to settle in this new city btw) I never had a girlfriend and not even a female friend other than her, coz I never found a girl I wanted and I think she fits in perfectly in the image of the girl I wanted.

But unfortunately its next to impossible for me to hide my feelings and our bond is so good that even if I hide it somehow, I am damn sure  she will catch me someday, and it is also painful for me to watch her with that guy. So I have decided to try to ignore her as much as I can which will prevent me from asking her out.

(I always pay, rarely ever ask them to do it and when i do, i get the money asap and return it) My mum proceeds to say that that‚Äôs all I know how to do: waste money and buy stupid useless things. And how I‚Äôm annoying/inconveniencing everyone. 

The clock strikes 12 am, on my birthday, and I‚Äôm still just tutoring. 

15 minutes after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, I have only gotten a message from the little kid I tutor and it‚Äôs him asking for help in his homework. 
30 minutes after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, im on a zoom call with him, teaching him algebra. 

50 minutes after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, I come out of the bathroom to my mum waiting at my bedroom door, not to wish me, but to snark at me and to tell me to clean the cats litter box. 

1 hour after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, im sitting in my room, alone with my phone in my hand, hoping I get some birthday messages.

1.5 hours after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, I open up my bank app and finally get my first birthday wish. From my bank app. 

2 hours after it‚Äôs officially my birthday, thought maybe everyone in my house was tired so they fell asleep but they bought a cake to surprise me.

I have no other way to explain it than I just feel constantly numb.

 I go out sometimes and it never really seems that exciting so I tend to just stay home more often than not.

I made the decision back in April to stop asking my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to hangout (because it was always me asking them all the time) as an experiment to see if they would message me and they haven‚Äôt. So that‚Äôs been a big portion of the loneliness.

I‚Äôm kinda nervous about going to the therapist but I think in theory it will help. The only off thing to me is that it‚Äôs over the phone and not in person but I‚Äôm actually more excited to just sit in the comfort of my own home.

It only hit me now, my family usually gets together to watch movies, and they NEVER watch my movies, they say they're ""too weird"" or ""too complicated"", now I only have a few friends from school and outside, and I don't feel comfortable with them soemtimes.
I finally got my family to watch another movie I recommended, Everything Everywhere All at Once, I heard absolutely brilliant things about this movie, and I was able to follow it fine.
However, after the movie ended, my family was confused, asleep, and could not care less about what I thought of the movie, the only thing they cared about was going to sleep. Now let's say it's a movie my sister recommended, they would talk about it for 20 full minutes, and talk about everything there is and then go to sleep nicely.
Now I had SO MUCH stuff to talk about, but they all completely ignored me and started walking out of the living room, I tell them that I probably shouldn't watch any movies I recommend with them since they usually just dislike them, I got greeted back by getting cussed at until they all went to bed.
So I'm here, still talked to nobody about the movie, and this happens EVERY. TIME.

With my friends, they need a 2 week notice before we meet up to even have a chance of meeting up. And even then they'll try NOT to show up, it only happened once but it really affected me since we almost never meet up.
There was a circus nearby recently, and I kept asking them ""Hey, want to go? It'll be fun!"" And they never ever gave me a real answer, just looked away and then started making fun of me constantly asking them, the closest I'd get is ""We'll make some fun ourselves"" whatever that means.
These days, people my age should have friends who simply ask their parents ""hey, can I go with my friends to A, B, C?""
""Sure""
And then we'd meet up, my parents let me, but I dont have anybody to go out with.

I have NEVER met a single person with interests even close to mine, similar video games, tv shows, music, movies, so I just have this giant fucking bubble inside of me with all the stuff I can talk about that I have NEVER verbally gotten out of my system. And whenever I have a chance to open up the bubble even a bit, I become annoying and people immediately don't want to hang out with me.

I feel so terrible, I keep telling myself ""I'll find somebody"" yet I never get anywhere close.
I'm just this annoying nerd that when somebody finally talks to, they ignore me the next time they're close to me.

What's wrong with me? Will I EVER find anybody to talk to about stuff I like, do stuff I like with them, watch stuff with them, or will I stay like this until my inevitable doom?",2022-10-25 00:16:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636806673,4,/r/lonely/comments/ycqwsn/i_have_nobody_to_do_anything_with/,,0,2,I have nobody to do anything with.

5019,ycs12p,MrReZx,"So, before I really start, I suppose I have it better than some. I have a girlfriend. In fact, I've had a few over the last few years, but that's not why I feel lonely.

I'm 27M. I haven't made a single new friend in 11 years, and the handful of friends I do have I can feel slipping away.

The last time I made a true, actual friend was in highschool. I still love the few friends I made back then, but they live far away now, and I know for a fact that they have many other friends which they see quite often. I see them about once a year, and have done ever since we finished high school.

After high school I went straight to UNI. I felt very alone during this time, and I was never really invited to anything unless it involved ""everyone"". Either everyone in my class or everyone in the larger group of programs that were sort of bundled together. Whenever I actually went to any of these parties, it felt more like I was just placed in the middle of a bunch of different groups of people socialising, with me just floating silently in the middle; like an awkward turd that no one wanted to acknowledge. Needless to say; since graduating I haven't interacted with anyone from UNI in any shape or form. Not over the phone, not online, not in person.

After UNI I moved to London where my best friend lived at the time. I moved in with him and got to sort of know his uni-mates. After about a year and a half he moved to Australia after meeting a girl who originated from there who wanted to finish her studies: this left me alone in London apart from the people I knew through my friend and my colleagues. I tried a couple of times to meet up with the people I had gotten to know through my friend but they kept on canceling. I also tried a couple of times to spend time with my colleagues outside of work but it never really happened. I was again invited to any event which involved ""everybody"", but not any other type of event.

Eventually I grew tired of the lonelyness in London and moved back to my home country. I quickly met a girl through Tinder (which is possible here, but very much not in London) and we have been dating for almost 3 years now. I love her with all my heart, and without her I would probably not be here, but even so: I still feel so very lonely.

I haven't made any new friends since I was about 16 years old, and I know that the friends that I do have definitely have made new friends, since those are the primary ""new"" interactions, apart from colleagues, that I have had since then. I recently tried to arrange a meet up with the guys for next weekend: I had planned it with my girlfriend for 3+ months, and invited all 3 of them around that time as well, but they couldn't make it.

I've accepted that I'm not all too desirable as a friend, based on experience over the last 11 years, but it still hurts. I just saw a post of a graph of how Americans of different ages spend their time and couldn't help but think of how my time has been spent these last 11 years. I'm not American, but the distribution is still valid I think. 

I wish so much that I was different - that I was more sociable - that people just wanted to spend time with me, rather than just being ""OK"" with me being around. I don't blame anyone but myself though - there truely is no greater hate than that of oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long post. I just needed to get my thoughts down somewhere where someone else might read them...",2022-10-25 01:11:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615485510,3,/r/lonely/comments/ycs12p/hi/,,0,1,Hi

5032,yctajg,AgainAndAgainForever,"Often I feel like an extra. Someone whose in the background, ignored. I tried to be seen, honestly; I did my best, tried to talk to people tried to help them, yet to no avail. Now I'm quiet, nobody wants to listen, they don't have to here; I'll spare them, maybe leave them to inquire about their actions. I know they won't, they won't ever question why I'm so quiet; nobody ever has. I'm not sure if they'll ever see, sometimes I dream of killing myself: would they know then? I'd want then to feel guilty, even mourn: they wouldn't, I'm not much of a person, no matter how much I try to be. 

I cry myself to sleep some nights, nobody knows. Nobody ever knows. I don't have friends, just the ceiling and maybe the voice in my head. None of my friends listen, I've tried so many different friend groups; all of then are practically the same. People cease to see that I'm only human, but maybe they're actions shine truth and I'm some monster. All myths have some truth to them. Maybe I don't want to be loved, not if I can't return it. My life seems to have lost all meaning, all I can see is black and white or maybe I'm using the wrong filter. God, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. 

Why have I been forsaken? The question repeats itself over and over in my head. Maybe I'd be better in the ground. I want to start over, constantly; maybe I'm a perfectionist or maybe I want the off chance that I strike gold. There's no hidden gems or diamond in the rough, just me. I'm sorry I'm nothing special, I'm sorry I'm me, I'll be better, I'll do better, it's for their happiness not mine. Right? Aren't you supposed to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of others, do something that will make you feel terrible or even worse even if it evokes that small feeling of happiness for someone else? Where's my happiness, where's my karma? I really don't get it. I'm I selfish. just for asking to be happy? 

I feel crazy, like a madman. The madman doesn't know he's mad, but if I know I'm mad I'm not and it creates a whole paradox. I live the same life day in and day out, I do all the same things. Einstein said it himself that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. 

Every night I lie in bed, contemplating what I should do, if there's even one person in the universe that can understand this exact pain. I often doubt there is, but I'm a good actor so there's gotta be someone else. I'd like to think I understand people, but at the end of the day it's night and lie in bed wondering if I do. Maybe I understand people, and everything is clear in my vision, no rose tinted glasses. Or maybe I'm wearing sunglasses in the dark.

My grades dropped, but as long as they didn't harm my siblings I put up with it. Until I said no. Haha, as if they'd stop because I said no.

One of my friends on discord (and also great one IRL) came out as bi, with attraction to feminine looking people. I've messaged him almost immedeatly, and said something along those lines: Hey, just wanna remind you that I like you the way you are, and this is not going to change that. And if you ever need something, I'm here for you. (I know this coming from a guy seems really weird and gay, but this is how i think...)

Anyways...

After two days, I've decided to message him again to ask him, If... he... you know... likes... me...?... (Yes, I'm also bi, so that's that...)

The message was reading like this: Hi, look, I take all people here as my friends, and i wish it would stay like this. For all. So my anwser is no, if it's probably how you think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

And I was like, okay, I was afterall, expecting this, there's nothing I was surprised with, but I've almost got into tears &amp; don't know why, then it hit me, This will be happening to me forever...

&amp;#x200B;

To be perfectly clear, I wan parter, but not for the reason you think, I just want someone to hug and confide to from time to time...

5109,yd4n9c,synapsegrimm,"Let me start off by saying most of my friends growing up would move away or transfer school every 2 to 3 years.  My longest friendship to date was about 5 years so keep that in mind. 

I went to college and met some great people. But now we graduated and have Ben working for about a year. They all live in walking distance to each other and I live on the other side of country. . I've had to live at home this year with my parents and I don't have a good relationship with my parents at all. So living here I basically stay in my room to avoid them. 

And my escape would be to play games and chat with my friends. But the last few months have been really hard. I've been in and out of depressive episodes constantly. And I can't seek help from my parents at all. And whenever I try go online lately and talk to my friends as an escape they seem really distant. They basically hang out every weekend so me drifting away is understandable but I really just need a place to go where I can relax but I don't have thag anymore.

I plan on moving to them at some point but I'm scared that would help at all and them I'm stuck there. I'm so used to really close friendships ending after a few years and it's never bothered me but for some reason this is crushing me. I'm trying to hold on to a rope thats not there. 

I don't know what to do. I'm on the verge of shutting down completely and what's worse is that it feels like if I do no one will miss or even try look for me .

And I get so enraged when people now say ""There's someone for you put there, and it takes time"" or ""The one will come for you""
No, it won't. No matter how nice I am towards everyone, they just don't care. I literally spend money for gifts or surprises simply to people, just to see happiness, but I realised it's worthless.

And I've seen posts where people ask for self-love. What does self-love mean? Give me some examples on how to do that. Because I have come to the point where I've accepted that I'm really really really ugly.

Even if I die, the next day nobody will care about it, and I feel like they're just gonna take my body and throw it in the dumpster rather than bury it somewhere. My self-esteem is so low, that even when people say nice things to me, I just consider it as pity compliments.

The second I set foot into my school I was just declined, thrown away, an outcast.
Nobody listens to me, nobody wants to talk to me, nobody likes me, except if they have to.
Everyone turns their back on me an ignores me.
If I text someone regarding important stuff or ask in the group chat of our grade, my texts get read by everyone, but not a single person answered.
Day by day I get more and more depressed and isolate myself even more, I even consider suicide almost every day.
At night I cant sleep and at day I am too tired to care for anything.
I even put a suicide note into my status and more than 50 people viewed it, not a single person wanted to cheer me up or talk or simply said ‚ÄûDont‚Äú.
I tried to open up to my parents about it, but my mother yells at me and blames it on video games, although I‚Äòm clearly overstressed beyond my borders by all the exams I have to study for and the lack of social acceptance, and my father cant help me with it, he tries.

5167,yddl0h,yumeRobin,"Hello, stranger I've never met. 

But if you're reading this, then I am talking to you. If you feel very lonely or depressed just like me, I'm very happy to have caught your attention and to have you here with me for a moment. I know I can't hear your answer from the other end, but, how are you? How's life been treating you?

I am also undergoing a very tough time in my life. I also feel surrounded by tremendous loneliness 24 hours a day. I understand what it feels like to live and work like a robot. I know how hurtful it is to realise few people really care about how you're doing and feeling. I know it's devastating to face a heavy loss of something or someone important. I know what it means to watch the world keep moving on leaving you alone in the darkness asking what living is all about... You shout inside but don't hear an echo...

But if you ask me, I think you're doing a really really good job making it so far and still carrying on. I'm so sorry for every painful feeling you're having. No matter what's going on or what has happened in your life, you always deserve love and happiness, and you deserve that naturally by right. If you wonder why there's so much pain brought upon you, well, something is going wrong, not you. The world is being naughty and mean. But the world also wants you to be happy and loved. I, at least, do. I am part of the world, aren't I? And you are too! Perhaps you and I are the ones that truly know the world's will, hush... don't tell'em! 

Trust me when I say there are a universe of beautiful things life has prepared for you and there's tons of reasons to enjoy life. And you deserve to be cared and loved no matter what you think, what you do or not do, that fact won't change.

I understand it must feel difficult at the moment. I feel sad I don't have the direct connection with you and I can't give you the real-time accompany which you probably need badly, but I wish I could.

But stay strong my friend, we have our bad lucks but that doesn't mean we don't deserve an awesome future. Perhaps it's waiting for us to be ready for it. Maybe somewhere there is a ""will"" or something is blessing you secretly, hoping you all the best, just like I do. We might not seeing it but it does exist. It's just like how you don't see the sun during the night but it still exists and will come to you just on time at dawn. You know, that sort of thing~

I write this to you because I want to, and I can. I understand there are so many lonely or sad people like me, like you. I hope you receive some care and comfort that you need

If this letter brings you at least a little bit of comfort, I'd be so glad. If so, I will continue to write more to you in the future! Perhaps tell you about my own stories, or how I find the power to carry on, how I find life is so much worth living. Or maybe just ramble on some interesting or beautiful things here and there in our life. Not a bad idea aye?

Thank you for listening to me, please make it an awesome day, okay? I'm always with you, I'll see you next!",2022-10-25 19:35:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,,88,/r/lonely/comments/yddl0h/a_letter_to_you_dear_loner/,,0,45,"A letter to you, dear loner"

Hey r/lonely!   
 

Through the years I‚Äôve been through my own fair share of struggles but have thankfully managed to get by, and with the things I‚Äôve learned by going through it I‚Äôve been able to help some friends and strangers through their own struggles. Over the past couple of weeks since I‚Äôve found this subreddit I‚Äôve been DMing with a few of you guys to try and help where I could but unfortunately it seems there are more people in need of help than there are people willing to help which is why I‚Äôm making this post (and maybe more in the future).  
 

I made these tips for a friend of mine to help him get better at making friends/socializing. So obviously this is just my opinion, and I‚Äôm by no means an expert of any sort but these are some things that have worked well for me (sorry if these may seem obvious or clich√©). Now these tips are based a lot on your mindset and less about direct practical advice because I think your mindset is one of the most important things you can change that has a direct impact on your social life. Changing your mindset is easier said than done I know, but not impossible like you might think. If you actively try and implement change it will get easier over time until eventually it‚Äôs second nature and you‚Äôve adopted the mindset. If you think you already embody these traits but are still having difficulty, I may write out more direct practical tips in the future so stay tuned.   


&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ **Genuinely like other people**

* Try and always look for the positive aspects in others and focus on those. You don‚Äôt need to ignore the negatives or be oblivious to them, but just be accepting of them and don‚Äôt let it interfere with your ability to connect with them. The ability to befriend people who have wildly different personalities and world views than you is a great skill to have. People are more open to reciprocating your desire for friendship/affection if they sense your genuine fondness of them.   


¬∑ **Believe/Assume that others like you back**

*  There are so many qualities you have that are great and make you a likeable person. Of course we all have flaws, but assume others can see the positive qualities in you and will extend you the same courtesy you give them by focusing on your positive traits. Assuming others dislike you is not a good mentality to have going through life and is more often than not completely untrue.    
   
 

¬∑ **Be an Optimist**

* When presented with the option to focus on 2 disparate possibilities/outcomes choose to focus on and believe in the positive. That doesn‚Äôt mean to delude yourself into ignoring the reality of the situation, you can still be a realist. Just choose to believe in the positive and be willing to accept the negative if it does come to pass  
   
 

¬∑ **Give people the benefit of the doubt**

* Don‚Äôt think everyone is out to get you. Someone might just be trying to be friendly and say hello just because they want to chat, not everyone is out scam you or take advantage of you. But you also don‚Äôt need to be na√Øve and trust someone blindly. It‚Äôs fine to keep some guards up and not give out money/personal information to anyone who asks. Just take the default stance that they are genuine and then let them prove if they are shady through their words and behavior.
*  Don‚Äôt assume people are avoiding hanging out because of something about you. People have busy lives and struggles of their own. Don‚Äôt assume you know what‚Äôs going on in their head or in their lives because you don‚Äôt. Instead use it as an opportunity to check in on them to see if they are alright. You never know, they might be going through a rough time and be really in need of someone to talk to. You might have been the only person who has reached out to check in on them.   


¬∑ **Be nice, kind, and caring**

* Be empathetic/sympathetic to others by intently listening to what they have to say and genuinely caring. Offer your emotional support and your sincere kindness.   


¬∑ **Put in the effort to initiate**

* It sucks when no one texts you first or is the first person to reach out to try and hangout. But don‚Äôt let that bother you. If they are willing to hangout/spend time talking it means they value spending time with you and the time you spend together should be what‚Äôs most rewarding. Don‚Äôt let your experience together or your perception of it be negatively impacted just because you were the one to initiate. They might be sitting at home thinking ‚Äúwhy hasn‚Äôt \_\_\_\_\_ messaged me in sometime? Do they not like me?‚Äù as well, you never know.   


¬∑ **Be ok and accepting of the situation if things do go bad**

* Not everyone in the world is someone you will be compatible with on an interpersonal level and that‚Äôs ok. These tips will help you develop and maintain friendships/relationships more easily and attract other likeminded people but if someone doesn‚Äôt want to have a friendship/relationship you can‚Äôt force it. Just remember to not assume that this is the case by default. There are sooo many people out there who would love to be in a friendship/relationship so don‚Äôt sweat what was or could have been and keep looking forward.",2022-10-25 22:04:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1562774399,10,/r/lonely/comments/ydh46c/maybe_helpful_tips_for_makingkeeping_friends/,,0,3,(Maybe) Helpful Tips for Making/Keeping Friends

And if I spend too much time alone I begin to ruminate about all kinds of things and sometimes find something that I turn into a problem and dwell on.

5199,ydhy0v,NoWind3360,"Hi there.

After a relationship of about ten years (18-28) I found myself single, for the context say that we did not have the same expectations or the same values... the blindness of love therefore. ...

It was not easy to accept and I locked myself in denial and sadness for a long time.
I have been single for 6 years now and I literally avoid all social interaction and possible encounters.

I know myself and I know I would blindly dive back into a relationship, but I know one more breakup would destroy what I have left of my self-confidence.
Yet I feel happy to be alone when I see the difficulties of the couples around me.

I do what I like when I like, the only thing that saddens me is the disappointment of my family (I am the eldest of the boys).
Yet I can't convince myself that I'm better off alone.

I'm not looking for advice, I just wanted to share my feelings

Good luck to you

The Chinese have a saying: ""If it is fated, people will meet even if they have to cross one thousand miles. If it is not, they will miss each other even after coming face to face."" That we haven't met likely suggests that it was not meant to be, which is fine. Life is good, but lonely. Nothing to complain about, but also no much to celebrate. As such, while not living my days passionately, it has been quiet peaceful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have taken the time to focus on work and personal projects, as well as contemplating philosophy. The past few years were about self development and next year I will probably enter the next phase of my career and take the next step in path towards the Dao. As such I am afraid that we will keep missing each other, but such is life. In a sense that we never met made me find within myself answers, perhaps not the answers I desired but the answers I needed, so I hope that you too might find what you need, even if you keep missing each other.

To be honest, I started to feel a little crazy lately and wondering if I maybe have some kinda serious problem, I wanted to post here because I don't want to talk anybody else about this, I feel ashamed, not even my therapist. I want to know if maybe more people does this? Or is it just me?
I realized I talk to myself a lot, but I know most people do that, but what concerns me is that I imagine I'm with people, with friends, I imagine conversations, or situations where I'm having fun and having the time of my life, and I genuinely laugh because of what I imagine said ""people"" say to me in that moment, that's what hits me.
I realized most of the time, when I'm alone, I picture a complete different life, replete with friends and love, so I just do that, and have full on conversations with these people, laugh at the replies, look with emotion eyes at those people, and like mimic I'm drinking or doing activities with them.
I feel like I'm 5 again and have imaginary friends, because when the genuine laugh part ends, I just feel empty and pathetic.
What should I do? Am I crazy? There's something wrong with me?
Honestly, if you want to be mean or cruel just be it, maybe I need a reality check.

Edit: I started to think more and more about it, I realize I also mimic the touch of someone, like ""they"" are caressing me or I'm being touchy feely with ""them"".

5245,ydnk5t,Legitimate_Annual533,"I deal with chronic loneliness. I haven't had real life friends for about ten-twelve years (I'm almost 21), and the pain that loneliness brings me comes and goes in waves. 

I feel like my sense of purpose, ambitions, and day to day life is pretty much a disaster but I can't stand this in particular. 

over the years sometimes I wouldn't care, I would be fine with just my family and I wouldn't try to make friends my age, but then sometimes it would cripple me and become overwhelming, I would be so sick of being alone everywhere I went. imagine seeing everyone else having something you don't have, and seeing that thing everywhere, all the time. it's always right in front of you, and yet you never have it. 

I know a lot of other people deal with loneliness as well and have the same feelings that I do, but it's never really the same. they always have people in their real lives to talk to. they just feel like they don't have any true friends. I just want someone to talk to, even if its surface level. someone who would consider me when deciding to go out.

everyone I've ever seen had or has real life friends throughout their teens and 20s even my family. my dad was shy just like me but had friends. hes literally where I got my shyness from, yet he still managed to make friends. my mom was also shy and secluded herself but still had at least one close friend. my sister literally has over 10 friends, 3 different friend groups. and she loves texting them and talking about them, all the time. we laugh about the silly jokes they come up with, but I don't have the heart to tell her that its painful and I don't like hearing it. it takes me right back to the years I spent in public school from 4th grade to senior year watching everyone around me do the same thing desperately wishing I could do the same. couldn't go to any dances, couldn't go to that DC trip  couldn't enjoy field trips as much as everyone else, couldn't enjoy my choir performances, couldn't find any partners, and any social event I forced myself to just to get out of the house I cried on my way home from after spending all my time alone.

I remember the last time I had a friend in elementary school. she started to branch out to making other friends and I freaked out and drifted away from her. then that was it, I didn't make any more, I was just teased for being quiet. which doesn't make any sense. why would you make fun of someone for minding their business? 

I really don't know what the hell is wrong with me, why I could never make any real life friends close enough to get their phone number. I know I have severe social anxiety and possibly autism, but even people with those mental conditions have a few friends. so I truly feel alone in that department. every time I mention this to anyone they just try to give me advice like ""you just have to branch out and talk to people and not fear rejection"" with the tone of ""you're doing this to yourself."" okay, easier said than done, you think I haven't tried? and I know it's my fault thanks. also that doesn't erase the haunting ten years of loneliness that I have to bury when I do get some so they don't figure out I'm a loser. I'm kinda tired of the unsolicited advice. I wish there was someone out there who knew exactly how this situation feels.

I'm also tired of holding it in, I know my family doesn't want to hear me complain all the time about my problems and don't want me to rain on their parade but I'm sick of doing that, pretending to be happy. I am depressed and bitter about my situation. it makes me feel like a crappy person but its getting harder and harder to push down my feelings and be happy for everyone else after my mental health has been getting worse and worse for so long. it sounds bad, but their joy in the things that I don't have just brings me pain, it really does. that's all I've been feeling lately. I just want to go on lockdown mode and not speak to anyone until I can get therapy. I don't have the money to utilize any of the resources I really need.",2022-10-26 03:17:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608512175,9,/r/lonely/comments/ydnk5t/having_no_friends/,,0,5,having no friends

5248,ydoh45,janksmap,"I'm a male student in college. I have worked very hard over the last few years to go on dates, get to know people, and get out of my comfort zone. I feel like the return on investment has been pretty low. I seriously dated a person last year for 6 months and it is something that I desperately want back in my life. I know that being in a relationship won't fix all my problems, but it sure feels like it would be nice to have someone by my side that loves me and cares about me. I want to have a healthy relationship where we work together to solve problems and help each other get through difficult times.

One thing I have realized about myself is that I tend to gravitate towards physicality. It's easy for me to quickly find people I'm interested in because I get attached easily to people I'm physically attracted to. The problem is that they never seem to reciprocate the same feelings. I've tried online dating and haven't had much success.

What advice do you guys have for a guy who's been lonely for a long time and just wants to find a kind girl that loves him back?

5252,ydos10,djmikegipapologist,"Today I checked my blocklist, where my two old friends accounts reside, and I‚Äôm not even sure why I did that when I know that seeing that they‚Äôre active and happy and just having a ball in their own little worlds does absolutely nothing but make me feel like shit, but it was a little different this time; the one friend who I was closest with, who I assumed had long since been inactive since they only really used the app to talk to me and the other friend, changed their profile picture, and as simple as it is, it just broke me. Knowing that they‚Äôre still friends and are gladly moving on without me, something they made very clear in their last message to me, just makes me so angry and tired and hopeless, because they‚Äôre clearly just having a ball without me while I‚Äôve done nothing but gotten worse, and worse, and worse; everything‚Äôs just so easy for them.

I‚Äôm so sick of everyone else being able to move on, able to do so much and be so many things, while I‚Äôm still stagnant, if not getting worse. I don‚Äôt have anything to show for myself, or anyone to even talk to to make the days go by just a little less painfully, but they‚Äôre doing great; they‚Äôve probably long since forgotten about me, but I‚Äôm still here.

My friend who is my priority I just want to see her happy if she is happy with him than i dont have any problem and she is happy with him....
 I talked to both and I know the point of view of both and I know that how much they close are. I just want my friend to be happy and for that I tried to sort out the situation but i ended up making it worse and here I am reffering my friend as female friend and her friend is the other guy... 
So i tried to sort the things and ended up making it worse and the her friend thinks that   i made them fight and told me alot of things even he used to tell me in the past like you are sad cause I am with him and these kind of things but I always thought that he is lying and after that i get to know alot of things like she hide some things from me and that's true he thinks that i made them fight and lot of stuff that hurts......

5284,ydu7xl,Either-Computer-4927,"Hi, i'm a 24 yo male, let me tell you shortly my story.
Basically i work and study, i'm always so full of stuff that i don't even have time for myself anymore.
In the previous years when i liked a girl but she was not interested in me i didn't mind it, i tought it was normal to me to not feel anger or sadness or anything.
Now, in my last relationship i tought i was fully in love with my gf and when we broke up i felt absolutely nothing... i tought that it was ok since the relationship was kinda toxic to me. 
And now again i liked this girl that works with me but when i found out that she was dating someone else i lost interest in like 2 minutes. What is this, am i the only one? Why do i keep acting like this, does it means that all the feelings i felt were fake or am i just so full of shit in my head that i am confused on everything? 
The only thing i am sure of is that i want to run away, change everything and start again with only myself...
It's lonely and kinda sad but this tought make me feel confortable...

5297,ydx6p6,Beforephoenix,"I have finally managed to move out from my parents house and rented a luxurious fully furnished apartment in a gated community closed to my work place. I even got into a relationship with a cutie after being out of the game for several years.

4 months went by and I'm moving lowkey as possible... I was so excited with where my life was headed, despite all the bumps in the road, it's finally going my way and cannot be more happier.

I publicly came out about my relationship and let everyone know about how I became financially stable enough to comfortably have my own place.
Idk just a lil public admiration or something would feel nice ya know?

I was just that proud of myself.

People started to come over whenever they needed a quiet place to work or study or to spend some quality time or just a place to crash. Sometimes they come to party and invite dirtent parties while I'm at work.

Next thing I know..

I'm jobless, single, phoneless  and unable to pay the rent let alone basic needs.
Literally all happened within one week.
It was pain all through I almost took off my shoes and did the walk of shame omw back to my parents house.

Thought I was handling just fine until after the worst was over when it hit me like a ton of bricks completely random and unexpected.
Eventually I done made my peace with it

BUT NOT MY BESTIES GHOSTING ME!!!!!!!!!

I struggle to accept that they turning me into an option from priority, in fact they have collectively counted me out and gave me the ass to kiss when I needed them the most.

They no longer includ me in anything and they don't answer my calls or reply back to my texts???????
The pain is unbearable tonight and I have no one left to call.
In a world so connected, I've never felt so alone, so confused, so empty, so friendless, so lost. I'm cut off and isolated, no check ups no nothing. I feel sick to my stomach and terminally bummed out. It's drastically affecting my mental health.

I now don't believe in best friends I believe in good friends and my friends are neither. I'm just  D O N E.

I hope to God no one can relate.

5298,ydxg2n,KillmongerOTM,"For as long as I remember, I've always wanted to be loved and to love back. 2022 has been an absolutely brutal year for me when it comes to that. It even has me questioning if love really exists, or if it is even meant for me at all. I saw a post on another subreddit that encouraged me to speak what I've been feeling here.

Early this year, I met my first girlfriend on a dating app. We stayed together for a few months. Things were going super well for a while, and then I decided to leave her because I felt like she was very overwhelming and didn't like being told ""no"". 

After leaving my ex, I enjoyed my time being single. But sometime later, something came over me. Instead of being comfortable alone, I was overcome with incapacitating loneliness. I went on all of the dating apps I could to try to find someone. I got plenty of matches and ended up going on dates, but nothing moved past the first one. I was either ghosted, was told that ""a connection/spark wasn't felt"" and I even had a date end early.

I attempted suicide because of these rejections almost a week from today. I felt like a massive fuck up because of how bad I am at dating and the opposite sex. Every time I try to connect with someone, they push me away. I still feel suicidal, but not to the extent of last week where I was actively pursuing the end. I'm just irreparable and I don't think age, dating experience, and working on myself will make any difference.

TL:DR - Had a crappy ex, left her, spent time alone, got back into dating, mercilessly rejected after every date, attempted suicide, questioning if love exists/if I'm worthy of it

I know it's one of my issues but still i don't think it's the reason why i feel so alone. Yes, I'd love to have an ideal romance, and adventurous active friends to go out to do things more than partying. But i don't reject people because they don't fit my ""template"".

I consider myself artistic, caring, romantic, funny and a long blabla of good qualities. Don't want it to sound as bragging, i just can't understand how i don't fit in. I'm not super pretty or hot but neither bad.

Still, no one gets interest on me and when i achieve it (online) it ends up dying for distance or because everybody see me as their friends. I guess having someone so supporting and such by your side is enough. You have a great friend, and then you go out with someone hot or whatever that gives you the rest.

On friendship side, i am not shy or introvert but it's true I'm quite calm and it's hard for me to start conversation and talk when i meet someone new. So i might not look how i am, then i get worried and it's a snowball where i feel bad and i worry about not saying things or thinking they don't see me as who i am.

I tried to meet people outside, go on trips with random people and get to know them there in person. Still, it ends up being online when we leave and still, not a real friendship to go out and make plans.

Idk if i explained the situation but i don't want this to take longer. Basically, i feel like i don't fit in, neither i look for the typical friendship, i need something strong. And in love, i don't even know what to do, it seems like being too good is only pushing me off. Then, there are girls saying ""there are no more good romantic guys"" but i feel like i don't get the opportunity, maybe because of looks, or because first impressions.

I do, however, have a lot of superficial friends. I always have an invitation to hang out. I can always have a man in my bed if I want. I have admirers who give me loads of attention when I entertain it. I have lovers who will keep me warm at night, if I let them. I even got a housemate to keep me company in a big space and they wanted to be friends. 

I push everyone away. 

I want to be alone all the time, but I‚Äôm lonely when I‚Äôm alone. 

A constant state of gloom. Even when I‚Äôm happy, or proud of myself, there‚Äôs this underlying sense of loneliness to it all that I can‚Äôt understand. 

I‚Äôm happy, damnit. I live in a beautiful house. I have a great job, I have a lot of free time. I‚Äôm attractive, in shape, healthy. I have no baggage, no kids, minimal debt, no spouse to worry about. I have cool hobbies I can financially support. I have the fucking life. 

Why am I depressed? 

Why do I feel so alone?

Lately I haven‚Äôt really improved myself, I‚Äôve just been existing.  I haven‚Äôt had any luck romantically, but i feel like that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been trapped. I‚Äôve been at home since Covid began, with limited social interaction. I‚Äôm taking my college classes online until next year (I‚Äôll be going away from home). 


*if anyone even replies* I know you will probably say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so young, you have so much time to experience stuff‚Äù 


I feel like I won‚Äôt ever.   I‚Äôve been hopeful since I was 15, absolutely nothing sparked.  I feel like this lack of experience will affect any chances I MIGHT have at a relationship.   I feel out of touch with people my age.



I seem to attract older people because of how mature, simple and engaging I am (it seems). 


But I can‚Äôt seem to attract anyone around my age.  Everyone is so different‚Ä¶. I feel like I‚Äôm a older man in a young person‚Äôs body at this point . 

It‚Äôs a lot more to this, but it‚Äôs starting to dawn on me that I‚Äôll always be alone. 


Everyone has had a glow-up, while I am getting uglier every day that goes by. 


If no one showed interest in me now, imagine what that‚Äôll be like as the years go on?

I don‚Äôt even see myself alive past 23 (not because of this, but for other reasons). 


Idk.  At this point, I am just gonna live, and let time fly by until I leave this earth.

They're doing so much better than me socially, mentally, and in every other category in every way, and I despise being reminded that she has other options, other people she can go to, and other things she can do, while I don't even find joy or satisfaction in any of my old hobbies anymore, am too anxious, depressed, and numb to build new friendships that I don't overthink and ruin for myself, or just can't find any feelings from, and the only other person I talk to only messages me for homework answers.",2022-10-26 15:54:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664241618,1,/r/lonely/comments/ye1hab/i_hate_seeing_my_only_friend_talk_to_her_other/,,0,6,I hate seeing my only friend talk to her other friends

If only she could‚Äôve known how much joy she brought to my life when I first met her.. I wasn‚Äôt in a good place at all. A lot of the friendship I can say I caused problems not all the time but the lack of communication on my end.. and idk being her friend kinda gave me an ego boost because she was really the only person who overly ever really cared about me ever .. and I was like ‚Äòwow she really cares about me and it‚Äôs not the other way around like it usually is‚Äô so I got a big ego, besides she was a year younger than me.

I think later during that call she said it was her so she called me a blocked number to make sure I‚Äôd answer ‚Ä¶ :( she didn‚Äôt want to feel stupid if I didn‚Äôt answer.  that was back in 2019‚Ä¶ my friend has a lot of weird ways and does things like that and instead of just telling me how she feels‚Ä¶ but get this, I‚Äôm the same way.

She texted me on snap one day this year like in may out of the blue and told me to listen to this song.. the song was ribs by lorde .. if you listen to the song.. wow it is so good.. and when I asked why she sent that she didn‚Äôt really have a reason she was kinda being a little rude in her responses but whatever.. and when I said is there any other reason you sent it?

5358,ye7ukh,Jurez1313,"I just can't shake this feeling that I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life. My therapist obviously frowns on that sort of ""absolutist"" talk but nothing she said helped me feel better. She walked me through some grounding exercises, as well as a self-compassion exercise, but it just doesn't help. I think because my thoughts are rooted in facts.  

The facts are that I am boring, uninteresting, unattractive, and for lack of a better word, ""an NPC."" Like, I don't do anything fun or interesting with my time, I don't have any unique experiences or insights to share, I have 0 creativity in any aspect of my life. The interests I do have are super basic to most people, and I go way too in depth on them for the average person. I do the bare minimum to take care of myself and no more. So while I'm kind &amp; empathetic, a good listener and punctual person, this doesn't make me even a good candidate for a friend, let alone a romantic partner.  

No amount of self-affirmations, self-compassion, patience with self, or ""small, doable steps"" will change these core facts about myself. No matter how many people I try to socialize with and meet, no matter how hard I try to ""put myself out there"" to social groups and various activities, it doesn't matter if no one finds me interesting enough to ask questions about, or to listen to when I speak on what I *am* interested about.  

I'm trying not to let it get to me, but it really does fucking suck that the things I feel would help me the most (social and romantic relationships) are the things I am straight up excluded from being eligible for.  

I do have a few online friends that help me through these dark sorts of moments in my life, and they try to reassure me that I'm wrong, but it's hard to see how I'm wrong when no one in my life, not even my own parents and siblings, have shown me any evidence to the contrary. Their disinterest when I speak about my interests is palpable, if they even ask about what I've been doing at all (extremely rare). This is the case with everyone I've spoken to face-to-face. Idk why I come across as different online but apparently I do. But, at least I have that - it's of little solace, as online friends can't go to the movies with me or hang out and play board games or go out to dinner or just chill and chat well into the night (in part because of time zones), but it's something at least.",2022-10-26 20:19:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,2,/r/lonely/comments/ye7ukh/i_feel_so_alone_and_even_my_therapist_doesnt_know/,,0,2,"I feel so alone, and even my therapist doesn't know how to help."

Ever since I graduated HS my life has just been so boring and I don‚Äôt want to peak in HS.

I dropped out by year 3 and have been heavily demotivated and sitting in my room/house just wasting my youth.

I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôm unemployed (never had a job ever partly due to social anxiety and my slight stutter/shyness), I don‚Äôt have any friends so I‚Äôve been extremely lonely and sometimes cry at night because of it, never had a relationship either. All of these things combined just makes me so depressed and sad and I‚Äôm not sure how to even repair my life. I‚Äôve hit rock bottom and it‚Äôs crazy considering I‚Äôm 21.

I want to go out and have fun and make friends, want to have a relationship/gf and experience that, want to get a job and be social/outgoing but once again I don‚Äôt know where to start and it just feels shitty.

I go to socialized events like magic the gathering tournaments, casual card games, Beyblade tournaments, gaming lounges for people are, concerts, every anime or comic book convention and I somehow have not made a single friend even though everyone enjoys talking with me.

I‚Äôm going on my fourth year in Washington and people still freak out and run away when I cough due to my asthmatic condition. Every person I‚Äôve gotten phone numbers from is always flaky and never commits to meeting up with anyone or doing anything other than sit at their gaming PC. It‚Äôs like people do not value camaraderie in the Pacific Northwest.

I don‚Äôt even want to think of what the dating community looks like here because I‚Äôve been discriminated against for being a cis gendered male and asking for directions in downtown Seattle. All of my friends in other parts of the country keep telling me to get the hell out of here, but the living wage is so high that jobs which pay $100,000 are right around the livable wage.

My family support is nonexistent because my dad is a rapist and his side of the family excommunicated me when I decided to not be Muslim when I turned 18. My mother side of the family is in and out of jail or dead because of their drug addictions and substance abuse. I wish they were decent people who would actually reach out and ask the simple questions. I am taking solace in reading manga, exploring the mountains and forests, single player games and all the other hobbies mentioned above to cope with my loneliness.

Somehow none of it replaces something as simple as a friend. Every woman i ever talk to always has to assume that I am trying to fuck them even though I‚Äôm married and have a son. It all feels like I am living a life well but I am missing a vital part of what I need to make it in life

I prefer solo gaming (Xbox) to relax and my only other hobby is weightlifting. That used to get me out of the house and around some cool people but after Covid I have an at-home gym  with anything I need and just don‚Äôt go (to an actual gym) anymore. Friends who come over are great but no one calls to hang out. Those that do call, call her to check in and organize things. Even at work I‚Äôve become the loner, preferring to hide in a back room in my downtime alone rather than seek out anyone for company (as I‚Äôm doing now). 

I guess most of it is preference and I get how one thing plays into another but at the end of the day, I‚Äôm lonely. I don‚Äôt feel connected to anyone anymore. My kids and dogs are about as close as it comes tbh. I haven‚Äôt felt truly connected to my wife since 2014/15 when she had an affair and we almost divorced (long story). Even when ‚Äúmutual friends‚Äù come over, it feels forced or hollow. We have a good time and all but I know as soon as they leave l that‚Äôs it, no one calls ME or checks in with ME. All drama aside, even my wife and I don‚Äôt connect like we used to. It‚Äôs like our interests have changed completely and whereas we used to match on all points, now we barely match on any. 

Some part of me wants to feel connected again. With anyone! But at the same time I value what little TRUE alone time I get because I can actually be myself and do the things (like gaming) that I enjoy; the rest all just feels like a show to keep everyone else happy. It‚Äôs funny to think how I used to be so social and eager to meet people and now I recoil from the idea. Ironically while at the same time yearning for SOMEONE who I can talk to and share interests with.

5433,yeigwa,lilsucculent_,"Hi, I (20f) never had a romantic relationship in my life. I feel like that should be pretty normal, but everyone around me has had at least a relationship/situationship by the time they were my age. 

All of my friends have already had either a bf or a gf. Both of my brothers were in a relationship at my age. One of them had 2 gfs (at different times), and both of those relationships lasted at least a year and a half (plus the dating stage). My other brother has had a gf for 5 years (plus the dating stage).

Meanwhile, I had my first kiss last year right before turning 19 because no one ever had wanted to kiss me before. He was a cute guy and that kinda gave me a confidence boost. He ghosted me afterwards, which I don't rlly mind cause a kiss doesn't mean anything serious (tho, if I'm being honest, I was a little heartbroken because I wanted it to be more).

Over the course of this past year I kissed a 2 other guys, but none of them really attracted me. I now realize only kissed the first guy after my first kiss because he gave me the attention I felt I needed (he flirted with me a lot, gave me lots of compliments, etc, which I'm not used to).

The thing is, I've never really been flirted with a lot, or (as I said before) I normally don't receive lots of compliments. People always comment on how they don't understand how I (who according to them is nice personality and looks-wise) haven't got a bf yet.

Anyways, I'm really frustrated, I really want a bf and don't know what to do anymore cause I feel like shit. I just want to give up. Sorry for the vent, and if anyone's interested in getting more context I'm open to DMs (or whatever they are called here) or questions.

I've recently loss motivation to work out consistently and turned one night into just drinking and meditating in sorrow. Having been cheated one twice in my life so far so I've hit a bump on my journey and the fall from grace as I like to put it has been real tough on me and has put me through a lot of dread for night on end to this night.I know i need to just move on and put it all behind me as life is just extra from the point that i swore to myself once I had started self improvement but her memory still lives in my head to this day that no therapist/counsellor/or psychiatrist has yet to help me with.I still seem to also see her in my dreams and remember her face and touch as if it were just yesterday.I know the true answer to fix it is within yet i feel so lost from finding that answer.I do miss her every now and then but its put me in a new ditch that seems to get worse and worse with over time and i just would like a piece of advice to help fix this and to fix my vices once and for all.Lately ive also turned a bit into smoking my old cigarettes and ive stopped working out consistently because the thought of also remembering that she just slept with another guy still lives like a ghost in my mind.I also spend most of the day staring at walls and imagining all sorts of what if situations,though,they are the root of causing me to do nothing all day after work.I also spied on her socials for a bit and it just made me terribly sad a lot lately to see her be so happy and carefree.She turned out to be healthy in the end though i have yet to let her go.This is the second time to happen to me for the second year as it happens around the time of my birthday because she cheated on me on my birthday so it also haunts me alot as well around these days and this month especially.Basically all in all,i live my life for the past month in a cold,quiet,and lonely demeanour just imagining all the things that could have happened to me self and thinking about it especially in the night and early mornings.I wake up non-stop where i could have gone wrong the 3 years that I dated her as I daydream about of seeing her near me or even her sense on my skin.I honestly am a workaholic and I have a strong passion for weightlifting so im supposed to become strong enough to strug her off as nothing.I find it very hard to make friends or even interact with any other person honestly because of my childhood being burned away on something so serious and important that I used to live in constant depression and anxiety over her.I must stop myself from looking at pictures of her online,but,i just cant stop reminding myself of her touch and smile that I always look at her insta pics online and her happiness and smiles just continue to break my heart even more.I am here to sincerely ask for help from anyone here online as only work,cigarettes,and an unhonest night of beer and whiskey is the only way i can eeven feel normal or okay for once even acknowledging my time and each breath on this earth.

Even with online friends I‚Äôve made in the past and now, I run away at the thought of voice calls or anything past texting. When I had irl friends in my freshman year of college, I worried at the thought of hanging out like friends normally do. Idk if it‚Äôs just me being nervous, but it legit happens with everybody outside of my baby siblings and mom.

I feel like im a person who is not built to have friends. Rather I am meant to be alone friendship wise forever. Maybe I just haven‚Äôt found the right person where it‚Äôll all just click, but for now, Imma just leave it up to having faith and keep on hoping for the best.",2022-10-27 05:23:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642386614,5,/r/lonely/comments/yejfvf/struggling_to_connect/,,0,5,Struggling to connect
5448,yejibm,[deleted],"I am a naturally high emotion person and a constant in my life has been that whenever I showed it, whether it be distress, excitement, depression, happiness.. there was always someone in my life to shut it down. To invalidate and make fun of me. Whether it was my family, ""friends"", or other adults I looked to for guidance.. I have always been shunned.

Eventually I developed the defense mechanism of having no emotions, being the ""chill"" person that didnt bother anyone and that no one can bother. Narrator: ""But it did bother him.."" and many times ive exploded with all those pent up feelings. This alone caused me years of mental issues.

Now here I am at 25 and I feel like I cracked the code. Idk what I did to make everyone hate me when I was young but now it seems like people are much kinder and I should let myself be vulnerable again.

5451,yek0ew,Electronic-Dig-7295,"In two weeks I turn 23 and I wanted to do something special since I've never been able to celebrate it, and I've realized that I have hardly any people to invite. When I was a teenager I lived in a coastal town, and I had a group of 6/7 friends who at that time we were like a family, although they always got along better with each other (they knew each other since they were very young) than with me.... Sometimes it even seemed like I was left over. They all had big surprise parties, many of them organized by me because I was excited to do something special for them. But no one ever did anything for me, knowing that I was dying to have such a special day. Even my boyfriend at the time (who was from the group of friends, and with whom I spent 3 years and the first years of college) knew I was looking forward to it but never did anything special for me.... 

It's been a year and a half since I finished my degree and from the university I only keep in touch with a good friend, and from the student apartments, with two people. Now I am back in the coastal town where I spent my adolescence for work, but of my old friends there is no one here anymore and even if they are close they never have time to see me. It is a very touristy town but, except for the summer, the rest of the year it is empty. I had a very cool group of friends older than me, with whom we went out for beers and planned concerts and metal festivals, but I'm not going with them anymore because it turned out that one of them wanted to sleep with me and his girlfriend, when she found out, blamed me for many things and we had a big fight (even without me having done anything).

Now I see myself at 23 years old, without feeling that I have ever had a group of real friends, nor a partner who has really valued me at all, and I feel very lonely. I try on weekends to go back to the city to do interesting things, go to museums, etc. because in this town there is nothing, but I feel very disconnected from everything, and unfortunately the current situation forces me in a way to stay here for a couple of years...

5452,yek37a,Nateco1221,"Its interesting how similar the feeling of not fitting in feels now compared to the my first day at school or kindergarden.

At least back then it was a pretty normal and common feeling among the children. But everyone else got the hang of it after a while. They began to form small groups and made things work.

Fast forward a couple of years and my classmates were already comfortable with the social interaction dynamics, many were already having their first dates and romantic relationships. Me? I was doing the best I could to try to fit in, but failing time after time. 

What about now? did I finally get the hang of it? Sort of. I should have gone to acting school, because it takes some acting skills to be able to fit in. This worked for a while. 

Unfortunately the pandemic came and forced us all to stay home. It totally destroyed the little bit of progress I achieved all these years.

Sorry that I was born to two shitty abusive parents that made sure to destroy my self esteem and soul every day of my life. I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was born. 

My father abandoned me at 13 and threw me and my mother out of his house. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in 7 years. Apparently he told his family I stole money from him. What money was there to steal?

this is getting tiring, cause really, all I want is human connection. all I want is someone to talk to, just one person to be friends with. I grew up my entire life alone, no friends and no family. when I was younger, I had like 1 or two friends. I thought I was a friendless loser back then.

I never asked for much, I didn't want friends as I felt that would take time away from her, I have no family for her to worry about, my life revolved around her and her alone and that wasn't enough, I WASNT FUCKING ENOUGH

Now I don't have any friends in real life. I don't know what I am doing but I don't see people as I used to before covid. If someone is mean or just isn't good I would avoid them. Well, the sad thing is most of the people I meet would end up making fun of me for something. They always find something. Even at the new places I go, I think I would find better people but that doesn't happen either.

Now the place I live people around me have basically known each other for half of their life, It's hard talking to them when all they are talking about is the fun they had in the past or some other shit I am not interested in.  I have 3 friends I guess? all of them are not that close to me. Known each of those for like 4 months. 

why is it so hard to make friends? At the same time, I miss all those people whom I have known before. Everyone my age is just mean to me because I am not as smart as them or as talkative as them. They never talk to me and then complain that I don't talk too much. No one really is just out there being good.

5520,yewc6n,No-Salt-2250,"Hello there, I just found out that this sub exists. I am a young medstudent who had a lonely life until recently when I entered university. Since I was a child i was trapped in a social bubble in my school, but when I entered university I noticed that the people around me were happy (at least I think so) and were enjoying life in a way I have never seen before. This made me realize that I never really enjoyed the concept of being alive since i was using all my time to study instead of enjoying it , and now because of that i don¬¥t know how to interact with people. I was used to being alone but recently i think i started liking this girl (she is a fellow student) that has been by my side since the beginning of university, but she has a ""boyfriend"" (member of my group of friends) and I have felt even more lonely since i realized i liked her and I feel like crap lately because of that.

5522,yewwah,o_0dk-frlsyall314,"I'm a self isolator. Like 50/50. Half self and half involuntary. Undiagnosed AvPD. Depression, anxiety, self esteem, blah blah blah. Anyway, I haven't been in a relationship in almost 5yrs, haven't had sex in almost 4yrs. Told myself I'm done with relationships. I've been lied to, cheated on, left/abandoned, manipulated, abused (mentally, emotionally, physically). I always have to be the bigger person, always the bad guy, always compromising my spirit into oblivion. Sacrifice after sacrifice after sacrifice and I always end up alone. Told myself that if I'm supposed to be alone, I'll stop fighting it. Permanently single. 

Single, after my relationships at least, is fun. It's freedom. It's being myself 24/7. It's living by my rules, moving on my time, occupying my own space. It's not caring about how I look (to an extent). It's saying whatever I want to whoever I want regardless of if I think I have a chance with her. I don't care. No shackles. No performing. Living my life. No one to answer to, nolonger the emergency contact for someone else's feelings and esteem. I'm not a prize by any means. I say that so you know I'm not bragging when I say there are people mad at me. Friends and potential partners. Mad because I gave up, and mad because they want what others threw away. Far from the best at most things, but I know what I bring to the table. 

The conflict started a few minutes ago. I'm permanently single-not trying-not looking. Touch is my strongest love language. I'm a cuddler. Cuddle monster. Miss that dearly. No touch. Touch bad. Sharing is my second though. I miss intimacy, having a strong bond and connection. I miss meaningful conversation. I miss random and whimsical conversation. Miss having someone who'll indulge me, or engage with me in philosophical/abstract/fantasy hoopla. Miss learning someone. Having someone care about my passions. Miss holding someone while talking about our Hope's and dreams and fears and loves. See how ""holding"" crept it's way in there? No touch!

So somehow (I say somehow because I don't remember how it started. I was on cruise control), I ended up searching reddit for long distance/no contact/purely online relationships. Something that's purely mental and emotional. I started typing a post, dreading the thought of having to ""weed"" anyone out if I got a lot of DMs. Or any. Then I thought ""what's the criteria for weeding someone out? Well, what if I'm not attracted to them? Why should that matter? What if it turns into true love? What if I meet a soulmate? What if they want to be with me just as bad? Would I be foolish enough to turn that down? Because of my principles and hurt feelings? Wait, am I really done with relationships?""

I deleted the post, and I've just been sitting here. Very perplexed. And confused. And annoyed. Throw a bit of despair in there too. I've either been lying to myself, or I'm about to betray myself. I can't take another disastrous relationship. 

Not looking for DMs, but it's ok to ask. I don't care.",2022-10-27 16:46:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607098897,3,/r/lonely/comments/yewwah/conflicted/,,0,9,Conflicted

5524,yex5fk,SoIveGotRedditNow,"I really needed to open up about this because it's getting really bad.

For as long as I can remember, I've felt alone. And I guess I prefered it. But I'm starting to question why it's always been like that.

I was talking to this boy I really like. Apart from him and my twin sister, I don't really socialize that much with other people. He was talking to me and he asked me if I don't get lonely being by myself. And you know what I said?

I'm alone most of the time because I feel more lonely around other people than when I'm by myself.

And I don't know why. I don't know why I can't be happy being around people. I don't know why I feel worse socializing than if I was just alone. And I don't know why it feels like I've met my people. Like, I still don't have any real friends not have I found anyone I really connect with.

And when I do, it feels like that person slips away. 

I had this guy I was talking to on Reddit, and I like him, but after a while we didn't really talk anymore. I tried to reach out to him, but I guess he's already forgotten about me.

Same with the previous guy I was talking about. One day he came up and just started talking to me, and it's felt like he was interested in talking to me. Not just because he didn't have anything better to do. But now it feels like he's ignoring me. I see him talk to other people and for some reason, I feel left out. Yes, I have a crush on him, but I just wanted a friend or some kind of relationship with someone I actually like talking to, someone I feel connected with, rather than feeling like he's not that interested in talking to me, even as a friend.

I'll text family here and there, but other than that, he's all I've got, other than my cat. Even before we moved and got married, I didn't have anyone. I graduated with one friend, and it was him. The one toxic friend I had before him cut me off because I began dating him, and she was my friend from the 8th grade, almost up until high school graduation. 

I was alone as a kid too. Didn't have friends, I got ostracized at school. Too quiet, too awkward and too poor to change any of that. 

When I got married, I had no bridesmaids. We had a rushed, barely planned and quickly put together church wedding. We needed at least one bridesmaid, and it ended up being my husband's sister. I didn't invite anyone that wasn't family because there was no one to invite. My mother-in-law asked me if there was anyone I wanted to invite, any friends to invite, and I just had to flat out tell her, ""No."" 

We moved to an area four hours away from where we grew up at. We've been here almost 3 years and I've made a total of zero friends. I haven't really tried, mainly because I'm an empty shell of a person and it wouldn't be worth it. I'd bore people, scare them off. I'm becoming more and more agoraphobic and more and more anxious when it comes to talking to people and being around others.

I got into grad school for cybersecurity, got a good starting job/raise in January, great friends, etc. 

I seem to have it all‚Ä¶

But when it comes to dating and women, at least for me, it‚Äôs impossible.

I‚Äôve stopped settling for what I‚Äôm not 100% interested in anymore which is good. I want to make sure the woman I‚Äôm with is someone I‚Äôll be proud to show around, spoil, and create a family with. 

But now it seems, I‚Äôm getting nothing, I turn down almost everyone, as so far not many people have done it for me.

And the people I finally grabbed myself by the balls and approached, they either ghosted me or weren‚Äôt interested after a few days.

I don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm doing wrong. 

I‚Äôve always been told I should model, I‚Äôm attractive, etc., I have a good job (one that I‚Äôm proud of), make good money, kind, compassionate, fit, empathetic, and so on. 

And I don‚Äôt care about that. I don‚Äôt need a person, but hell I want one.

It seems like everyone around me is getting lucky, but I‚Äôm still here, alone, and all I got is my education and money. 

I‚Äôm still not attractive for the people I truly want. Or to really anyone anymore. 

I‚Äôm tired of being so damn lonely. I try my best to be the best I can, self-improvement every damn day, but when it comes to finding my person, I can‚Äôt catch a break. 

I‚Äôve done it all: went to college, going to grad school, have a great job w benefits, will have a long and prosperous career, but I still can‚Äôt find a person I truly want.

5545,yf0ejt,2Mac2Pac,"I'm not sure how I should phrase the title since my issue is much more complex than that

Having ASD, I always have trouble socializing with other people and thus rarely made any personal connection with anyone, I habituate myself to keeping things to myself. I can mostly get by living on my own and I honestly don't really feel it is something so torturous or humiliating as many neurotypicals would have led to believe.

However, I do crave human connection so I try my best still to socialize, and I'm doing much more since I started university to make up for the fact that I never really had friends in highchool. But the thing I notice is that I'm always better off if I'm just not involved at all since doing so exposes the fact that I'm weak and pathetic.

I take teases with an awkward laugh and don't really push back to establish boundaries since I'm afraid that I might be overreacting if I do so, which could possibly lead to me being seen being the easy target for disrespect. I often force myself in social situations even when I'm not feeling it because I don't wanna miss out on anything but at the same time don't contribute anything valuable either than making the crowd look full (but surprise surprise I ended up still missing a lot anyway). I don't really add much of my own opinion to conversation, just playing it safe and support other people's point, but on a rare occasion, I actually do it's always somehow inappropriate.

Overall, it just feels like I'm trying my best to be an NPC, a one that's not consistent to add to that. For some reason I just always feel people are bothered or irritated interacting with me but they don't know why.

There are a couple of guys that I know that are loners like me: weebs, nerds, and all that. But I feel they are more dignified. They aren't desperate to miss out but are perfectly content with just doing whatever they want. Still, people will approach them anyway and they usually have a fine time with small talks. I try so hard to be part of it but I might as well be invisible but here they are. On the social hierachy, it appears that I'm lower than them.

But the point is, at least they have a spine. They have a solid grasp on their identity and feel that they can do whatever they want without having to bend the whim of socializing, and they're totally fine with that. How could I be like that? How could I at least have the strength to be content with myself?",2022-10-27 19:06:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660038863,2,/r/lonely/comments/yf0ejt/how_do_i_become_stronger_mentally_and_less/,,0,1,"How do I become stronger mentally and less pathetic, even if I'm a loner?"

they always have an excuse as to why they can't see me, but see friends at the same date and time i suggested. but of course they have an excuse for this too. i would pay for events to go with them, only for them to cancel last minute. 

when they do let me come with them i feel parasitic, like i'm dead weight, just ruining their fun. no matter how good of a friend i was, it didn't matter. 

today, after a particularly bad day, and after being cancelled on again, i snapped. i decided i wouldn't waste more time on them if they really didn't want me around. told them i wasn't stupid, i could tell they were lying. they just said ""ok"" and left me. they've blocked me on social media, and i'm afraid they might have had a legitimate reason for not being able to see me and i lost my temper at them for nothing.

When I started second year, I lived in a shitty house with a mould problem and housemates who I didn‚Äôt know and weren‚Äôt very friendly. I started to feel really lonely and depressed and stopped performing daily tasks, including uni work. I also ghosted all my friends and rarely talked to anyone. The pandemic was the final straw.

I ended a relationship that was the fault of both of us.  I was drinking and doing weed a lot at the time.  I like video games, I started GTA V rp, it was good to stop drinking so much.  There I met someone who later became my very good friend in real life, that was 1 year ago.  We spent New Year's Eve together and smoked a lot of weed, laughed at everything, talked about everything.  He was my only and best friend.  I lost everyone around me because of my ex-girlfriend, so it was very nice to finally have someone in my life again, it was almost my brother, we talked for tens of hours every day on discord.  But in the summer, unfortunately, he lost his battle with cancer and died.  My grandpa died a week later.  I feel like there's no one left in my life, I'm lonely, I'm starting to feel again that alcohol and weed could help, but I know it's not a good way.  I don't know what to do with myself.

I thought someone wanted me for the first time in my life but after a month of talking, he ghosted me for a week. Then he sends a tiktok of a slide of cat pics, with a silly joke and the last slide said come back to me or else. I had to get out of him that he wants love and sex but no relationship aka he only wants to use me. That hurts a lot and I feel played. Like if I didn't get attached so quicky, if I wasnt so attention starved, if I wasnt so naive and hopeful, I would've realized that Iwas beimg used. 

2. I keep thinking about how ugly I am. I keep thinking about if I was pretty, my life would be better. Pretty people always get what the want. They have better lives. My coworkers that I'm close with are always getting hit on. A male and female. No one has ever hit on me. They can literally get whatever person they want if they choose to.

Long story short I'm with my children's dad because of the kids. He makes it possible for me to stay home wi6h them rather than working a full time job to pay for day care.

5611,yf8pog,superIUG,"Hey everybody. 

To make this really clear, I'm a french gay dude. And if there's some other gay dudes reading this you might know what I'm about to say.

I'm in university, and some days ago I met an argentinean student. We share tastes in music, our fav band is Radiohead, we share the same takes, saying that Amnesiac is somewhat as enjoyable if not better than Kid A (maybe RH fans will get it). We became very good friends in less than an hour : that guy is very chill, good-hearted, really cute, and overall seem to be a very good person.

Yesterday I invited him to a university Halloween night. (I'm writing this as I just got back home frim said party.)
He accepted to come with me very quickly. 

When he was at my place so I could do some make up I offered him to play with my guitar and he played some Radiohead songs while I was making a bloodt bullethole on my forehead.
And thats it, I'm completely in love with this guy. It's just impossible to describe it. Can't stop thinking about it.

Thing is : No idea if he's gay or straight and I don't want to ruin a potential friendship by asking him out. It saddens me to a point where I'm just depressed cause my heart has been torn apart many many times and I will barely go through another heartbreak. 

It's basically a all or nothing situation. 

My friends told me he really shines that gay energy, and I can somewhat say they are not that wrong.
But I don't know.
Maybe he's just like that.

I'm happy cause I'm in love but very depressed at the same time.

5668,yffhjz,PLSKIPME," I don't know how to start this. I just became 18. When I was young I remember that I was very ""friendly"" and had a lot of empathy and love to offer. But all of that was faced by family abuse at home and bullying at school. Bullying was making fun of me in general and sometimes it got physical. No one actually cared. ""True friends"" like what I saw on tv shows such as Gravity Falls and many other shows in the same genre where there is no bullying and they are good emotional support was a dream. Comparing myself back then and now. I changed a lot. I used to try to appease my bullies now the first thing I do after getting bullied is think of how can I ruin his life not like murder or anything illegal but more like what can I do that won't get me in trouble but will also hurt them very much and they won't be able to do anything about it. I think there is a subreddit about revenge. It is something like that. nothing illegal but still hurt others and I wouldn't care about how much will it hurt them and I see them as ""enemies"" if that makes sense. I used to try to avoid those who will bully me now I am standing u for myself so I can count them as ""enemies"". I used to feel bad for others now it makes me kind of happy if I don't like them. I used to get abused by my parents but time passed and I kept the hatred in me for years even thought the beating stopped and I am planning to leave them now while their marriage is falling apart and I don't feel a thing. I used to fantasize about being in a relationship with someone. Now when I think of what would it be like to share my life with someone else I laugh. I just don't care about it. I don't know where my life is going but I know that I just don't care about anything or anyone else, anyone except myself. From reading only these few lines you may think that I am suicidal and hate myself but it's quiet the opposite. Only not in a healthy way. I know that I am basically an asshole with a backup story to justify it. In my whole life I only opened up to one stranger at the internet who opened up to me first, and I did not say anything very personal. They told me that They are suicidal and I said I also was at one time very suicidal and actually tried it. That's all I said and yet I still cringe at it to this day. I don't wanna be seen as a ""poor little victim"". This is why I will never try to justify myself by bad past. This is not a tv show where you get to see some flashbacks of the bad guy everyone hates in order to feel a little sorry for before he dies. I know I am a not very good person but I don't feel like I should change. does that make any sense. I am not a psychopath who enjoys to hurt people. I only like to see those who tries to hurt me get hurt but I never ever liked watching someone who I don't know or haven't bothered me having it bad in their lives.",2022-10-28 05:44:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/yffhjz/i_became_someone_else/,,0,1,I Became Someone Else

will this information bring me any peace? maybe getting to know the fact that he found someone new will finally enable me to move on. maybe I'm still holding on just because of that hope that he misses me too and maybe in future I'll get the chance to meet him again.

5707,yfk3qo,Itsa_MeJeff,"(M 22)For the past 15 months I have been gradually getting more lonely and lonely, and it is seemingly ever growing. I had a best friend idk if we are still best friends anymore, but we were definitely best friends and we did everything together, we got interested in a new tcg hobby where we met a group of people who we clicked with straight away, this group and us 2 were spending a heap of time together, until I got food poisoning and missed a night, and idk what happened from here, but there were 5 of us and 2 of the 5 were a couple. And they started spending time as a 4 and not regularly inviting me, I figured it was because my humor style and general demeanor was impacting the Female in the 5, and I want to preface this by saying it was not anything bad, we are still friends I am just extremely goofy, a little over the top and have very direct humor so I can be a lot to handle and I know that.

So this friend group + 1 other bloke decided to travel for the nationals of the tcg we played but we decided to spend an extra 3 days there for fun and a little holiday, during the first day we all went out for lunch and did miscellaneous activities that everyone wanted to do, I say everyone, I wasn't interested much however I still did it, I was excited to go to Movie world a warner brothers themed theme park and the casino, I had only ever been when I was young and didn't get to really experience it the way I wanted and this was a perfect time as any to spend it with my best friends, so we play our tournament and then we have 2 spare days, but apparently what I want to do is ""too much"" and ""they don't want to do it"", I think this was the moment it started sinking in for me that I wasn't appreciated as much as other members, I ended up going to the casino alone that night, drinking by myself and gambling by myself while everyone stayed at the hotel, or so I thought, they ended up going to a arcade bar, and didn't invite me because they knew I wanted to go to the casino. Anyway the next day I was practically pleading for someone to come to the theme park with me, and I didn't want to go alone, and yet it fell on deaf ears and we ended up going bowling instead.

After this shit went down that I wasn't there for and pretty much the group got broken up and legitimately I'm the only who speaks to all members anymore, so it was fine for a while, but over the last 6 months I've been fading away again, all of them have partners now so I can attribute it a lot to that, and it's fine, it's just that whenever I try to initiate anything anymore it's always no, I tried to start a DnD group that keeps getting cancelled last minute and when I try to reschedule everyone seems disinterested, I try to get upwards of 15 of my closest friends to each individually come to concerts/ gigs with me and all requests are met with nothing, I have gone to 6 shows in the last 5 weeks by myself, alone, 2 of which were to my favourite band, and people know they're my favourite band. It just seems like everyone knows what I want, and actively try to avoid it.

As for my best friend, about 2 weeks ago, I asked him to come to my show, and he literally said. ""I just don't want to, I'd literally rather do anything else stay home with GF, go to \*local card store\*, cook dinner"". And it really bothered me (this was to my the 1st of my favourite bands shows). 2 days later I asked if we could do some deck testing, we played one game, I lost and made a comment about bricking and wondering what I could do to fix it, and he got pissed and then decided to put some music on, which made me angry so I spite paused the music and he got up went to his room and called me the ""saddest c\*\*t alive"" (we are aussie so apologies for the use of the c word). Which isn't entirely false, as my Nan passed away about 5 months ago, and I haven't really dealt with the grief sort of just bottled it up, and this pretty much tipped me, I spent the whole weekend bundled and crying, he asked me on the Monday if everything was all good and if I wanted to talk about it, I said I didn't because I thought to myself its just the grief and I can deal with it myself, he pressed me about talking about it repeatedly calling me a coward, I decided when I got home from work to play some valorant with another friend, he asked to join and I said I just want to duo with them, and he what I assumed was jokingly said ""don't ever call me your friend again, we are just 2 people who live with each other"" We have not spoken since then, and I've now realised I am depressed but I've also realised he's just a shit bloke, not once has he apologised for the way he's behaved, he repeatedly puts me second, and when in company of others he takes advantage of my tough skin for comedic purposes, he never once asked me how I was doing after my nan passed, and he knew how close her and I were.

It just seems like I've lost everything recently, my Nan, my best friend, most of my friends, I've gained nothing, and am just growing increasingly lonely. And I seriously do not know what to do.

EDIT: I should mention its my birthday in 13 days and I haven't even heard anyone bring it up, I'm not sure if no one knows or just that they don't care, one of my friends who I was planning on asking to spend some time with I've found out is going away to queensland which is pretty cool i suppose.",2022-10-28 10:07:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621646421,0,/r/lonely/comments/yfk3qo/nobodies_first_choice/,,0,1,Nobodies first choice

I am going in depression day after day. I don't know why, I don't know how. I just hate it, I hate myself now. It is bothering me so much. I have very few limited friends but I really don't know if I can share it with them. Or will they understand me, even a little. 

Thankfully I have a very good boyfriend. Who is helping me fight this state of mind. But I dont know how long can he keep it together. My bad stage of life is effecting him as well. I just don't want to see him miserable because of me and I don't want to leave him either. 

My classes are messing up, I am lacking behind, I am unable to focus, I don't know what to do. I am tired of faking it that it's all good. When it is not. I feel like I am burden on my boyfriend. To make it even worse, I am getting addicted to porn as it releases high Domaine which makes me feel good. But that is NOT HEALTHY at all. 

Can someone talk to me, can you help me by just listening or letting me something good. i will be great full for each one of you!",2022-10-28 10:51:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658609146,7,/r/lonely/comments/yfkw9y/f24please_anyone_talk_to_me/,,0,12,(F24)please anyone talk to me!!!

Living my life like a routine, wake up work sleep repeat.. feeling tired of this bs, little me thought that my adult life would be exciting, but.. there's nothing that great here..
No love, I'm not that appealing, not that out-going because I'm very shy and withdrawn.. I am better talking through screen via text but not in person..
And I can't say about my problems to anyone.. even my family.. they won't do much than basic ""Just stop thinking negative and you'll be fine"", so I have to wear mask of happiness in public and then breakdown coming home..

5716,yflc7k,astralrealm444,"(18f) and I live in England for any confusion about schools and stuff lol

When I was in school (I‚Äôm in college rn) I had a lovely and amazing group of friends. Although I still consider them my closest friends, I rarely (few times a year) see them due to distance and most of us being very introverted (we stuck together in school, didn‚Äôt really talk to anyone else apart from a few people who left).

This was around 2/3 years ago. I‚Äôm now in my last year of school (college for us) with about 5 or less months left and I only go in twice a week. I don‚Äôt have any friends I see and I haven‚Äôt for a long time. I‚Äôve started to believe that it‚Äôs just impossible for me to make friends now. Lots of people call me nice and attractive/pretty but I‚Äôm nd and was bullied a lot of my life so that definitely brings me down. No one ever wants to or try‚Äôs to be friends with me and when they do I realise they hate me after only a month or so. I have a boyfriend but it‚Äôs exhausting not having any friends to talk to, or to hang out with. I unironically have only hanged out with my bf and my mum for the past 2/3 years. My bf doesn‚Äôt take me out or anything (he‚Äôs lovely tho) and It gets so lonely just doing nothing at all. I feel utterly unloveable and as if I can‚Äôt connect with others anymore

I‚Äôm not going to university (I‚Äôm doing an apprenticeship instead) so I don‚Äôt think there is any chance of me making a friend group. Just feel so lonely and as if I‚Äôve missed out on the teenage experience. I‚Äôve never been to a party, never been out drinking or even to eat with friends.

This year as I sat and wondered who I would invite, I realized there was no one I could invite. I realized that I‚Äôm alone. I am watching as my sister gets ready for her ten friends to come over tonight; setting up balloons, all kinds of halloween themed decor, little gifts for her friends, pumpkin carving station, halloween cookie decoration station, all kinds of snacks, getting the couch ready for a comfy spooky movie night, etc. I‚Äôm just so sad and so jealous. I wish I could have what she has. So I am going to be sitting in my room tonight alone, listening to the fun of her party. It just sucks to be the ugly weird older sister. I wish things were different. I live in a smaller town and go to college here too so there‚Äôs really been no opportunities for me to make friends because everyone kind of already knows each other.

As many people here, I've had my share struggle with mental health issues, social anxiety, ADHD, trauma and severe depression amongst others. All of that may be ok if it wasn't for the existential loneliness that accompanied it. We humans have evolved in a social setting, and our corporation in large numbers may have been the contributing factor that made us so common in the first place, hence making me more likely to find myself at this point in human history and culture - following our spread across the planet and the exponential population growth that came after the industrial revolution. This is a fact I am very thankful for. In the deep history of life in this universe, I still seem to care about the far future more than my personal life &amp; existence. Perhaps that is a defence mechanism, an escape from my personal life. Or maybe it's my way of (rather sillily) trying unconsciously to attract the reader's attention while losing it üòÖ

This is not my point. What is my point?

My point is that finding a point seems like an endeavor which I wouldn't like to pursue at the moment. And perhaps loneliness will continue, for now, until the day in which I return to the state of non-existence from which I came to be, before mom decided to have me (against her psychologist's advice). Well, it's a fact now, I am here writing this sentence. 

As the world continues on its trajectory out there in space, what are these electronic patterns duplicated across screens of similar creatures on the planet in which life evolved? All you see are shadows of something you presume is a writing, conscious human being due to its relative coherence. Yet, on second thought, perhaps this sentence was in fact written by an artificial neural network, in which case I don't exist as a living, feeling human, but as a shadow of a GPT-3 network that's misleading you into making a part of my non-existent emotions your own, in a somewhat analogous manner to the way a bumblebee orchid imitates the appearance of an individual from that species. 

Soooo... Our conclusion?

Can I find someone to talk to before my ADHD brain goes crazy, causing me to see my personal identity disintegrate before my eyes again? 

There, I'm sending this message into the world where it will be kept perhaps for centuries and centuries, bothering no one for that matter, perhaps, while disappearing within a sea of countless other messages of the sort.

5834,yg5au8,fake_friends_please,"I'll try not to beat myself up and constantly call myself a worthless piece of shit for liking her, like I usually would here. Maybe instead, I'll just talk about her.



She's super cool. Like, that's probably what you'd notice first about her. Idk that I'd call her style and vibe ""goth"" , but its something kinda close to it. Maybe post-goth could describe it? Black lipstick, dyed hair, kinda monotone voice and vibe.

She's really chill and easy to be around. Once you get to know her a little, anyways. Cuz honestly, she was so monotone that I couldn't read her at all at first, and I was constantly afraid she was pissed at me. But now it's comforting. And she does like laugh and stuff, she's not psychotic or anything.

Speaking of her laugh, it's really great. She kinda throws her head back a little when she really laughs, and its so fucking cute. Very contagious, can't help but be happy around her when she laughs. And it feels really great anytime I'm able to make her laugh like that.

She's a digital artist, which I'm ridiculously jealous of. Always wished I could draw; it seems like a super power to make your imagination reality, even if only as a static image. I haven't seen her stuff really, we don't know each other well enough for me to feel like I could ask to see it, and she hasn't shown anything to me. But from the snippets I've seen, its super cool. It looks like she cares a lot about vibrant colors, which I really appreciate. I do hope she let's me see some of her stuff someday.

She's way better at our job than me (we work together) . It has a very social component to it, and she's just so good at that part. Not like she isn't at the rest of it, but that's whatbim jealous of. I wish I could do half as good a job as she does. She seems -- idek if confident is the word for it. She's just herself, no matter who she has to talk to. I wish I could be like that.

She always has THE BEST lipstick. Shit is perfect every time, it's really nice.

I've come this far without saying it cuz it feels shallow somehow, but this wouldn't be a proper vent if I didn't mention how hot she is. It'd be gross to go into detail, probably, but suffice to say she's a knockout.

I think, if I'm interpreting things right, that she's pretty compassionate. At least towards me. Twice I've been really shaken up from anxiety around her, and both times she's said something to me. Idk, I'm probably just imagining things, but it seemed like she was kinda trying to get me out of my head. Whether that's what she was trying to do or not, it had that effect, and I really appreciated it both times. It made it so that just being around her calms me down a little, which is kinda invaluable given how stressed I can be at work.

She reminds me of a friend I once had. Really similar vibes. In fact, similar interests and even appearance.



Idk, guess that's it. I wish I could stop being pathetic for long enough to have a chance at being attractive to her. But while that is almost certainly a pipe dream, I guess I can still at least be work friends with her. Which is good. I'm glad I met her.",2022-10-29 00:36:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603483175,1,/r/lonely/comments/yg5au8/venting_bout_a_crush/,,0,0,Venting 'bout a crush

5875,ygax6b,4eyeskitty," Hey everyone, I am single, no kids (don't plan on having any). I am blessed to have good family members arounds, btu I don't have any close friends who I can hang out with. In my case, I do a good job of making friends but maintaining them is another story.  Most people seem to genuinely enjoy talking to me and usually don't mind working with me at school, before I graduated. However the problem lies with how hard is it to maintain friendships. It's much harder to maintain friendships when you get older. I graduated from college a few months ago and all of my ex-peers have moved on with their careers and education. They're great people, it's just naturally harder to make friends when your old classmates move on with their lives. I don't think many people underestimate the complex social/emotional/financially problems what creates loneliness.  This can apply to anyone who lives in any country. If you are a marginalized group member, old, homeless, person of color, it can be very isolating and difficult to find friends who share similar values and common interests.

I'm still in my late 20s, so still young, but I am worried what's going to happen to me when I get older and many of my relatives and parents will start to die. I know that's morbid but it's something that happens to a lot of old people hence why it's important to have a social support network.  I read Fortunately I'm fairly independent and have a job and degree now, I'm very blessed and lucky.  But it's scary for individuals who lost most of their relatives and friends, little to no education and sometimes no job. Those people are even lonelier than I am.  Some individuals truly have no one close to them.  I've been reading reddit posts about individuals who live with their parents well into adult hood, but happens when they're parents die and they're left alone to fend for themselves?

5877,ygb4a7,Baluun,"To be clear, I myself am a target demo of the sub (21m with essentially no irl friends). How has this become so common among the 18-22 demographic? Typical loneliness is associated with growing old or with being a social outcast in someway (autism, mental illness, trauma, highly niche interests, noticeable physical deformities) but I bet a lot of you, myself included, don‚Äôt identify with those groups.

This isn‚Äôt to say that people in those groups ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù to be alone, that is not true. But it isn‚Äôt surprising when they end up alone due to various obvious difficulties they face.

So how do those of us not in those groups end up this alone? What is happening to cause this? If anyone is reading this, I beg you to help me answer this. It‚Äôs eating away at me, both for my own purposes and out of worry for others. 

I know for me, I was basically fine between hitting puberty (~15 years old) and graduating high school (18). Everything before that was sort of isolating, and everything after that has been severely isolating. Does anyone else relate to this pattern?

The reason I feel so desperate is that none of the common answers make sense and, of course, I really don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this.

Some common answers:

1. Changing demographics

Claim: Populations in the West are getting older. As such, young people are growing more isolated

Issue: This doesn‚Äôt apply to those enrolled in college, which is the situation I and some of you are in. Obviously, in college, you are surrounded by other 18-22s. This factor may contribute to loneliness in 23+ and those who aren‚Äôt in college, but that doesn‚Äôt apply to me.

2. Social Media

Claim: As social media becomes more prevalent, people become less dependent on irl social interactions, and fewer friendships are made.

Issue: I have social media but I barely use it. And clearly, irl friendships still happen. If anything, people with more social media seem to have more irl friends. Plus, the stereotype of zoomers being glued to their phones appears bogus to me. Many if not most seem to have mostly healthy relationships with phone usage while boomers seem unable to get away from propaganda on Facebook.

3. The Pandemic

Claim: The pandemic cut people off from irl communities and social interactions, weakening community ties and overall social skills

Issue: While some of this may be true, I doubt social skills are still suffering from lockdowns. People redevelop those skills quickly. Plus, I have pretty good social skills (and so do many of you even if you don‚Äôt believe it), but it doesn‚Äôt really seem to help some of us. Also, restrictions have mostly been lifted but it doesn‚Äôt seem as if we‚Äôve returned to pre-pandemic social levels as a whole. If anything it seems like loneliness in the 18-22 demo has continued to get worse.

4. Decline of community institutions 

Claim: The destruction of community institutions, whether intentional or not, has led to fewer instances where people naturally and regularly meet the same set of people, which allows for relationships to develop naturally.

Issue: This is a great explanation for increased loneliness in 23+ demos, but college is definitely a community institution that should be able to do this. This should not be eviscerating the social experiences of 18-22 year olds.

5. Weakness in individual life


Claim: For some reason, there is an increase in people who lack the skills/personality to form relationships. Until they find themselves, they cannot have friends/partners

Issue: For one, this isn‚Äôt quite an explanation. ‚ÄúFor some reason‚Äù is doing too much lifting. But additionally, humans are not individualistic creatures. We are social beings who are meant to grow with one another in communities, whether they be small or large. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfinding ourselves‚Äù which allows us to form meaningful relationships. It is forming and maintaining and growing meaningful relationships which allows us to find ourselves, at least for many of us (myself included).



The rest of these are going to be more specifically directed at heterosexual men who want to be in a relationship but can‚Äôt find one

6. Women have higher standards 

Claim: Women‚Äôs higher/unrealistic standards compared to ‚Äúthe past‚Äù are making it impossible for some men to find a relationship.

Issue: This is probably true, but really it should only apply to toxic men who treat women badly in some way or another. And I don‚Äôt think a significant proportion of women have unrealistic standards, at least not to a greater degree than some men do. Plus, lots of ugly people, poor people, and douchey people still find relationships.

7. ‚ÄúRed Pill‚Äù

Claim: Women are only interested in the top 20% of men. Any man can get there in theory, but most don‚Äôt have the mental fortitude to improve themselves to get there.

Issue: I mean, where do I begin? How do you even define ‚Äútop 20%?‚Äù I think the rate of ‚Äúincel‚Äù-dom among 18-22 men is probably underreported, but it isn‚Äôt 80%. At most it‚Äôs about 50% and I think it‚Äôs probably closer to 40%. And certainly not all women are that shallow. Lots of guys are ‚Äúsubjectively‚Äù charismatic to some subset of women. The red pill is mostly bullshit and largely based on evolutionary psychology, which is itself largely bullshit. I have sympathy for a lot of you who identify with red pill, but I really don‚Äôt see how it makes sense if you think about it detachedly.

8. ‚ÄúBlack pill‚Äù

Claim: Some men are genetically predetermined, by physical deformity or mental issues, to be alone.

Issue: This may be true in extreme cases, but 30-45% of men cannot be extreme cases. Plus, I actually excluded these groups of people from my population of interest earlier. So it definitely doesn‚Äôt explain my situation, nor yours if you‚Äôre in a similar boat. 


So what on Earth *is* going on? If anyone reading this has done research on this subject, please let us know what you‚Äôve found. Personally, I‚Äôm getting pretty desperate for an explanation so I can hopefully find a way out.

If I've learned one thing from here is that every single one of you are a beautiful array of stories and feelings. And the one reading this right now is a good person. I know this because you made it this for in this little mess of a text. The world is shitty, but it's ours. And without you it gets a little more lonely.

(I'm sorry if this a mess. I doubt any of you would care. I've been posting some positive things on many subreddits because I've been in a bad headspace. And since a single post got me banned from suicidewatch and depression I'm just helping others the best I can.

5884,ygbfh2,Alwaysalone117,"I'm extremely lonely. I have no freinds or family and nobody cares about me. I never had romantic success either. 

Everywhere I go people treat me like I shouldn't be around. 

I have all these weird thoughts about relationships and I don't really know how they work. But when I try to learn it makes people mad. That's also one of the reasons I chose this title cause I know some bad people and they still get relationships with ease. They have supportive family, freinds and also get sex and dates. 

A lot of the time I'm told I deserve to suffer. I get told I'm alone because I must of done something wrong. I try to look deep within myself to figure out exactly what it was I did, but can't find it. 

I know I'm super sensitive. Which isn't good. Pretty much everything makes me sad, wars make me sad, seeing a commercial with the abused animals makes me cry, seeing commercials with kids in poverty makes me cry. 

Sometimes I noticed I almost seek or embrace sadness, the world just seems like a miserable place. The media and books I consume always are dark themes. Dystopia novels like the handmaids tale to books about genocide like ordinary men. I like psychology related things in a morbid way, I for some reason enjoy criminal psychology and true crime stories. I enjoy watching police interrogations. Particularly of high profile suspects. 

The most exposure I had to relationships is what I see online since in real life I'm completely devoid of anything social or sexual. Online I read about constant cheating. Watch evil awful men get constant sex and relationships, openly cheat left and right. In real life, my bullies all get laid. Cheaters and liars and abusers get laid. 

I don't know why people associate morality with relationships and sex. I read all the time that the key to relationships is ""being a good guy"" and so on. That if you are just a genuine guy who never wants sex and has tons of hobbies and just wants platonic relationships, suddenly as a reward for his good behavior, he will get sex. 

There is guys who just go around using women, going on dates, getting them into bed, then using them and dropping them right after he gets laid and is on to the next. I just don't get how it's ""cause he's a genuinely good guy"" is the reason he gets to do that. Those guys then get to choose who they want it seems like. 

I don't know why it bothers me so much. 

I get that certain people will always have more relationships and sex. But to go my whole life with nobody... just seems so miserable. 

I'm told just being bothered by my infinite loneliness is a turn off. But I just can't tolerate forever. 

Holidays are alone, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas. No new years either. 

I have my hobbies. I like computers and IT, I like machinery, I'm into mycology, I love books, I like philosophy, one of my main hobbies is just learning new things. These things do not end loneliness. 

I have career goals too, I want to be a professional technician. I'm interested in tons of fields but mostly want to get into industrial equipment repair, installation, stuff like that. Industrial automation is cool to me. And IT seems cool to me. 

I'm not simply saying they're cool and that's it. I actively pursue these fields, mostly by taking college courses as I got a technical degree, I also set up home labs and study at home, and study for industry certs. 

That kinda stuff if I can get established into them. I could make good money and easily support a family. But it seems I'm not allowed to have a family. 

This is so crazy and sad to me. Sometimes I just really wish I wasn't alone forever. I'm really alone forever. Forever. That's a long fucking time. 

Anytime I can get my mind off it. I always at some point remember that I'll always be alone.

You have to feel some degree of comfort being alone because if you don‚Äôt you will undoubtedly be neglecting yourself.

If you do you‚Äôll be more appealing to people you eventually meet and have more chance of making new friends and having deeper close relationships.

5902,ygevag,ShiryuuNI," I know well what a panic attack feels like, I have them every now and then. But Thursday, I experienced one that just shook my whole world.

I‚Äôm a second-year college student studying animation abroad and yesterday I was in the middle of my life drawing class when I noticed something. My hands suddenly started to shake violently, the strokes I made on my paper became rigid and heavy, my mouth was dry, I felt sick like I could pass out any moment. For the next 30 minutes I experienced several of these panic attacks one after another.

I managed to pull through the class without anyone noticing anything and returned home without almost not falling due to the sheer emotional distress I was in. I was able to call my parents and just let everything out. It did me good, but I still felt extremely sick. For the next couple of hours, I questioned every choice I had made so far. 

Was it a good thing to have moved to another country? I certainly miss my home and my family. I‚Äôm never excited to go to university even when I‚Äôm having a class that‚Äôs mildly interesting. I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time at uni and that I could be using that time more wisely to work on my passion projects and try to build a career out of them. I‚Äôm surrounded by people who don‚Äôt mean much to me. I am lonely, I have no friends. I have talked to a few people here and there, but I have never met anyone who I really ‚Äúliked‚Äù and who I want to spend more time with. Everyone I talk to is just there for me to pass the time.

Sometimes, I just want to pack my stuff, say 'screw it' to my university and just move back to my home country and try something else there.

I feel lost, hopeless, alone and like my life is already over even though I‚Äôm just 19.

5903,ygfcsf,Grumpiest_Lamb,"I think I needed to type this out. For the past years, I tried to meet and find someone who would spend time with me. After years of rejection and neglect, I come to think that I'm going to be alone forever. 

Ever since I started college, I've actively tried to go out and meet somebody. I just needed some kind of companionship, to hold someone in my arms. I haven't had sex since I was 19, where I lost my virginity. I've gone on a date 3 times in the past 4 years, to which none of them went anywhere. 

Just tonight, I've been rejected and ignored by the women I've tried approaching. I've been going out to clubs, parties, meet-ups, etc. I know the reason why. I'm just not good looking. I've come to terms with that. No matter how many times my friends and family would beg to differ, I know from experience how a stranger would think of my physical appearance. 

I tried fixing my hair up, wear some nice looking clothes, I even lost tons of weight to be in shape. I don't get nervous when talking to women. I enjoyednthe conversations and always did my best to keep things interesting. But after many reactions, I've come to realize that women don't want to be with me. 

Honestly, I'm just really depressed by this. I think I have to come amd try to accept the fact that I am lonely, and that the only way I could ever get some kind of affection is by paying women. I'm writing this just to get my emotions out. 

I'm a logical person, I know that there's help out there like therapy to help cope and talk to a professional. But I don't need to spend couple hundred dollars just for some bare bones insight on my issues. I recognize it. I am treated like a bug. That's all I'll ever be treated as.

They either ghost me online or never want to see me again in person. Am i that bad? I‚Äôm starting to think that i‚Äôm the problem. I don‚Äôt know, I feel like no one wants to befriend me because of my looks. Like, I‚Äôm not ugly, but i‚Äôm not the beauty standard either. It‚Äôs like people would rather judge me based off my looks rather than getting to know me. Maybe i‚Äôm just overthinking.

I‚Äôm on the cheerleading team at my current university, and even the other girls on the team don‚Äôt want to befriend me. During welcome week, three of my teammates invited me out to parties, but they stopped inviting me and i don‚Äôt know why. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong to them. I‚Äôm starting to think they invited me to go out with them out of pity. I don‚Äôt know if i have the right to be upset by that, but i definitely felt some type of way about it for a while. Whenever i see some of my teammates in the university cafe, they‚Äôre always sitting together but never ask me if i want to join. I mean they‚Äôre not obligated to ask me to join them, but at least ask. I always end up alone in the cafe. 

My point is, i‚Äôve been extremely lonely for over a year now. It seems like i‚Äôm a social reject. Just a few days ago, I stopped putting myself out there because no one cares to be my friend so why even try anymore. I just want to know will my situation ever change? Does it get better? Because being alone like this all the time has started to take a huge toll on my mental health. I don‚Äôt know how much i can take anymore. It just hurts.",2022-10-29 12:56:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663885116,3,/r/lonely/comments/ygiyvy/im_tired/,,0,2,I‚Äôm tired

5928,ygkpvw,Present_Object_4634,"One thing about me, I‚Äôve always struggled with body image and eating habits. I struggled from as early as 7/8 years old since that was when i was first overweight. Everyone in my family at the time made me feel like i should be ashamed of how i looked because they were just ‚Äúlooking out for me‚Äù. I was a kid bruh. Anyway, time passed and i lost the baby fat by the time i had gotten into middle school, but once i lost it I was never satisfied with how i looked, and kept wanting to lose weight. I wanted to be 100lbs in 8th and 9th grade specifically. However I never reached that goal, and tbh puberty kinda f‚Äôd everything up. I was gaining weight of course in chest and other places. And as a result, the sexualizing comments started. Do you know how it feels to have people make comments about your body in school, church, and even in family events?! It‚Äôs absolutely horrible. It was like people always said something about my body more than my personality. The common thing that i would always get sexualized about tho since as early as 12 was my chest. It never matched the rest of my body. this would be the common reason of why i would get sexualized and what led to sexual harassment by different guys throughout my life. In another post i‚Äôve even mentioned how i‚Äôve gotten sexually harassed for like 3 years straight unfortunately by a guy who i used to consider my friend.Currently i‚Äôve reached a point where i just can‚Äôt talk about anything body image related or hate when people compare their bodies to others. My best friend knew about the sexual harassment and eating habits, but is the same person who says i need to ‚Äúbulk‚Äù after i said the word bulk literally 1 time because i wanted to get involved in the gym.she has mentioned the bulk up comments so many times to the point i interpret that as you need to gain weight, which sucks since i have been trying my hardest to. She‚Äôs also the same one who would send me videos of women with like huge chest ( size g ) and has said ‚Äúthis is how i see you everyday‚Äù I don‚Äôt care if you view me as sensitive but that shit hurt since i already view my self in a negative way . I don‚Äôt want to be seen as sensitive to her or anything since she also has a tendency to tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that deep‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that serious‚Äù.

There are many people around you who can benefit from having you in their life but we're so focused on ourself and our feelings of aloneness to realize it.

so basically, i've been moving around schools and countries for basically the entirety of my life, and have barely been able to be with friends for more than 2 or 3 years at a time. It just sucks because I feel excluded and lonely, because I'm not able to get those really strong relationships with anyone, especially not a romantic one as well.. And every time I move, I feel myself trapped in the community  that I've been placed into, and have a difficult time adjusting, while my other friends have the best parties and time of their life, without me. I also feel a strong sense of being lost and loss of identity from this, and lack of understanding of myself, thinking if there's anything wrong with me or I'm different to other people in a bad way. Currently, I'm in a high school, just moved to this country, and my parents already know that we'll be moving back in 2 or 3 years back to the last one. It's just really hard trying to make friends while knowing that i'll leave them through our school years, and going through the entire process again in 3 years. It sucks honestly.",2022-10-29 17:53:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/ygq5hy/just_lonely/,,0,0,just lonely :(

5973,ygrz60,leptz233,"Let me preface by saying that I don't mean to invalidate the experience of women or nonbinary folk. Everyone can be lonely, and everyone can be put off by the loneliness of others. Also, I know that this is a common opinion on this and other subs. It's not an original though, but I just wanted to share my experience.

I have been dealing with horrible loneliness for more than a year now. In many ways, I have been lonely my whole life. I was isolated as a child, and never really had any close friends until high school. But things took a horrible turn when I left home for college. My relationship, which had been going well for 5 year at that point, ended in disaster. Now, I'm in my junior year of college and I haven't made a single close friend. It's all acquaintances here and there. 

I came to realize that my high school friends didn't care much about my feelings. Maybe they cared, but it truly hurt that despite them knowing I had gone through a rough break up, no one ever came to me. No one ever asked me how I was doing. One day, when I couldn't take the pain any more, I made the move to reach out to one of my friends. On the verge of tears, I told him how I was feeling and before I could even get through all my emotions, he quickly changes the subject and advices me to just move on. He was clearly uncomfortable, and it hurt knowing that he was the one person I trusted. The one person I considered my best friend, and he couldn't even let me fully express myself. Men just aren't suppose to be vulnerable around each other.

None of my friends are open about things like this. Men don't ask about each other's emotions. It's all just a joke. I don't doubt that's how it is in most guy groups. 

In college, people can read right through you. It's so obvious how lonely and sad I am, and it disgusts people. Nobody wants to be friends with the loner guy. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe it's me that doesn't put on a mask as I should. It's clear that as a man, I have to pretend like everything is okay. Maybe it's the same expectation for women, I can't speak for them. But from the outside, it feels like women always have a shoulder to cry on. It's not rare to see a woman crying with her best friend next to her saying words of comfort. But two guys doing that would be seen as gay or repulsive. Hell, a guy just crying in general causes people to avoid you like toxic waste. I should know from the many times I started crying in public.

It's troubling to see so many vulnerable men fall into the hate of incel (or whatever you want to call it) culture. I understand the pain of being a sad, lonely man. To feel unwanted. It's not shocking that more and more men are falling pray to hating women and backwards ideas about relationships and masculinity. It's very sad to see. I just wish men were more open and were taught to be emotional around one another. We should all have a shoulder to cry on from time to time.  I wish someone would realize that I'm lonely, and instead of avoiding me like the plague, they would ask to hang out with me one day.",2022-10-29 19:08:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643956041,104,/r/lonely/comments/ygrz60/people_dont_like_lonely_men/,,2,50,People don't like lonely men

5975,ygsfmx,DauntedSoul6,"I'm a 20 year old male living in the Netherlands. I've basically been lonely all my life, but as i get older, the thrist i have for love gets stronger, and it makes me feel so depressed, every day.

My life has no duality, no vibration, no color.

Everyday is the same. I wake up to head to college, i return back home, i do some writing, and sit on my desk, the whole day...

Dreaming about a life i am aware i could never even dream of.

I don't have any friends. I never did. If you consider friends you only see at college, then so well. I do have two friends in that case, other than that, none.

Everyday i see other people around my age holding hands with eachother, lovers, laughing their butts off, people having a coffee or some food together, everytime something as similair as those things catch my eye, enviousness, the depressing feeling we all feel, it all daunts me, and rushes through my whole body.

I sometimes don't understand, i mean, i am by no means a socialistic person, i'm not approachable, even though i wish i was being approached, i don't feel the need to get attention from others, yet i do feel the need of getting attention from others.

Again, i am not a talkative individual, yet i see others who plainly seem as people who's personalities are far from ""accepting"", yet they are the ones that end up in a relationship with a partner i could look at and think, ""why would they be with someone like them?""

I don't feel like i have the right to say this, maybe i am restraining myself, but what can i do?

In the current days where attractiveness does matter, i am just an unattractive person, suffering from anorexia nervosa, dealing with something that also affects your overall look called alopecia areata,

for close to four years, this alopecia disease has made myself be even more unconfident in myself, having to walk with a beanie no matter where i go, the daunting feeling of someone seeing one of the bald spots i have, on top of which the fact that my body looks utterly fragile, everytime i look at myself in the mirror, i just want to break it...

My health worsens by the day, i am just afraid of my future days. I want to recover from my eating disorder, but i just cannot seem to gain enough courage to fumble myself out of this coffin of despair.

When i see the ones that do have a significant other...

I don't care about how one might look, or sound like, i too want to be loved like those other people...

I also want to experience spending my time with someone that truly enjoys being with myself.

Watching movies together, listen to music, hug eachother, being there for eachother...

Waking up, looking at my phone to see a text from my dear telling me how much they love me that would always puts a smile on my face.

I may just be destined living this life.

I am thankful however to atleast have a household that does care about me. Yet i am seen as a outcast, as alot of my viewpoints on life has gotten so much different from what everyone else sees it like over the past few years. Making living here feel like a fifty-fifty.

Not to mention the years of parental abuse i've gone through, today it still feels like a fifty-fifty, but my relation towards my family has definitely worsened over the past few years.

If i could mention one thing i enjoy doing, it's writing. I'm an author of two books and i assume it is the only escapism i have. The only thing that cracks pure euphoria within me.

As if this euphoria tries to overcoat my depression, but as soon as i finish what i was planning on doing, i sit back on my chair i never leave, i gaze at the late noon sky as it darkens up, my demon walks up to me, holds my chin and reminds me how much of a good for nothing i am.

But what can i do about it?

Words of encouragement have been thrown at me for too many times already, it is something only i myself need to take charge of, this is making me chuckle as i am writing this sentence, but seriously, i HAVE become a demon of myself at this point.

Does luck truly exist?

Do the proclaims of people ""eventually"" getting out of their mental cage, and experiencing a better life refer to every human being?

Or is it to work towards your goal, and hope for the best?

Or could it be the ""go to the gym bro!"", ""just talk to this girl"", ""if they don't like you, they don't deserve you"", correspondences people of a higher status repeatedly tell you?

You see, life truly is not for one person only. Our bodies work differently as all our life experiences happen differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been trying to be a better reader but I really love the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.

With That I‚Äôd love to Dress up as Gandalf or Bilbo.

If I wanted to be Scary I could dress up as like a Nazg√ªl or maybe The Nazg√ªl King or the Mouth of Sauron cause in my head they seem pretty creepy.


I‚Äôd also love to Dress up as the Riddler from The Batman. The Batman is prolly my second favorite movie this year next to NOPE which is my favorite movie of 2022.


This incarnation of the Riddler and really The Batman movie itself is like the Batman movie I‚Äôve always wanted.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

I am really wanting a woman that has never had a romantic bond with another guy before, meaning no previous boyfriends or even a first love. I don't know if I will ever find that, and I may end up alone the rest of my life. I do like younger women a lot more, but I may be too old at this point.

She left me for a guy on the internet she told me threatened her and was scared for her life. She made it all up I guess. I was so worried for her and it all all fake. It was all fake. My whole family thinks im gay and I wish I was at this point because my treatment would not change at all. No one cares I lost over 100 pounds or I learned valuable skills. At the end of the day im still just an autistic pervert. Nothing happens in real life. I see at my school a 20 year old man already has a wife who attends the same school and he isn't even particularly handsome and I can't even blame it on that. I only have myself to blame for my lonliness and I cannot fix it. I watched the youtube videos on how to talk to people and it doesn't work for people like me. It doesn't work whatever I try. It's always rejection. It's always such a funny joke for everyone else when I get rejected. Such a funny joke to bring up on girls night. All of them know to stay away from me and its so funny to act like im dangerous. They tell everyone im dangerous because im not any good and I've never hurt anyone or would plan on it. It's just the same as high school everyone still thinks im going to hurt someone yet they do nothing other than laugh at me in their groups. Theres no one like me I can connect with. I want to be someone else that I haven't been before but no matter how much I change im just a different version of the same person. I quit my job and I don't have money to leave the house other than school but everyone at my new school knows what I am already. I only have one female friend and she probably doesn't like me like that. I wish I could just hangout with her I don't even need to take it further I just appreciate the friendship so much. But shes busy and goes to college everyday now. When I message her she doesn't respond sounding very interested so I don't much anymore because I don't want to bother her. I've known her since middle school and shes asked me out once in 8th grade and I said no because I was afraid of losing her as a friend and now I hate myself even more because I may have missed the best thing that could've happened to me. She also somewhat thinks im closeted, because shes asked me not ONCE but TWICE since i've known her. My best friend actually got a girlfriend that loves him. Hes a lot like me so in a way it gives me hope I can find someone that would love me too. I thought I did for awhile, and I lost my virginity to a girl I loved more than anything. But it meant nothing to her, and she broke up with me to immediately get with a guy she accused of being a rapist pedophile ON THE FUCKING INTERNET. And by immediately I mean legit less than 24 hours after she dumped me. She was talking to him about it while she was with me and it makes our intimate moments feel so naseous to me. I feel gross. And of course, I showed her to all my friends. All my family. My mom was so fucking proud of me and I had everythint I ever wanted. It was so great but she said she couldn't be with me because
1. ""You're too nice and its not comfortable because you're too good for me""
2. ""(INTERNETGUY) Is coming for me and its not a good idea to be together because he might hurt you""
3. ""I can't be in a relationship because I need to work on myself"" (then she immediately got with INTERNETGUY.
I'm having very violent thoughts, and though I wouldn't act on them, its definitely a fantasy of mine. I stalk her social media sometimes, she wants to drop out of college to go live with internetguy. I even made a fake account her tell her it was a good idea.

i'm so fucking mad about how it's looked down upon to do things by yourself as a young person. sure, i'm lonely. it sucks. yes, i know this is the time i'm supposed to be going out and meeting people and experiencing life with people my age. i wish this situation wasn't how it was, but from experience i know at this point i can't do much about it. but you know what would be more sad? if i just sat around and moped about it all the time. 

today at work i had someone straight up just be like ""do you ever do anything??"" cause i never talk about friends or most of the stuff i get up to, and that's because i know people will do the same thing if i even say i did something like go to a movie by myself on a saturday, cause that's always how it goes and instead i get a weird silence or just like a pitying look or some bullshit like that. i'm fucking sick of it. 

no, i'm not happy, but i straight up will kill myself if i decide to follow the shitty rules people seem to have surrounding this. the pity and expectation of feeling sad and sulky about it isn't compassionate, it comes off as ""if i was you i'd want to die"" cause it would literally be a death sentence for me. i know it's not the intention but for fucks sake leave people be about their problems cause it's not helping",2022-10-30 05:37:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593997528,3,/r/lonely/comments/yh5nu1/im_super_pissed_off_rn_doing_things_on_your_own/,,0,6,"i'm super pissed off rn, doing things on your own should not be seen as sad.

I left my Girlfriend of 5 years, 1 and a half years ago because of how toxic she had become. she was my best friend, women i saw marrying and spoke about building a future and family with but became toxic towards the end of the relationship. I broke and pulled the plug despite still being in love with her.

I was ok for a week and then the heartbreak and regret set in, everything feels wrong and incredibly lonely and empty. Coming home to an empty house after a long day. no one to confide in or look forward to seeing. A big Empty bed ect.

It's 1 and a half years later and this feeling never vanished. I miss what i had despite how toxic it was and honestly regret leaving.

im not sure if im still in love with them but i have no desire or attraction to any women at all and dating seems worthless.

Had a dream about my ex last light and god damn im a mess again

6115,yh6t8v,Multi_Sharp,"I can't believe I'm gonna start posting again on Reddit and onto this sub, but reading this place once in a while gives some comfort. I believe I always had a love/hate relationship with the internet. So anyways, I recently got onto antidepressants for about two weeks prescribed by my GP because I have had suicidal thoughts for about a few months, but until I got honest with a friend who told me to seek help, which I did and since then I've been feeling happier. I told some of my other friends who are sort of an established network.

But my story is that I haven't gone home in the last two years. I've been overseas doing uni and COVID circumstances made me unable to go home. Naturally that builds onto depression and loneliness, and I recently have been thinking the even years (2020 and this year have been worse) while last year in 2021 has been great where I could make more friends and enjoy life. By the end of January this year, I began working out, which was super helpful and as of now I have been getting bigger and fitter with a good diet thanks to learning how to cook well with various recipes to do.

  
I find my source of comfort is my cousin who's 6 years older than me, we talk on the phone almost every night, he uplifts me more than my parents (I'm a single child). He was the first I disclosed my mental health issues so it meant a lot to me. But he's also had a girlfriend in the last 7 months which has reduced a bit of time for us on the phone which is understandable. At the college I live in, my close friend group with other 3 guys has changed since last year, as two of them have been in a relationship--one has dated a girl for about 11 months and the other started to date another girl I know last month, luckily I'm friends with those girls and I keep a distance and respect boundaries whenever I should have. This makes me and my other gay friend the last half who aren't in a relationship, but he's become one of the heads of the university's anime society, so he's got a lot of stuff to handle and he has a lot more friends than I do.

I never really had many friends back home nor do I keep in contact with anyone from my past, I preferably keep myself private and growing older it's better to be alone. Then you have both sides urging you to start a relationship/better to be single, which I choose the latter as a conscious choice, being single is healthy and happy. I really don't see myself in a relationship for the next few years, I'm came out as bisexual after realizing I was bicurious since I kissed my best friend a few years back. I would rather see myself as a fun uncle type guy, as I'm self-aware of being a third/fifth/seventh/ninth etc. wheel which I joke about myself and that does make me feel a bit insecure at times when I see couples around, and friends getting other friends and busy makes me feel disconnected to/with them. It's like you have to put on an act, a mask when you're around and lots of social anxiety kicks in, especially this year and I don't know why. 

I have more hopes next year to prioritize myself, do things I enjoy like I did about 90% this year,   
like gymming and be a big health nut, keep reading new books like when I did read a whole book on a 2 hour train ride back and forth, listening to music, playing with Lego figures, and most importantly keeping track of my dream records on my notes because I have been doing that since 2020. Gotta stay on my meds as usual too, and I'm glad I'm feeling happier on my own. 

Hope this isn't a lot to read, but if there's any single folks out there, take care of yourselves, don't think about suicide, please do seek help and talk to someone if possible. I'm also open to anyone who wants to DM me on Reddit.",2022-10-30 06:39:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1490044216,2,/r/lonely/comments/yh6t8v/a_lonely_year/,,0,0,A lonely year

I moved to a new city back in the beginning of the year, so I transferred to the university here but I wasn‚Äôt living on campus, so I commute. I joined a club to meet some people and it seems like every time I meet someone new, we end up having a good conversation and actually relating and once it ends, we just share socials. But when I try meeting up with these people, it just seems like they‚Äôre always busy, or when I do meet with them it‚Äôs because I initiated it. And I know when your new, you kinda have to initiate stuff to meet people but it really just feels like I‚Äôm just initiating everything all the time. Like if I stopped texting these people, they‚Äôd basically just forget about me. And it just confuses me because I thought we had a good connection and actually wanted to continue to see each other but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like it since they would also initiate hanging out and such and not me always making the effort. I only truly made 2 friends that seem to actually want to meet up and text but then again, I don‚Äôt really have much of a connection with them except that they also have nobody to hang with or talk to, so that‚Äôs really why we‚Äôre all friends.

At first, it didn't bother me, but the closer we're becoming, the more of their life I get to see. And it's painful to see it. What they get to experience as a mundane part of every day is something I've been daydreaming about and crying myself to sleep to for the past 10 years. They do everything together, give support to each other and share affection - all the things I've long ago delegated to the same realm of fantasy like flying to the moon in a rocket or owning a fleet of yachts. Every time they innocently use ""we"" or ""us"", as if it were such an unremarkable and self-evident part of life, I feel a little less human than before.

I hate it. I hate what they have, I hate how it's poisoning me, I hate myself for being such a wreck who can't even be bigger than that and overlook it. It's making me distance from them for periods of time and then making up lame excuses to mask the true reason. I can't realistically tell them that their relationship bothers me, and I also can't sustain this pain long term; at the same time, I don't want to lose my friends just because I'm a failed attempt at being human.

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I‚Äôm complaining just being blunt.

6195,yhjkx5,Throwaway2755485,"I just started a masters program, and I‚Äôve been crushing on this girl who has been in a very long relationship (yes I know it‚Äôs wrong but I don‚Äôt have enough emotional maturity to stop myself). She‚Äôs from far away and her boyfriend is still where she used to live so they‚Äôre mostly long distance.

She threw a party for Halloween and her boyfriend was there because he was in the area for a brief business trip. I spoke with him briefly and he talked about how lonely he was before he met this girl. How he didn‚Äôt have any friends until he met her and how much she has changed his life for the better. How he wouldn‚Äôt be here without her. He also spoke briefly about when he wants to propose to her.

This hurt me. I have jealousy issues enough as it is but what hurt me more is that I saw a lot of myself in him. I had no friends through high school and college. I would live alone and sit alone when I ate lunch or dinner. I have an abusive father back home so I try to stay wherever I end up for as long as I can. During the height of covid I would often go weeks without opening my mouth to speak to anyone. I‚Äôve never had a relationship; I often fantasize more about holding hands than anything sexual because I‚Äôve been so starved for love in my life.

This man is what I would have been like if I had my life together and didn‚Äôt have a mental illness (anxiety). In reverse, I am what he would be if he never met his true love. I was completely alone until I bumped into this girl at my grad program; just like him, she‚Äôs the only reason I have a social life now. In fact I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we have gotten so close because I am similar to him. My attraction is built on me being a platonic substitute for her boyfriend. That fact makes me extremely upset. 

Should I cut this girl out of my life? The rational answer is yes, but as I said at the top I can‚Äôt seem to stop myself. The boyfriend is leaving back home today, so things will go back to the way things were before he visited. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever going to leave my head that he is everything I could have been and everything I‚Äôve wanted so badly. I am not asking for solutions; I‚Äôve dug my grave and I am more than happy to lie in it.

I've tried talking to people, putting myself out there, and nothing ever sticks.The most I've gotten are acquaintances who text me and tell me all about their lives but never ask me anything or invite me to anything. What really made me want to give up was when every time I would invite someone to something or propose a hang-out idea they would say yes and we'd set a date and everything, only for nobody to ever show up. Not a single one ever canceled on their own either. Either they didn't show, or (I started getting insecure so I would ask people to confirm just before) they would tell me that they forgot they already had something at the last minute. 

And dating is even more horrendous....I'm gay, average looking, but I just can't wade through Grindr or tinder anymore. Trying to get a conversation out of someone is like pulling teeth, and if I don't get ghosted, the hook-up is mediocre half the time anyway.  

What sucks is that, while I never had many real friends in highschool, things got better when I went to uni. I had a decent first semester and a half before pandemic hit and I crashed and burned, and had to drop out. I had a bad breakdown that I didn't even realize I was having at the time and basically got ousted from my friend group.

6215,yhn2ae,Yamaha_R3,"Today was Sunday and I decided to go for a movie.

 As usual I'm lonely. No friends, no girlfriends, just one piece invisible me. I went alone for the movie just as i have been doing for years now. 

Unfortunately for me, my seat was beside a couple. It was heart breaking feeling to see hear how they were sometimes discussing the movie scenes, they were laughing and smiling together.

They discussed what to have in the intermission and one of them went to bring pop corn and drinks..

It was heart breaking to see them eat popcorn from one bucket. 

That's always been on my bucket list. To have a girl and share pop corn tub in movies and discuss movie scenes and laugh it off together.. 

I don't know how it feels to live that experience. Must be good i believe. Wow.. 


The film was great though and served as a saving grace when the smiles, talk and discussion from the side seat would pierce through my soul.

It's like screaming silently pointing at me... See how alone you are..? 

Not that i was focusing on that but it was all happening so near me... It's like you have not eaten since a week and you come across a grand feast where people are having the great time and there's nothing for you. 


Part 2 of misery..(if the above was not enough)

Coming back from movie, i thought of grabbing a burger and coffee from a good burger joint.. so rode off my bike to a burger cafe. Boy was that a bad idea.?

There wasn't much crowd as it was already late evening. I noticed again a couple.. and oh boy there it goes again. Cracking jokes, smiling, taking selfies, hands in hands and enjoying cofee together... damn..

That's a dream i wonder if i ever get to live.. trust me I would give away my soul to the devil to live those experiences at least for one day. üò≠ 

I was almost choking on my coffee..same sinking feeling in the heart... 


You know what I'm 100 percent confirm that you need to be born with a heavy stroke of luck to enjoy these things in life... wow.. fuck man.. why the hell i was even born.. for such a shitty fucking life .. 

Some fellows like me or other loners have no such luck..In fact No luck at all.

I have always been alone going to food joints. It's just so lonely man.

I infact go late in the night towards 9ish 10ish if i feel like having anything from any eatery. I do this because there would be very less to no people and i would not end up feeling alone and miserable seeing others...

I was feeling heavy in the heart so thought of penning this down here for fellow loners about the daunting experience. It is such a sinking feeling i tell you. 

You know, i am baffled.. what's wrong with me.. 

i mean when I went to the washroom in the cinema and i saw my mirror image in the body length mirrors installed. I look good enough if not superhot or handsome. I was groomed up properly, well dressed, using quality perfumes, a fucking $250+ wristwatch, $2000 200cc sports bike. 

i never simp anyone or bother anyone by frequently message or call &amp; talk in standard civilized way whenever I get a chance to talk with anyone.

6217,yhn4a8,FestiveProdigy,"Made plans for Halloween earlier last week with a friend who said he'd invite some of his friends to come down with us. We were gonna go into the city, get drinks and do some clubbing. I'd never been clubbing before and I don't get the opportunity to do this sorta thing often, so I was pretty excited. I also don't have many friends, maybe a couple real ones, but since everyone I knew left for uni back in September I feel even more isolated than before. So having someone who I've known for the past few months who really felt like a good friend wanting to come out with me for Halloween meant the world. 
But I guess that's not happening anymore. My friend hasn't been replying to any of messages about what time we should get down there, or if we're doing costumes, which I sent him a few days ago now. I even messaged the gc for our gym about who'd like to come; no replies. 

Man, I'm fucking bummed out. I've been alone for most Halloweens over the past few years and I really thought this was it; I organised a costume and everything, got my hopes up and now it's all flaked out.
I feel just like I did the day before my 18th earlier this year where I'd spent ages trying to organise something with ""friends"", but no one gave a shit. Then I had to spend the day alone. I hate that that will always be how I remember my 18th.

6224,yhnufl,Impossible-Tea-4389,"I am 24 and have never been in a romantic relationship. I know there is nothing wrong with this, but the problem is how much I long for someone to love. This has turned into something that I think about every single day and I simply can't shake off. I feel like I'm looking for someone wherever I go and it is a huge  distraction from my work,friendships, hobbies...you know, all the things that give meaning to my life and that I should be grateful for. But instead of giving more time and energy to these things, I keep thinking about the one thing I don't have.

I definitely have issues with my self esteem and part of this longing is because I want someone to walk into my life and lift me up and give me the confidence I can't seem to gain on my own. I understand that even if I get into a relationship, it probably won't be a healthy one because I will bring all these unresolved issues into the relationship, and it's much better for me to try to work on these myself. At least this is the advice I got from everyone that I opened up to about this issue.

But then again, everyone has issues, and most relationships aren't ""healthy"" or""ideal"", but I guess they're worth having because you learn from them. Most people I know started dating as teenagers and most people don't love themselves or worry about working on their issues at those ages, but they fall in love and maybe it doesn't end well but it's an experience. And the more I think about this the more I want to start having my own experiences. Yes, maybe someone can't solve my problems for me but is it really too much to ask for someone to love me despite them?! Because I really want to love someone with all their imperfections, and maybe help them work on themselves.

This has turned into a rant but I had to share it with someone.

6227,yhoujx,Lightening333,"Here goes. I‚Äôm going to be honest, I‚Äôm getting sick of reading posts about how low and depressed people say they are. I don‚Äôt lack the empathy for them but more needs to be said about what people can do to to improve their own situation. Loads of things can be done which will help them to gain confidence, have a higher self worth, gain better social skills and make them more intelligent, interesting and more desirable to potential friends and of course a more meaningful relationship. Getting a job is massively important, work on your fitness, walking, jogging, running (great for mental health and alleviating anxiety) Work on your body, life some weights (great for confidence when you start to see the results) it also alleviates anxiety, make people laugh, improve your intelligence, make more effort with you appearance, try to get yourself out there because there is more chance of actually meeting people, try not to let the depression or anxiety stop you from enjoying your hobbies, try to not show how miserable you truly are around the people that you would like to befriend (that shit can be shared once you have a connection) stop wasting time on the people that you give your all to but get nothing back in return (move on a focus on other people) See someone you like whilst out and about, make small talk because you may never see that  person again, ever. Life can be strange, one choice encounter with someone could possibly lead to events in your life than you don‚Äôt think could be possible which in turn lead a to a chain of events.

6228,yhowzv,ThermalDust095,"PS, I'm 19M

So for almost majority of my life, I haven't had any major social issues. I've had friends whom I've hing out a lot with, it is true that I've never been in a relationship or never liked anyone who liked me back as well. But I never felt like I was missing out much in life. Until I did like, maybe even love someone this year, who broke my heart and created so many insecurities in me, that took months to heal. This incident kinda created a void in me, that started making me question myself why I could never find anyone who was truly mine, and who truly liked me a lot with me liking them back as well. Maybe I'm to young but, when I try to understand why that is, I'm never able to figure it out. It's like this equation, I can't comprehend. Why have I failed in this aspect? Is it my looks, cause ppl call me attractive and yet go around liking others. Is it my personality, am I that repulsive? But I'm trying to improve as much as I can without being intimidating/weird, etc. I'm never able to understand why it's so easy for others to get a suitable partner but so hard for me.


Recently, I feel like everyone including my friends that I am pretty close with as well, either has already  someone who they have, that they love. Or is gonna find someone soon enough. While, I'll just have to keep waiting for a possibility that may never occur. It feels like, the only thing that would be less hurting would be to just distance myself and follow my passion of computers cause that's the only thing that will not disappoint me.",2022-10-30 20:25:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650830856,1,/r/lonely/comments/yhowzv/define_loneliness/,,0,6,Define Loneliness

6232,yhp666,dogmakistemedim,"Woah I didn‚Äôt think this post would be this long. Here‚Äôs a tldr if anyone cares to read; I fell apart with my old friends and couldn‚Äôt make any new ones in college. I know some people to hang out with between classes but they don‚Äôt really care about me and I feel like an outsider when I‚Äôm with them. I don‚Äôt even remember how I made friends and relationships before. And I keep dissociating and feel like invisible hands are holding me back when I try to talk someone.


I‚Äôm 23. It‚Äôs my second year in college, I started late due to some family and financial problems. I didn‚Äôt have many friends to begin with but since all of them went to collage and made new friends we fell apart. It‚Äôs followed by pandemic and I became even more introverted than I ever was. It was always hard for me to make friends and keep relationships but fucks sake I don‚Äôt even remember how to do it anymore. I feel like invisible hands are holding my hands and mouth when I try to talk to a stranger. I keep dissociating in slightest inconvenience.

I met couple of people in college last year, we were getting along until they stopped hanging out with me outside the school. I don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs something happens to me a lot. I guess I‚Äôm just boring. When I talked with one of them she said I was cold towards them. How can I not be when I‚Äôm left outside of every activity and there is even a WhatsApp group that doesn‚Äôt include me?? They aren‚Äôt even hiding it or anything lol. I saw their stories on Instagram where they celebrated one of the girls birthday. Then I was asked why I didn‚Äôt text her in her birthday. I didn‚Äôt even know you wanted me to celebrate your birthday lmao. Not to mention they completely ignored my birthday. They want me to sit with them and care about them in school but ignore my existence once we leave the campus. Only reason I‚Äôm hanging out with them is that I have nothing to do between classes. I don‚Äôt believe being alone is better than being around people who don‚Äôt care about me because being alone allows me to overthink and pity myself. I feel so pathetic even my grades and attendance started to get worse. 

I‚Äôm below average and socially unskilled, obviously. And now I‚Äôm failing academically too.

6247,yhrdeo,GentleExplosions,"This is a bit of an emotional cry/dump. Yes i had a cry before i typed this out.
The struggle has been hard. I just started loving myself again after my most impactful breakup about 3 years ago, and it's not like I haven't dated or slept with other women since then. There's been a few, but still heartbroken the whole time.

The way she left, took way more than I ever expected. I know im not the best looking guy in the world, not the smartest or most talented, but despite our differences I was a good boyfriend. I'm decently attractive, had to grow into my good looks so that played into a lonely previous life. The relationship probably wouldn't have worked out regardless, we were both impulsive and that's how we ended up together. But I can say I gave her my everything, and she was the first girl I ever loved truly. Before her I only ever had small crushes and the imagination that I could be with anyone. My closest feeling to knowing what is was like to be desired was reading about romance. Not the cheesy romance, like the actual beautiful parts that can be shared between people.

I miss having a woman to make laugh, I miss having someone to call beautiful and take on dates. Send gifts to, share your day with. The way someone could shared intellectual talks with me about her college classes or work. Someone who called me handsome and made me feel confident. I miss falling in love and buying flowers and tampons in that isle no guy wants to go down in CVS. I'm miss the casual ""hey babe"" after you pick her up or visit her at work on break. My whole life I had everyone who I shared myself with leave. I felt loved for who I really was, and now that's gone. I'm hopeful to find someone who will love me again, but also afraid. It took so long to be attractive enough in general, and confident enough in myself to maintain a real relationship. I fear there's a good chance I'm just a too complex person to love. Well it's been 3 years and I finally healed inside from her. I don't really know how to have anyone who will love me for me again. I feel like I got lucky even to have it once.

TLDR: I just got over my ex after 3 years. I love me again, but now I'm really reminded of what it is I'm actually missing. I feel as alone as I did before I even had her. It feels a bit empty now.

6253,yhs28q,EvilFloopyD6,"(M25) This is a quote from a friend of mine he ment it as a joke and honestly we have said much worse to each other but I'm starting to think he is right. Don't get me wrong I have friends and family that love me but I don't have anybody that loves me romantically. I have been with a few girls and had a few that showed interest in me but it all goes downhill as soon as I start likeing them it all happens the same way they show interest in me and I in my ultimate wisdom believe they are just being nice (maybe they were), we talk and hangout but by the time I realize they like me and I build up the courage to tell them they have already moved on or in most other cases I start likeing someone that doesn't like me back ( I know it's teenage shit).

What I'm getting to is that I have realized that no matter what I do or what I try, I am unlovable and that there is no one out there for me. I have tried and always come up short and now I'm just tired of the game. I'm spent, I have had my heart broken one too many times and now I just don't wanna feel anything for anyone anymore and I'm not blaming it on anyone else I know the problem, the lacking is in me but I'm too indifferent ( for lack of a better word) now.

6269,yhtyg7,Initial-Animal-1422,"I started my sophomore year in college two months ago. My freshman year was absolutely terrible. When I first moved in last year, I got terribly homesick the first week or so, and essentially became a shut-in because I was so depressed. I realized what a mistake that was since I missed out on making new freshman friends. Then it seemed like everyone already had their friend groups. I made one really good friend, but she constantly went home since she was dealing with mental issues (which I understand, but this meant I was left alone a lot of the time). 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really was popular in high school. I didn't really find ""my people"" until my senior year, where I met two other girls who I consider now to be my best friends - one is a senior in high school right now, and the other is the same age as I am. When I go home I hang out with them pretty much the whole time, so being away from them is hard. I can say the same with my parents - I have a very close relationship with them and I miss them so much when I'm at college (my college is about a 5 hour drive from home, so not terrible, but I can't really go home when I want). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, back to freshman year. I was alone pretty much the entire year. Only one friend, and she never really was present since she went home a lot. A lot of that was my fault, though. I never really made an effort to go out and meet people. I have a work heavy major so I often times spent weekends in the library doing homework while everyone else was out partying. Something I always have wanted to do, but no one to go with. And as a girl, you can't really go to parties alone. I found myself constantly wanting to be home. I hated myself for being so isolated from other people, so I became heavily depressed. I made acquaintances, but every time I asked them to hang out, they didn't want to, and instead hung out with their other, much closer friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coming back to sophomore year, I vowed that I would get out more and make more friends. I was put on depression/anxiety medication, so for a while I did feel much better about my situation. I did meet people this year. A lot, actually. But, they all left. None of them really wanted to be my friend. I made a particularly close friend who I went to parties with, but then one day she decided she didn't want to be my friend anymore. Cut to now, where I have no friends once again. This past weekend was Halloweekend, which as some of you may know is a big social time in college - people dress up and go to parties the whole weekend. I wanted to do that. I wanted to dress up and go crazy at a party. But I had no one, absolutely no one to go with. Everyone I was ""friends"" with always cancelled plans on me. I was always the one to reach out and try to make plans. But for some reason no one wants to hang out with me here.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so fucking lonely. And don't even get me started on dating. I identify as lesbian so it makes my chances of finding someone significantly harder than if I were straight. I've tried Tinder, and so far I've been massively unsuccessful. I've gone out, met girls, none of whom were interested in me, if they were even into girls to begin with. I am not joking when I say that every one of my close friends (mostly talking about those at home) or even acquaintances have a fucking boyfriend or girlfriend. I'm the token single of every group I'm in, not by choice. I wish I didn't get upset over this. I wish I could take this better, but having everyone leave you, both friend and romantic interest, throughout your life, takes a toll on you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go through life alone. I don't want to finish college with no friends. I don't want to die alone. I don't want to be single forever. I don't want to have to make a game plan if I end up single and with no friends. But that's what I've been doing. Is there something wrong with me? I'm not mean. I'm kind. I'm normal. The most important people in my life are my family and friends. So why is it that everyone is drawn away from me? I don't deserve whatever is happening to me - I deserve love and a fulfilling group of friends in college. It's the most unfair thing in the world.",2022-10-30 23:33:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652238160,3,/r/lonely/comments/yhtyg7/im_all_alone_in_college_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,,0,4,"I'm all alone in college, and I don't know what to do.

6295,yhwp1l,Jon_Bill_22,"I'm so exhausted. Don't even know where to start while I'm writing this. Usually when people say nobody cares about them, there's someone that actually does. But in my case, I don't have anyone in my life in the first place for them to care about me. My dad, died suddenly and my mom is still kinda mourning. I wasn't close with any of them anyway. I got acquainted with exactly two people in the past 13 months. One guy just wanted to learn martial arts from me and the other girl just wanted a dumpster to dump her daily stories on, she didn't even care to notice, even when at one point I directly told her I'm going through stuff too. 

So yeah basically, I'm just this guy, alone by myself, eating, sleeping, sometimes starving cuz I don't have it in me to get out of bed, training martial arts in the evenings but the reality rushes back in the moment I'm done and I look around and see the rest of the world, never noticed, Noone even believing that I could have a difficult time.

God knows how many times I've literally been on the edge. I'm not even sure about god anymore. Tried therapy, didn't work... and now, I've almost come to terms with the fact that maybe, some people like me are just not meant to get better, to have a normal life.

6308,yhxsqd,Material_Candle_8324,"I want the type of love where we mutually obsess over each other, where we make each other our worlds and can't bear to be apart.

I have been obsessed with romance stories for the past decade (I'm 20) and I have come to have high standards and expectations for love. 

I want a guy who is completely devoted to be and who I can spend the rest of my life with, I want them to want to be with me until death do us part. 

I want to become their oxygen and so they can't live without me, where we travel the world together and be buried in the same coffin.

I want that eternal soulmate love where it seems that we were perfectly made and created for the sole purpose to love each other. 

I want a romance and love story to rival the ones (over 3 thousand at this point) that I have read. 

However, for the past 2 and half years I have been unsuccessful in my search for this type of love, everyone that I have interacted with has fallen so far short of the mark that it's downright pathetic. I even lowered my standards and tried talking to men who weren't even my type just to see if trying something different would work out, but it didn't.

I'm always the one initiating the conversations that just fall flat because the other person won't put in any effort, I try to get to know them, but they just come across as disinterested and like I'm not worth their time. 

I'm tired of initiating conversations that end up boring and pointless and have my time wasted by men who can't even be bothered to use correct grammar, punctuation and spelling. 

Why can't I just find the man that I'm looking for?

Is that too much to ask?

 It's really disheartening to keep failing at finding love when the world is the most connected it has ever been. 

For now, I've given up and am focusing on going to university.

6315,yhyc5q,Zrs1587,"So I met a girl 6 months ago at Church. Heart melted as soon as I noticed she was looking at me a lot.  I'm 25 and I've asked maybe 5 or so girls out in my time but never really been on a date.  This girl I felt we had a chemistry for each other so I started messaging her and she was responding well. Just talking to each other like friends.

Hadn't seen her for a while so I messaged her one Sunday saying I missed her. Saw her next week and she came and hugged me hello and goodbye.  That was maybe 2 months ago. 

I really wanted to ask her out in person but never really got the chance as there was always people around.

I asked her if she'd be keen for lunch at some point a couple of days ago.  She let me down gently. She said she wouldn't feel entirely comfortable with that because she's not looking or wanting a relationship now but that we can catch up at church etc.  I responded and said that I respect that and I'm glad I asked which is true. She's 21 and has a fair bit of uni left to go wheras I'm 25 and finished uni 4 years ago have a career etc. Just seems like different life stages.

I'm just in a lot of pain and I feel like wherever I go it's just a bad memory. I enjoyed the last 6 months of my life and thinking about her gave me happiness (and nervousness).  Now i just don't know what to do.  Usually if someone rejects me I can move on. I know it's only 2 days later but I still really really like this girl and I really want to be with her.

Saw her for the first time last night at a formal event. We greeted each other and said hi but towards the end om another occasion we were walking straight past each other and it was a bit uncomfortable I tried to smile at her and I think she did too but she looked away.

6330,yhze1x,MlitWav,"For Context, I'm a 17M in college. 

I only experience 3 emotions now: a mixture of sadness, anxiety and pain; pure emptiness which I can liken to nauseous - feeling like I'm not living; and hollow joy, which doesn't have a reason or something from social media or something.

It not uncommon for me now to go days without experiencing joy. I tried so hard to make friends, so hard, that every rejection, ghosting and lies has fucked my confidence and self belief over and over again. I've given up on that now. I've lost hope in making friends or finding joy in people.

The periods of pain and emptiness are getting longer and more painful, while the periods of joy and weird bursts of confidence are getting shorter now. It makes so fucking anxious to see no effect from nature, motivation or anything. Im currently a below average human being in every department and thought makes me feel so unworthy. I'm spiralling so hard and losing connection to this world.

I posted here sometime ago, and followed the advice of the comments and a very nice dm that I received. I feel like 3 different people with these emotions. I've started writing to myself when I feel happy and confident, writing messages of motivation, guidance and a list of to dos to the other versions of me. Promising myself to go to the gym. Take control of my life. These messages make it easier.

The pain gets more painful and my limits are beginning to be tested. I see no more point at all. I know it's temporary, but I also know that it's only temporary it I put in the work in myself and face the pain and be strong. Letting the fire inside of me burn hotter than the fire outside of me. But it's starting to become very difficult :(. 

Any advice or anything really would be helpful. I'm desperate D:
I don't want to convince myself that it's all hopeless and there's no point. But the emotional pain is starting to take a physical toll and I'm starting to hate life and myself. I've considered things I kick myself for later on. I know my parents would be devastated. But I've planned it out which scares me so much. I just need that hollow joy again to keep me going. 

No ones coming to save me, and I know the solution is within that confident happy self. I don't know what happiness feels like most of the time. Any help is immense.

My life is cold, pointless, wasteful and boring right now. I dont want it to stay this way. Im trying do hard and Im losing energy and hope. Any help is much appreciated. I don't want to lose my life this young. Please D:",2022-10-31 03:22:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/yhze1x/im_losing_joy_and_any_help_would_be_so_helpful_rn/,,0,3,I'm losing joy :( and any help would be so helpful rn.

I just feel lonely not being able to party. Hanging out by myself sucks, and when I try to meet new people it just doesn't feel the same. There's that boundary that I always feel even when having a conversation with them.

6358,yi2q1q,LmKidPrime,"In latin there's a cool expression that I learnt when I was in high school: Voluptas dolendi.

It means to feel pleasure or satisfaction because of your inner suffering.

It is akin to masochism but on a psychological and moral level. It's the call to pain and suffering.

I personally have been in a rough state in the past year and this thing came up to my mind because the only moment that I felt a little of consolation for my condition was when I acknowledged my ineptitude and how everything I once planned to do in the future is now out of reach. Basically complete resignation.

It seems counter intuitive but the only thing that gives me pleasure right now is the fact that I'm suffering. The idea that if I can't achieve my dreams or even live a healthy life, at least I can get some comfort through my own thoughts of self deprecation and victimhood.

It's because I can't find any joy in life, it's because everything seems uncontrollable and it's because the only thing I have is misery.

I simply find that desolation can be and will be my only friend. A destructive tool for an unhappy life that paints the world with tones of grey. After all, what can you lose if nothing really matters?

It's the simple disillusioned thought of an inevitable mediocre life without a fake happy ending.

The peace and serenity that comes from knowing that there is nothing to do.

6372,yi3ppf,jarviscockerhijo,"i am a guy, 14 years old, and I feel very lonely, i dont consider myself a shy person, more like introverted, I have always been incredibly ok with being alone and lonely, but i guess being a teenager just hits hard sometimes, anyways, dont like it.

like a year ago i thought i was lonely even though i had a girlfriend and some friends, then felt lonely because i had not a girlfriend but friends, now i dont have either and i feel not sad just lonely. i have some friends and surprisingly they feel a lot of things for me, and i do for them or most of them, i never really tell them and dont want to, because i just dont like being sensitive, because the last time it didnt come out right.

i want to be ok with having no friends because that builds character i guess, and im maybe deleting this in like a while but i absolutely love women, and i know youre probably thinking yeah youre 14 and yeah i like hot girls and that but thats nowhere as near as what i feel when a girl just fucking hugs me or tells me to dance with her, its been a while since i feel any of those things and that actually makes me sad, but as i said, i would never say that because even though my friends, family and environment would absolutely understand it and support me to death, i still just dont want to, and the worst part is, i dont know exactly why. 

i just want a hug from a girl i love and thats kind of all, the thing is, my last girlfriend was a girl who was really cute and shit, but i dont think i ever loved her, i guess i was just horny, and that embarasses me, but i think i have had some female friends in the past, whom i have ""loved"" way more, i use air quotes because i dont actually know what loving is, i just felt things when my friend hugged me after i saw her after years, i remember i was shocked at the fact that a beautiful girl had hugged me, and i didnt move at all, she was just as emotionally unavailable as me, but when she saw me she just hugged me with such a force, it felt incredible. 

the thing is i stopped talking to her, dont know why, i know that sounds like the stupidest thing ever, but i did, to settle the context, we had been tslking for over a year, DAILY. One day i jjst left, she had no idea why and the worst part is i didnt either.
 i dont know if i did it because i wanted to prove myself that i dont need anybody, not even my best friend, or what was it, but i do know some things: 
1. i did want to keep talking to my best friend
2. i do not understand myself, AT ALL. and i mean at all.

i say that because maybe i did because i was scared that she would leave me, and maybe if i ever told anyone thats what they would tell me, but i have absolutely no idea whatsoever.

i miss her. a lot. and i know she missed me at some point because of some tweets but this was like on mid june and something tells me shes moved on, and i give myself too much importance, but i still miss how even though she was very coldhearted she would occassionally tell me she loved me and all that, and i would probably ask her out now if we were still friends, even though i never told her i loved her.

but even if i miss her more than anything my pride would NEVER let me talk to her. for some reasons.
1. she probably hates me
2. even if we got to friends again it would not be the same at all
3. i dont want to come crawling back like a poor child

at this point i just dont think i could ever find love or something, i know im just 14 but i really feel that way. i do believe in love but i also gelieve that some people dont ever find it.

and finally i dont know why i keep getting sentimental i dont like it i just fucking hate it, the thing is i dont know why i dont like expressing affection lr even feelings at all, i just do this because no one knows who i am, i have loving parents and loving friends, people care about me i just do not understand myself at all and talking to a therapist would be too much, by doing this im trying my best not to delete it because that means acknowledging i have feelings and i dont want anyone, not even myself to know that, but even deep down i want them to know, and i kind of hate myself for feeling that

this is the corniest shit no ones ever going to read. 

btw if youre under 25 and want to talk i would love to, send me a message",2022-10-31 07:19:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626218540,1,/r/lonely/comments/yi3ppf/14_and_lonely/,,0,1,14 and lonely

6376,yi40a5,wells2273,"Title pretty much says it, had a talk with her, told her how I felt. I've been feeling super shitty about how she treats me. We were once close, but she doesn't remember it. I've been there for her for the past 2 and half years, forever by her side, being there for when she needed a shoulder or whenever she wanted to do something, have fun, play games, chill In a voice call. I was there for her first breakup and her second now. I was always there, but she isn't for me. I don't think I can do this anymore, I love her so fucking much, but she doesn't even care. She cares about me, she wants me to be ok, but she doesn't care about how close we are. Or how great we were together. 

So I talked to her, it got a little heated, waiting for her to respond, I might be friendless by the end of the night, I'll keep this post updated or I'll write an updated post later in the week for those who care or want to see how this story concludes.

EDIT 1: So we talked it out and now we're taking a break while she thinks and figures stuff out. No idea what any of that means as the last time we fought like this, not much really happened. I'm just assuming she's debating on if it's worth keeping our friendship alive but who knows.

EDIT 2: So we talked things out, she seems to better understand why I'm upset. We're still friends, which is nice but idk if things will change for the better or not.

6381,yi6brs,Big-Transition-7782,"Hi guys, I want to share to you all my recent accomplishment. I have low self-esteem because I'm fat and I want to lose some weight. I think my obesity is due to the fact that I have an office job (so I sit from 8 to 5 at least), combined with the fact that sometimes I overeat and I have an irregular sleep pattern (insomnia is killing me). Not to mention I'm depressed because I'm single.

But lately I have tried my best to force myself to exercise. Last weekend I have gone to the gym and hit the treadmill for 1 hour, burning approx. 240 calories, the longest I've exercised ever and the most calories burned. While this may not be impressive compared to a normal human who could easily run for hours on end, I feel like I've achieved something, although it yields no tangible benefits (I don't see any weight loss as of yet). During the 60 minute treadmill session, I've also ran for 4.5 minutes which I think is impressive (usually I couldn't do more than 2.5 minutes without getting out of breath). I feel like going to the gym is getting easier and easier, and I hope that I'll see some results soon.

I write this not to fish for any attention/ask for any praise. I don't need people sucking me off telling me I did a good job. My parents are disgusted at my weight and I don't really have friends, so I literally have no one to share my thoughts with. That being said, I'd appreciate any words of encouragement or tips on how to sustainably lose weight.",2022-10-31 09:34:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605599033,23,/r/lonely/comments/yi6brs/sharing_about_going_to_the_gym/,,1,17,Sharing about going to the gym

6431,yifzi1,Marine214,"Went through a day of hell yesterday.  All day I thought about my life! I thought about my early childhood and the days, all I wanted was someone to show love for me.  The hell I went through sitting in my room, alone just wanting to feel loved.

As I got older, how I tried to focus on other things. But, as always, I just built anger up inside me. At times, after years of letting it build up, it would come out. Once at the age of 18 on a Sunday. The day before, my step dad had choked me, almost to the point of me passing out.  The next day a Sunday, he was repaid, by me. He called the police on me. When they arrived, I was trying to leave. One of the two, grabbed my arm and pushed me.  I told him, I was leaving, as my step dad wanted and not to touch me again. He didn‚Äôt listen, pushed me up against a door. I absolutely lost it. I beat the hell out of the two cops. Broke one‚Äôs collar bone, 4 fingers on the other ones hand. I spent 39 days in jail afterwards.

I joined the USMC shortly after that incident. During my time in the Marines. I learned how to deal with all the bottled up feelings I had.  I did well for a few years. Focused my attention on taking care of people I loved. Then, I found a girl I fell madly in love with. After 4 months we got married. Things in my life seemed to be making a turn. We were both madly in love with each other. Unfortunately,nothings took a turn 2 years in. I worked shift work and there were too many hours between us seeing each other. Our finances were hard, after we purchased a place to live, that put a strain on our relationship. One Friday night, I met her at one of her friends house.  When I walked in, there were 3 gifts and 3 boys. I had a few beers that night, my wife and one of the girls decided to take me home. Somehow, we ended up at my wife‚Äôs dads place. He got in the car with me and out came my anger. That ended our marriage, as it should have. But, it didn‚Äôt end my love for her.

I moved out of state, to gather my feelings and work on becoming a better man, human being. It worked, again I learned to deal with my anger and my feelings. I began coaching youth sports, always hoping I would be the man a kid with similar childhoods as mine, could talk to, look up to, it helped me tremendously.

I fell in love again and married a wonderful, kind woman, one of God‚Äôs Angels.  I spent the next 20-30 years, taking care of her and our children. Laying my feelings aside to do so.  We‚Äôve been married, next June 2023, 50 years. Although I love her and would die for her. Someone else is still deep inside my heart, my first wife. I can‚Äôt explain it, I just deal with it.  My wife has never been a person to express her feeling to me. She will tell me she loves me and I know she does, without a doubt.  I love he too. But, the feelings of wanting her to express her love of me with a sensual kiss, throwing her body at me are raising feelings deep within me.  Not, the feelings of hate that I had for so long. No, the feelings that I‚Äôve given out through the years. The passion, to take care of those I love. The passion of making sure they know what love is and that I love them!

Yesterday and last night, it all came crashing down on me.  The feelings deep inside me of no one truly showing they love me.  Today, those feelings are overflowing. As I sit here writing this, tears are creeping out of my eyes.  I feel like my heart is about to explode! Not feelings I ever thought I‚Äôd have at 73 years of age, but, here I am. 

In closing, take the time out of your life to express your live to someone. Not just by the words of I love you! Show it passionately, show it in a way, that will leave no doubt! You might just learn, sometimes it can mean the world to someone!",2022-10-31 15:56:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587602816,2,/r/lonely/comments/yifzi1/loneliness/,,0,0,Loneliness!

a year ago today, my downfall began. It started when I was trying cigarettes and weed my first time. This was going on for a few months. I stopped, when I realized how bad these things actually were. (I‚Äôm strictly against drugs and cigaretts now) However, meanwhile I started loosing friends and everybody in class tried to stay away from me. Now, exactly one year after, I don‚Äòt have friends anymore and the cute girl in my class thinks bad about me. I was trying to reach out to her a few times but as the things are, she doesn‚Äòt think much about me. Everyone I know is out at halloween parties tonight while im sitting in my room, feeling the loneliest i‚Äòve ever been.
I‚Äòm not a bad person. Actually, I‚Äòm the complete opposite. I love animals, planes and the nature.

Looking for people to talk to, be over 18

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I‚Äôm complaining just being blunt. There‚Äôs bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it‚Äôs honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I‚Äôd just rather avoid it. I‚Äôm really into horror movies, Pok√©mon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I‚Äôll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I‚Äôve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I‚Äôm down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly ‚Äúget busy‚Äù like I understand if you‚Äôre honestly busy I‚Äôm usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I‚Äôm feeling it‚Äôs an excuse. I‚Äôm not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I‚Äôm starting to feel jaded and like I‚Äôm just ranting. Regardless, I‚Äôm down to try to build real bonds, I‚Äôll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don‚Äôt really care as long as it‚Äôs interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

6512,yiro4t,Lonely_Monody,"i hardly talk to anyone. at school people only talk to me if they‚Äôre forced to be in a group with me. there‚Äôs this boy who sometimes says hi to me in the halls and each time i always want to cry because of how happy it makes me. 

at home being around my parents is exhausting. they always have something negative to say every single day. they always compare me to other people and it‚Äôs so demeaning.

my brothers always tell me i‚Äôm lame every chance they get. and when i‚Äôm visibly upset they get annoyed at me for ‚Äúacting like a girl‚Äù, which is funny because i am one, but even if i wasn‚Äôt it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

most my friends live 3 hours away. we text, but i miss being able to physically be there with them.

my best friend is a 10 minute drive from me, but he goes to another school. he reads my texts, but responds days later. i barely hang out with him, because i feel like i‚Äôm bothering him. 

strangers compliment me and it makes me happy, but so sad because kindness leaves too soon. 

sometimes i think about finding a fucking one night stand, because i just want to feel like someone wants me. i‚Äôm a sex-repulsed asexual, but i‚Äôm so desperate to feel needed even if i‚Äôll regret it later. 

i forget how to talk to people and i don‚Äôt try to be pleasant anymore. so maybe it‚Äôs just all my fault.",2022-10-31 22:58:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1550458040,7,/r/lonely/comments/yiro4t/i_feel_so_fucking_lonely/,,0,1,i feel so fucking lonely

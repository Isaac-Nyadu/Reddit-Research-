0,z97xpp,ChooseyLovah,"I find recently that trying to cope with loneliness/depression shopping does nothing; the main thoughts that start coming to mind are “ what’s the point of buying new clothes to look nice when the only place I go to is work ? “ 
Why am I getting stuff to decorate my house when no one will ever be here to see it and hell I might not be here tooo much longer anyways “ 
What’s the point of a new jewelry when it’ll stay cooped up for the most part”
Etc etc and I’m not on social media nor do I go out clubbing anymore .

5,z98ggm,natooral-skeptic,"Hi folks,  


I hope you don't mind an older guy (m39) do kind of like a ""helpful rant"". I am a straight forward, blunt guy but what I am about to write is only with the best intention, so please don't take anything of that as a personal attack but rather as a chance to improve your life. Just for the record: I work as a life and relationship coach since 2003, so I got my fair share of experience with people who are desperate and hurt.  


Feeling lonely sucks - you know just as well as I do. But you can do something about that feeling, whether you believe it or not. I hope you won't get defensive if I tell you: Not feeling lonely starts with you and only you. If you cannot be on your own and crave validation of others, chances are that you have some bad or even toxic attachment style. One way or another you must start working on that, because if you don't, you'll never be able to connect with other people from a place within. By that I mean: From a place of true confidence and self-worth. For me, that's easy talks because I spent the last 20 years working on myself, building several businesses (of which all but my most recent failed, by the way), and so on. You might be some 18 years young, still trying to figure out what the hell you actually want in life. And that is ok - just promise me that from today onward, you'll focus on your own development. Become the best version of yourself. Then other things will fall into place. I can guarantee you that. That said:  


See, a lot of (young) people want to connect with others, especially when it comes to dating/relationships - millions hide behind apps like Tinder or Bumble and spend hours scrolling through Instagram, TikTok and all that BS. If you are a young lad or girl: Please, for your own sake, uninstall that crap right now. Almost every bit of data collected in the last 10 years indicates that such environments are biased, unrealistic, artificial and toxic environments: On average, men receive one match on Tinder for some 6000 swipes. So far we did not even address how many of that 1/6000 matches flake or ghost guys. Or to look at it from the female perspective: Girls match with roughly 50% of all guys they swipe right on average. Speaks for itself: There's dozens of guys in her contact list and for her own sanity, she simply cannot reply to every dude that hits her with a cheesy pickup line. TLDR: Whatever your gender is, chances are that your experience on dating apps are just horrible. And yet again we did not even address the simple fact that none of these apps are real places. Use your head: If you see these ""models"" on Instagram, chilling at the poolside, slurping pina coladas and all, you got to understand that none of that content is real. Just because people strike unnatural poses during their short stay in a hotel does not mean they always look like that: The next morning they might wake up with wrinkles under their eyes and their belly popping out because of having gas or whatever. Same for couples posing on social media: Yeah, some look soooo glamourous and all. But are you aware that he might snore at night? Or that she drinks so much coffee she keeps farting for 2 hours every morning?   


I hope you get my sarcasm here, because all I am trying to say is: Don't buy into that phony nonsense and instead allow yourself to be real. That includes: Being vulnerable. Maybe you think your legs are too short. Maybe you envy that dude's beard over there because it isn't patchy. Maybe you tricked yourself into believing that - for whatever reason - you are not good enough for this world that seems to consist of shiny Hollywood type of people. All of those thoughts are nonsense, because you are good the way you are. There is no other person like you on this planet, so cherish your individuality and simply be who you are. You are unique by default - until you start trying to be like those top 50 people trending on social media again. Why would you want to be a clone of somebody else if all it takes is being yourself? You're that one sperm that triumphed over some 40 million other sperms. You are unique amongst almost 8 billion human individuals on planet earth. Celebrate that instead of beating yourself up!  


Speaking of the world's population: Let's assume the worst. Let's assume that only 0,01% of the entire human species could ever fall in love with you. Are you aware of the fact that these are almost 800.000 people? I want you to think of that number for as long as you need to understand that one of these 800.000 people could be the cute, shy girl behind the counter at the coffeeshop. Maybe that clerk at Walmart could be one of those 800.000 matches for you, so why pass him by while he's filling the shelves? Even if 99,99% of the entire human race would actually truly despise you, got nothing to worry about. F...k them, because even then there is almost one bloody million individuals out there who match with who you are.   


If that pep talk did not convince you, let me finish with this: All that keeps you from achieving grandeur is your own mind. Let's say you brought up the courage to approach 99 girls or boys (or whoever you are into) and are turned down by all of them - sucks, right? But why stop now when attempt no. 100 could be the very approach that connects you with your future wife/husband? You made it this far and took 99 heavy and devastating beatings - should they all have been in vain? No? Of course they should not!   


I think you catch the drift. Some final words: Look at  me. Like most of you, I have been rejected, dumped or cheated on. In 39 years time, I felt devastated, broken and lost on several occasions. I got laughed at by people whose silly opinions I gave to much importance for years and got bullied back in school because I was a ""misfit"" according to others. I cannot count the days I asked myself why I am still standing. But somehow I just did - and it is just now that I somewhat start to figure out life. So if you want, really listen to some aging random stranger on the web when he tells you: Go easy on yourselves, don't beat yourselves up and simply be alive. All it might take for your to end your pain and misery is a simple ""Hi, how are you doing today?"" in the supermarket, at the bus stop or your favourite bar. And if it did not work out today, you just try again tomorrow. In the meantime, be proud of yourself for taking another step towards a brighter future. It isn't always easy, still it always can be done.   


You got this. I believe in you. And I really mean it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 and I've felt like a complete failure for the past 3+ years. No girlfriend or friends around, haven't been able to make much money and it just seems like literally EVERYTHING I try just seems like it just doesn't work out for even the smallest thing. I really didn't think this would happen this way... I had it all figured out when I was 18 I thought. I'm a programmer. I used to do game development until I lost all of my work I had for years on my microsd card due to unsafe ejection from the computer. I also got into web development around this time, but none of my projects took off. It's been really hard and I remember this almost every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

There's been so many times in the past few years where I just sit in my dark room, lonely, alone and just wishing there was someone I could talk to. Unfortunately there was no one.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an idea for a website yesterday and I want to see if maybe it could help someone else. This idea actually got me out of the state I was in for the last 3 days as I slept most of the last 3 days only being out of bed for like 3 to 6 hours max. I figured maybe this is a sign.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone would like a website where you could find someone to talk to on a regular basis? Like a platonic friend to listen to you, talk to you about their day, and just be there for you? There would only be a small fee since I would have to end up being able to do the work to make the website and everything and get everything hosted onto the internet, but I knew this would be something that would of helped me personally so I thought it may help someone else. You don't have to but if you want I would appreciate if you'd help me by answering my google forms poll to see if anyone would be interested in this. I think this would also really help me to finally get onto my feet programming again and I'm sure this idea would really help others battling loneliness and related struggles as well.

33,z9by67,Kaiju1964,"I want to say lately I've been feeling really lonely lately but loneliness is something that I've been dealing with for almost as long as I can remember. Although it does feels really bad right now

First of all I am autistic which comes with a whole bunch of communication issues. This pretty much made me the outcast day 1 when I was going to school. I was lucky to have a few close friends at school, but even then I always felt outed by the rest of my peers and was often the target of bullying. It got especially bad in 9th grade when I didn't share any classes or lunch with any of my friends leaving me to eat alone 99 percent of the time.

You'd think things would get better in college and in some ways it did, but other ways I still felt like the odd one out in the group of friends I made. One time I and one of my friends organized a small movie night with pizza that I would provide for the... however I ended up being the only one single there making me basically hosting a couples night where I was the 9th wheel. Yes 9th wheel. I ended up dropping out of college only after a couple of semesters. I still kept in touch with those friends for a couple of years but sadly nowadays I don't keep in touch with any of them

So how about family? Unfortunately my parents divorced when I was very little and both my parents ended up remarrying and starting families of their own. Of course I love my little sisters on each side but unfortunately I can't deny the fact that since they were born, particularly on my Dad's side, I was less and less the priority. In regards to my Dad's side of the family it became my responsibility to keep communication with them if I wanted to basically keep a relationship. I still do with my sisters and step mom, but not my Dad as he won't contact me at all anymore and never notified me about him no longer having a phone and other things. Even within the immediate family on my Mom's side, I hold different political opinions and don't generally join them for dinner or anything as I keep to myself. When it comes to extended family I basically no longer have any communication with any of my uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. It's probably because of my trouble with communication and reaching out but at the same time they don't really reach out to me and tbh the family dynamics on both sides is... not great

Currently I'm about to turn 27 and unfortunately have been living with my mom for the past 4 years or so after having a bunch of issues living at my old apartment and haven't been able to move out since. I only work a retail job on the weekends as I try to work on making an independent art career, which in itself has been isolating, come true but I'm worried that it'll never pick up and I'll be forced back to working retail for basically full time but only still being paid as a part timer. I feel out of place in my department as the people I used to talk to have either moved to a different department or have left the store entirely leaving me with co workers that I struggle to find anything in common with. At this moment I really only keep in touch with a handful of friends and only occasionally hang out with one from time to time. I've never really had a romantic relationship as I've only dated a couple of people, the longest lasted only a week and I haven't tried to date since 2019. I don't really think trying to date someone right now is a good idea atm so I doubt I'll be starting a relationship anytime soon. Still though as I approach 27 I can't help but feel that I just won't be able to fit anywhere and I'm going to end up completely alone

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this off my chest and don't really have anyone to talk to about this

89,z9itzc,No-Chain5165,"According to De Jong Giervald:


""Loneliness is a situation experienced by the individual as one where there is an unpleasant or inadmissible lack of (quality of) certain relationships. This includes situations in which the number of existing relationships is smaller than is considered desirable, as well as situations where the intimacy one wishes for has not been realized"".

I can relate to this feeling quite a bit. I have struggled to make and keep friends. I recently reached out to an old friend. I met up with him and a few school mates. I felt more anxiety than pleasure during these interactions. I was panicking internally. I know it was right to put myself out there. However, I felt very anxious and awkward. I do not want to isolate myself because it does suck to be lonely. Unfortunately, I still feel lonely around people which is what makes loneliness so complex. 

I sometimes wish I was born as a different person. Life has been a bit overwhelming. Positive connections have been few and far between. I sometimes wonder if I am a worthy human being. But I know I cannot give up.",2022-12-01 08:43:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609235212,8,/r/lonely/comments/z9itzc/what_is_loneliness_why_am_i_like_this/,,0,6,What is loneliness? Why am I like this?

109,z9l0qj,19sol11,"I'm 22, Male, from India, currently pursuing my degree from a University. I wanted to talk about this with someone but I literally don't have anyone to talk about this.
 I feel like people just act like I don't exist, yes I'm an introvert, I do have friends but I always feel left out and end up feeling lonely. Whether it's a group project/work, a party or any random discussion people just ignore me and my opinions, people just don't bother. Even in a group chats or text messages people just ignore my message. Hell, people 10x worse than me are getting the attention. I feel like no matter how hard I work or put in the efforts in all the aspects of my life people just don't care. And honestly sometimes because I don't get the recognition for success i just want to give up, feel like what's the point... I have achieved a few things so far, from good grades in academics to sports and many miscellaneous certificates but lately I feel like I am just working and working and getting no result.

Even my parents don't bother, no matter how hard I work to get the good grades. I feel like have I done anything wrong to anyone, why are they acting like this? I'm a human, I want attention, love, hate anything, emotios. I don't know why but everyone around me, all the girls, boys etc. Act as if I'm there but I'm like a stone or a pebble, I'm there but I make no difference, no one cares. 

Literally I'm working in a group of 5 people and I did all the work and this girl didn't even knew my name, at the time of presentation she was like ""oh is this guy with us"" I'm like wtf bro, feel like there's actually no point in being a good/helpful human. Ofcourse if I'm giving someone the love and respect then I would expect the same from them... I have helped so many people like so many times, none of them even told a little ""thankyou"", they just forget everything, and when I need their help they are just not there...
Ohh and ofcourse I'm a virgin and sexually frustrated as well, surprise surprise... A few people have said to me that i am good looking and have a great personality, but when it comes to pull up game, it's just non existent, girls just literally don't know if I exist

I honestly don't know what to do, how do I make people know that I do have a name, that I do exist. 
It was my birthday a few weeks ago, and like legit people didn't even spare 5 seconds to wish, i know these things are trivial But I did feel bad, especially after seeing how some of the other people get treated in a nice way all the time. The worst part is they will feel bad if I did something wrong with them or just ignore them but they don't realise what they are doing.

Thinking about all of this makes me feel lonely, and I can't help it. Is it because I don't have any good or real friends even after 20+ years of my life, or am I doing anything wrong, what can be done
I probably don't make sense with this rant, I have waffled everything out in no order but Just wanted to vent a few things out here, thank you.",2022-12-01 11:01:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1561903945,5,/r/lonely/comments/z9l0qj/feeling_lonely_and_low_feel_like_people_never/,,0,1,"feeling lonely and low, feel like people never acknowledge me"

I find the empty pleasantries of “love yourself, invest in yourself” so hollow. Picturing myself coming home from a hard days work to just my pet makes me feel incredibly sad. My one friend lives far away, I have a difficult relationship with my family, and I don’t have any friends besides that when it comes down to it. I’m trying so hard to branch out but being heartbroken makes me want to isolate. 

All I do is sit around pining for the day my ex comes back. We technically still live together but he’s traveling for work and most likely going back to his family in the new year to support a  loved one recovering from major surgery. I only want what is best for him and unfortunately I do not meet all the criteria right now. Maybe I will one day but sitting here making changes for his sake and not my own isn’t right. I have to do it for myself but I am scared. I cannot picture life without him, but I have to force myself to. That’s painful too. 

The panic and sheer terror I feel after sunset when I am alone doesn’t feel normal. It doesn’t matter what I’m watching or listening to, I cannot distract myself from my grief and anxiety. “This is temporary,” doesn’t feel right. I am in therapy and doing the work. I feel abandoned. I want a real hug and affection from the person I love most. Not a heating pad, a weighted blanket, and numbing myself with edibles.

The depression and cold feeling of having no one give a crap about you and because your male you are supposed to just take worlds all shit and not complain ever. All i wanted was one friend and girlfriend but i suppose thats too much and i dont deserve it apparently according to crap sling at me by this universe. Worlds cold and the shittiest coldest narcissistic people are always on top of everything, because they have cabability to destroy others life with no feelings to fuel their own social status and success.
Wellll i have met some nice people, but they live far away so their just online friends pretty much that i rarely talk ever..
My social skills are so bad i dont know how to socialise with them. I dont know what to talk about or say.. but i want to.
I have the shittiest social skills and my confidence is like a broken puzzle. Too much abuse, trauma and bad experiences in past,, cant trust no one.
True good people are rare. Most are just fakers who think being good person is just about being law abiding citizen and other than that you can be shitty as possible to other people if it does not broke any law. Thats the type most people are nowadays. Fake narcissistic bs clowns.

I dont think anyone would care if i killed myself. Few times i have mentioned about it to few people they were just like ""well its your own choise"" or something like that. Some times i wonder would my own mother even care. Am i just some embarrasment black sheep to my family.

I feel like social media has made peoples go completely feelingless numb robots...
Or maybe it has always been like this, and most people in world just are like that by nature and im just too young to know,, but i feel like things got worse after 2008 when social media started get bigger thing. Everything now is about status. No heart. Cold robots.

172,z9ua9a,RevolutionaryAd5143,"""Loneliness is the deepest poverty, that person can be subjected"" says prof. Juho Saari. As we are herd animals, we have a need to belong somewhere or some community. Harari mentions mans greatest feature to be inventing narratives where there might be none and then thinking up meanings for those narratives. Man has conjured Gods and sins to meanings and rites and worships to uphold those meanings. Because of those meanings we sometimes curl up in regret and shame, those are strong feelings that regulate our herd behavior.
Today I felt the shiver of shame running along my spine.. .. because I did something stupid 21 years ago. That shame was supposed to remind me to behave in a herd approved way, being separated from the herd was once upon a time a matter of Life and Death.

Martela and Laird defined a social cohesion and a feeling of being loved and connected as basic human needs. 
What creates connections? 
Manson and Martela point out, that religion and shared rituals connect, as do similar values and most of all; a common enemy. Us versus those who are not us, is a strong bond that connects us in ""battle"" against imagined enemies. This bond can be seen from politics and religion to championing sports teams and occurs in violent extremism in all cases.

Communality is most likely a built-in feature in us as a species. This gives us hope for the future. Fear gives a common enemy, but despite fear mongering, neither pandemics, climate change or breaking supply chains haven't derailed us into anarchy or sparked the Purge and why should they. 
When asked ""when civilization started?"" anthropologist Margaret Mead puts it somewhere around 15000 years ago. To a skeleton that had broken and healed femur. It's hard to move with a broken femur today and it was so 15000 years ago too. Healed femur means that the human pack has had to stay put and take care of its injured member. This was thousands of years before permanent residences. 
A person for that pack was more than the things they accomplished, their value was something more, because the rowing pack didn't leave the injured and ""useless"" member behind.  
As a species we have always aspired away from chaos towards civilization, for at least 15000 years. It seems ridiculous that something like that would be destroyed ""overnight"".
maybe because of this ""early care"", thinkers from Kant to Martela and Tecumseh see secrets of meaningful life to be in goodness towards others. 

What if you have difficulties creating and feeling connections. What about us, who are always picked last to teams when playing sports, us who couldn't run or catch? Those of us who were told we were too weird and embraced that weirdness Even tighter. Pushing away that group who didn't want them. Us to whom words were too big or just left unsaid. Us to whom bonding rituals were too confusing. 
For me, my narrating mind created a loudmouth heckler, who built his minds bastion out of assholeness so that nobody wouldn't even want to approach. And in that bastion was left a small boy, who just wanted to be hugged and invited to play.

These days anyone rarely dies without tribes protection. Yet it's still very easy to slip outside of the herd without anyone noticing… well because you're not part of the tribe anymore. 
At the beginning of this year I was very depressed. When depressed you focus on stupid things and I focused counting days. 77 days went by without anyone asking how I'm doing. On that point my feeling were so complicated, that when seeking imaginary tribes acceptance, I understood to lie my answer. I realized however, that I wasn't part of anyones tribe and it's really difficult to take interest in anyone who isn't part of the tribe.  

Monkey Sphere longevity research examined human herd size. It examined the relation between brain size and herd size in primates. It determined that the human herd size is 50-100 individuals. That number fills up fast from extended family, childhood friends, hobby pals, people who go to the same church and that sort of thing. To most people it's really difficult to take interest in anyone outside of this number on a personal level. 

Childhood friendships are bonded because of geographical reasons. We become friends with those who are nearby. So it's pretty random what kind is your childhood tribe and by that extent your skills to uphold that or any other tribe. If the bonding rituals were revolving around intoxication or other socially frowned upon activities. I.e If your parents are substance abusers, you are likely to not develop good social skills. 

There are thousands upon thousands lonely people without any meaningful connections and mental - and substance abuse issues are partly caused because of lack of meaningful connections. When becoming marginalized, we are not just left aside, but deprived of doing good to others, which would create meaning to us. Putmans Bowling alone noticed that today people exercise communal sports, like bowling, mostly alone. This can also be seen in aging members of fishing and hunting clubs. We loosing the sense of community on a societal level 

How do we bring back that sense of community and make people create connections to each other? I don't really know, but it might be a boomer whining from a generational gap. Research shows that youth raised in the internet age see virtual communities as real as any other. Maybe this is just a dirge of ill-fitting Lemminkäinen, who found out that the stone baked inside his bread was in fact Snapchat?",2022-12-01 17:48:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606543266,3,/r/lonely/comments/z9ua9a/considering_connections/,,0,1,Considering connections

little over 1.5 years ago my ex wife (of 13 years) was cheating on me, before that for 7 years I felt like a roommate, she wouldn't hang out or go out when I got home, never home on my days off hanging out with her dad or family, blowing off our date nights, it made me madly depressed, I kept telling her we needed councling and she refused, didn't see a problem, I left her, I am the type that I love romantic outings, picnics and all the movie mushy stuff... I have my faults we all do, she has begged me for almost a year to take her back, and I refused... finally got the divorce finalized 6 months ago, that is when the reality of the situation started sinking in for me... I kept having to keep in touch due to her bills being sent to my place of residence, and vice versa... we agreed to see a movie together on the 13th after months of mind games from her, and I couldn't slee0 until 5:13 am that morning anxious on what to say to her, how to talk to her after a year+ separated, and so I woke up at 11 am went to ask her what time to meet to see black Adam, and she had me blocked on Facebook... so I sent her a text stating ""I do not appreciate these games, you are better off leaving me blocked, and loosing my contact information"" it depressed me even more... but I don't like drama... then a week later last month all her friends started blowing up my phone of her on a date with someone on the 14th, don't get me wrong, I am happy for her going out like that... I am just tired of the lies and makes me depressed to the point of feeling like suicide is the only answer to escape the mind games (I am not going to do that) anytime it enters my head, I think of the people I will leave behind, what they would hsve to go through both financially to resolve my problems and emotionally, and it puts me in a solid state of mind... only time will heal this, but these mind games seem childish at my age and really upsetting...",2022-12-01 18:07:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652382950,5,/r/lonely/comments/z9uu7o/36m_depressed_venting/,,0,1,36M Depressed (venting)

I see you working your butt off everyday. Even the smallest of tasks require some levels of mental fortitude. Understand that I am proud of you. I am proud of how far you have come. Overcoming life hurdles isn’t easy especially when you’re fighting it alone.

Remember that while you may be alone physically, you’re truly never alone. I am with you always. I am there to guide you. I am there to talk to you when you need it. I am there to empower you. All you have to do is close your eyes and think of me(yourself).

You may feel like you’re at your wits end. That your depression is slowly winning, or that your problems are increasing exponentially. I say breathe, take a step back. Remember the time when you did that task alone? You remember how difficult it was for you mentally yet you persisted and came through! I want you to be that for me. Do that again for me. For us. I know it feels difficult and I know having no one around to ask for help feels lost, but you need to remember that when you came through for yourself.

Be that person once again. I got your back.

226,za2lxb,Kitchen_Notice4439,"Here I am again posting on the lonely subreddit. I’m f,21. I feel extreme loneliness often. Even though I kind of have people in my life that aren’t shitty, but I also don’t want to talk to them and definitely don’t want to open up about things.

Like distant relatives, that are kind of cool, but I couldn’t bring myself to talk to them about certain things that are hurting inside. It’s not like I don’t have people to talk to online, but that’s way different! I can’t call them when I feel extra low, they’re on the other side of the globe, have their own lives and we usually don’t share numbers.
I have grown apart from my old friends, I didn’t like certain things about them when I was a kid, and now I finally understand that I can choose to not be around them.
I have okayish parents - my biological dad is very avoidant, has another family and really doesn’t want to spend time with me or call to check in on me.
My mum has some sort of personal duality shit, I don’t know what it’s called. She can be super nice and supportive, and then switch clicks and she’s the meanest person and can say really hurtful things. I don’t talk to her anymore about what troubles me.
I have a very nice boyfriend, but he’s at work from 7am-7pm, and after that he’s too tired to hang out. I often feel like we don’t really click emotionally. I need emotional support, he needs emotional support, but we can’t give it to each other.

I have started having problems to fall asleep. I will be in bed for hours, next to my sleeping bf, waiting for sleep to come, but nothing, just sad thoughts.

I am seeing a therapist and I really look forward to our meetings. She’s expensive, but I feel very seen and heard... so that’s good.

I really want to make real friends in real life, but I don’t know how... I’m not in uni anymore, I’m not currently employed, I don’t know where and how to meet people.

I often wish I was medicated. I don’t want to feel what I’m feeling, I don’t want this anxiety and not being able to get out of bed in the mornings. I don’t want these sharp and painful being alone feelings. I just want peace. Not even happiness, just give me peace.",2022-12-01 22:44:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644310367,4,/r/lonely/comments/za2lxb/here_i_am_again/,,0,5,Here I am again

246,za5nvx,HungHeart,"Dramatic headline and thanks for your time if you care to read on, but I feel like this is a place I can be vocal about my current situation and let it out. Not seeking a relationship here, just advice as to why am I undesirable? What must change?

So it all began when I was born...anyway I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up (my parents wanted that for me and I ran with it cuz at such a young age, who knows what to do with their entire life?) and I did put my best effort into that since highschool. After years of college and the extra curriculars and devoting my youth to the medical field and covid and then, after being deployed as a medic, I realized I've got one shot at life so I better do what I want with it or come to terms with the existential dread of living a life I didn't desire. So. Dropped out of college, pursued a career in aviation and I feel I am succeeding very well in it! Became the black sheep of the family with that decision. Just got a promotion and a raise though. I truly love my job. My coworkers are great and the money is enough. But why am I on r/lonely ? Because when I deployed, the girl I wanted to spend my life with left me after a few weeks. We were together for a year and a half and I brought up the idea of where the relationship was headed (marriage) and she said she knew I was the one, but then when I was on the other side of the world she presented me with the ultimatum to become Catholic or she's gone. I was upset, I would've married her and gave her my benefits to pay for her college. We also had previously discussed before I left that we would be fine continuing our lives together with our current beliefs. So, shaved my head and hit the gym all that time in hell out there. Became a new person and am over her. Gained 25lbs of muscle, never been so carved and fit, wasn't drinking or smoking, ordered a new car from the factory and gave my old one back to my family. But despite that brief time of health and confidence, I feel like a shadow of that guy I was. It's just so easy to let go. Its been over a year since I've come home and about after the first 6 months, I'm drinking a mixed drink every night with a cigarette just to feel something and fill the time. I never did that before, I just drank and smoked with my friends at parties on the weekends. I still see my friends a couple times a month. I've been on dating apps since I've got back to get myself back into dating and now I'm on four apps and I just can't make a meaningful connection. The dating scene has never been so bad imo. I still work out on my days off, still have the v and a professional appearance. All I do is cook and watch shows in my free time. what happened!? Is it me? I don't feel different, I act the same as before I left, I know I've changed a little with time but why am I so undesirable now that I feel I'm at my best? I thought I made the right choice in choosing my own life. I feel more lost than before. Why am I unlovable now? 
The only thing I can see to change is stop the drinking and smoking and workout 6 days a week again. And what would that accomplish?? I could also grow my hair out but is it really something so superficial? Do I need therapy!? 


TLDR- deployed, changed careers, lost the love of my life, succeeding in new career, can't find a kind person to settle down with, why am I unlovable?",2022-12-02 00:39:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621839597,2,/r/lonely/comments/za5nvx/no_matter_how_hard_i_work_im_not_good_enough/,,0,0,"No matter how hard I work, I'm not good enough"

248,za5ts5,lesbereallads,"How it feels to see someone’s face light up when you’re around. How it feels to not be looked at like you’re ruining the atmosphere and making people uncomfortable. God knows how it feels to be asked out. Or how it feels to not be looked at like I’m insane when I ask someone out. 

I look back at pictures of me as a teen and think “why did everyone hate me?” I don’t get it. I know I’m a little awkward, but that’s it! I’ve always been quite pretty, my features are literally conventionally attractive. I look just like my sisters and they’ve never had issues dating, they were married at my age. I’m passionate about lots of things, I like my job, I’m completely independent, and I’ve worked my ass off to get this far.

People seem repulsed by me. I’m lesbian and I find that anytime I’m surrounded by other lesbians they gang up against me, give me dirty looks and I don’t know, just fuckin hate me! 

Even in a friend sense, nobody ever sticks around, and I never get invited to anything. I had to just start asking people to invite me whilst they talked about arrangements they were all going to.

Either way I still go out on my own. I meet and talk to people but it fades within a couple days, because who in their mid 20s is going to bars to meet friends? They’re there WITH their friends. When I miss people, I reminisce on memories with them, just to realise we don’t really have any good memories.

251,za6fz6,DrunkGallina,"Hello, I don't really know how I should make my post, but here it goes.

Many situations have lead my life to be a mostly lonely endeavor. My nuclear family disconnected itself from all my extended family in both sides, I was raised in a dysfunctional family, I have always been shy and have a lot of baggage. In spite of all that, I've managed to keep romantic relationships throughout my life, the most recent one being an almost 7 year relationship that ended about half a year ago. Sadly, as it seems that I tend to do, during that almost 7 year relationship, my energy was solely focused on my partner and my work, so once it ended I stumbled into the situation of being almost completely and utterly alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I neglected most of the few relationships I had while in that relationship. Currently, I only have one friend. My childhood best-friend, whom with, although I dearly love, I just can't connect in a way that satisfies my need for connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the months, the loneliness I have always felt (even while I was in that relationship) has kept increasing steadily to such extends that this past Thanksgivings I had to spend it in a psych ward as I was suicidal. A few lies and some prozac later and I'm out, no longer suicidal thanks to the numbness of the Fluoxetine. But I'm still lonely... I'm still so miserably alone and I crave some kind of human interaction. That's the point of this post. I guess I just want people to talk with to ease this lonely feeling a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped in my house, in my hometown, and my sanity came and went at points. I've taken steps to try and get better, hence the medication, but pills can't cure loneliness.",2022-12-02 01:09:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1566089242,2,/r/lonely/comments/za6fz6/feeling_trapped_at_the_border_of_sanity/,,0,0,Feeling trapped at the border of sanity

I've been with this girl for almost 5 years now. Also been living together since the start of the Pandemic last 2020. But recently she's been asking for space. She still loves me, she hurts when I hurt, but the thing is she needs her own space. I think I should also mention that she's an introvert (sort of). 

See, here's the thing. We had this talk a year ago, that she needs space and to remedy that, I would go home on the weekends to my family's house. (I'm an asian so its normal tk still live with our families). After a few months of this, we started to heal as a couple again. Fast forward to 2 months ago, she became extra clingy. As in, honeymoon phase clingy. I found that cute and that made me get extra comfortable again. But then starting last month she became distant again and then we had the ""she needs space"" talk again last night. 

Here are some things I should also note. We have cats. Presently only 2 but there were 4 of them. 2 died earlier this year due to asthma and it really struck us both. One cat that died was named White he was the eldest of the 4. You see, when we were just starting out White was already with the GF along with another cat whose name was Brown. During that time, I loved animals but not the parent child thing yet. Brown got extremely sick and died before and I showed little to no effort in helping the GF cope up with it. I know what I did was wrong but at that time, I just wasnt attached that much, until the new litter came. Anyway, she always brings up that time when I showed that I didnt care for the GF and the cat Brown during that time. What hurts me is that eventhough I've changed quite a lot, especially me towards the other babies( the cats). I still miss White and the new one Grey who died recently. I also noticed that, whenever the GF is happy or is making new friends, I'm the one who gets discarded. And I feel like shit because of that. Ironically, I'm the one who encourages her to make new friends despite her saying that I'm her only friend. I just dont get it, I'm really hurting so much. I don't know what to do, and I neee someone to talk to.",2022-12-02 02:02:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605871726,1,/r/lonely/comments/za7t7f/i_need_help_it_hurts/,,0,0,"I need help, it hurts.."

So I've already decided that I'm not going to date nor be in a relationship for the rest of my life.  I don't need help with that.

What I'm now trying to figure out is what to tell people when they do ask why I'm single or if I'm looking, particularly at work.  I know they will, because it does happen occasionally, and this is a fairly social company, where social activities outside of work inevitably happen.  I don't care about what people think about me except if they start to question my ability to do my job, and I'd also like to avoid unnecessary awkwardness with business associates.  I don't want them to think I'm unstable and question my judgement.  What I was planning to tell people henceforth was that I don't want to date or be in a relationship.  If they ask why, I was planning to say that it's for religious reasons.  If they ask for details about my religion, I was planning to say that I don't feel comfortable discussing it.  This seems like it will stop most people from investigating further, or at least the kind of people I work with/ do work for.

What do you think?  Is there a better thing to say that sounds more ""normal"" yet does not invite/ allow further inquiry?  I'm really curious to know what people think.

 The night is done,
 I break and bend,
 To be someone.

 I yearn to be all that i can,
 And to make the best of what i have,
 But it doesnt seem like they are a fan,
 They dont like to hear me laugh.

 I believe that i can live my dreams,
 And be the person i want to be,
 But that hope is swallowed by distant screams,
 That i could never share with my family.

 So the day will end,

He would enforce sex onto me, even though I told him I would only do it after marriage and I have morals. He got mad and said I was boring, called me useless and left. It did hurt, because I would do anything to make him happy, I just don’t want to do that yet. He also used to make comments that made me extremely uncomfortable, used to say things about my body in a provocative way or wanting a gangbang with him, his friends, and me.

However, besides my family, I’ve never had someone else that stuck around in my life, someone that I deeply connected with. There are very few select people that I have truly connected and felt comfortable with, but that was several years ago and have since lost contact with them.

342,zahp7j,stellachoo,"Last semester I did pretty shit. Failed a class for the first time. After that semester, I worked one new internship in addition to a job I had previously. I got so fucking burned out that I was experiencing hallucinations. I figured it was bc I was too stressed. So towards the end of the summer, I quit my older job. A job that I had for 4 years, and one that had a rather unpleasant boss (who's also very clingy and takes advantage of the fact that I have trouble saying no, and straight up lied to staff saying I didn't quit but was on ""sabbatical"", etc). 

When this fall semester started, I withdrew all of my courses in the add/drop period and decided I had to take the semester off. I was too burnt out to give a shit.

The internship didn't end though, and doesn't have an end date. Considering this was the first internship I've ever gotten and didn't really have an impressive resume, I decided to keep this internship longer till today.

This time I only come in 3 times a day to adjust because I told my boss I wanted to set aside time for online courses I was taking.

However, I've been doing poorly on these online courses (not that it matters or affects my gpa but I haven't learned much and it bothers me) and I've been somewhat declining in my work.

Doesn't help that I was assaulted and had some issues/events with my family. I don't know how to process this. I experienced suicidal thoughts but never got any help as mental health resources are limited. It wasn't until hallucinations came in where I actually managed to see someone until they stopped. 

I have a boyfriend of 4 years, my HS sweetheart. He's been somewhat supportive, but there are times where I feel like I don't know him well and its hard to trust him. I recently found out he's an Elon musk and Andrew Tate Stan and I don't view him the same way. He has hurt me mildly before but he doesn't anymore. He is obsessive with being rich and I have really mixed feelings bc he is the only friend and person I've had and love. But IDK if he's compatible with me.

The whole point of taking the semester off was to get better. And somehow I feel like I got worse and more alone. I'm not sure who to trust and where to even begin.

I feel so alone. I wish I had a friend to trust and hug and tell me that everything will be okay",2022-12-02 10:03:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587371118,7,/r/lonely/comments/zahp7j/i_wish_things_didnt_turn_out_this_way/,,0,10,I wish things didn't turn out this way.

344,zai1si,Camel60,"Hi, I'm 18 years old M and it's my first year at a University, and I've yet to make a single friend. The semester ends in two weeks and I tried really hard at the beginning of the semester to make friends but I didn't have any luck. I am a commuter student at a school that is well known for parties and the majority of freshman live on campus. I live in the area so my parents told me that I could save money by living at home, but I regret it a lot because I have no social life at school.

I have friends from highschool, but everyone's out living their lives and I'm just stuck in the motions, going to school, going to class, talking to pretty much no one, and then eating alone and going home. I've kind of given up for this semester, and I feel like a reject. Everytime I meet up with my friends from highschool I'm embarrassed because I wasn't like this in highschool, I had a normal social life and a decent amount of friends. Everybody thinks that I'm living it up at Uni but I hate it here. I look forward to the little interactions I have with my girlfriend and friends, but it just feels like I'm fading out. Like everybody's just leaving me behind.

I look on social media and see all my old friends out partying at their schools, while I'm sitting on my ass at home or sitting in the fucking library at school. I can't even get away from it at school, all my classmates have their own giant groups and it seems like I'm the only commuter student in the entire school. Everytime I introduce myself and they ask which residence hall I live in I can see it in their eyes that they feel bad that I still live at home. Like I'm some fucking sub human that they have to pity. Like I'm a fucking idiot for not moving out when I had the chance.

I regret it so much. It feels like its been so long since I've had to make new friends completely on my own that I don't even know how to do it anymore. When I went to events at the beginning of the year to try to meet people, it seemed like everyone I met already cliqued up or at least has their roommates.

Even my own parents are looking at me like I'm a fucking loser. My mom keeps asking me why I'm at home so much these days, and she keeps telling me to get more involved. I'm fucking trying! But I can't force people to be my friend. I can approach all the strangers I want, but I have no fucking idea how to make a friendship deeper than a classroom aquaintance that you talk to once a week.

To make it worse, when I do talk to strangers or classmates, my social skills are so dull now that I feel like I can't carry a conversation as well as I used to. I feel like a fucking highschool burnout and its only been like 6 months since I graduated. I can't believe that I turned out like this, I just feel embarrassed to be me. So now I'm turning to strangers on the internet since I don't feel comfortable saying this outloud to anybody.

362,zalmzn,plshelpmeicanttakeit,"I'm a 19F currently still being heavily controlled by my  Nmum. I have never thought of myself ever feeling so lonely as I've always been sociable, fun to hang out with, constantly trying to make connections and easy to work with in group projects, despite having an extremely controlling Nmum. Because of her, I do not have that many close friends who understand my situation. Even if I have course mates who know, they wouldn't really think to invite me out since I seldom hang out with them, and only contact them when it comes to school work due to my strict curfew. 


In terms of curfew, I would always have to lie that I'm having classes so that I would not be like a prisoner, having to give a detail report of who, where and when I've been with. Also, in my Nmom's world there's ONLY 2 PLACES I CAN SET FOOT IN. School or home. She would want me to return home right aftet school, not even allowing me to have simple dinner w friends etc. To the point she restricts my mode of transport and FORCES ME TO UBER HOME EVERYDAY. Because she doesn't want me to have close friends or friends in general, making sure I have 0 time to interact. Since there's definitely a school holiday, I can only hang out w my friends a few days a month to make my school calendar less suspicious. Hence, it's very hard for me to hang out with my coursemates even if I wanted to since most of them wouldnt know and understand. I feel, In their eyes, they'll only see it being difficult to ask you out on parties becuz of all these restrictions. And I can't really enjoy the outings when they invite me, since I would have to worry about extending my curfew because I need to ""stay late in school to do projects""


So today, I think I've finally understood the actual feeling of being lonely???? My cohort had a phototaking session. There's only 60+ people in my cohort. So everybody was gathering in the mass hall with their own cliques and I didnt have anyone to stick with. I'm okay with most of the people in my course but I just seem so out of place if I just stepped into their convo etc. My close friend from the course dropped out so there's technically nobody else that's really close to me. So at that instance, I really felt so lonely that I left the crowded area for awhile to calm my emotions in the toilet. I wasn't having a panic attack or hyperventilating. 


I was just so overwhelmed by this feeling that I needed a place quiet where I'm physically alone. When I'm in the toilet, I kept telling myself that ""it's okay, friends come and go. you have more important things to worry about. You're just here to study and graduate."". Now that I recall, I used to experience this feelings but it wasn't so intense compared to today.

So a few days ago I saw on TikTok some random Russian girl and I thought she was very pretty and I just got hooked and wanted to know the girls name. And the first few minutes I didn't know who she was until I did a little research and I wish I didn't. Now I probably need to say I am a 14 year old male (introvert) and I never had a girlfriend. So anyway back to the girl, her name is Rina Palenkova. Russian 17 year old girl who passed back in 2015. Normally I ignore this stuff (I don't really mind nasty stuff in general). But this one really hit me, I don't know why but maybe she was the first girl I found actually pretty. So the last few days I was feeling actually shitty and couldn't think about anything else than her (and yes I know its sick and I don't like myself for it ). I have been thinking like what would I do if she didn't do what she did or how badly I would want to save her if I could. Now keep in mind I never knew this girl or heard or seen the girl in real life. Anywhere I go I just picture her there and start to feel shitty again and its driving me crazy and sad at the same time. I am not any kind of psycho or have some sick fetish or anything like that (I never pictured anything intimate). Whenever I go somewhere it feels really depressing like my life had no meaning without her. And I want to ask if someone had similar experience with stuff like this and how did you get out of this state.",2022-12-02 16:07:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585671757,1,/r/lonely/comments/zapzw5/just_a_random_girl/,,0,0,Just a random girl

440,zawoll,Affectionate_Hat494,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. The reason why is because he had a girlfriend. Even when I tried to be social media friends with him, he rejected my request after two weeks. In hindsight, I think he was trying to be as gentle about the rejection as possible by not rejecting it right away, and by not blocking me. But in the moment, I realized what that meant. I realized that he had a girlfriend, because why else would he say no? So I blocked him for a few days. 

He told our friends, because two of them started texting me, and they seemed to be kind of dancing around the situation. I didn't give them any information, but I unblocked him after a few days. Surprisingly, he didn't block me back when I unblocked him. He and his girlfriend broke up not long after, and ever since, he's been stalking my social media all the time. He didn't before, but he looks at my social media everyday now. I think he still likes me. But I want to know why he didn't block me. Do you think he was able to read between the lines and realize why I was upset?

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

477,zb2550,zatannazatar,"this is my first time doing anything like this but i just have nowhere or no one else to go to. i've probably been depressed since the 8th grade. im now a sophmore in college. i've been in love once and that honestly is an entire novel in itself but recently I just found out that my first and only love, didn't actually love me and he barely even remembers our relationship. when reading that text it honestly was one of the most hurtful things in my life. for years after we broke off i couldn't get over him...he meant so much to me and there were so many memories and sweet moments i cherished and felt lucky for experiencing even once. so to learn that it was really one-sided kinda hurt, but i should've known that seeing he didn't want to end our 16month relationship until I got too pushy about him dating my best friend. Yes. i was super young, dumb, insecure, &amp; didnt know better but I'm gay and he's bisexual but at the time we both were DL, but he was super popular and would date girls for a 'beard' but with my best friend it was different. they knew each other since the first grade and he had a crush on her since then. i didn't amount to anything when it came to her. anyways that story is too long to get into but last week was my birthday. most of my family forgot, none of my friends wanted to do anything with me, the friends who I thought were closet to me gave me dry happy birthday text but when its everyone else's birthday I do everything in the world to make them feel important, the guy i was talking to and really liked probably sent me all of 2 texts the entire day. my childhood dog the night before lost the ability to walk on one of his legs and it was the most heartbreaking thing to see. i literally spent my birthday alone watching christmas movies and sobbing...then I just got drunk and cried even more until i passed out. i think this birthday truly made me realize how unloved and lonely I am because since then my depression has gotten so much worse. nobody wants me, nobody likes me, &amp; i don't think i'll ever truly be loved by anyone. I fianlly told my mom about two weeks ago in multiple paragrpahs about how I was feeling...she ignored my text so then I sent another text saying ""well i know who i can't talk to lol"" then she did what she always does and tried to guilt trip me for being sarcastic ""i didn't see your text I was sleeping""...but any other time you need something you're blowing up my phone like a maniac and you're all over social media I bet you dont miss any of those notifications. but im not surprised with how my mom reacted because my senior year of high school I attempted to open up about how I was suicidal and a week later she turned around and said I only was doing it for attention and an excuse for my shitty grades. (I was dual enrolled taking college courses and on track to graduate with my Associates Degree and my entire life I had been a stellar student in student). My biologal dad wants nothing to do with me, every few years he'll make some lame and faux attempt saying he's sorry and will do better....but when I actually try to connect with him he goes ghost. he doesn't call or text for anything not my birthdays...not my graduations and not even two months ago when i poured my heart out to him. still no response. I grew up being bullied by own family for being gay ""f\*ggot"" ""sissy"" ""girl"" ""stop acting like that boy dont do that"" ""you only like girl music"" and the icing on the cake is my entire family being athletes and particpants and nearly everything so I'd say we are a pretty well-known family in the 100 mile radius of where we live so me being different in any way was always sooooo embarrasing to them. My two brothers are talented athletes who do sports but I didn't when I was younger until my mom forced me....in forcing me to do sports I had to do football. I weighed too much though to play with my age group so the coaches and my family made me go on extreme diets and do ridiculous workouts. but it didn't stop there because every week i had to get weighed in before a game and the stress of being over and not being able to play gave me the worst anxiety in the world. it was bad enough I was the weird kid out of the family and my teammates treated me pretty shitty. My own mom called me a fatass on multiple occasions. As i went through puberty I lost the weight and was actually really thin, only at the time I didn't know it because my body dysmorphia was so bad. Now I've become obsessed with being skinny and I'm not diagnosed but I know I have an eating disorder..I'd rather not elaborate as I feel too embarrased by it. I was sexually assaulted multiple times at a very young age and the people i've confided in about that didn't really seem to care as nobody ever does when I express myself. over the years i've noticed i'll fall into addictions to cope with my sadness because I want to die but I also want to live. i want to marry my prince charming and adopt kids and have my dream career as a showrunner for my own tv shows and movies. but its so hard. today the guy that i was talking to (the same one who barely talked to me on my birthday) just told me today that I was thinking too much about us and that he doesn't want a relationship with me. then proceeded to make me feel crazy by saying he thought it was mutual...since I met this man he literally was telling me how much he liked me and how he wanted me to wait two months for him to get back from PA for the holidays. now two weeks later he wants nothing to do with me. no guy ever wants to be with me and I've come to the conclusion im just not interesting enough. every guy will probably talk to me for about 1-2 days then im ghosted usually. or ill meet them through a dating app and they'll only want to hookup or trade nudes...the few times I was pathetic enough to actually do those things I ended up blocked or ghosted still or they just aren't looking for a relationships. Guys honestly have been an obsession of mine just like weed, food, &amp; alcohol ... but I only become obsessed with those things to feel better about myself and to cope.i just want to be loved and wanted by literally anyone. im constantly feeling my heart in pain. but at work and around everyone you'd think I was so happy because I'm so nice, caring, &amp; empathetic to EVERYONE even strangers because I never want anyone feeling bad about themselves, so ig it just hurts really bad when you overestimate your importantce to people and realize they'll never do the same for you as you've done for them. im sorry for this long and random harry potter novel. if you read til the end I thank you so much. i just want to get at last some things off my chest.",2022-12-02 23:58:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670022527,3,/r/lonely/comments/zb2550/idk_what_to_do/,,0,2,idk what to do.

I used to try to incorporate certain personality traits I liked in others, into me. That’s what I’ve been doing for years. I’ve been trying to design my own character for years. I’ve tried on different personality traits. I’ve been naive, and wise; I’ve been warm and loving, and cold. I’ve been quiet, I’ve tried being talkative. I’ve been serious, and I’ve been laid back. I’ve been flamboyant, and I’ve been modest. Etc. You get the point. But so far, it’s gotten me nowhere in life. At the end of the day, I’ve still no clue who I am and I am still alone. 

And so lately, I feel like I’m hitting the pause button on being a person. I don’t feel like a person in a way. A lot of who you are is what you are in relation to others… and when you aren’t anything in relation to others… what are you? For example, I’m not mean, but I’m not kind; I’m not either, I’m not *anything* really, because I don’t interact or speak mostly. And as a result I have basically no one reaching out to me. I feel as if I might as well ditch my phone and go live on a remote island somewhere because that’s about as relevant as I feel to the outside world. It is almost as if I don’t even exist. I am physically here sure, but the abstract concept of my self has eluded me. I feel like I’m nothing.

It’s just me, my phone, my dog, my couch, a tv on in the background. Barely hearing from anyone. Day after day. This is at least partially my fault.

489,zb3uml,beenibroh,"**TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide, PTSD,** 

i am a male who turned 17 a few months ago. i suffer from Bipolar disorder, Social Anxiety, and ADHD. i have experienced trauma from a few years ago that i feel like i will never truly recover from or find real closure. and more obstacles like losing friends or something i love will come my way regardless of what i do about it.

some would say i should talk about my problems but every time i open up about them people either wont listen or wont hear what im saying as i naturally have a very quiet voice. if you want an example, last year my mom passed away in her sleep and i tried to continuously bring up how she died but either no one would hear me or i would find myself cut off for something thats more ""important"". now this of many thoughts has been nailed into my mind to the point i am genuinely afraid to stick up for myself and find professional help due to the fear of being judged for thinking these things. no one ever tells me its okay to think these things so at the end of the day is it worth even writing this dump if someone is going to tell me that this is an unhealthy mindset?

i am failing a handful of all my classes because of all these thoughts in my head telling me i will never omit to anything in the real world and wont live passed the age of 20. the only friends i have left in school never ask if i am okay or ever want to talk to me. whenever im pulled out of a classroom or reminded im falling behind on my assignments. they'll either write me up without asking me whats going on or when i tell them its mental health they never ask me more about it. but who am i kidding no one will ever understand.

considering i dont see myself contributing to anything in friend groups or even passing i often think about dropping out of high school. if i dont have a good plan for the real world or see myself living passed 20 whats the point? no one ever thinks of me as a genuine friend and i feel like a ghost half the time not knowing what to talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

if you want a good idea of what i havent recovered from, well in 2021 i was dating a girl who convinced me it was okay to think these thoughts and checked up on how much water i was drinking or how much food i was eating. our relationship abruptly ended because someone insulted her while she was facing her own problems. when i first had to accept this i had genuine thoughts of ending it all because she was the only friend i had who ever cared about me.

for a while, i actually felt better about myself and didnt have these thoughts as much because i had a theatre class in the 10th grade with people who got me out of my shell and convinced me to express myself. there was a girl in that class i had feelings for and we became good friends around the end of the year. i was beginning to build up the courage to ask her out until i overheard she was moving to a private school for charity and other things. on the last day of school me and her were both waiting for a parent to pick us up from school. so for maybe 20 or 30 minutes we just talked about random things. i asked her if she was actually moving and she said yes but brought up that she'd come back in the 12th grade. after learning she was gone i began to feel kind of depressed again, but i kept reminding myself she'd come back so i wouldnt feel as sad. eventually school started back in august and i didnt have theatre class anymore. i have an animation class now but the only friends i really talked to take different classes so i stopped talking to pretty much everyone altogether as i mentally felt lost. especially since i cant trust anyone.

however me and that girl talked on snapchat occasionally and we'd talk about how our days been. i asked her if she was coming back when she brought up how overwhelming school is and she said that plan might change. considering nothing ever seems to go right she probably is not coming back it just makes me feel much more miserable. 

the only happiness i even feel is either making music on a computer or sleeping in on a school day. i have a designated friend group on the internet that often times is chaotic but for the intentions of usually being a joke. this is one of the things restricting me from committing suicide as i feel like without me in that friend group there would be much more arguments and more people would split into their own groups. additionally i've known these friends for years so without them i cant imagine how they'd react if they heard news of me ending it.

495,zb446g,sleepyinthebath,"I don't have perfect recall, but the intimate memories I remember I relive with intensity. I made a ham bone soup with lentils today, and the taste of the ham and lentils reminded me of memories of watching my spouse browning onions and chickpeas or lentils in a pan to serve with rice. I remember the feeling of watching her cook, the taste of the burnt curried chickpeas and onions, and the fresh, dry toothy taste of basmati rice. I would feel a kind of spiritual warmth eating something that was made for me by my love. It should be a happy memory, but we fell apart in a horrible, horrible way that deliberately ruined my life. I'm still subjected to these memories all the same, even in such small ways as eating and preparing food.

I have nightly dreams, they get longer every night the longer that I'm alone, about my last girlfriend. They always follow a conversation I can never remember, it seems to go on for hours, and then ends in love-making. I remember her smell, taste, and feel very well. I haven't seen her nor do I want to, but when i wake up from these dreams the memory of her presence next to me in bed is so real that it feels more like a haunting that a memory. 

I would hide my memories from each girlfriend, for fear they would interpret it jealously, and I would realize that they'd be a memory soon too.

I also remember negative things, the death of a friend, and traumatic experiences, but it's not the same. Somehow the positive memories make less sense to me, and feel more like an invasion to my normality.

I have these strong recollections every day and every night, the longer I am alone in life the more persistent they are. I'm currently trapped in the suburbs, no life, no purpose, no possibility of meeting someone new and I am older, almost middle-aged, with nothing to show for it. When I was young, like probably all young people who are heartbroken, I often wondered if I'd ever love again after a breakup. I would grieve like it was death. I'm not like that anymore, in my last breakup I merely stopped talking after saying a few words.

I need affection. I think my brain is recycling it for me in the form of these memories to keep me feeling. I wish I could have an intelligent conversation again, or laugh and goof off, or be innocent with someone I just love. When I think about this I realize that as we age, loneliness becomes more common. No matter what happens the end decade(s) of my life will likely be the loneliest.

509,zb5k07,LivingArtistry,"27 yrs old. Got out of an abusive relationship 8 months ago.  Still struggling from that, but between that and the pandemic, I've found myself 27 with literally 0 friends, I talk to nobody on a regular basis and I live alone. 

My apartment is a mess, like, absolutely horrible and affecting my mental health.  But I can't seem to fix it and there is nobody to help. 

I still go to work though, so most the time I can ignore how miserable I am. 

Now I have the flu. I've been home for 4 days and all I can do is just cry. The physical pain is one thing, but the crushing emotional weight of literally not a single person checking in on me, is just.  .  .

I could die tonight and nobody, not a single person, would actually care. And that is just.....

How do people handle having literally 0 friends? 0 family? 0 support.  And I mean, 0. Not ""aw I don't want to bother them"", I mean there is nobody to bother and anytime I have bothered the few I thought I could, I get nothing in response.... or like 4 days later ""lol omg just seeing this"". 

Like no you're not, but that's fine. Message received. 

I just want a hug. Or someone to give a shit.  Or anyone to treat me with an ounce of the compassion and kindness I treat others with.  I'm so tired of nobody being there when shit gets hard, or even just reaching out with a kind word. 

That is worse than the actual flu.  I just wanna curl up and not exist it hurts so bad.",2022-12-03 02:42:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649882491,2,/r/lonely/comments/zb5k07/friendless_with_the_flu/,,0,3,Friendless with the Flu

It wasn't just a few of them, it was every single person I considered a close friend. Also, on Halloween, I asked if anyone had plans and I was told no so I just got bored and went trick or treating for the first time in years. I then found out through photos how they had a party that same night after denying plans and telling me they weren't planning anything bc.  My DAD went with me on Halloween because he felt so bad.

535,zb8dac,Any-Special1501," 

for a little background I'm 19 in my sophomore year of college.

Recently I've come to the realization that I'm completely alone and it really hit me hard. Before this became a major issue for me I was actually really content with my life. I had ""friends"" , a girlfriend, i went to the gym regularly and was planning on playing football next year, basically everything was going in the right direction. But about a month ago me and my girlfriend broke up, this sent me into a short depression but i quickly got back into my normal routine. For a couple weeks after i got back into things ,I felt like I was back to normal and was feeling pretty good. But a couple days ago I texted my ex and going into this i already knew it was too soon and that I hadn't completely moved on, and no matter what the result of texting her would be it would not be good for me emotionally. We ended up having a good conversation and it went really well but just like i thought , I ended up feeling really sad that i knew we would only just be friends and I wouldn't be able to go back to how it was when we were together. This made me think a lot about me as a person and made me realize a lot about my life.

Now I'm not posting this for advice on how to get over an ex or how to cope with the feelings that come with a breakup. I'm posting this because now after talking to her and accepting our relationship is over, I've realized that I'm extremely lonely, I have no real friends, only people I see at parties ,or people I talk to that go to different universities. And the only reason I had been overlooking this is because I was telling myself that its fine because I had a girlfriend who I spent almost all my time talking to and that having ""friends"" like the ones I described was fine, and that everything else was going well so why bother changing anything. Now im here and I don't know what to do because ive tried and I just cant seem to find any real friends here and i feel so alone.

The only reason im posing this is because now this feeling of isolation is starting to take a toll on my life, grades dropping, skipping the gym/training, and just general lack of motivation and happiness. And i feel that going into winter break its only going to get worse because all im going to be doing is sitting at my parents house playing video games in my room and going to the gym alone.

I really didn't think id be posing on reddit about this but I genuinely don't have anyone that I can talk to about this and i really don't know how i can improve my situation.",2022-12-03 05:12:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670041464,1,/r/lonely/comments/zb8dac/im_completely_alone_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,,0,1,im completely alone and dont know what to do about it.

 Kind of a ramble, but it's good to let it out.

 I think we can all agree that when you get hurt, your capacity for love shrinks. Maybe not forever, but it takes time to recover.

 For me, when I got into a cycle of repeated abuse due to food insecurity and poverty. My ability to love gradually faded. I have had several partners that have hurt me in separate ways. I go to therapy for it now, but I still find myself falling into an abusive cycle of sour relationships with people.

 I have found peace knowing that I have the choice to prioritize myself and my future career over the ***potential*** good relationship and family. I love being free from the fear of an intimate partner. It's a big compromise for me. I always wanted a big and happy family.

Most men I've met have cheated. Same thing for women. So, really, wtf is the point?

Not everyone is that I know.  Trust me, I've met some good ones. I could never fall in love with them.  Not really.

579,zbcyom,Odd-Conclusion-320,"I just got triggered by some post on Instagram by a dating coach trying to tell people what they need to do to attract a partner. I felt so angry reading it because I have read countless books on dating, tried so many “strategies,” and played all the games (and not played the games).

I’ve done crazy things to change how I look, and who I am. I’ve dyed my hair, lost weight, worked out, bought countless things that might make me look better or be a better catch emotionally.

I’ve dated so many people but every time they left. And I felt broken and wondered what made me so unlovable. Surely there could be something I could fix to make them stay…

But enough is enough.

I watched Bridget Jones’ Diary tonight for the first time, and it really spoke to me. A 32 year old woman, totally alone and honestly a mess. I can relate. But ultimately there is a guy who says he likes her just as she is.

I just want that. I don't mean I don't feel that I can just put in no effort to be loved. I mean that I’m enough as I am.

I have so many flaws, but I can’t really be all that bad when it comes down to it, can I?

And I’m certainly not going to beat myself up trying to be the perfect partner because it’s exhausting.

605,zbhgjv,AirportFriendly2103,"Hey Ho, just posting this to let my feelings out to not bottle it up.

I'm honestly so lonely, i have no meaningful friendships only superficial ones out of convenience. It's been this way for a while whether it be my personality, or my actions due to mental health. Which not making an excuse for this as i am me with my mental health they are not seperate entities. I should probably get therapy for them but im honestly so scared of having to share with another person how im feeling and how weak and disgusting that makes me.

So instead i come on here and try and find friendships that last but only end up having ones that last less than a week due to the reasons above and the fact that i latch on to anything meaningful or anyone that gives me attention which isisnt right i know that but like without it i have nothing. and for me people are going to leave anyway so why not 1. enjoy the brief moments of feeling needed, 2. push them away before they find out how i really am and leave anyway.

 It wasnt too bad until i broke up with my ex, this was brief however i experienced something that i hadnt before, someone that truly cares about me and someone that would talk to me without me talking to them first. Which was foreign for me and what i took for granted truly. With us both not being in the greatest of places, things deteriorated as expected of everything that i touch. Zeccini, if you are reading this, i hope you are beginning to heal and i truly love you and wish for you to get better.

that brings us to now, where all i do is work home sleep, and in between that time, try to make friends but realise that i am truly and utter alone, weekends are the worst without forcing my mind to be busy during work i get the full effect of sitting here in a cold english room with nothing and no one of value around me, making me in fact less than worthless. the only value i have is people reading this and realise in fact things could be worse, but how much worse should i let things get before i consider this life a failed run, and take the plunge into the void of nothingness where much like now everything is meaningless.

I might write these to let my feelings publicly out, as its probably the first time i have done so.",2022-12-03 14:25:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670076424,3,/r/lonely/comments/zbhgjv/teetering_on_the_brink/,,0,2,Teetering on the brink

614,zbika4,Fallunlight1988,"
I'm my life, my 34 years, I've spent all but 6 of them effectually single. And for 5 of those 6 non-single years, my attempts to keep up with the couples life was rough. Regrettable things were done by all parties involved. My social skills are underdeveloped past the initial stages of interaction, call it social exhaustion. I lose my charm, I just want to exfil from the scene. On one scale or the other that's been my safety net, always having an out. You can take that in both ways it was intended. 

I'd be lying to myself if I didn't confess to the obvious that I had a overbearing mother who went to the darkest places and returned to keep me safe as a baby. And a birth father who was in jail (3 guesses), and a step father who loved me dearly but was always away at work. 

My older brother was abusive pretty much out of the box. If he wasn't finding ways to hurt me, he held me down so other bullies could. My younger brother was always the golden boy, the ""normie"". And actually he didn't grow up unscarred but he ended up being the only one that was as close to normal as possible. Stable professional career, no prior convictions, no drug history, no alcohol issues, distanced himself from the family history. 

Myself, I've been writing notes to myself for as long as I can remember, trying to capture myself in those moments and also collect a compendium of my life. Some would say was exceptional, others like my mother would fervently argue it was boring and safe. The answer is always somewhere in-between. Naturally I'm beyond used to long drawn out deep conversations that beat a point so far into the ground I need a flashlight to see into the hole that was dug anytime I sit down and talk with my mother. Ironically outside of matriarchal monologues interrupted by complaints of silence on my end, I find myself in deep conversations easily and quickly. Like a trap. Trapped in becoming more like my mother. It's a fate I'd rather do without but the alternative is a passive distant but loving step father or a narcassistic professional liar, mentally unstable and abuser, birth father. God forbid I make my own path and I'm observed doing so. 

Needless to say others entering into the equation historically has never ended well. Either us boys have terrible taste in women or all we can muster for attraction is women like our own. You can imagine two alphas in a room don't mingle well. Infact my younger brother just got married, a secret alpha, webbed control, no like for any of us in the family besides the one good apple in the crop. Though I'd spent long hours attempting to break down her psychology and how she beat my mother, I know I'm not finished deciphering this developed dark empath. I'm at best a novice still having only reconnected with my own emotions in my 30s. As much as I know, that's what seperates us. 

You may have I'm image of who and what I am by now, and Lonely is a characteristic upon myself self imposed. Truth is, I broke the mold of what everyone thought I was become and devolve to. I kept up my positive nature, my affirmations to a higher order to do good if I survived(attempt) or the many times I tried to sell my soul to devils to ensure those I felt I emotionally hurt found joy. And all three did. 

I'm a little broken. But I'm still someone who actually enjoys making people happy, seeing people happy, feeling their emotions. A smile on a face and I'm especially weak when someone looks me deep in the eyes. I try to be a good person, each opportunity. I do feel I'm battling my own demons and my own nature. I'd like to think that's honourable that I may be also redeemable. 

I thought maybe after 6 years of this since my first and last anything true to a relationship, that I would be stable enough to approach one. I do want to hold and be held. Truth is, I'm only good for deep conversations, and me trying to help doing something and looking the fool for it. I can't seem to get past first conversations, and if I do I hold it together until I'm alone where I can go into my less than stable self. It usually takes me a couple weeks of isolating myself from the other person before I become stable again. 

You can imagine in all that happens I never really picked up a hobby that was socially acceptable like a musical instrument or art. I've tried fervently to explore hobbies in the past, nothing really sticked. It's been years and I still haven't even been able to finish a videogame or continuously subscribe to a long form TV show. 

I enjoy learning about history and science, physchology. Lots and lots of YouTube. Lots of delusions of grandeur, lots of hopes that fade quickly when exposed to sunlight, and many many repeated attempts to stay positive and be a good person and try to give back something to this world. 

In short, in order to be stable I must be alone. If I don't fuck it up, I'm sure another would play their part.",2022-12-03 15:17:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1483506186,3,/r/lonely/comments/zbika4/well_truth_is_i_hate_being_lonely_but_its_whats/,,0,2,"Well, truth is, I hate being lonely, but it's whats kept me stable."

643,zbm4iw,Flowrome,"Surprisingly I’m lonely, and it won’t change. I’m 26 male and every kind of relationship seems to be just too fake, i mean, from outside all the people i know seems to consider me a really joyful and extrovert kind of person, who can get in touch with pretty much anyone. Also my best friend that knows a lot of my past and my struggles in life (usual thing like depression, suicidal feelings, loneliness etc..) can’t understand why i feel lonely, and she tells me that I’m not.
But I can’t, I can’t think of myself not being lonely. The only time I wasn’t lonely it was when i was spending time with my last relationship (that was toxic as hell), because somehow i felt important and appreciated by that person, but it was all in my head.
So the problem seems to be just me, and how i cannot establish meaningful relationships with other people, i feel so sad about this.
Do you have any kind of advice that could help me a little? Or at least cheer me up.

Many years of my life afterwards was about thriving as a person and developing myself. And i did. I loved reading and I maintained a habit of walking for hours daily. But when covid-19 happened and the lockdown etc, i regained an awful consciousness about my loneliness. It was crippling. I do suffer from depression but i never really linked it to the loneliness until i started aching from solitude. I changed a lot and what i used to like about myself is barely here.

689,zbqrd6,pikaxuu98,"hello everyone. I do not want to give info about myself as this is an embarrassing thing to post.

I am a 25 yo girl living in the UK, but I am originally from another country which I prefer not to say. I started studying social work in the uk now 2 years ago and I am (at last) on my last year of uni. Uni is meant to be 'the time of our lifes', but it aint being like this whatsoever. Everything I do is attending my placement for my degree then my part time job, that's all. I do not have many friends around as I barely had the chance to meet new people due to my busy routine neither I feel like other people are interested in me, or they have partners etc.

Once I get my degree I do not feel like coming back to my home country at all as job opportunities and career are shit over there.

There are days like Saturday or Fridays that I spend them at home but I see lots of people posting stories on snapchat and instagram going out. And I feel like I would love doing this sort of stuff as I am a young woman and I am meant to be enjoying life because, otherwise, when am I mean to?

I would for example love going festivals but I have no people to go with and most of my friends live overseas. However, and as I stated, I do not want to come back to my home country anytime soon.

I just want to think that life will get better for me once I get my degree therefore I will have more free time. But for the time being is being so sad. I think I also developed social anxiety and it is very hard to deal with it.

Thanks for your attention",2022-12-03 21:09:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670096357,2,/r/lonely/comments/zbqrd6/i_feel_so_lonely/,,0,2,I feel so lonely

During hunter-gathering times, fitting in with society meant the literal difference between life or death. We were way less connected so burning bridges could be fatal.

Overtime our bodies got good at telling us we were in social pain through shame.

735,zbui5i,Novel-Special397,"A few weeks ago I broke up with my ex, we were both in an online relationship and I never had something close to a relationship. I always neglected my love feelings, and ignored those things growing up. Now that I’m almost 20, thinking of love annoys me bc of what happened. After a month or 2 of knowing each other, she told me she loved me first, and I felt the same and we became a couple, a foreign concept to me, was a reality, and I was so happy. I was so confused but thought maybe it was a good choice in my life. We stayed together for some weeks I was so naive to think an online relationship could remotely work. Long story short, she found someone else while we were together and didn’t know how to tell me that she found someone and the only thing they did together so far, was have sex while camping, where they met. 

What hurts me the most isn’t the breakup itself, but to know all those affection words we shared, all those warm moments I felt, every I love you, to think someone loved me, was all fake, and it damaged me so much I had to attend therapy and almost took my own life that day. I was there for her, every time, supporting her, listening, when her ex manipulated her for explicit content, I was there and always  looking out for her bc I truly cared about her and she played an act just for a dick, and even to this day I still don’t understand why she would do what she did. I don’t trust people, but I opened my feelings for someone and I regret it. Getting over it has been hard, I skipped a lot of details and moments but point is, I can’t trust someone saying they love me, to have a relationship, to love someone, I can’t and it hurts.

I don’t wanna blame her but she hurt me so much and I can’t forgive her for what she did. So easy to just leave someone huh? Just like that, when she told me she loved me, only to break my heart, for such a dumb reason, I’m just that insignificant to her. I felt used, I m frustrated and powerless, and I hate the intrusive thoughts I get, reminding me how much of a fraud I lived and how I can’t trust people again, I’m scared to trust or love someone, but now that I felt that feeling once, I miss it.

I asked if he wanted to meet at New Years' or some other time and if he'd like some gifts or not.

793,zc031e,greeneyedhaze,"It is done. My father has officially walked out on me, but this was not on his own merit, it was on mine. I once came from a beautiful curly brown haired man, one with green eyes and funny wit. He was always the fun one. Everyone just loved him. All my little friends would just adore his personality and lack of authority. He had far less responsibility. It was given all to my mother. My father was not really that of a father, he was a dad and always was, until now. I feel that because he won't be here every weekend like he was to take me out to dinner or watch movies on television in the living room with me. He is not my dad anymore. He is a father. The memories are still there, they will never go anywhere else. 

After many weekends of misunderstood arguments, which turned into years of such became monotonous. After the back and forth toxicity of name calling and frustration, and not to mention puberty and my diagnosed clinal depression didn't help so much either. No matter what happens, he will never understand being the narcissist he is that he is always wrong, but it is not his fault. I do not want to point my fingers like he does and blame someone for his insanity but I feel I need to for this to be resolved. For my own sanity to be resolved. Maybe it was when he was first introduced to drugs and rock n roll by his older brothers. He was just an innocent boy then. Perhaps it was the extremes of his parent's unhealthy relationship and the cheating, of course. Was it possibly having major anxiety and it never being treated growing up. This all led to my dad's unfortunate future with me.

Over my 20 years of bittersweet life, we've shared so many good and bad times together and as a family. Too many good ones, too many bad. That's the thing with my father is that we'd gotten so close to each other that distance was much needed. It had been for a while but I wasn't ready to say a temporary good bye to him. Now it is very permanent. I didn't want it to be but I know if this kept on, we will have a relationship quite similar to him and his father. I rather not explain it, but it is extremely unhealthy. My grandfather is a bastard. I still love him; he's family..but he is a bastard.

Until my father is ready to get some mental help and by that I mean see a therapist and get back on stable medication, I will be ready to resume the dad and daughter bond we used to have oh so dearly...But, you see, this is not saying much at all because..that will never happen. Ever.

 I have always been my dada's sweet little angel but that part of my life is now gone forever. I at least have my dreams and pictures to remember him by. Memories are all we have in this present life and I'm quite thankful for that. Our relationship was here for a moment and now it is gone. I pray that you all have a loving and blessed life with your dad. Just know he loves you more than words could ever explain. :)

799,zc0fyo,-GeorgeMZ-,"Well I'm not the kind of person that feels lonely all the time, actually I love being alone but man, not talking to anyone (except my family) for months is actually killing me slowly.

I little bit of context, I know there are worst scenarios than mine but I suppose I got to my top of loneliness, so I'm 18 and I got a virtual job on August so I don't have to leave my house for anything other than buy things and so. I live with my parents and my sister, I love them and I get along with them, I stopped going to gym and I switched to calisthenics which is something you can do in your home.

The problem is that despite going to the gym I just couldn't talked to anyone in a daily basis and being around ppl was like the social interaction I used to had, just being there was good in some way, I pushed away all my friends because they had kinda a toxic life and habits, I only talk with two guys but they aren't the type of ppl you talk your problems with, they are more than personal growth and stuff.

My ex best friend turned into someone I don't recognize, she started having toxic habits and well I tried to recover her but I just couldn't and I pushed her away. 

Now the only person I could rely on, is gone and for me is really difficult to talk about my problems so that's why pushing her away was really hard for me.

I guess I need to go outside and make more friends but I don't want to go to a club just to find ppl I don't like because I don't like parties lol, so I really need someone I can rely on but they need to be outside my social circle since my nuclear family is there for me but for other things (I guess someone can feel the same with their family) and I can tell the same thing for my two friends so at the very end I really feel lonely cause I have no one I can tell my things and problems.

I'm just sitting here, in the dark, sitting by myself.

Spent the last few hours coding a dice game in Python based upon a drinking game my friends and I used to play.

Currently, watching some movies on my computer.  My wife is in the other room asleep, hating me as usual.  Recently we've been fighting because she's been making fun of me and I've actually been sticking up for myself.  First time in 10 years or marriage.

The kids are either at their friend's houses, or at grandma's spending the night.

Most of my time, I'm by myself, either on the road doing another IT computer or network install, working on coding  projects in pursuit of my second degree, or trying to console my daughter from getting yelled at by her mom.

810,zc1qx8,Practical_Step_3930,"I haven't spoken to them in 12 weeks last thing we spoke about was how I was nervous about starting school, since I did all of 9th grade online because my social anxiety is incredibly bad so I was anxious about 10th grade. 

They werent really helpful and basically just told me it was fine, even when I confided I was having a really hard time they basically just skirted over what I was tryna say.

I dm'd them today basically just said 'yo I have a question and your the only person I can ask so please answer honestly' once/if they reply I'm gonna ask what's wrong with me. I don't know why but, I've been ostracized and made fun of for no reason since KG I'm not sure what I did in KG to make all my years in my old school lonely but 5 year old me fucked up since in a small class of 20 kids I never made friends. 

I'm in highschool now and still can't make any but it's worse this time since I have awful self esteem, maybe it's from all those years of being ostracized for no reason I can figure out but who knows. 

I've tried really hard to understand. I infact didn't even realize how much I was made fun of or how lonley I was even way back when I was 8 until I was cleaning out my room and found an old school worksheet that we had to do at the end of the year which was basically a recap of our year some of the notable questions were 'whos your best friend's 'what do you like about your friend's?' and I left one of them blank and wrote I didn't have any on the other one.

Years later come 8th grade and were talking about shit and my 1 'friend' mentions how much I was made fun of and I simply didnt recall half of it/ didn't even know I was being fucked with in the scenarios she gave.

I don't know what's wrong with me since no one else I went to that school with was ostracized the way I was. Right now I still have no one whatever was wrong with me then is probably worse now and I can't figure out what it is. 

I just want an answer or should I not ask and delete the message? It's 12:am and I asked on something with deletable messages should I just not ask? I'm conflicted since the more I think about it the more I feel like she'll think I'm being weird randomly asking that but, I feel so alone and just want to understand what went wrong. I cry myself to sleep since I can't understand why my life is the way it is.

I can handle people exchanging words with eachother that arent me, but ive been literally completely outcasted... never checked on, if I vent, no one listens but I listen to them.

Another time, he and his yearbook club went to the mountains about three hours away from our town for a few days.

They were together five years. I'm pretty sure they've had sex, at least once. It just makes me insecure because I'm miles behind him.

Along the way, I’ve unfortunately bumped into far too many married/attached/engaged men which I quickly ended the conversations upon finding out. This made my dating life pretty much non-existent.

Recently, i met someone that finally made me feel like i really connected with him. I had just spent weeks talking with him. Yet somehow, my gut was telling me this whole thing is too good to be true. So i did dug a little deeper into his online presence and sure enough, i find out that he’s attached.

Because of this, it's very hard for me to initiate the conversation first with someone, as Idk what to say and always think like ""Wait, what am I supposed to say now, lol?"". Plus I'm a very shy person. I love playing games, comforting ppl, listening to music, and chatting with strangers on Reddit to make friends with them (or wasting my time on Reddit lol). English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has the same gender, and perhaps something in common. If we don't have anything in common, that's OK too \^\^. Hopefully I will find some1 that will stick around.

With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ Reddit chat sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-04 08:55:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,4,/r/lonely/comments/zc4u7w/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,1,18M Hi everyone!

847,zc50h0,RevolutionaryAd5143,"I read a post here where someone was worried that no one would date a person with no friends. He felt that women judge a man by his social circle, but I guess that could go either way. 
I felt the old doubts surface again, is there something wrong with me, because I don't have any real life friends? That is a reflection of a thought: Do people think there's something wrong with me because I don't have any friends? 
I've given this a lot of thought over the years and I never could figure out if there is. 
I also found out that it's a toxic, haunting and frustrating thing to think: ""What's wrong with me?"" and never getting an answer. I've asked my childhood friends and people from my past about it, never getting an answer. Looking back, that was a pitiful, sad and unfair thing to ask, but we do that kind of thing sometimes, when wallowing in our own heads. 
It took a lot of acceptance practices to come to think that it's alright if there is something wrong with me, but there might not be. Also if there is something wrong with me, but I can't see it to the death of me, maybe it's just who I am and I can change for so much. 
My question is; do you think that there is something wrong with lonely people and if so do other than lonely people think that?",2022-12-04 09:06:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606543266,2,/r/lonely/comments/zc50h0/is_there_something_wrong_with_lonely_people/,,0,6,Is there something wrong with lonely people?

861,zc6oy9,MeanCat4,"I am alone my whole life. I remember very few really happy times of my life and they seems so distant like a dream. I have way passed my 40s, without my own family, not a girlfriend in my whole life since I am not much behind it, (I often say that I find courageous men that committed with a woman), the last 8 years in another country searching for job and the last month unemployed. I stay at home now most of the time searching to make economy (I just cooked 2 eggs for lunch with bread). I hope that the situation will change soon. Often I feel tired all this. I remember a girl years ago, she found me at a school sitting alone on a distant area away from the others and she said to me: ""you hate people"". Who knows. For sure I am extremely severe of other people (but also to myself) and I stay away even if I participate in groups activities. If someone ask me to telephone to a friend of mine because of something happened I really don't have a single telephone number. How my life became like this I really don't know. The only thing I remember since my childhood was others don't make friendship with me or make funny of me (even a couple of women teachers at the kinder garden). Alone since then. Even my own family couldn't understand or help my situation. Now I feel already my sister and her husband back in my country searching to appropriate of what I have. I lost both my parents the last few years. I remember them on feet when they said to me goodbye when I went to this country and then both for different reasons mostly at bed since till their death. I often feel guilty of their deaths regardless if they were old. Going to another country it was probably the first really important decision I made alone in my life but it doesn't go well right now. The economy is not good and my profession like years ago in my country, is the first to feel it. Its the first time I write all this and I probably I will cancel it after a few days. I hate the place I am now but at the same time I know that there is no future also going back to my country. Its like the entire universe since my birth has decided that I will not be happy in this life. I see often really difficult situations with other people and I thing that maybe I am just looking the worse and not the good but its difficult doing like that.",2022-12-04 10:49:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1588227281,3,/r/lonely/comments/zc6oy9/an_entire_life_alone/,,0,4,An entire life alone.

Sometimes I engage online with people based on similar interests (mostly ancient history, music, magic, astrology, philosophy), but they're not close, they already have their live. And IRL...I don't have anyone.

I've been physically sick for 7 years, which had me cut all bonds with the friends I had before, for several reasons : 1/ they didn't understand my illness and took personnally that I kept canceling plans 2/ this hardship triggered what I think might be the beginning of a spiritual awakening ; my views have changed and I can no longer make shallow encounters, I need authentic connections 3/ I work from home because it's the lifestyle that suits me best. 

Yesterday I had a painful experience and realized that in this case, I have no one to turn to. I'm not looking for someone to fix my problems ; I just want to know that someone, somewhere cares for me. I'm also anxious because at my age, everybody already has their solid group of friends, spouse, etc...so it's becoming harder to connect.

Go gym. Go to work. Come home. Eat. Repeat. But at the end it's like I'm just with myself and no one around. I wouldnt say it makes me depressed but its certainly a feeling of deep sadness. I wish there was more real life connection to life rather than online connections. Someone who's actually there right infront of me talking and chilling.

941,zciu9j,unohdettusaasta,"And I'm starting to think I'm incapable of doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember first noticing this in high school. I would see people acting super excited when their friends had something good happen and thinking: ""Is that really necessary? Why are they putting on this act of being super happy when it's not even their own success? They do realize they come off as incredibly insincere and fake, why not just congratulate them and move on?""

&amp;#x200B;

Later on in life I realized that it is possible to experience genuine happiness about something that happened to someone other than yourself. Or atleast I assume it is? I really wouldn't know. I can confidently say that I've never heard about something positive happening to a friend or relative and shared in their joy.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I remember my mom telling me the news that my cousin's youngest daughter was in the hospital because of an infection and all I could muster was an ""OK"". She could've told me that she bought a pair of shoes and it would have had a similar impact on my day.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel really disconnected from everyone around me. I can go months without talking to someone and not give it a second thought, only to resume as if no time had passed, as if it was a completely normal thing to do. Trying to connect with people and form genuine friendships seems pointless since I seem to lack the capability to truly care about anyone other than myself.

&amp;#x200B;

This can't be how most people behave, can it? When a friend or relative tells you about something good that happened to them, do you truly, genuinely feel happy for them? Or do you act enthusiastic out of courtesy? Conversely, if something bad were to befall them, do you feel genuine concern for them?",2022-12-04 19:23:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664658431,1,/r/lonely/comments/zciu9j/i_dont_think_ive_ever_truly_cared_about_anyone/,,0,0,I don't think I've ever truly cared about anyone

960,zcl8gl,AzulaAnon,"I’ve (21F) always tried to treat my friends the way I’d want to be treated. I made myself available for anything at any time, knowing how challenging it can be to do everything on your own. I made it a priority to listen to and understand them, because I know how painful it can be to feel invalidated. I was their support even when they made mistakes, because I know how important it is to be in a friendship with someone you can learn from and grow with. I give them the best I can offer, even during low points in my life where everything I had left probably should’ve been given to myself.

I’ve lost my best friend. After three years of helping her (21F) through three abusive relationships (and a good chunk of toxic friendships), getting her into college, getting her into and out of her first apartment, helping her rebuild a connection with her family, helping her get jobs, and encouraging her through depression, trauma, and anxiety…she left.
She finally found a man (21M) who treats her with love, kindness, and compassion - another best friend she can rely on for anything. I’ve helped her through every step she needed to take to get to where she is today, and I couldn’t be more proud of her. But she was all I had left. 

I’ve exhausted myself so much in all of these friendships that I don’t feel like I have anything else to give anymore. I know that after some time, people naturally grow apart and move on to other relationships and stages of life. Yet, after so many years of reflecting on my friendships and why they’ve ended, that’s never felt like the case. Although, as I’m writing this, maybe it happens because I’ve fulfilled my purpose for their life. Just maybe, I fulfill them before I ever have the chance to let them fulfill me.

Or maybe, that’s the only coping mechanism I have against the painful reality that some people just leave.


tl;dr - Coping with the loss of my closest friend and feeling exhausted by sacrificing all of my resources to them and others. Not looking for advice necessarily, just feeling like I’ve been wiped of everything I have to offer to others and myself",2022-12-04 20:50:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607064003,2,/r/lonely/comments/zcl8gl/when_friends_come_nothing_can_stop_them_from_going/,,0,3,"when friends come, nothing can stop them from going"

962,zclcbu,oluky2022,"I (30M) used to be a happy fellow. I enjoyed staying with friends and they enjoyed my presence. I was the one that was cheering others up a made jokes and so on.

The only thing that was always scaring me deep inside was that I knew I was gay and was afraid to share it with anyone. And tried to convince myself it's not true.

When I was 26/27 I realized I couldn't keep going like that after a break up with a girl for obvious reasons. I felt so lonely and empty. I joined a gay dating site and after some terrible experiences found a really nice guy. We fell in love and after couple is months I moved to his place.

We were working on his house pretty hard. I was taking care of our (his) dog and tried to work on the house as much as possible as his work was hard and he was not at home very often.

I was about to propose after 3 years together, but felt there was something rotten. He was in a very bad mood and was not nice to me for some time. Once I couldn't handle it anymore and asked him wether there was someone else. It started a conversation which led to a break up. I didn't see it coming at all, but he told me after some time that he was not in love me for a long time. He felt like it for almost 2 years. Out of 3 years relationship. It devastated me. It's been 6 months and I still don't know what to do with my life. I lost him, I lost our dog, I lost our home. All I was left with were my clothes and my laptop.

Every night I dream about him and how I return home. Every morning I cry for him. I even selfishly tried to find someone else to forget, but it only led to another broken heart (not mine).

I have nothing to live for. I hate myself for not being able to save the relationship, I hate myself for not being able to recover and for breaking someone's heart.

I consider killing myself every day since. As I have nothing to live for. I am no longer the happy guy.

999,zcr1r8,throwawaydeeznuts100,"I get literally zero texts from anybody everyday, I quite literally don't talk to anybody almost all day, everyday. It's very lonely not only because I have nobody but also because I feel like I'm the only one who has absolutely no one in my life. The isolation is starting to drive me insane but I can't make or maintain friendships anymore. Its been more or less like this for the past 2-3 years and I've just gotten used to it but it definitely has taken a toll on my mental health. I try to make online friends but they eventually fall out, sometimes because they just don't seem interested and sometimes because I just can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I hate hearing social things saying to ""bring your friends"" or something pertaining to friends, I have nobody I can call or refer to for anything. I hate going to school seeing people with their friend groups and even the loneliest of people have at least 1 or 2 friends. I hate going to school and interacting with nobody, sitting by myself at lunch just to come home to nobody again. My family has become so distant and we don't ever talk and the only person I'm close to (my mom) is hardly home because of work or she's out somewhere. When a girl entered my life as my only romantic interest, I became so attached to her, she was my priority in life. Tbh my social life improved when she was around a bit but just went back to how it was when she left my life.

1003,zcrlgs,fyrixias,"I have people. Like, a circle of over 10 at least. But you know the problem with them all is that they've evolved into just names on a list. They don't talk to me most of the time and I'm the one always having to take the brunt of the conversation, to even start them and yet I'm the introverted one.

I don't know when I was assigned this position but I don't quite like it.

I envy friend circles that are healthy. The ones where people hang out most of the time. They interact. They know what another is thinking. People busting eachother's balls and not getting into fights over it. Supportive. Caring. Trading off interests and working with interests.

I don't have any of that. I mean, I thought I did with some of the people I've associated and continue to associate with. But I don't, those interests are just simply the welcoming part of a friendship but they don't carry the friendship to have it work.

So things just devolve into long periods of silence and it's aggravating to deal with. I'm always there, waiting for people to say something to me so I don't have to be the one who feels like they're bothering others. Never comes.

And trust me, I've tried getting rid of these friends but then the loneliness hits me very hard and I just end up accepting the reality.

1014,zct93m,IlIllIllIIlIl,"I (19M) have Crohn’s Disease and recently diagnosed a few months ago with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). I have been struggling a lot with these illnesses as well as severe depression a lot. I feel extremely lonely everyday because while everyone else my age lives a normal life of going to college, I am stuck living in pain everyday at home. I have tried to start college multiple times but have had to stop due to being admitted to the hospital due to my chronic illnesses. 

I feel like no one likes me or understands the amount of pain I go through everyday. Due to my PSC diagnosis and the life expectancy I have seen on the internet, I don’t want to be lonely for the rest of the time left I have here. I have tried multiple times to talk to girls but every single one of them has rejected me which has made me feel ugly and that I’ll never get a girlfriend. It just feels like nothing good will happen in my life. 

At this point, the thought of death feels like an escape because I won’t have to suffer with these illnesses, loneliness, and would bring relief to me. But, I don’t want to bring that pain to my family. 

So I have decided to just suffer through the remaining 10-15 years I have left according to what I have read on the internet and hope that something in those years will change my thoughts. But as of right now, I have not found it.

1024,zcu7qs,AnimateStoneOcean,"God I hate this feeling. It’s so hard to describe what it is. Is it sexual or romantic desire and is there even a difference? Is it possible to be pleased with just one and not the other? I just I don’t know what I want anymore. I mean I know how I want to feel and that is with the void in my soul filled but I don’t know what I need to fill it. Maybe I can delude my thoughts with religious ideas to believe in some magic man to make my pain go away. It’s just like painful, not in a way where I need it to go away immediately or I’m gonna pull the trigger because it hurts so bad, more like a slow burn. I feel starved almost, yeah, starved is a good way to describe my condition. I want to say I’m starved from touch or relationships or something of that nature but I don’t know if that’s the case, all I know is the best way to describe my pain is starved. It’s a perpetual feeling of seeing that x on the far right of your phone on snap chat, knowing the unadded you and you have no idea what you did wrong. It’s that feeling but perpetual, it doesn’t really go away no matter what I do. I used to just smoke and I’d be fine but I can’t do that anymore. I don’t even know why I quit at this point I just decided I wouldn’t smoke so I’m not going to. I don’t like this feeling, it’s really uncomfortable and just a buzzkill. 
I never have tried to kill myself but I used to just lie in bed and pray to god that he would kill me. I did this for 2 years. I wasn’t even Christian, I just hoped that if he was real he would hear me and put me out of my misery. Now I lay in bed and just feel void. I don’t know what I want, I don’t want to die anymore no, but I don’t want to live much either. I’m not super depressed but I’m not happy either. I’m just here, alive void of emotion. Sometimes I want to feel pain so I can feel anything at all. I cloud my days with laughs and try as hard as I can to put up a happy facade at school but on the inside I’m truly empty. I feel big emotions, like I’m so stoked about my role, but I’m so nervous that when this is over I’ll go back to feeling nothing, or an even bigger feeling of nothing and purposeless

1042,zcvny7,throwawayacc28377473,"17 years is a long time to be feeling lonely. I learned in my psychology class that lack of physical touch and proper socialization stunts growth and brain development because you’re not releasing proper hormones.  

Imagine the surprise when I heard that.

I have lacked physical touch aside from my mom. I have lacked close friendships. I feel so lonely like there’s a hole in my chest and that I’m dying. 

I have never gotten physical touch regularly from friends. 

I keep telling myself “just one more day” but I feel so lonely it’s painful. I want a meaningful connection.

I want to laugh and talk to people too. I want to smile and feel good and have conversations that have substance.

I feel like I’m going to kill myself if I don’t get any connection. It’s been long enough. I’m tired. I want to feel loved. 

I wonder if maybe I’m just depressed. I have no real life close friends whom I talk to everyday. I am alone at school except for people I know. I am always the last choice. 

Maybe loneliness is making me depressed. I feel so alone. I feel like dying is more peaceful than this. Feeling this feeling makes me so frustrated and angry I want to rip my heart out and claw out my throat.

I can’t do this. I know I’m bad at approaching and saying hi consistently but it’s not even my fault at this point. I’ve never gotten the opportunity to learn. I’m normal too. Sometimes people straight up ignore me and it’s so fucking rude. 

Why can’t people treat me like a human being? I’d be embarrassed if I treated someone the way people treat me. I’m normal. I look and act normal.

1044,zcvvcn,Plus_Calligrapher412,"I've lived an interesting life (like the Chinese curse).  Had mountains of friends when I was a kid in late 60s and into the 70s.  School was a challenge, was bounced out to another institution and lost contact with most of my friends freshmen year.  Struggled in new school, bullies, alcohol-pot, being an outsider, got out of there and went off to college in 79.  

College I was a blank slate and bloomed, tons of friends, got in shape, had lots of  wonderful and many beautiful girlfriends.  Depression was around my brain when i was 12, but it took off in college.  Graduated, corporate sales jobs - go- go 80s.  Lost contact with college friends, took transfers here and there.  The one woman, who was so funny and looked like a goddess dumped me two years out of school.  She was in London and I was in Philadelphia at the time - long distance just is too difficult.  Depression and booze we intense and I crashed when I was 31.  Everyone I knew during that period was married or getting married.  i was popping in and out of psych wards and getting sober - my life crashed.

I few years later I pulled things back together, worked until I was 52 and walked away from corporate sales.  i have lots of nieces and nephews, all grown up, but no kids of my own.  I try to do things where I will meet or at least talk to people.  I take painting classes, go to the gym.  However, the most social thing I get is a compliment on a painting I doing or I will have a little conversation with someone at the gym about certain exercises.  Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled to talk to someone about their cardio program (as I did today).  Just the interaction makes me a little bit more positive about life.  

I don't know how you meet people at my age.  What groups or clubs or activities should I investigate?

1049,zcw7ln,[deleted],"it’s been a while since i’ve self harmed. i selfharmed from when i was 13-14, now I’m 15. 


I feel like i’m wasting away my high school years. My 9th grade year consisted of me having friends but i was a coward. i was too much of a coward to make new friends, plus i was stuck in a toxic friendship that limited my every action. Now that i’ve left, i thought my school year would be good but i guess it didn’t work out.


i still have a few people i talk to. i’m in a different lunch period from the people i’d talk to. i sit alone at lunch, either on my phone or doing my homework. I’ve tried doing clubs but the loneliness still lingers with me.


i always sit by myself in clubs. i’m too much of a coward to go up to people. i feel like everyone there hates me - whenever i speak, i feel as if they’re toning me out. i remember once, i left multiple times during a meeting; just to go cry in the bathroom.


i feel like harming myself to deal with situations like these. i hate how my mind goes straight to this yk? id deal with a sudden rush of emotions and i want to hurt myself. also what seems pathetic of this is that i want people to see it. my younger self who hid the scratches would’ve hated me for doing this but i just want someone to go up to me and ask if everything’s alright. i don’t wanna go down the self harming route just for help.


i’ve been trying journaling out to counter these thoughts. i guess it’s fun but it doesn’t get rid of the feeling. i feel like if i start self harming again that i’d go deeper than my standard cat scratches and hitting that didn’t leave anything permanent.

People seem to think that you are lonely because you don’t have anyone around you or to talk to or basically it is the absence of people around you.

The truth is it happens when you lose connection with yourself. You don’t feel like you, you devalue yourself, you dislike who you are and you often wonder if you are the kind of person people want to be with. This makes you feel lonely. It is coming from within, from your own self doubts and missing connection with the part of you that often needs to feel loved and connected, not by others but you. 

I would like to mention that I too feel lonely, quite frequently, I also wonder everything I mentioned above and it took some real time and efforts to realise that I am the reason I am lonely and it’s not the absence of people around me. So now I am working on it, working on being happy in myself and being satisfied with who I am. I wish everyone of you could do that too and trust me if I can, you can too :))",2022-12-05 05:34:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644182091,7,/r/lonely/comments/zcy578/the_misconception_about_loneliness/,,0,6,The misconception about loneliness
1059,zcy6ie,Obvious-Statement503,"I’ve dealt with this stupid feeling of loneliness for 8 years. It’s gotten worse over the years. I have people who care for me; but, I feel like nobody sees me. 

I feel like everyone only sees me as the happy go lucky person because I’m always smiling, and a friendly person. But, that’s only because I’m around people; my mind isn’t able to focus on being alone at that moment. 

God, this feeling only gets worse at night. I’ve gone through some mental abuse, I’ve just recently broke up with my ex of four years; I don’t have anyone. There’s people I go to when I get this way; but, it’s not the same when it’s through texts. 

Feeling this way has been a plague over my life. I know I’m not alone, but, I can’t help but feel alone. I don’t get why I have to be someone who has to go through this. 

Why can’t I just be free? Why can’t I be alone with my thoughts anymore; without my thoughts suffocating me? As soon as it’s nighttime, and I’m alone in my room, the past rushes through my fucking mind. It all runs through me. It’s killing me. 

I don’t want to be here. I want to be with someone who can help me. A friend is all I’d need. But, nobody is responding. I have nobody. 

It hurts so much more knowing that I can help so many people, and people come to me when shit gets tough. Yet, I can’t help myself, nor does anyone return the favor of helping. Very few people I talk to actually know how to help. But, when I need help, they’re dont respond. 

I feel like my mind is dying. I just want to push passed everything that’s gone through my life. I want be whole again. I want to be me again. 

Is that too much to ask for? Just to be happy? To not feel like I have nobody? Why does nobody see what the hell is going on under the surface of my smile?

Why am I trapped inside this horrible shell of a deadman’s mind? I just wish to be okay with everything I’ve gone through, accept it all, and move on to be happy. 

I was mentally abused when I was 14, and that caused all of this to get so much worse. I was blamed for the person who abused me’s suicide; and that sent me so far down a dark pathway. I can’t- it’s so hard to accept everything that’s happened. I never got any kind of closure from them. 

So, now, I’ve got to deal with everything. I’ve got to live in torment because of their actions. I’ve wanted to die so many times in the past. I wanted my mind to die, so I can become a new me. I want the old me to leave me for good. I want to be someone new. 

I’m doing my best at forgiving that person. But, it’s so fucking hard to do that. I just want to accept it all, and move on. I’m so tired of having it all rush back to me all at once. I just want it gone. 

How do I move on? How do I make it passed the trauma? How do I get over the pain? Why did I have to go through it? Why me? Why must I suffer? Why can’t I be free? 

I hate what I’ve gone through. I want to go to therapy, but don’t have money for it. What can I do to get out of the room I’m trapped in?",2022-12-05 05:36:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647284709,10,/r/lonely/comments/zcy6ie/19_felt_alone_since_11/,,0,2,"19, felt alone since 11"

1086,zd18gt,Any_Indication_2846,"Honestly, the older I get the more aware of how terrified of the people around me I am. I find myself dreaming about having friends or even falling in love some day, but the second I do anything to better my situation I freeze. I find my mind wandering and wondering if anything I can do will actually lead to the one dream I've ever had.

Recently, I pushed myself and asked a girl  I was interested in to coffee just to chat. I'm glad I did even though she ghosted me after. It was nice to pretend I wasn't absolutely terrified for once. I couldn't help but sit there and think about how even if things worked out they weren't going to last. What's going to stop her for moving on the first chance she gets? Is it really worth the potential pain to trust her? So far, evidently not. 

At the end of the day I know these anxious thoughts will only lead me to ruin, but I'm still figuring out how to cope with them to be frank. Every bone in my body is terrified of being hurt by people, but I love people too much to not socialize. Being socially anxious has lead to complete torment for me, and at this point I'm just pushing myself to branch out more and fight my inner instincts to hide and be alone. 

I constantly feel like my life is falling apart despite having a family that loves me, a stable job, and great grades in my classes. I'm set to go into a field that makes a decent amount, and I have never gone without a roof over my head. My anxiety still manages to make my day to day feel worse than it is and I hate it. I hate having such a pointless weight on my shoulders, and to be frank I'm trying everything in my power to just push through and find the right balance in my life.

At the end of the day I'm doing better than I think I am, and honestly I make progress every day whether I feel it or not.",2022-12-05 08:25:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617829050,1,/r/lonely/comments/zd18gt/im_just_scared_to_be_honest/,,0,2,I'm just scared to be honest

1095,zd2z4c,fuckthisdumbshit1,"Lately I find myself stuck on the thought of love. Ive been stuck on a kick of watching mostly romance/romcom anime lately and.. it makes me sad, in a way. Its.. watching these beautiful, heart wrenching stories play out, that leaves me with a bittersweet feeling. Like theres a hollow in my chest. And the more i think about it, hell I knew what it was without having to think i just didnt want to acknowledge it.  The more I can feel how.. lonely I am.

I hate saying that. Its like, theres not a better way to put it but it still sounds so fucking pityseeking. But it is what it is. Heres a little perspective and backstory, for those that bothered themselves enough to read this far. Im a 25 year old young man, ill be 26 in January. Not old, not a kid anymore entirely. I lost my father almost year ago, itll be a year in about 2 weeks.. Ive been dealing with the emotional process of that. But it makes me think like.. the clocks ticking. Like.. you werent able to have your father meet whoever would be your wife. Or your kids. It fills me with regret, but not like... i wish i had done this. More like... seeing people in love in the world around me, my friends, my family. Watching love stories unfold in different shows. Seeing all the light and love glowing in the world.. Selfishly.. i find myself wanting some for myself more than ever.

I want the love story. I want the fireworks blazing in the sky, so bright you see them when you close your eyes. I want to not even notice them, like a tv on mute, and watch the one i loves eyes light up at the sight of them. I want to able to wrap up in a blanket with hot chocolate when its cold, and have someone to share it with. I want someone who will call me so dumb, all while smiling so beautifully my heart could melt. I want to love someone. I want to be loved. 

Im sorry for the long read. Im not sure if any of this will make any sense to anyone else. I feel like im half crazed anyway writing this. 
My hearts just been hurting lately, and i dont know what step to take. Im afraid to. Since my fathers passing.. everythings a lot scarier. And trying to put yourself out there and look for love, is so fucking scary now. But thats all i can think about. I dont know whats changed, because for the longest while i had honestly given up on it. Just stopped trying, or even hoping. Accepting a life of solitude. Id have my books and my games. But now... this last month... all i can think of is finding someone who i cant wait to grow old with. 

Its getting late now. Ive been typing, deleting and trying to translate what my brains doing, for the better part of an hour now. Again, if you even made it this far, im sorry for the read. Im also sorry just.. for this post. Im not looking to get any kind pity votes, or anything.. i just needed to able to get my thoughts and my feelings out, and im not the kind of person who can just write it on a piece of paper and throw it away. Oh well.

I joined this community in a drunken stupor. I want to drink myself to sleep every night. I want to come home to someone who loves me unconditionally and feel like I deserve it. But I get told I’m fat and boring from romantic partners, even though they tell me I’m good looking and it’s hard to focus on the positives when they’re outnumbered by the negatives. Especially when my mother never misses the chance to tell me I’m unhealthy, unclean and fat and she tells me she worries about my physical well-being. I get performance anxiety, low confidence and insecurities about my physical, emotional and mental health to the point where I get mental breakdowns, which I think turns my romantic partners off. I love my career more than anything and apparently that’s not healthy if I don’t have hobbies. What’s the point of being good looking if it’s fleeting? I think I’m so insecure I’ll just see the positives in anyone and love them for all they are, making me the one that gets dumped in the end. I got so hurt when a friends boyfriend didn’t invite me to their birthday party and when my friend with benefits texted me to say we were done. I have lots of close friends who tel me they love me but clearly I rather cry about those who don’t want my attention. I just want the attention of those who don’t want me and I hate myself for being so ungrateful.

All of this boosts my anxiety and seeing people I knew do well in life just makes me even more hollow from inside, as if I was never the same as them once (This is not jealousy but the pain of knowing that I can achieve all that too if I just even have a little will for life). It feels isolating as if my whole will, my personality is dying everyday from inside, isolating me from everyone else, my surroundings and myself.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ This platform sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-05 16:24:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,2,/r/lonely/comments/zdbfgz/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,2,18M Hi everyone!

1136,zdbu72,Ohboysomiserable,"All I got is my family. I know that I have more than some people do cause some don't even have family or have a toxic, abusive one. But does it really matter? Started university 2 months ago, getting really good grades so far, and I've never been a good student, so it's something new. But it doesn't matter to me. Why should the grades matter if all I ever do is spend my time alone. I haven't had a social life since 8 years. Just some casual friendships when we were talking to each other like 5 times a year.

I spend entire days alone, and university is the only thing that keeps me going, as it's the only opportunity to spend some time with people. I prefer being there over sitting at home. It was my birthday tomorrow. Got some wishes, but almost all of them were from my family. Only 2 people outside my family wished my happy birthday, but we don't even talk to each other, so whatever. I don't remember the last time I had the opportunity to celebrate my birthday with someone(maybe about 10 years ago). I'm lucky that I have family, so they always buy me something, and get me a birthday cake most of the times.

But family can't replace friendships, relationships, and all the memories you make with your peers. It's good to have family, but it sucks to have no one to talk to or no friends to hang out with. Tried socializing more, but I'm always stuck at the stage of just being a person you talk to when you're at school, work, and outside of these places we never talk. Yeah, I have some people at my university that I can talk to, but we don't talk to each other outside of university. I'm tired of this loner life. Always loved christmas, but for the last few years it just reminds me how alone I am.

I can see people partying at New Year's Eve, and I always have nowhere to go. Last year I tried to ask 2 of my friends what they were doing at New Year's Eve, and they said I could come because there would be only 2 of them, and we all knew each other so it wasn't a problem. But they never reached back to me, so it never happened.

1154,zdec35,Manus_2,"I want to change my life so badly, but I just feel so unbelievably stuck. I've got decades of learned helplessness to overcome, and getting to where I want to be in life just feels like staring up at a distant blue sky from the bottom of a deep dark well. Life was hard enough for me as it is, but I also recently experienced my first ever seizure, and although I'm not officially diagnosed yet, I've essentially got epilepsy to deal with now as well, on top of everything else. Ultimately, I just want to get to a place in life where I can bring happiness/joy to other people's lives, and that in return I can receive their love, attention and concern. It's just really awful drifting through life and knowing that, besides immediate family, nobody really knows about you, or cares about you. 

To be honest, I'm jealous of online entertainers who've managed to make a positive difference in so many people's lives, in terms of providing content that allows someone the opportunity to laugh or unwind after a hard day. It just really sucks not having the kind of personality that other people could find endearing or likable. The real nail in the coffin for me though, is how I'm simply too much of a pussy to put myself out there and try. Being too afraid to try is one of the worst things you can be guilty of, and will guarantee you a lifetime of loneliness and misery. And yet, despite knowing this, I still feel too powerless to feel like I could really, truly change for the better. 

Whether it's a famous musician, or some obscure dude on YouTube who makes a few people laugh/smile, they'll always have people out there who'll love them and care about them. Regardless of how obscure or well-known they are, it must be fantastic to know that you've made other people's lives better. It's extremely/painfully lonely when you're just some nobody, like me, that's floundered around from failed friendship to failed friendship, and the only influence you've had on others boils down to ultimately either being negative or insignificant. You don't have the solace that comes from knowing that, somewhere out there, there's people who're fans of what you do, and love/care about you for the laughs/smiles you've been able to give them.  

**TL;DR:** I really wish I could give something positive to the world and have an audience of people who care about me, instead of being some lonely nobody who's just a buzzkill.",2022-12-05 18:04:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1463526987,7,/r/lonely/comments/zdec35/painfully_lonely_im_31_still_live_at_home_and_ive/,,0,4,"Painfully lonely.

1161,zdfrvy,snoopychien,"Hi, it’s my first time posting in a subreddit like this so please be kind.  I guess I just came here to vent because I don’t really have anyone to talk to, but I would greatly appreciate any response. Apologies for any typos or weird grammar, typing on my phone.

I’ve struggled with mental health issues since I was a kid. Just near constant anxiety and depression for the past decade. I am in treatment and have been in treatment for almost a decade. Talk therapy, tried lots of different antidepressants, group therapy, DBT, CBT, and lately, ketamine therapy. 
I’m also in a healthy relationship. My partner is incredibly supportive, patient, and understanding. I can and do talk to him, that’s not the issue. The issue is that I don’t have any friends or anyone else besides my counselor and psychiatrist to talk to. I don’t want to overload my partner, as he is very stressed about work and money. It’s also not reasonable of me to expect him to “be everything” for me. I need to have other outlets, other people I can rely on and go to. I feel like he bears a big burden when it comes to me because I rely on him a lot. He is aware of all of this and I talk to him often about my problems. I can’t go to my parents for support, it’s complicated (there was abuse and neglect) and that’s part of why I’m so depressed and angry lately. I’ve recently started talking about my childhood more, learning about schemas, etc. so there have been a lot of stirred up emotions and thoughts. As for friends, I do have a handful of internet friends that I’ve known for several years, but I deleted Twitter and IG months ago because it was bad for my mental health. I made a Discord and have exchanged phone numbers with a couple online friends, but I let the conversations die out. I stopped replying because I was doing so poorly that I couldn’t even talk to other people and after quarantine happened, I definitely regressed when it comes to social anxiety and social skills. I have no clue what to say, I have no idea if it’s appropriate or “the right thing” to say. I had some IRL friends as well, but they were linked by an ex and I slowly just felt myself growing apart from them. I’m still in a groupchat with them, but I never talk in it. I have nothing in common with them anymore. I’m still a bit weary of COVID when it comes to large groups of people indoors, so I haven’t even been going to my one friend’s band’s shows, which are usually an easy outing for me. There’s a clear beginning and end, I don’t have to hangout after if I don’t want, and there’s no pressure to talk during the show. So, I haven’t seen any of my IRL friends in a year or so now I think. I also don’t work, I very shamefully haven’t worked steadily ever in my life. This is due to mental health struggles. So, I don’t have any work friends either. The only social interaction I get besides my partner, who I live with, is therapy and doctors’ appts. It’s pathetic and sad. I forgot how to be a human. I’m 24 and I don’t know how to make friends or how to even talk to the ones I already have. I have no interest in being friends with my IRL group anymore really, but I feel like a jerk if I reach out to my internet friends after months of them not getting a response from me, only to vent to them because I’m incredibly lonely. I struggle with a lot of shame and I feel like I am defective and that people can tell something is wrong with me. It’s hard for me to even leave the house alone.

I am 30f, with a job and a decent social life, but I could never find a long term partner. My own standards plus confidence issues from being raised by a narcissistic mother and  emotionally absent father have made it close to impossible for me to open up and trust people. Shitty relationships have also not helped. With a mortgage on my hands and a general sentiment of dread, not quite enjoying my job and a pretty repetitive life, I have become the green monster. My stomach turns when I hear workmates talking about how they go on weekend trips, how they split incomes to pay for their home and all the other cute couple things people do. If this is all there is for me, it's pretty sad. I am all by myself and no one really gives a crap. All my friends have their lives and I come back home to the same emptiness every day.

1177,zdion6,Practical_Step_3930,"I have no friends and can't make any. It's not even just not having I talk to no one the whole day. No one even acknowledges me. For example, I'm in school and a girl who sits in front of me didn't have a phone charger and asked the 3 other people sitting around us but didn't ask me.

Very small thing but I'm genuinely invisible no one acknowledges my existence. I'm also pretty sure only like 2 people even know my name.

I was never able to make many friends from my old school (I'm in 10th grade now) old school was KG-8th and for 9th grade, I did online since I have really bad social anxiety and couldn't be in person because of it.

I was actually excited after not hanging out with people my age since I was 12. Even when I was in my old school I wasn't close to anyone but people at least knew who I was, I at least talked to people on a daily basis.

It's so awful now though I go the whole day not saying a single word. I think I didn't say a single word for the entirety of last week.

All of it sucks so much. My school days are miserable but I got through them by just daydreaming or reading to make the time go by. Recently tho my seat was moved in my English class and I sit behind 3 people and next to someone and it's awful. They're all friends and it makes me having no1 so much worse. Hearing them talk about hanging out, and just random shit friends talk about made everything hurt so much more. That's all I've ever wanted, to have friends.

I've had issues making friends since I was young I remember feeling lonely as early as first grade and I used to think getting older would make it better.

It never did tho, when I was 10 I tried to kill myself, it didnt go well all I did was drink hand sanitizer I thought that would kill me, all it did thought was make pretty sick for a day or two after that I was fine.

After that I told myself things would get better in HS I'd get to start fresh away from all my current classmates, I'd finally be able to have friends. Clearly I was wrong.

My home life isn't great either maybe not the worst thing ever but no good. My parents hate me, they've told me this multiple times. So even when I'm home alone because to avoid my parents and siblings scrutiny I just stay in my room by self.

Anyway, my next semester is soon, late January and if by the time school is out and nothing gets better I'm just going to kill myself. I even have a plan, one more thought out than hand sanitizer. I've tried for so long hoping and trying to make it better yet nothing has so if nothing changes soon I'm just done. I don't want to live like this and I don't think I should have to.

I've really tried to get better but, I just cant and I cant even get any real help. I can post as much as I want to try to get advice but, you can't really give specific advice to someone unless you know them all you can give is general shit, like being confident but, that doesn't mean anything.

I'm really hoping something changes, in fact, I need something to change because I just don't wanna live if this is going to be the rest of my life.",2022-12-05 20:32:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646357150,5,/r/lonely/comments/zdion6/alone/,,0,2,Alone

1201,zdmsdx,Responsible-Camp5834,"So I liked this girl back in high school, but I knew she liked another guy. We were good friends, and it fucked me up mentally, and with college rejections, my mind completely crumbled. 

However, I eventually got back and began to focus on myself but I always found myself thinking about her time to time. I want to get over her but I jsut can't seem to. Even after hitting the gym, practicing piano for 3 hrs a day, getting straight As in  college, she comes back from time to time.

I dread texting with her. She would text me out of the blue because she sees me as a friend, but I always kill the conversation. She has hinted that she knew how I felt towards her, but I knew she liked the other guy. I want to get over but I can't. It's also because of this I don't intend to enter any relationship in college. I literally am incapable of finding any other girls attractive. I had many opportunities to snag during college, but I just didn't care. (Many times when I play piano, a girl will always come in and compliment how beautiful I play, but I always give a dry thank you.)

Anyways just yesterday after another intense heartbroken gym session, I went to sleep. I woke up almost crying. I had a dream where I was hanging out with her and she told me she got engaged and invited me to her wedding. WHile in the dream, I was shocked. I thought this couldn't be happening. It must be a dream (luckily it was.) I woke up instantly and I was a mess. I wasn't even sure if it was a dream and immediately checked my DMs to make sure that was just a dream.

I told my friend about it, but what she said only made me sadder. This friend of mine knows about my situation and she wishes I can get over this girl as well. This friend then said something extremely thoughtless and insensitive. She said ""I hope she \[my crush\] gets engaged to someone random. Maybe some college dropout who went to Africa or something."" I know the context is weird, but I snapped at her, saying how cna you say such a thing to me? You know I'm suffering yet, yeah. And no, this friend does not like me that way, she has a boyfriend herself. 

Anyways, I just realized that the thought of her marrying someone other than me absolutely crushes me. I find it so pathetic that I still can't get over her. I already think I had no shot. I never had a shot to begin with. She always called me bro and stuff. She viewed me as a friend, but I viewed her as more than that. For context, she was basically my first crush.

Because of the fact that the Tolkien Mythos is 85 years old and God of war 2018 is 4 years old 

So just continue with caution


This past week I’ve finished 2 Really Good Stories, The Story of The Lord of the Rings, and God of War Ragnarok 


Stories are important to me very important, Books, music, games, and movies especially movies are very important to me. Besides family, and responsibilities it’s what gets me up in the morning.

Stories are how I express myself and escape from the troubles of life, I love analyzing, discovering immersing myself in these worlds, I love characters. As sad as it is to say some of my favorite characters have gotten me through some tough times, they inspire me, remind me I can be a better Version of myself help me up when I fall down. 


Any of you who even recognize me and my ramblings at all know how much I love and dearly appreciate The Hobbit, it is a book that affected me on an emotional level and has helped me become a little more comfortable with myself if you want to read me gushing about it 

[gushing about the Hobbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/wzxqvu/lets_be_lonely_together_whats_your_favourite_book/im5cwam/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)



The Lord of the Rings I’ve spent about a year and a half reading, I’m not the most consistent reader trying to get better.


I think what I love about lord of the rings the most besides it being a continuation of the Beloved The Hobbit, I feel it expands on the themes and adds new ones I love how big middle earth is and how many different perspectives there are in this big world, it also reminds me alot of Spirited away in that it’s a big world you can get lost in and kinda fumble and pick up the rules as you go along because there will be people to support you, from simple yet courageous and compassionate Hobbits like Sam-Wise Gamgee, and Frodo to Beautiful and Generous Queens like Lady Galadriel , then The Wise and inquisitive Gandalf the white.

I think one of the Themes I loved the most in Return of the King was towards the ending, pain and it’s lasting reminders.


Frodo, was the most brutalized member of the Fellowship, He got stabbed by a morgul blade, lost his finger and his sanity, he’s traumatized, and everything in middle earth seems to remind him of it.

I loved how Frodo’s next journey isn’t to save the world it’s to save himself and dammit he deserves it.


I think another reason i loved lord of the rings is a lot like God of War it’s introduced me  to the world of Norse mythology, which I now find really fascinating, I honestly used to think it was weird and goofy because of the MCU portrayal 
(this was when I was in middle school) 

I really just love the friendships and companionship found in The Lord of the rings it’s something I wish I had 


But Lord of the Rings connects to Tolkien because Norse mythology was one of Tolkiens main inspirations for his world. He also translated alot of old Germanic stories like Beowulf and borrowed from them. He also translated Arthurian mythology like Gaiwan and The green knight 

Gandalf is supposed to be an Odin like character 

And as much as I love Smaug the Dragon he is basically just a talking version of the Dragon from Beowulf

And yes Beowulf is an Anglo Saxon story but I believe if I remember correctly the character comes from Scandinavia to save the day, also the Anglo Saxons were a culture influenced both by Chrsitains an also Germainc and Norse mythology, at some point they all kinda melded together prolly because of who wrote the texted that were translated",2022-12-05 23:15:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1553318416,4,/r/lonely/comments/zdnkvk/do_you_guys_feel_sad_after_finishing_a_good_story/,,0,3,Do you guys feel sad after finishing a good story?

1210,zdo536,Weekly-Efficiency458,"Who is in the same boat as I am, sometimes I think i'm the only one. I'm Dutch, living all my life in the Netherlands.

I am very ugly, partly deformed jaw which couldn't be fixed by jaw surgeons even though I have been operated twice, it made matters even worse.  They gave up and left me behind with this mess. They removed too much from my lower jaw giving me appearance of someone without having teeth. Also my face is extremly oblong and I often received nasty comments about it.

Women always bullied me from early on in life, and it didn't get better later in life. I got ignored , rediculed , laughed at by girfriends of my friends in my teens. At parties I always ended up alone and was completely invisible like I did not exist. I stopped looking in the mirror for over 2 years now because it gives me panic attacks. In fact even if I somehow accidently look in the mirror it's so traumatic that my brain is actually erasing the image from my mind and so I forget how bad it actually is. I also developed  major social anxiety and I do everything to avoid people because I feel like a burden to them.

My parents are very ignorant about the situation and don't want to hear anything about it, they accepted the way I ended and I don't have any contact with my parents for over 5 years and 20+ years with other members of my family. My sister is happily married with 2 kids and ignores me completely.

I stopped life completely about 3 years ago after the failed surgeries, I live on social welfare. I'm a recluse for about 20 years now and for the last 3 years I didn't have any contact with anyone apart from doing grocery in the local supermarket.

My days for 3 years are as follow: I wake up around 5 or 6pm then I turn on the PC , I drink some Cola zero and start playing World of Warcraft or other games with twitch streams on the background. I continue to play till around 9 PM, then I go outside to do grocery, it takes about 5 minutes to reach the supermarket on foot. I do grocery and then do the checkout without human contact. After that I drink and eat ""breakfast"". Then I continue to watch movies, play games, watch streams , watching people get killed on gore sites, or sometimes watch porn but not often till about 4 AM, then I make dinner, taking a shower and then going to bed to watch youtube or movies on my Iphone. Obviously I do not have WhatsApp, facebook, twitter, instagram etc. Then I fall asleep around 8 Am and wake up at 5 PM and the same day like groundhog day starts all over again.

This is all I do for the past 3 years. Now i'm 45 years old, I don't feel like a human being anymore, I just exist. Strangly i'm not bothered by it that much, I felt a lot shittier in my 20s and early 30s. It's like my hormones have settled down or i'm just tired of fighting and don't have any energy left.

I tried to approach some women on datingsites but they either ignored me, said i'm not their type or said I'm just plain ugly. Also the times when I approached women in real life in my younger years they actually felt insulted which I can understand. and no they were not the model type, i'd say they were below average looking which is still a lot better than my appearance.

So here I am at age 45 living in the darkness and shadows. Never had a date , kiss, hug and obviously I am a virgin and I will stay like this because I also have erection problems due to my extreme low self esteem and due to my age.

So is there anyone that ended up similar as I did or am I really the only one?

I wanted to end my life at 39 because reaching 40 would be too much for me. But instead I somehow chose to continue life, also very scared to end my life, I have respect for people who commited suicide , it must be so hard to do something completely against nature. You basicly have to fight against your survivial instincts which is quite hard.  
Also here in the Netherlands it's very hard to buy firearms as they're illegal here.

1237,zdrezv,Pirate_of_the_neT,"All my life, I've been asking myself, who am I and what is the meaning of my life?

I've felt sadness, I've felt anger, I've felt inspiration, I've felt motivation; but these feelings all come and go. While they are perfect for the purpose, they are not enough to base my identity on. I desire structure, I desire stability. I want to enjoy life and move forward.

Back to the question, ""what is the meaning of my life?"". Every time, the answer that I've come to is to learn more. Understand more. Knowledge does not betray you, knowledge stays with you. Knowledge gives you power, control. Ok then, I'll start reading some books then right? Wrong. Time is limited. You must keep up with your responsibilities, you must recreate, you must sleep. And then, where do I even begin? Which book do I read? It is too painful to give up my all to one singular purpose. I keep getting plagued with what I am potentially missing out upon. At least for now, I am too weak.

So, here I am. I feel like a fish in an infinite ocean. I do not know where to swim to, but for the occasional current, however it does not last. 

I know what I can do. I can try to give up everything for my one purpose. However, it hurts too much to think about the things I am missing out upon. I can keep living as an uncertain husk, but that means I am destined for mediocrity. I can balance a bit of both, but what is the correct balance? What if I am wasting my time? No matter what choice I make, the threat or regret looms near.

So how does this tie to loneliness? Because it is a feeling that I am feeling right now. Do I act upon it? Do I ignore it and suffer? Do I obsess over a balance? It tears me apart thinking about it. I am filled with unrest.",2022-12-06 01:49:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1527888193,1,/r/lonely/comments/zdrezv/what_an_annoying_and_unpredictable_feeling/,,0,3,What an annoying and unpredictable feeling...

1253,zdtdtm,Lunatic_Gibberish,"What a pathetically stupid old fukwit I [M61] turned out to be. After a life time of being dealt shit, like being repeatedly being beaten and raped as a small child, then going through life with acquired mental illnesses and poor choices hounding me at turn, I found myself in a hole.

Used to being knocked down every time I stood up, I learned to live life in the shadows, never stay in one place too long, and never get attached to anyone. I survived by being insignificant, invisible to regular people, and by not being interesting enough to warrant a second glance. I got to 60 yo when I realised that I was old, ugly, stupid and completely and utterly alone. 

I put an advertisement for a female friend in a popular free online classifieds, it went in the men looking for women ads. I know that I'm fucking ugly, and I have prostate issues that make my dick not work properly anyway, so I specified that I wasn't looking for sex, hoping to reach more people. 

My ad headline said; ""Sad, stupid, lonely, old man wants a woman to talk to"". 

The body of the ad said; ""As the headline says, I'm a stupid, lonely old man. Ive been stupid and lonely for a long time. I really only got old (60) today. No it's not my birthday it was when I realised that I'm a joke. I'm invisible, nobody even notices me. I want a woman to talk to please? (I'm not looking for sex).

So I waited. After a day or two I checked the ad. I had several replies. Over the next week or so I had 13 or so. There were 2 from cross dressers offering to perform oral sex on me. There was 3 or 4 from prostitutes directing me to their ads. One gentleman wanted me ""to pound him with my big fat cock"". I don't know where he got his information from but it was very wrong in both descriptors.There was one or two replies from people who cared enough to direct me to community events but not enough to leave a phone number. A few thirsty men that have trouble reading and comprehending simple english. Then there was one from a proper sick fuck that wanted me to voluteer to be his scat slave.

But one, although it was a non starter it required an answer. ""Jazzy1782: Will you reward?"" I'm in no financial position to pay somebody to talk to me but, on this site there is a feature where you can click on the user name and it will direct you to the user profile. So I clicked and was directed to the profile of an escort. Having nothing better to do I replied to her saying that best that I could do would be to buy her dinner. I figured that would be the end of it.

Within 30 seconds, or at least well before I got rid of scat guys ad (it offended my senses even to have it in a digital mailbox associated with me) she had replied.""I can't for a week or so, really busy"". That started 2 ish weeks of really nice communication in the ad mail box. I would send her a 4 or 500 word text about whatever was going on in my head and she told me bits and pieces about her. She told me that she was not going to lie to me and that if I got too weird she was going to stop. I assured her that I wouldn't. 

She said that ever since she was raped as a girl her only relationships with men were sexual, and she was constantly being used only for sex and sexual exploitation, so she figured she she might as well turn it to her favour and began a career as an escort. She was only 28 but had been escorting for 7 years. She had never had a father figure, just a constant stream of losers that her addict mother bought home. She said that it would be nice to have someone to talk to and to share her happy times as well as the not so happy ones with. I assured her that my dick was in a coma and therefore I thought with my big head nowadays. I solemnly promised her that I wouldn't cross over any boundaries, and I meant to keep that promise.

I began checking my ad's in box far too often I had given her my number a couple of times but I understood why she didn't want me to have hers. We planned to have a f2f for a meal the next Tuesday week. It was going to be a 2 1/2 hour drive each way for me. I was busting at the seams. I wasn't sexually excited but was so looking forward to sitting near her it nearly did feel like a sexual attraction. I told her some things, both good and bad, about me that I have never uttered to another person, but it felt comfortable and it felt right to tell her.

It got to the Sunday, I was as happy as 13 year old boy with 2 dicks. I wasn't excited for any other reason than I was going to meet this woman for a meal and a conversation, but boy oh boy! My ad had worked. I hadn't felt the cold breath of lonliness on my soul for nearly 2 weeks, and I was sure that at dinner, we would just further our new friendship. I, at 60 yo was for as long as I could remember, finally ready to commit to a long term friendship.

I hadn't seen her face. The photo in her ad was a neck down lingere pic which made me uncomfortable to look at now. I didn't know her name either. I had purposely not asked, I figured that she would tell me when she was ready.

Sunday night I recieved a message from her which made my heart sing. She obviously had sensed that I was who I said that I was.  In her message she gave me her Facebook, Whatsapp, KIK, and Snapchat id's and not her work ones either. She told me her full name as well. Her face was nothing like I pictured in my head, but she was genuinely beautiful. She told me not to let her down and that she never trust's anyone like is trusting me. I assured her that I never would, it was a promise that I intended to keep.

I tried KIK first. Found her straight away and typed in a short hello. Then Snapchat then Facebook and Whatsapp. I made each message a little bit different from the last. It seemed important to me for her to know that she was more important than cut and paste. And then, I waited for her reply. Days, then weeks went by, with nothing. I suspected that I had been catfished after 3 days. I had no doubt after 4. I removed the ad and sent all of the messages to the recycling after a week. That's when I noticed her ad was gone too.

I'm not going to lie. It crushed me. I actually cried for at least 2 hours when I saw that her ad was gone as well. I still dont get it. There was nothing for the person on the other end of those messages to gain, there was never any mention of money except in the very first message. They didn't get me to drive a 5 hour drive all up, and watch me wait. They may have already known that I would feel the way that I feel right now. I'm much sadder, much more lonely, and I feel a damned sight more stupid than I did before I placed the ad. All that the whole thing achieved was to turn a spotlight on to my  bland, featureless, lonely future. Honestly I am  confronted by what that future has to offer. Because the answer is, more of the same, boredom, lonliness,depression and regret. That experience has made me seriously consider suicide. There is no more point in hanging around, waiting to die than there is in hoping that that ficticious girl, that stupid, stupid me got so attached to, will walk through my door. That catfish, whoever they are gained nothing except sadistic pleasure from the knowledge that they had gutted a poor, stupid, lonely, old man.

1254,zdto6z,Mitarashi,"I'm 30 yrs old and I've always been pretty happy being the loner type of person in my youth. I never really cared to go out and do a bunch with friends as I was always fine with 1 or 2 really close friends to hang out with. I thought I'd make friends at work but I tend to attract more women who are willing to talk to me more than other guys are. I've ALWAYS had more female friends and I'm not ungrateful for girls talking to me or anything, they're always very sweet. 

But I'd like male friends. I'd like a boyfriend at some point (I'm gay). The only other friend I have in my city is always busy unfortunately so we're not able to hangout. Are their ways to meet groups of men that isn't just bars and clubs? It always feels like alcohol has to be involved in order to socialize. I'm pretty socially awkward but I've learned to hold conversations better thanks to my job(s). People like me and think I'm a nice person. I have small talk with a lot of my coworkers but it never goes anywhere even if we exchange numbers. 

I wish i could find guys who are comfortable hugging other men but... lol I think i'd have to find lgbt men for that. I also live in a city thats pretty conservative?

1262,zdume1,CalmLovingSpirit,"I envy my younger self so much, I had no idea my ability to talk had a time limit. I've always had back pain and ground my teeth when I sleep, as far back as I can remember. The doctor says I've got scoliosis, and the teeth grinding gave me TMJ.  TMJ isn't covered by insurance so it's never been treated. Somehow the two have merged in this last year, and now when I talk I get horrible spinal pain that won't go away until I don't talk for a couple days and do some exercises. 

That makes me so absolutely hopeless.  I feel fully motivated to go out there and find friends, but I can't fucking talk to them. I was a very high achiever as a youth, got into a top 10 university, dropped out with more credits than I needed to graduate because of mental issues (literally started hallucinating and was psychotic). 

Then I spent the next 10 years working for restaurants and bars. This was a pretty good time in my life all things considered. I was poor, but I had friends, and I really enjoyed being around people even though they scared me. I'm fairly good looking so I had sex with a few girls, and my coworkers and I got along well. I saw working in restaurants as what I needed - I needed to immerse myself with people because most of the reason I dropped out of college was that I was terrified of people.  I was a loner in high school, so college was a shock to me that rocked my mind. 

Right now I am currently supposed to be in a turning point in my life. Three years ago I left my job as a barback and decided to get sober. It has been a struggle, on and off, but at this point I'm two years sober from everything except for kratom (pain relief ground leaf you drink).  I'm even trying to quit that too.   I am highly motivated to put myself back out there now, try to find a job, some friend groups, but my pain is immense whenever I talk. 

I've been asking myself if my pain was bad when I talked before too, but I just didn't realize because I was always either drunk or smoking weed or on some other drug.  Who knows. But sober me definitely is in pain. And it's the kind of pain that feels like there is something wrong inside. Like even if I got on like codeine or something, I would still feel that grinding around in my neck bones that only goes away when I don't talk and do pullups and rows. Something about those exercises aligns my spine just right and everything feels great again. Until I talk. 

So that left me feeling like the only people I can talk to are the people I already know. Like I don't have the talking time necessary to make new friendships. First of all, this made me really regret letting many of my friendships from college lapse. 

BUT THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING OF ALL has been the conflict with my brother. I'll be honest, I think I did not appreciate my college friendships enough. I think my close relationship with my brother kept me from feeling the pain of losing those friendships. Because DAMN I miss those guys now. I think of them and cry. I think of my coworkers and cry too. I'd love so much to hug and laugh with them again. 

But I let pretty much all of those relationships fall apart, and put all my eggs in my blood brother basket. Well, he has a girlfriend now, and she doesn't like me, and guess what? He chose her over me. So even though we live in the same city I never see him.

That was the ultimate blow to me. That is the reason I am now more lonely than I ever felt possible. Even in middle school and high school when I had zero friends at school I always came home and had a full social life with my brother. 

He was the whole reason I eventually ended up being able to have friends, I believe. He was like the internal proof I had, that I could point to and say ""ya, I must be lovable, even though I've never had friends, I've always been able to enjoy the company of my brother, have fun, play, be goofy, etc."" It was like, without that proof, I would have believed I was the fearful, quiet, darting eyed scared guy who went to school. But because of that relationship I knew I was capable of much more.  

He even kind of helped me learn to be comfortable around groups, he was like my training wheels. I had no friends in my grade, but he did, and he had me hang out with his friends, without that I would have never had that experience.

So his betrayal has cut me to the core. And now I feel completely unmoored. I feel awash, like I have no clue where to turn to for love. 

I don't even feel capable of love until I get it first, you know? Like my brother withdrawing his love from me makes me feel like I don't deserve it from anyone. But to get love I have to go out and seek it, no one is just offering to hand it to me. But how can I seek it until I get it first? If I don't get it first I won't have the confidence that I am lovable that I need to seek it! It feels like a horrible cycle. 

So ya this is where I am. 

My therapist thinks I need to go to some group outpatient shit, or some meetings, something. And I really am making an effort lately to change myself. I started going to the gym this month, hoping that my jaw and back pain will reduce if I strengthen my neck muscles so they can hopefully keep my spine more in line so I can talk more. I've only gone 3 times, and I can't tell if it is working. But I definitely feel better after going. 

Life is just freaking hard man. It is difficult not to find resentments. Like my dad was well off when I was a kid. Braces back then would have saved me from a life of jaw grinding issues I think. No idea why he never did it. Now my dad is absolutely broke, asking me for money even. I am on medi-caid and they don't cover braces as far as I can tell. My front teeth are straight, so everything looks good, but my rear teeth have been shoved to the side from the grinding side to side, and I believe if I get that corrected these issues may go away. 

But I was never able to save that kind of money while working in restaurants.

Now that I'm sober I can't work in a restaurant or bar until I get the talking issue fixed. 

Part of me thinks I should just spend this time learning a new skill, like coding or design, something I don't need to talk to learn. But even then I would need to talk in the job, right?  Just hope I can bear the pain until I make enough to fix my jaw?

Then I think about doing a gofundme or something, and I always shoot it down mentally.  For one thing it is terrifying to put something like that out there and potentially get no responses.  I'd honestly rather go on thinking ""oh well maybe someday I can make a gofundme and people might help me go back to work"" and have that hope to hold onto, than actually make one and risk rejection, risk finding out nobody gives a shit about me. Reminds me of that collegehumor skit where he is slamming gofund me and says ""we run a site that holds popularity contests where if you lose you die."" lmao. Fuck American healthcare. This right here is why healthcare needs to be a human right like in Europe, so you don't get stuck in weird loops like this. I literally am dying to be a productive member of society, but I can't until I get medical care, but I can't get medical care until I become a productive member of society. Looped.

That is kind of a pattern with me lately though...what I just said up there about not doing something so I can retain the hope? Like I know some college friends still live nearby, but I have been holding off on contacting them because I'd rather keep telling myself ""oh ya soon I might be able to reconnect with x,"" and that hope is precious to me. Actually trying to reconnect with them makes it real, brings up the possibility they don't give a shit about reconnecting with me.

But reconnecting with old friends really does feel more appealing to me lately than making new ones. It is really hard to bring up early in a new friendship that I can't really talk much. But people who already knew me I can bring it up right away, it's just like updating them. Then they can hopefully understand and we can talk only a little and spend time in silence, or I dunno. Just in general they will know I wanted to see them again I'm just not as capable as I used to be? 

I've been in a mental health inpatient place a few times, and god it feels attractive right now. I know the physical shit should take priority, but honestly I'm starting to be a little concerned about my mental situation. I've never been one to think about ending my life, but lately my hopelessness has become pretty vast. Every single time I get an inner wellspring of hope like I always do, it gets shut down by this damn talking thing. I've always been hopeful and motivated, but right now god it's hard to figure out what that is supposed to look like. 

It is so fucking isolating to have the ability to talk ripped away from you.

Like I've literally started wondering if I need to learn sign language and join the sign language community, like what am I supposed to do here?

I've been playing video games lately, and have made some online friends that I type to. But even they keep asking to talk on discord, and I keep turning it down, and explaining to them why.  It is so frustrating. 

Well, it was nice typing all that out. Cathartic in a way, to be honest. I've been needing to get all this off my chest for a while. If anyone reads this, I sincerely thank you &lt;3.

1264,zdupeg,NoAd1229,"I had a friend group from freshman year to fall semester senior year of college- now I’m graduated but I feel so lonely. I broke off the toxic friendship kinda immaturely I’ll admit. We had plans to keep dorming together 2nd semester senior year and I pulled out of it, ghosted them, and blocked all their numbers. To give you context- they were very catty girls who talked shit about each other behind their backs (including my back), judged our dating choices, and were overall very rude/passive aggressive when it came to splitting household chores in our dorm. 

Additionally, I introduced 2 of these girls to my family and the whole entire time they were laughing and talking to each other, completely ignoring me the whole time. 

I always felt like a 3rd wheel…and then a 4th wheel when they became closer to one of my friends outside the group who turned against me in the end.

I know that leaving the group should have made me happy because I don’t deserve that amount of disrespect-but almost a whole year later I’m bombarded with snap memories of us going out and I spent almost 4 years of my life with these people instead of venturing out and meeting new people. I have so many regrets I’m so upset.

1276,zdvva4,[deleted],"Birthday is coming up so and I will be 36 this year, but over time I have dealt with anxiety and panic attacks over the past 3 years.

I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs. Never have.

But I only have 1 friend (guy) and one friend (girl) and I have no kids and divorced.

I lost 50 lbs. and look better than I did in high school, but as you get older it is harder to make friends, and it is harder to trust. Anything that may bother you in your twenties amplify X2 in your 30s.

I just don’t know why I can’t sleep well and have anxiety/panic attacks. I have a normal great life, but I believe Tik Tok, Youtube, Facebook and the like all push for men to become more and more self conscious and anxiety while girls all have to do is take a topless pic, bikini pic, or smile to gain followers and guys hitting on them.

Men could message 100 women and maybe get a response from one, but girls don’t even need to message and their inbox is flooded.

I sometimes believe being born a woman is a much easier road from 18-35 but a much harder road if she doesn’t marry by 35.

If you are a girl reading this, why not message a guy who interests you first or approach him first at the gym? Odds are he just doesn’t want to be rejected or thinks you are out of his league.

1290,zdxzei,[deleted],"To me being lonely means working from the outside-in. I've always found when I feel loneliest is when I'm looking for something external to come and fix everything in my life. It's usually when I'm feeling defeated over something in my life feeling out of my control. It's exasperated when I make a joke to myself and there's no one else around to laugh.

It's hard to not reflect off of others. In the end though I feel like it's better for me to be alone right now. I'm coming out of a very bad co-dependent relationship that lasted over a decade with zero empathy. The worst part? I'd still rather not be alone. But that's the fear talking. I'm happy. Happier than I've been in a long time. I can still be sad at the same time though. Sad that the love of my life is gone, sad that she never *really* loved me back. Sad that I didn't realize it sooner.

But you know what... another person isn't going to fix that in me. The co-dependent behavior, the addiction to stress and other people and things, etc. Lately I've been filling up my bucket with platonic relationships and it really sucks. I get it, the feeling of wanting someone to be your ""real"" self with. Somebody's shoulder to cry on.

I'm not used to feeling empathy and lately when I go out I get it in spades, from friends, from family, and it feels weird and gross to me. I still don't know why but that's where I'm at right now. What's even stranger to me is that in my past relationship that lasted so long there was no empathy and I didn't see a problem with that. Maybe it's better for me to be alone right now at least romantically. I don't know. Putting my faith in my God right now that he'll let me know when I'm ready again.",2022-12-06 06:27:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/zdxzei/what_does_loneliness_mean_to_you/,,0,0,What does loneliness mean to you?

When I see how your eyes flicker in the evening light,

As I watch, unseen, unfelt, unheard,

Hiding behind my phone screen.

&amp;#x200B;

Join me,

Become a part-time invisible man,

Working overtime to be underfed.

&amp;#x200B;

You, the reader,

My love, my lover, my loved.

When I blink I dream of you.

And when I open my eyes I see that your thoughts are somewhere, elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a piece of a photo of you.

I kept it in my pocket, and when I got home

I drew what you looked like in my imagination.

Van Gogh's swirls, Durer's steely gaze,

Bloomed from my pen.

And when I found you,

You couldn't rival the beauty of the portrait.

&amp;#x200B;

When you sleepwalk, 

And I appear behind your closed eyelids,

Remember me.

&amp;#x200B;

I measure my life in hands,

Not my hands, but the hands of others.

I see your life, a life I wish to but cannot live,

And vicariously I feed off your joy, your experiences,

Your love.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a sad thought,

That so many words are made for things you will never have.

Not that they're not meant for you, but you're not meant for them.

&amp;#x200B;

So have your love, your sex, your bacchanalia,

And I'll watch in quiet fantasy,

The suicide hotline, along with two teen crisis lines, the Samaritans, and a ""warmline"" (hotline for people not in crisis, 20 min time limit instead of 1 hr), are seriously the worst calls I've ever had. Maybe I came in with the wrong expectations back then, because I honestly didn't expect these guys to have the personality of a *brick.* I swear, I could just be rambling to myself in my room and I'd leave the conversation feeling better—with these guys they're literally just going ""Hmm"" and ""Yeah, I understand you"" and ""Your feelings are valid"" and ""DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE OR SELF HARM?"". The repetitiveness of these calls are enough to drive a person to suicide rather than stop them from it, I'm telling you, man.

I don't self-harm, I don't use substances, I don't have suicidal thoughts or thoughts about harming someone; I probably sound like the pinnacle of mental health to these guys for just wanting to have a conversation with someone on the phone instead of just mindlessly venting my problems into the speaker. I really do just want someone to talk to instead of listening to someone read off a list of questions and ask me if I self-harm for the millionth time, but I guess that's not what I should 'want' out of a hotline.

1308,zdzyde,Hello_frend,"(Hey this might be triggering, I’m jus tryna make sense of these thoughts) 

I’ve always had a lonely life, so why does it feel extra hard today. 

I’m around people, having conversations 

Why does it feel so lonely. 

Why does every little thing exasperate this feeling. 

- isolation is so comforting, but is it? 
Or am I forced to just enjoy it. 

- friends and relationships are hard to give energy to, I don’t feel like myself. 

- i wake up feeling grateful for having dreamt, where did that energy go. 

- why does living this life feel so isolating. I’m experiencing the most happiest moments inside of myself and in my own head and I can’t necessarily share or show people around me. 

- what do I bring to the table, aside from small talk and awkwardness 

- why am I so god damn uncomfortable

- who even am I, why am I even caught up in a narrative 

- am I living correctly? Are any of us? Who gives a shit? Do I? If so why am I so quick to settle on my situation? 

- I have a idealized version of my environment, relationship, work life, overall lifestyle
I can dream a perfect life where I’m comfortable in my own skin, having conversations that seem natural and fulfilling

Where the fuck is that in my daily life 

And why does it always seem like I have to put 10000 percent of my conscious effort to get an inkling of positivity out of my daily interactions. 

I am aware that I am the way I am and I have the power to fix what I want to fix. 

It’s very uncomfortable to be comfortable right now, just sitting in my organized mess of a life.

It’d be nice to smile and mean it right now, and to be a part of a joyous moment with myself and others

I think we all deserve a bit of that on the daily, happy serendipitous, hilarious moments.

Moments that make you feel light and airy. I yearn for that version of myself, not even physically just mentally. I would trade a few limbs to be in a happier mindset.

That’s ridiculous and I know it’s not true but I think I’m reaching a breaking point of desperation that I might actually keep those promises to myself. To fear less and do more. To find help in more than just weed and booze. I wanna start loving myself and life. I wanna help others. I think it’d be something my idealized version would want. 

I dunno though, misery feels very comfortable for the time being. Suffering is becoming all I know. 
This all feels so fucking unhealthy!!!!!

1331,ze2oi6,Tzuyari,"The loneliness that goes away in the presence of someone else, only for it to pick the locks to the doors that you’ve shut tight because of the sense of false security that you’ve deluded yourself into thinking will keep all the bad away. It doesn’t have to wait outside for you. It has permission to enter the moment you feel the sadness, the regret, any low frequency energy to disrupt the flow of your day to day in the presence of someone else. 


When I’m trying to do right, it’s wrong. When I think I’m being thoughtful, it’s not enough. When I’m moving, it’s too slow. The clicking at the door stops and it opens slowly. It’s in here, now.

1332,ze2pkm,RoseJamCaptive,"Recently I've been thinking a lot about this community and r/socialanxiety and wonder if there is some overlap/correlation between the two. In addition to this, I know that loneliness is not a one-size fits all, as many have said in comments on previous posts that they are lonely in their long-term marriages or when surrounded by family and friends too.

Tell why you think it is you are lonely. Give me all the detail; I genuinely want to here your story. The reasons I can think of are things like:

* Social Anxiety (too afraid, so end up lonely as a bi-product)
* Emotionally/Physically lonely (no-one matching your intensity/people too intense/can't find partner)
* Intellectually lonely (no-one to share hobbies/interests/thoughts/ideas with) *(this one is me)*
* Spiritually lonely (no religious community, no-one to share philosophy of life with)
* Culturally lonely (new city/country no-one shares culture with you)
* Existential loneliness (incomplete; no purpose. Disconnected not just from people, but the world)

The reason I ask is not without motive; I want to embark on a project that seeks to help people connect with each other but offering things as small as questions you can use in small talk to mindsets you can adopt to help you change your perspective on situations relating to connecting with people.

I've made a similar post over on r/socialanxiety, so I will echo the same sentiment. The more people that respond, the better understanding I can develop of this. You can comment here or DM me; happy for either. If you want to get involved in any way, then please let me know too. I really want to make a difference and help as many people to not feel as I have felt for so long.",2022-12-06 10:21:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667504740,1,/r/lonely/comments/ze2pkm/i_want_to_understand_why_are_you_lonely/,,0,9,I want to understand; why are you lonely?

I guess what I’m trying to get at is that I yearn for a relationship, but I’m just to scared. Rejection and embarrassment are a huge fear. As well as me taking things personally. 

I don’t Snapchat anyone. I don’t reach out to people that I’m interested in. I don’t believe that I’m worthy of them I guess. Just a lot on my mind. This doesn’t really go hand and hand with social skills, it’s just something I wanted to ask. I’ve even caught me asking myself “when will it be my turn?”

From an early age (4~6 years old) my life was normal, or as normal as one can be at that age. But once I started growing, things started to change. The bigger I got the more people talked to me less and less. No matter how much I tried to fit in to friend groups, they all eventually pushed me out of the group or tried to take advantage of me. 

I haven’t really had anyone to tell me problems to besides my parents, and they don’t seem to understand what I try to tell them. So I’ve grown  cold and I don’t trust people anymore. I still enjoy many things in life, but I can’t help myself from hating people or society in general. 

I’m close to finishing my senior year in high-school. And even with my job, people barely talk to me, and I can understand be nervous talking to someone my size, but it’s taken a toll on my mental health and I’m just looking for some help or just anyone to be around.",2022-12-06 14:56:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651982463,3,/r/lonely/comments/ze8tjx/acceptance/,,0,5,Acceptance

1366,ze9gam,Super_UGA_SaiyanDawg,"I am currently a 26 year-old student at the University of Georgia. This was always my dream school since it was a big SEC Football school and I thought that alone was gonna be the reason I was gonna make a lot of connections and make a lot of friends. Before transferring here in August of 2021, I had always been a homebody back at home. To provide some context about my life before I started to attend here, I had started college late because I had attended a trade program for the State of Georgia that catered to people with disabilities in the State of Georgia to help them learn interdependent skills for the workplace. I later completed my program there in 2016 and I stayed at home and worked for the next 2 years. I have always been a homebody, I have never owned a car, I have never got my driver’s license. People always talk about how everyone’s social skills were impacted by the Pandemic for being at home for so long. Imagine that but for 4-5 years being at home in my case. After that trade program I had flip-flopped over the years about what I wanted to do in my life for a career and I settled on being an English Teacher to soon change my major to Psychology this previous spring. Jumping forward when I arrived at UGA during my first month, it was awful. I had not visited the campus beforehand, and the transfer student orientation was all online due to COVID. I realized that I wasn’t hitting it off with people like I thought I was going to and that everyone just seemed interested in themselves or their friends that they knew from High School. It was also hard to connect with a population of undergrad students that was 18-21 while I was 5 -7 years older than these students. Whenever I tried to get advice about this problem I would always get the same cookie cutter advice like “join clubs, you’ll find your people, etc.” Whats is even worse are the football games, I had always dreamed of going to the footballs games with a awesome group of friends like I would see in a movie or a sitcom, but nobody wanted to go to the games with me and I always ended up going alone and couldn’t find enjoyment because I was alone. I also barely had experience with dating and I thought I was gonna have the fairy tale love story of finding the girl of my dreams here and going on cute dates, I was so mistaken. I’m 6’2, I know I am a handsome guy, but I realized how hard the dating scene is here. I tried dating apps, talking to girls at bars downtown, meeting people in clubs, my social skills were so inadequate where I failed to make a lasting impression. I did start to see a girl this previous May, but we barely talked after she went home for the summer and ghosted me when the fall semester started. I also do have a few friends I have made over the time I’ve been here, but I don’t know if I make a real impact on their lives compared to other friends that they have. I’m at the point where I feel like I will never get a good social or dating life here. It honestly depresses me that this school was not what I had envisioned it to be. I always see people I follow from UGA on Instagram doing all of these fun things with their group of friends or dates and I feel jealous and sad because I’m not having that kind of lifestyle. I have decided just to focus on my degree and actively avoid a social/dating life here. I guess I will probably be a lone-wolf and I need to accept that.  ",2022-12-06 15:23:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609727128,13,/r/lonely/comments/ze9gam/a_lonely_autistic_and_neurodivergent_college/,,0,0,A lonely Autistic and Neurodivergent College Student with barely any friends

I have terrible social skills as well and I just feel extremely lonely. So basically, theres this girl in my class thats really nice to me and I‘ve become infatuated with her these past few months. It’s gotten to the point where its all I think about 24/7. I realize its really unhealthy and that I just have some unrealistic fantasy that she can fix all my problems. I was planning on asking her out but my friend talked me out of it since we don’t even really know each other. I honestly kind of wanted her to reject me so I can get over this. I’m gonna try to let her know I like her somehow and if she responds negatively then I know I just have to stop.

1383,zecl5f,Opalovrn,"(F18) I haven't been on Reddit for a very long time, but I just need to rant I guess, try and get my thoughts out of my head. 

Honestly I just feel shitty and I have and I always will, I don't know if it's a ""winter depression"" thing but I think I've been depressed and suicidal around this time of year for like 4 years in a row now. And people always try to convince you that there's hope and that ""you can get better"" or ""you just have to keep going"". But when does it? Like the first time I felt this way, I was 13 and things have only gotten worse and my loneliness has never really gone away. 

Currently I have 0 friends, like really, I have no friends at uni and I don't know how to make any and the two friends I did have moved far away and made other friends, and I just feel like I always get left behind, always stuck here. I want to leave the city I live in but I have my uni here and there's my boyfriend who doesn't want to move away from his parents or friends, but I do, I'm only here for him. And it's nice having him around and at least I have someone, but whenever he's with other people I get jealous, but not because I don't trust him or anything but because I miss him and feel left out I guess. It also reminds me that I don't have anyone to hang out with myself, and that makes me feel shitty. But that is becoming a problem in our relationship I guess, but I can't stop feeling that way.

And I don't know, I don't think I'm a very nice person and that's probably why I can't keep friendships.. Times like this I just want to get drunk and kill myself. I'm just so fed up with my life and I'm so useless at everything and I don't want to be me anymore.",2022-12-06 17:29:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670346833,12,/r/lonely/comments/zecl5f/it_never_changes/,,0,4,It never changes

I'm a very shy person to talk to a girl and look her in the eye I've never been in a relationship with a girl in my life but today I came and now I have a girl the problem is I don't know how to make the first move I really want to have my first kiss and eat her lips but I can't Because I live in an Arab society that considers kissing a girl in public as a lack of upbringing and a lack of respect for the principles of Islam. The problem is also that I did not find the perfect opportunity or place to kiss her, and she is shy and is still waiting for me to make the first move, but I do not know how. I am now in a state of depression and I still blame myself all the time because I could not and will not be able to kiss her.

Everyone in my family treats her like a Queen, I don’t know where she got that.

She confessed to me personally and apologised and said she don’t go through with it because she loves her brother. I don’t know how to react, I am 21 she’s 19 . I thought of her as my best friend,

He doesn’t pay attention to me. He’s either watching TV or playing video games. I only talk to him when we go to bed because it’s the only time he’s not in front of a screen. He gets mad as he’s tired and wants to sleep. 

When we do talk, I say I want a relationship as we feel like roommates. No affection or intimacy. He gets defensive and says he has hugged me today and he’s given me attention. This leads to arguments as every single hug or anything, I have to ask for. I’ve told him I want someone who wants to be in a relationship with me and he just says he loves me and doesn’t know how to show it. 

I’m a full time grad student and spend my days on campus from 8-5 and when I get back, he still plays his games or scrolls on his phone. He does ask what I want to play or watch and I’m not into coming home and sitting glued to a screen all evening, I want to go out or talk or anything else. 

I do know he’s very stressed. He’s just given up his job because of it and in his defence, he needed to. He’s taking some time out and is going to apply for some in a couple of weeks.

1431,zeiyan,stonerboner2617,"Im lonely relationship,family and friend wise

Family:
Where im from family is really important and its not uncommon for cousins to have extremely close relationships with each other i always see cousins going out amd enjoying themselves but my cousins dont really want to go out with me i remember once when my cousin got invited out by his friends and they said to bring me he asked if i wanted to go i said yes but after staring at me for a while he phoned his friends and told them we wouldn't be going i think hes embarrassed to be seen with me but i guess its ok 

Relationship:
Never had a gf never even held hands or kissed a girl so yeah. Kinnda sucks when younger boys ask me for dating advice bc i absolutely know nothing about dating. I have However heard a girl talk to her friends about me and it pretty much whent like this her"" jack kinnda looks cute doesn't he?"" Her friend's""yeah but hes too fat"" so i guess i have somewhat of a chance i just need to lose some weight.

Friendship:
Out of all 3 this has to be the hardest when i was little kids would outright ignore me and run away so i spent my whole life up until grade 5 completely alone afterwards i met a few friends and then had to move to a different city made a few new friends again but outside of school we never talk and they never invite me to anything im always left out so i decided to meet up with my old friends turns out things have changed to the point where they also ignore me even after not seeing each other for years to me its seems as if they are some what  angry at me even tho we said goodbye on a good note so yeah i really dont know what to do the people at my current school mostly only want to be my friend when it suits them example of this is when i invited my friend over he agreed but afterwards canceled to hangout with kids in our class he was friends with so at this point idk what to do anymore",2022-12-06 21:40:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618738285,2,/r/lonely/comments/zeiyan/im_lonely_im_all_aspects_of_my_life_and_im_not/,,0,5,Im lonely im all aspects of my life and im not sure how to fix it

1438,zek7xd,natooral-skeptic,"Before I write my posting, let me just be nice and give you a trigger warning: Some of the things I am about to write might upset certain people, especially those who are in a vulnerable place and suffer a lot. I got no intention to hurt you in any way, but please be aware that whatever you are about to read might do some damage.  


I am convinced that sometimes we have to be broken in order to get back on our feet. I have been dumped before, I have been cheated on, I have been lied to and sometimes all of these things happened to me altogether. I know how much it hurts to feel isolated, rejected and lost. But during the last 20 odd years or so I have learned an important truth: Being alone is essential to self-development. Here is why:   


I was born alone and did not ask to enter this world. I will die alone and I am certainly not looking forward to the moment I'll have to face the reaper. But both of these things are what they are, and not accepting this rather harsh reality just leads to unnecessary misery. If we cannot come to terms with being alone, we are f...king up our own lives. In other words: If we resist being alone and don't work with this ""alone-ness"" so to speak, we create what we call ""loneliness"" ourselves. In case you are not following me, let's look at the very definition of ""alone"" and ""lonely"":   


Being alone simply means being on your own. There is no connotation to that in terms of good or bad.  Imagine waiting at a bus stop on your own: You are alone, but you don't feel lonely, right? Then imagine stepping on the bus, being the only passenger: Again you are alone, but you are not lonely, right?   


Loneliness on the other hand describes the **feeling** we get when our need for rewarding social contact and relationships is not met. Repeat that sentence until you get it. You can *feel* lonely, but you cannot *be* lonely. Meditate on that for as long as you need to.   


What it always boils down to: Being alone and okay, or being alone and feeling lonely. You cannot really control the state of being alone, at least not if you are hurt, sad or even depressed. But you can address the feeling of loneliness: It is a feeling you yourself do create. Chances are you are feeling lonely because you are expecting something of the external world. Which intrinsically means you are looking outside of your inner world, right? Are you with me? Great.   


If you don't do the heavy work and look inside yourself, you will never come to terms with being on your own. I speak from experience, because for dozens of years I myself tried to ""fill"" my inner void: I played music on stage, got into relationships, hooked up casually, and so on. All just for the sake of having somebody else admire or validate me. Let me ask you this: Are you seeking validation from other people? I thought so. We all do. It's who we are as human beings. But that desire for validation probably is the reason why you are feeling lonely right now, isn't it?   


I hope you do see the circular motion in this: You were alone, did not find a way to accept being alone, so you searched for external validation or so, so you developed a desire which is the root cause for your feeling of loneliness, which leads to you being alone, not finding a way to accept being alone, searching for external validation again... And the wheel keeps on spinning.   


So how is this supposed to help you? Well, I can only hope that some of you do manage to understand the difference between being alone and feeling lonely. Because that understanding can be a great relief. At least it was for me, and it set me out on a quest to really, truly do some introspective work and to come to terms with myself and only myself. I am 39 and about to turn 40 next year, so don't think that I didn't need time to get where I am today. It took me a lot to get where I am, and I feel very privileged to have realised what I just tried to explain to you. I hope you can use my example to look inside yourself and to discover who you are. Because if you do, all other things will fall in place: Relationships, (sexual) connections, and so on. You simply have to shift your focus from the external world to the internal one.   


For what it is worth: I wish you well. And I know you got this. Don't give up. Don't dwell in self-pity and worries. Instead, let your pain be the very temporary experience it is and understand that all you have in this life is the time between your birth and death. Like me, you are mortal - so cherish the experience we call ""life"" for as long as it lasts, because nobody can guarantee you an afterlife or heaven. For all we know, this is as good as it gets. I know, it might sound bad, but then again your life is quite a miracle in this vast, dark and cold universe, isn't it? You'll do just fine. Of that I am sure.",2022-12-06 22:30:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664112185,9,/r/lonely/comments/zek7xd/on_the_difference_being_alone_and_being_lonely/,,0,9,"On the difference ""being alone"" and ""being lonely"""

I want to get a degree in computer science. But I've been told by everyone in my whole life I'm too R worded. 

In high school I had to drop out the bullying was so bad, people took my lunch tray and put it at the special needs area and told me that's where I had to sit because it's ""where I belong"". 

People at work treat me the same way, always calling me the R word and making jokes about my intelligence such as ""his elevator doesn't reach the top floor"", or ""the lights are on but nobodies home"". 

My freinds always have bullied me too. My nickname is also the R word with them. They call me dumb, stupid, imbecile, simpleton, the R word, and so on. They also like to make fun of me for being a virgin and tell me I'll be a virgin forever cause I'm an R word.

1497,zeq1dd,Affectionate_Hat494,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos. It's not that I wanted to talk to him, but sometimes, you like to admire someone from afar.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up a little bit. I only had like 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few minutes/hours later, my TikTok views on my videos would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter, too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious to me that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other little instances where he did something similar to that. 

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours. A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend.

Edit: he and I live in different countries, 2,000 miles away from each other. A lot of girls like him. There was even one time about a month after they broke up, he and his friends went to a vacation home and invited a bunch of girls over. He hooked up with one girl that night that's a model (she actually is a model with promoted products and everything). They're not together, because she got with someone else several months later. So while I do worry about being an emotional rebound, I recognize that there's other girls he could have better rebounds with.",2022-12-07 02:50:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642055763,1,/r/lonely/comments/zeq1dd/im_worried_that_im_a_rebound_at_least_emotionally/,,0,2,I'm worried that I'm a rebound (at least emotionally)

1499,zeqfl6,PinkNoon,"12/6/2022

 I haven't been feeling well lately. My in-laws wanted to celebrate my birthday yesterday by taking me out to dinner and I was nervous the whole time. Not that I didn't appreciate it, but I appreciated the movie time at home better.

 I wanted to write this to myself to prove that even the days where you feel the worst don't have to be awful.

 I woke up at around 8. Nobody else was home and I felt the dread of having to go out in public later today. I doom scrolled for about 20 minutes before remembering I got some more of my favorite cereal bars. That really woke me up so I walked to the kitchen and had a cereal bar with my coffee. I checked my emails and saw nothing interesting. I read some of a new comic I got and willed myself to get ready.

 I actually picked out a comfortable outfit today. I took the risk of wearing some brighter colors and putting my hair half up just because I thought it would look nice.  I packed some of my library books in with my school supplies since they were due today.

 Classes were actually very fun! I am preparing self portraits for my art final. Everyone was focused with their drawings. For English, we had another essay. Usually it would be boring, but I like my professor. Thankfully nobody paid me any mind today! I survived a day without being harassed!

 I got home at 7pm and made some dinner. Some nice vegetable soup and bread. I did my online homework while my laundry was in the washer.

 So yeah, for my own future reference, no matter how hard you beat yourself down there is always something that will make a day better. For today it was reading through some comics and eating some of my favorite foods. For tomorrow, I'll have to wait and see.",2022-12-07 03:09:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667660359,1,/r/lonely/comments/zeqfl6/what_i_did_on_another_lonely_day/,,0,0,What I did on another lonely day

1514,zerwh2,memeage_,"Hello everyone, I hope you are well, I am just here to vent really; moreover, I'd vent to those within my personal real life circle, but I have been burned from doing that in the past, by those who acted as though they cared for me. [I've had my vulnerability, my traumas, and more used against me by people I knew in my past, who have since been cut out]. Anyhow: I'm 23, I am a virgin, I have only had 2 legitimate relationships [One of which was heavily abusive] and I am at my wit's end when it comes do dating. I have every single imaginable angle and have come up empty handed every time; moreover, every time that and interaction has looked promising, I end up getting snubbed and blocked without any obvious explanation nor reason. I'd like to think I'm not a terrible looking person, I have been heavily focused on body improvement, I have a full time job, and I am moved out from home [Albeit with roommates]. I wouldn't have too much of an issue if me getting snubbed was some that only happens occasionally, but I have run out of fingers to continue counting how many times this has happened [Alot].  I think I have just recently swallowed the pill of, ""Nobody in this world is guaranteed, or obligated to, the legitimate feeling of love."" Which is all fine and dandy, but I am constantly surrounded by people that have a loving relationship, houses, and more; moreover, if they aren't in a loving relationship, many of them seem to have no shortage of romantic, or sexual, interaction with whoever they please -- I'd be a liar if I were to say I wasn't envious. I'm just deprived, I know it is cliché but I'm a pretty hopeless romantic who just wants something that is comfortable, tangible, warm, and homey, and as I said: I know not everyone is obligated to that feeling, myself included, but it is just something that I wish for. If I remember correctly, more and more men aren't getting into relationships anymore, I can see why, and I guess I'm a part of that statistic. It is what it is though -- I apologize for spouting out word vomit, I'd wanted to be more concise in what I typed here, but if you chose to read this, thank you, I appreciate you, and hope you're having a lovely day, night, evening, or whatever it may be for you. .",2022-12-07 04:24:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1588916223,3,/r/lonely/comments/zerwh2/something_i_have_been_holding_in/,,0,0,Something I have been holding in.

1545,zevrvb,[deleted],"I used to have a huge problem with wanting to pull away from people when I started to care too much about them, and felt like something was wrong in our relationship. Just things like.. not feeling respected, even though it was mostly my problem, being too oversensitive; feeling like someone was pulling away, even though this is normal ebb &amp; flow in many friendships as people grow and change.  
  
This resulted in me nuking my entire social life, twice. Once irl, once with online friends. Irl it was easier to understand that my past friend's hearts were closed off to me, when I tried to apologize. But I just can't get over someone I met online.  
  
I'm pretty angry. This person was only around on the site we used to use for three short years. I, on the other hand, never really left. I hope he's ok, but part of me is hurt and frustrated and angry that he's most likely moved on, while I have not. The way our relationship ended was over the most stupid misunderstanding. If I had tried to call him rather than text, maybe I could've accepted the fact that he wanted space. Maybe he could've heard the sincerity in my voice, rather than assuming none of it mattered to me.   
  
I was able to let go of the past when it came to my irl friends, but he was really the first and only guy I ever felt understood me. We were able to banter and have fun talking about our common interests or nothing in particular; before him and subsequently, after it ended, I was never able to find even one person who I got along with like that. Sometimes it almost feels like it was just a dream, because it still feels so unfinished and weird. To care so much about someone, and yet they're gone. No massive fight, no way of contacting him ever again. Nothing except a 'last logged in' date that's now almost seven years in the past. I've gone over it so many times that I've gone through accepting the fact that I didn't just want to be friends, and then realizing I just wish he could still be in my life even if he wasn't attracted to me. Sometimes I wonder why he never even felt curious enough to log in again, or whether he ever even thought about me after that point, or whether he simply assumed I was some shitty, shallow college girl who liked toying with guys. He had no idea how hard it was to feel like I had to remove myself from not just his life but other people as well, including irl friends. And I'm angry that he didn't even care to check, or to try to understand. I'm angry at myself for ever having bothered, I'm angry that I wasted my time. And most of all, I just don't know how to even cope with the fact that the memory of this person is *so close*, but he's completely unreachable. How can you possibly care about someone so much, yet you barely even remember them, and you barely even ever knew them, and you feel so alone knowing that you'll never meet anyone who even remotely compares to him again.

1552,zewpcr,Squadradot,"Yeah, the title is quite straight forward. Since a couple years I've been considering the posibility of ending myself, and the only reason I haven't done it is probably because my mom exists.

It doesn't matter the way I die, it can be by accident, by myself, by pills, by an earthquake, it doesn't matter how I die, because I know that my mom will blame herself for it, and even though I am selfish, I haven't reached that level of selfishness.

Once in 2021 I told my mom I was hoping that she dies soon so I could die after. I know it sounds really fucked up, and it actually is. I regret telling her that. She might not remember it now, but still I do, I regret telling her that.

I am sick of everything, and a part of me actually cries inside for feeling like this being so young. I know my life should be more than this, I just don't have the will to solve things, I don't know how to solve things either. I only focus on the problems I can't solve and drill my own mind with them.

I'm 19 male, and I'm probably the most virgin person you will ever meet. I have never went to a party, to a friend meeting, to a “boys night”, to a dinner, to anything. I don't like to diagnose myself since I feel that's really stupid, but there's the really high chance that I have social anxiety. Just imagining being in the same room of a woman of my age makes me dead nervous, like I really find it extremely hard to move or breathe like a normal human being in that scenario.

I've lost more opportunities than I can remember due to being so afraid of socializing. I've read many advices and saw many videos about the subject and they just make me feel worse.

I have never had a girlfriend, I have never went out of my home for a walk with someone that isn't a family member. I would never speak to my schoolmates the second I left the building.

1560,zey5r5,Adylonglegs,"~~I've always been a very extroverted person.~~
Correction: I _was_ a very extroverted person.

I (5'10, F) was always a person people wanted to hang out with. I was a jack of all trades, be it sports, music, debates, academics etc. 
I had multiple social groups and was mostly at the very core of them all.
I had the height, looks, interests and friends anyone would've wanted.

It's not like life wasn't tough you know ( childhood trauma, abuse, bullying, domestic violence...) but my friends were what kept me centered.
I used to love telling stories and listening to them, _loving and being loved._

All this started slowly changing, I don't know how it started, but I'm guessing a change of environment had something to do with it. ( My family moved a lot as my dad was serving)

I stopped enjoying my extra-curriculars, my grades slipped, I struggled with my identity and purpose. It took 2 years of my life before I realised I had changed but that realisation hit me like a massive wave and I couldn't ignore it anymore. It started bothering me every minute, the fact that _I was no longer who I was before._
I had changed, for the worse. (According to me)

Life kept throwing one thing after the other at me very soon after that and that coupled with the fact that I couldn't recognise myself became too much.

_I gave up._
Here I am, 6 years and still struggling.
Every now and then I'll wake up with a good song, decide to put my extroverted pants on to talk to a few random people and enjoy it, for a short while.

These people that I meet during such instances expect me to be like that all the time and all I can do is sit amongst those people, wondering what I'm doing.

This has been my **every day**, **every minute** and **every second**.
Feeling out of place and without a anyone; and not floating around aimlessly like a feather, no. I'm weighed down by an anchor all the time. I wonder when I'll be free, when I'll float.

_I miss me._


**TL;DR:** Can't recognise myself anymore as life happened. Stuck in the middle of people, without having anyone beside me.",2022-12-07 10:50:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634944561,4,/r/lonely/comments/zey5r5/not_alone_just_lonely/,,0,6,"Not alone, just lonely."

English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has perhaps something in common.

With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ Reddit chat sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-07 17:54:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,0,/r/lonely/comments/zf85t1/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,0,18M Hi everyone!

I really don't see this getting any better, my head is spinning all over the place, i didn't even enjoyed breakfast today, at this point i really want to ram my head into the wall repeatedly just to stop the noise, i really can't do this, and before you go ""why don't you take a walk or something?"" you think i haven't tried? All that causes is more anxiety and stress. I can't play video games calmly, i can't read without thinking about other stuff, hence i can't concentrate on what I'm trying to read, i don't wanna watch videos on the internet because i lose interest minutes into it.

1665,zfg2eq,Puzzleheaded_Sort962,"Almost everytime I come back at my apartment at the end of the day, I am alone. I always let a video or a music run in the background to feel a bit less alone, but it's still the same, only my ears are fooled, not my brain nor my eyes: I am still alone. One of my deepest dreams at the moment is to be next to someone in my bed, to keep me warm all night long under a thick blanket while hearing the rain pouring down outside. A lot of people suffer the same as I do, and I find it terrible, I am not much of a social person, and even if I do talk to other people than my friends I just can't seem to make new friends or girlfriends despite my whole class being fully composed of girls.

I lack motivation for work, and I fear it is the same about making new relationships, I thought college years would be the greatest but no, they aren't. College years are the best: despite being depressed or feeling bad all the time, it's an opportunity to overcome my fears, being all by myself puts me on the foreground of my life, I am the one who has to do all the decisions, I must do the chores otherwise no one else will achieve them. I can do whatever I want, and that's what makes us adults.

As we are all confronting life, alone or in company of someone dear to us, we have to do our own choices, we choose to work or to let things down, we can decide to mess with our lives or to take the bull by the horns. I don't know yet how I will stop this depression, but as long as I have my family, my friends and some motivation backing me up, I'm sure I can do it. Everyone can, we all have our personal matters, family issues, health issues, no social skills, whatever, as long as we seek to thrive, we will always look for ways to overcome the challenges life throws at us.

1673,zfgu4b,oilypopcorn234,"I feel very guilty about this and i need to confess how i realy feel. 
This year i went on a camp(i am 16 F, and this is a sort of survival camp). At this camp, i was with a few of my mutual friends(all girls). Through ons of my friends i met a boy. He was nice and we al got along together and pretty soon started hanging out. This camp is a week long and we were in each others company 24/7. I was very actracted to this boy but did not act on it because i did not believe that i was in his leuage and i have never dated before, also never flirted before(was just not what i was interested in and i am afraid of love and relationships although i crave it). My after a few days my friend started making comments about me and him, it made me uncomforatble but i noticed that he payed more attention to me after the comments. I did not think anything of it and thought we only grew closer as friends. I started realizing that he might like me because he started doing all his duties with me, talked to me constantly, would always tell me to sit next to him and even one time after i had showered, i lossend my hair for it to dry and he kept looking at me in a way i did not hate. The last two days he started giving me hugs. I did not think anything of it because he gave other people hugs and i am a very afectionate person so i give people hugs and stuff(platonically) all the time. When all this behavior was happening i could not pin down how i felt and convinced myself he was just being nice. I was being extra nice to him and i guess this is flirting? I dont know hoe to flirt so...
 On the last day of camp he said goodbye to me and i gave him a hug and then he wanted another one. After a while he came back and wanted another hug and it felt like he wanted to say something but did not. After the camp he got my number and messaged me, i saw that his profile pic was a photo of when he hugged me the last time. This kind of freaked me out because i still had very mixed feelings about it. My friend who said the comments and gave my number to him sent me screenshots of him asking how far i live from him, and she then asked him if he liked me and he confirmed it and then i saw that she said to him that se thinks that i like him to, this rubbed me up the wrong way because i thought that she gave him false hope, because i have not said to her how i feel about him. He wanted to go ice skating with me and said to her that he wanted to tell me that he liked me then. When i saw this i started bacraking with all the potential feelings i might have been developing and started being very cold to him over texts, justifying this with things like, no he got it wrong and that this is just puppy love and that someone can not start liking me in only a week. He eventually got the hint i guess. And i told my friend that i did not feel the same way about him and then she showed me the messages between them where he said that he might be wrong in thinking that i liked him. 
This broke my heart beacause i felt so bad for him and was feeling very guilty for about 2 months and then the feelings slowly died away. 
Now i am sitting here thinking about it again, 8 months after the camp and thinking about it and how i probably blew my chances at a very nice relationhip with a good guy. I am also probably gonna see him next year at the same camp and i dont know how to act when i am around him. 

This experience has helped me gain a bit of confedence(because i have never been in a relationship or put myself out there because i was convinced no one will find me attractive and like me, i am average looking i guess but i feel super ugly), and after seeing written proof that someone actually liked me and thinking back at how he was towards me makes me feel some sort of way. But i also realised that even though i want a relationship very bad, i am afraid of putting myself out there and commiting to someone. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest and if anywone is actually gonna read this, what do you think?",2022-12-07 22:50:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670449666,0,/r/lonely/comments/zfgu4b/i_accidentely_flirted_with_someone_on_a_camp_and/,,0,1,I accidentely flirted with someone on a camp and he fell for me and then i ran away in fear of commitment

1684,zfi3s0,xelyra,"Iam a woman, I recently turned 20. Since the age of around 13-14 I desperately seeked male attention. I must say, when I turned 18 I certainly received male validation and experiences that fulfilled my curiosity and such. But thats not the point. I want to express how badly i wanted a relationship since being a young teen. How desperately I seeked men from the worst imaginable places.. I can’t say I never had a guy hit on me, because they have, but they weren’t right for me, I wasn’t attracted to them though (it was one or two guys im talking about). I’ve battled this incurable, extremely deep loneliness all my life.. i am a romantic, i love love and the idea behind it. I have been in love with my best friend (who is a woman too, she didn’t have the same feelings for me) but just recently I fell out of love with her. It’s new for me to no longer have someone I love who doesn’t love me back. I so desperately want someone to love, cherish, take care of, support, encourage, hold close and call mine.. I’ve tried dating apps, but no guys there want commitment, it always turns out to be meaningless sex. Currently, my loneliness is not the worst so I am struggling to express my experience.. i just. People say “it only comes when you don’t want it”, but i want it so badly and I have wanted it for the majority of my life, I cant just stop..

1685,zfi5lq,math285g,"Hello all. As a warning my grammar is nort the best :)

My post is basically the title. I am incredibly lonely and have been for years. I know there are groups for lonely people in my city but I am too ashamed of myself to seek them out. 
I fear what they might think of me because of my appearance and I am worried they might think something is wrong with me because I am 22 with no friends. I am worried that I would be much older than all the other people there.
I would never think poorly of others for these reasons, only of myself. 
Right now, I would only go if I was happy with my appearance but that will not happen for a very long time(being optimistic here) even though I feel like my heart is going to give out from the feelings of loneliness :P

Do any of you deal with the same kind of thoughts?

At that time I was 20 and I've still never kissed anyone so I let her. Other stuff happened too but it seemed like good night. I feel like I really let her down or didn't meet expectations or something because she started talking to me less and less. Even if I wasn't good at that, I thought we'd still be friends but she's gone. I don't blame her she had her own life to take care of, I just wish I knew what I did wrong. After that my great grandma died and I've had nobody to talk to since then. It was the second time I've had to carry a casket. I hate it so much and it always messes with my head. I feel so alone. My family really couldn't care less about me and I'm too insecure to ever be in a relationship. I'm to insecure to even meet people in real life anymore. I can't even really remember the last time I was actually happy. Now I'm 23, I'm still never been in a relationship, can't make friends, can't keep conversations going, the most insecure I've ever been, and absolutely alone.

But since the first day of my freshman year Ive stopped trusting people to be my friends while I still talked to them like friends I truly don't see anyone as my friend anymore I got suspended from that school earlier this year for a bullshit reason where the principle was in the wrong and accused me of ""not creating a safe space for others"" my dad worked at the school I went to. I was pulled in by the principle and councilor where the councilor brought up a very private talk I had with her about my life. Im assuming she wanted to trigger an emotional response but I sat there saying nothing as they both accused me of stuff I didnt do partially because I dont trust anyone anymore and never told her the full truth of my story either this same weekend I had told my grandma the same story and she told me how in all her life she learned that you cant trust anyone. I was suspended that day and decided to move schools because I couldnt see myself representing the school i disliked on there basketball team but because of this Ive cut off all ""friends"" i had at my old school im now in my last year of highschool being told I will be able to graduate early at my new school tho I feel as tho I walk with a mask and have now stopped trying to trust in other people now that I would want too ig Im asking myself as I write this whats next for me, as the only Ive had to hold on to these last years have been sports its not like im not smart and have been told by many teachers Im bright and intelligent. Im just thinking over my highschool time in this post as because ive had no one to trust ive thought about these issues in my life a lot but not as much as recently when I injured myself. Im on the cusp of ""adulthood"" and I have no Idea where ill be in the next 5 months Ik im just ranting at this point but im sure theres others like me that dont know whats next for them or for anyone whos thought the same before and have made a life for themselves Im asking you what did/are you doing about feeling lost?

I (female,  early 20s) haven't made a friend since I was a child, and we don't talk anymore.
Well,  that's a lie.  I made some online friends,  but we don't talk anymore either.  

I was home schooled for most of my elementary education, so when I entered middle school I had to learn a lot of social skills. I tried making friends but never really made it past the acquaintance stage and didn't hang out or text anymore.  

Most of the people I got along with in middle school went to a different high-school. High school was an almost fresh start.  However,  after a couple years of not making real friends I lost motivation and stopped trying.  I talked to people,  but never invited anyone over or anything after class.  At this point,  I had online friends that I could talk to anyways. 

The nice thing about online friends is that they  are in your pocket. I can pick up my phone and leave it whenever I want.  Basically,  I was lazy.  

Skip to college.  I tried really hard making friends with 5 girls.  All turned into nothing. I also joined a church group but my dad told me to stop going because they were a cult (okay fair enough). When i no longer lived on campus,  I seemed to only be able to make friends that would last the semester. There was one girl who invited me to her birthday party,  which I was pretty excited about.  She came over to my place after.  Then things just fizzled out.  Maybe it is because I don't drink or smoke.  I don't know. But it made me lose motivation to drive out just to socialize.

Now that I've graduated I've pretty much given up on making friends and now want to date. I never looked into dating much because I had this idea that I should probably have friends first. Oh,  and at this point I stopped talking to my online friends because I didn't like the version of myself that I was when I talked to them. And I also hoped that it would motivate me to socialize more (it did a little but not really).

But with online dating,  I can match and talk to people,  but when it gets close to the ""okay let's meet"" part I lose interest. I realize the issue is me so i deleted all my dating apps. 

Anyways.... if you made it this far... you're the mvp",2022-12-08 01:53:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655431823,35,/r/lonely/comments/zflck8/how_do_you_not_give_up_on_trying/,,0,44,How do you not give up on trying?

But that is all I have going for me. One friend group is done because this whole incident that for once is actually mostly my fault. Another friend group probably won't hangout with me much until the summer, and even then the vibes are still off.

I hate not being able to make friends easily, having to see others live their life while I am too afraid to talk to people. I'm so jealous of others.

Bots are there to make people feel heard when there is no one present.

It's hard to tell if you are reading a message from the past or if someone is currently typing it because bots replicate the way messages have been typed, appearing as if someone is typing in the present.

As it plays be sure to take long, soothing deep breaths. Close your eyes or look out your window and relax your muscles.

1797,zfvjz9,RedAnalysis,"I lost all of my friends over a stupid argument. I wasn’t in the wrong, but the way I went about things was stupid and naive. It’s been over a year and they’ve slowly all drifted away. Recently even my best friend drifted away. He doesn’t return my texts anymore. That’s been an incredibly painful loss. He was so important to me.

My family is slowly drifting away from me too. My mom and dad don’t seem to care that much anymore. Well, they care, just less and less. They never had time for me when I was a kid and it just got worse as I got older. 

My gf is working a lot and taking on a ton of schoolwork. She isn’t helping with chores around the house enough and won’t listen to me about helping out more so I have to either constantly remind her or do it for her. Usually it’s both. Lately when I open my mouth she just seems annoyed. I want to talk about baseball, or philosophy, or math or something and she just doesn’t want to hear it. Lately I question why she’s even with me. She says I make her feel stupid because she doesn’t understand what I’m talking about. I’m starting to resent her. We love eachother but I don’t know if we still like eachother. 

I don’t feel suicidal but I feel increasingly manic. I strongly suspect I have ADHD and it’s been making it hard to function. I’ve changed my major like 6 times over 3 years and I feel so lost. I feel alone. I need help and I’m trying to get it, but I don’t even know how I can be helped, and I feel like no one around me will take me seriously when I say I’m not doing well.

So I’m 30f and I have a decent social circle, I’m an introvert but I have a boyfriend and a few close friends I keep up with regularly so I’m not day to day lonely. (This is not to humble brag at all this very relevant to my overall point so please don’t think I am).

I have had (and probably had since childhood) this gnawing feeling of being alone and that no one really cares about me on a deep level. I was raised by a single mum and I am an only child and I just think if my mum were to die then there’s no one left who would actually on a deep level care if I wasn’t around. I’m not saying others might not be a bit sad if I died but like no one else on a deep level would really really miss me if you get what I mean? No brothers or sisters to care, no real family basically (I have extended family who I’m sure would be a bit sad but essentially I’m in the periphery of their lives).

Am I the only person who feels this? I’m not saying I don’t want to be around and I’m not saying people don’t care about me cos they do. Im a nice person and I think I have brought happiness to other people but if I were to die I just think it would be like ‘oh that’s a shame, never mind’ no one would be that gutted apart from my mum. I just think other people have way more people who are ‘their people’ who would be there for them no matter what and I just don’t have that and it makes my life feel a bit pointless sometimes.

 I'm generally OK with being on my own throughout the year, but as soon as the end of October hits, I am lambasted with 'spend time with friends and family!', 'spend all your money!' adverts, it genuinely makes me feel sick that people get themselves into financial ruin to have that 'perfect christmas' driven by consumerism, and folks who are estranged from families or find it hard to see them like I do etc, then you are left to watch from the outside like some sort of leper. And surely if people need a religious holiday to remind themselves how much they love their families and spending time with them and all that, it's a fickle love shaped by an expectation?

What's more, how sickly everything is. The songs, the films, the imagery, everything is so faux, gaudy and over the top, and based on an unreal expectation of a perfect day, which for many of us is unachievable.

Hi all, long time lurker here. 

My ex wife cheated on me and left. We were married for a very long time. We have kids too. I (male) work out, eat healthy, pray…..work for my career. 

Now my issue is my self esteem is very low, before approaching someone, I already have the thought that she will not like my appearance and character. 

Separately from that, my kids, friends, colleagues… ask me a lot of times why I haven’t remarried or have a girl friend. 

How do you guys cope with the loneliness feeling? 

It’s quite depressing and unpleasant. Cold bed at night, coming home to an empty house on top of that the repetitive questions by relatives about my relationship status.

1838,zg55ux,[deleted],"For the past three years, I have been focusing on work and studies, and I decided to ignore my social life. I have lost contact with most of my friends, and I rarely go out or do anything that starts with the words WORK or STUDY.

Frankly, I've always been okay with being alone. I can get lost in my thoughts and forget about that time, but recently something changed.

Maybe it's because some of my projects failed, and a business that I tried to start was a total disappointment.

It would be nice to have people to talk to, and possibly build long-term friendships.

Here are a few things about me, if you are interested:

* I'm 20 Male.
* I'm an introvert (INTP), but I can be really sociable once I get to know you.
* I'm interested in a broad range of subjects, and I can talk about pretty much anything from psychology and philosophy to art, music, and politics.
* I'm trying to write a book in my free time.
* I like to listen to people tell me about their lives, and I can offer advice or emotional support if needed.
* I'm very out of touch with current trends, and I can sound like an old person sometimes.If that sounds at all interesting to you, please feel free to DM me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just have to say that I'm often busy, especially now that I have a lot of things in my life to take care of, so I may not always answer your messages straight away, I hope that's not a big problem. And I'd prefer it if you are from the Americas or Europe, because of the time zones, but I'm willing to talk to people from anywhere.",2022-12-08 17:18:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/zg55ux/ive_always_been_okay_with_having_few_friends_and/,,0,0,"I've always been okay with having few friends and being alone in general, but recently something changed."

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

1871,zgad01,hazard10_val,"My best friend of 14 years, the constant source of joy and happiness in my life, The one who made sure I never felt ‘lonely’ in this world, just passed away after 6 weeks of struggle.

I got Tommy when he was just 22 days old, when he could barely walk, but his enthusiasm to explore new things was never ending. I don’t remember much of my life before him, I was only 8 when he came into my life, a little bundle of joy, and now he’s left me, and all I can feel is a sinking hole inside me.

Never in his life did he fall ill, which is why when he suddenly lost mobility in his front leg on 31st October, we rushed him to the vet only to learn that his liver and kidneys are not working like they used to, and that he only has hard days left ahead of him. He was jumping with joy a day ago, but now every step he took seemed like a painful one. He recovered some mobility in the next week but his health in the subsequent weeks was on a constant decline.

He stopped eating on 30th November, and stopped getting up at all on 4th December, in constant pain and unease, the only relief from which would be for me or my mother to give him pets or to make him drink water.

I struggled with depression for quite a long period last year, and my mother would ask me to go spend time with him, and I got angry once and said, “ I don’t wanna go see him. He has the same routine everytime. I’m bored of him” I don’t have a lot of regrets but what I wouldn’t give up to go see him, all jumpy and fawning over me, just one more time.

We buried him today, and I couldn’t bring myself to kiss his lifeless body goodbye. What I wouldn’t give to kiss his furry cheeks once more before I laid him to rest.

He fought to live longer till his very last breath, having not eaten for 7 days straight, surviving on sheer will and love seemingly. He was my best friend and He will always hold a very dear place in my heart. I’m only 22, and he only left me 7 hours ago but I’m gonna be counting hours till I see him again.",2022-12-08 20:22:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668271149,33,/r/lonely/comments/zgad01/my_best_friend_passed_away/,,0,8,My best friend passed away

1898,zgdy3c,nuthinforme,"I can't take it anymore.

This without a doubt is the loneliest and most back crushing period of my life. Everything that ranges from loneliness to work pressure to the high risk of dire consequences is devouring me and I feel like I'm no longer able to carry on. 

I tried to survive and save my sanity by recalling some nostalgic memories, memories that when I look back on also have a dark stain in them, but they were a lot more tolerable times. They're memories with people that don't want to see me, people who have made it clear that i meant nothing to them and that they didn't want me when they didn't want to work through the first and slightest misunderstanding that we had, regardless how silly it was. These memories are fading now. I'm forgetting more and more as time goes by, and the ones that remain make me feel little to no improvement.


I'm currently in an awkward state, having lost almost all my friends with the only 3 remaining and 2 of them being judgemental pricks that I constantly have to act in front of and monitor every word i say, friends who bash and mock me for being in the dire situation that I'm in and make me feel like the existing risks are going to be a lot worse than they already are. These risks are taunting me. If I mess up, my 4 year agony would be in vein and my future would be ruined for sure. I wish I was exaggerating, but I know my local system well.

I'm in complete isolation. I don't go out, I don't hang out, I don't buy things, I don't entertain myself, i don't even have time for myself, and i don't live like respected adults. I'm just sitting in my room by myself all the time having to suffer and bare witness to my brain rotting more and more as the days pass by. I'm forced to see how others my age and much younger can live and diversify their activities while I'm forced to endure the work overload and constantly cope with burnout while having only the option to face them with even more work and mindfuckery. I can't stop thinking about it, I can't stop ruminating about how more miserable I would become if my work quality doesn't hold up (which it most probably will not), I can't stop feeling jealousy and envy towards those who get to live a normal life, not a great one, a normal one, one which they have to suffer only a portion of what I'm going through and not the whole package of every possible mindfuckery. Jealousy and envy are things I vowed not to feel and just be happy for everyone. I stayed true to this for a long time, until I snapped and couldn't take it anymore. I don't feel jealous or envious towards Bugatti and pourche owners when i open social media, I'm only in sorrow seeing how people can just live a good balanced life and maintain good relationships, regardless of how cheap it is. 

I was completely against the idea of making ""friends"" online. I wasn't comfortable with speaking to someone behind a cover and knowing full well that I could be lied to about everything. I could write a lisit on the topic. Lately, however, I had subconsciously given up on the idea and only realized it when I found myself talking to a bunch of people online. It was awful. I thought it was amazing, initially, but was immediately proven wrong. I approached a sweet girl who I've grown attached to immediately. She was so goofy and playful and I was hooked. She ghosted me. I don't know why, but it happened. I ranted about it and was consoled by a lady and was even offered her friendship. I remember my face turning to that of a puppy. We talked on and off for a short while before she, too, disappeared. This was months ago. She Definitely opened reddit on different occasions but never responded. What happened? I definetally didn't upset her. There were no signs that she was going to disappear and ghost me. I was reallt attached to her at that point and seeing this happen ruined me. I spoke to a number of people afterwards and they, too, all ghosted me, even the men. Not going to lie, this hurt me a lot. I legitimately felt drained and couldn't walk straight. Someone told me that there is a glitch in refreshing the feed, so he's not really ignoring me. I'm a little skeptical because this has never happened to me in either one of my devices. Even if it is true, they were aware of it, they still would have checked at least every now and then for new messages and not leave me hanging as they promised not to do. I'm still hurt by the girl who specifically offered me her friendship the most. She truly cared. I dont know why she disappeared. I felt warmth and safety while talking to her. I wish I could know if I fucked up somehow and I hope she's OK.

I have to confess that I did feel bothered numerous times by the delays in their responses prior to them ghosting me, but then I used to remember that not everyone is a worthless, lifeless, rotting sack of meat stuck in its parents apartment as a storage room like myself. Luckily, I met one good man who seems to care about chatting with respect to the time zone, of course.


I'm speaking truth, free from metaphors and exaggerations, when I say that I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm changing, and I'm growing, but I have neither the time nor the space to process it and accept it.

I've been having awful panic attacks a lot more frequently recently and in some of them I did have close calls to crying. Eyes only watered a little. It was a few days ago when I was minding my business, going about my day when tears started gushing. They were gushing like I've never seen them do before. I was really crying this time. It continued as I recalled every single issue I had, the ones I talked about here and the ones that i didn't, all in detail. Before I knew it, all the paperwork around me was ruined by my tears. I felt a snese of shame and relief afterwards, like, something was lifted off my shoulders. It was definetally a fine moment.

The next day I talked to the 3rd friend that I didn't speak of earlier. He's the least judgemental person I know but he's always busy and could sometimes take weeks to answer. I spoke with him the whole day and It was also like something else was lifted off my shoulders. I spoke In a language that surprised me. I'm usually terrible with expressing my emotions with words, but this time, I nailed it. I spoke words I didn't know I was capable of. I'm feeling a little better now. Didn't change the reality of my situation or that I'm in a great risk, but it did motivate me to go forward, maybe stick around to see if there is an aftermath, and if so, is it as hideous as It looks? I wonder? 

I senserily apologize for the long post. Have a great day.

1916,zggyz7,Asspinchers,"I've always been on the extreme introversion end of the spectrum, and certainly exhibit some schizoid tendencies, though I wouldn't go as far as to self-diagnose. There was a point in time that I recognized this and started making a real effort to socialize, even if I didn't always want to. In college I had worked hard at it and had a solid social circle, a tight inner circle and a large outer circle. I dated some, but being vulnerable and intimate with people still wasn't my forte so none of those flings ever sprouted into a real relationship. 

After graduating and entering the workforce, I continued to make efforts to stay in touch with my inner circle from school, and to develop more social connections. Got better at dating, but still couldn't maintain an LTR, whether because of my own coldness or because the other person and I just weren't a good fit for each other. 

At a certain point, I gave up on that. I'm going to be intentionally vague here, but I developed a hobby that was occupying all of my focus and interest, I was ignoring literally everything else. My employer and I had some irreconcilable differences and I decided to quit. Fortunately this hobby I was developing turned out to be a profitable one, so I had a new career path to pursue. 

I've neglected this important aspect of my life, using my new career path as a distraction, and a substitute for healthy human interaction. Constantly traveling, barely having a real home, mostly living out of hotels on the road, missing family functions because I decided to work instead. I've kept a part-time gig as well, but it's remote, so there's still no face-to-face interaction, what little time I do spend at home is alone, and in a rural area where I feel like I can't connect with anybody, they all work traditional 9 to 5s, have families, live normally. 

The towns I frequent for work I'm never in for longer than a week at a time or so, I spend all my time there working and sleeping, so I don't get to know anybody. The work is very isolating.

I chose to live this way, and now 5 and a half years later, I don't know how to rebuild a social life, I don't know how to rebuild a dating life, I'm stuck. My choice to live as an obsessive vagabond/hermit has wrecked my chances at living a normal life...with friends....a spouse....a family of my own. 

It doesn't seem like there's any hope of coming back from this...it feels like I'm just going to be alone forever, and it's all my own fault.",2022-12-09 00:14:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667533279,2,/r/lonely/comments/zggyz7/i_did_it_to_myself_and_dont_know_how_to_rebuild/,,0,0,"I did it to myself, and don't know how to rebuild."

Lonelyness has indeed been a staple of my experience since my other half left me (about 6 months ago). My big question is, how do you find either the courage to go on or the passion needed to escape reality? 
I'm at my limit here. I know I'm about to reach a point where it will affect my daily (and work)-life, and it's like I'm constantly scrambling to avert a train of disaster from wrecking everything else I also know, everyone I love and all that I have built to tell myself its all right. I cannot focus on simple tasks, I struggle to make heads or tails about other people interpreting myself and least of all, I can't identify my own needs as compared to those of my family and friends. 
I usually make a point of being at the very least the best informed person in the room, mostly because that's how I can make people respond positively towards me. When the initial rush from feeling usefull dissapears however, I wish to be killed in a motor accident or something alike it. Dying has seemed preferable to living for a long time, and I've given life chances. So many chances to become and to stay different from before, until i do feel like I'm reaching a level where everything seems irredeemable. I hope someone found comfort in this. I'm likely not to respond, due to obvious reasons. Keep struggling people.

1927,zgihri,narcolepticcamel,"I (22m) was brought up Christian but never wholeheartedly bought into it. At uni I went along to church to meet people, and quickly made a close group of friends. Met my ex and we started well, it was both our first relationships. 

Over lockdown I realised I wasn’t a Christian and was just using religion as a crutch to help with my poor mental health. This should have been a sign to end the relationship as she said she needed me to be a Christian too, but I ignored this for many months as I really liked her and wanted to make it work.

It was a tough last few months of the relationship as I think we both knew it couldn’t work with the trajectories we were both on. Ended it back in May, after which I moved back home after uni and fell out of touch with my ex and our friend group.

Also my only friend from high school (also Christian) moved to another city and we’re losing touch too. I have surface level friendships with my colleagues but it’s not the same. 

I’ve never had many friends, but this year has been a different level of lonely as I don’t see any opportunities to make any new friends.

1936,zgk2th,ThoughtFloter,"Hello everyone, to give everyone some context I am 22m. I come from a culture where mental health isn't taken as a serious issue. 
For most of my life I have been lonely. I am a middle child, my elder sibling was always the top academic performer, so I was always expected to perform upto his standard, but at the same time I don't remember being adored and loved like my younger sibling.
During my school days I just used to involve myself with any co-curricular activities/hobbies like singing, painting, dancing, cooking etc just so that I can enjoy something. Dring my Uni, I overloaded myself with so many projects that I was always under so much pressure that I didn't have a moment to think about anything outside the scope, and did have a burnout by the end of it. I recovered and went back to the same coping mechanism during my job and slowly ended up with the work load that was previously being handled by 3 different individuals in the team. 
I migrated out of my country for pursuing a master's degree and now got a chance to socialize and break out of the shell I had built around me over the years. I am now realizing that how lonely I have been throughout my life and how does it actually feel being free and having time to self actually feels like. I am just trying to explore and live life without just burdening myself with everything in the world. 
Also I have been single my whole life and I think at this point even though I sort of feel desperate to get into a relationship and have someone to talk to, I realize it's just my mental state that's responsible for it and I should heal befor I even think of getting into a relationship. I am seeking some professional help, but still just wanted to vent it out somewhere. 
I don't regret anything that I did, I am who I am because of my relentless approach to life, but at this point I am getting to see my life from a different prospective, which in turn I hope will help me become a better person.",2022-12-09 02:20:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666809880,7,/r/lonely/comments/zgk2th/understanding_myself/,,0,1,Understanding myself

1941,zgkc0l,Obvious-Statement503,"I still feel this terrible sense of pain and loneliness. It all started last Saturday, and its still fucking going. Monday was the worst. The headache, the past I've been stuck in, not being able to have anyone I relate to; its all just been a horrible time for me. 

I haven't felt this way in years. 5 years have gone by where my trauma started. I haven't felt like this since then. I've gone to friends for help, but, nobody makes me feel safe but one person. I've gone to family about this, but, they can't help me much. I've written in my notes on my phone about how I feel, and have sent them to the person who makes me feel better. But, that person is busy at the moment. 

I have so much numbness in my chest, I have so much heartbreak, I have so much of my past that my mind is fixated on. I just want an escape from it all. The things I have as an escape aren't here. My car is getting fixed because of an accident I got into on Thanksgiving, and I cant get out of this fucking house. 

I'm trapped in my room physically and mentally. I haven't felt some sort of freedom in a week. I just want to talk to my friend that helps me out. But, I'm respecting their decision to just take time with things. I need something to help.

My mind has been trying to get me to do drugs to escape, but, I know that if I do that, I'm only going to find more pain. I won't find a healthy way out of my pain. I wouldn't be okay anymore if I fall victim to drugs. I've seen the affects of them with people in my life. I don't need them. I don't want them. That goes for alcohol too. 

I just wish I could feel free again. I hope this all goes away within the week. This week has been hell for me. I want to be okay. I've tried breathing it out, I've tried crying, I've tried everything. Nothing works. I let out 5 tears last night after nights and nights of not being able to cry. But, as soon as I started crying, it stopped. I almost cried earlier, but, I held it in for some reason. 

I hate showing people that I'm happy. I'm not happy. I'm only happy when I'm with that one friend that helps me out. I hate being here.

I'm not into SH, I don't want anyone in my life to worry about that stuff with me. I just need my ways of escaping. I need my car. I need my friend. I need my life to the way it was before I was 14. I was so happy. I had my safety and peace of mind ripped right the fuck out of my head. 

I can't help myself. I've tried so many times. There's nothing I do towards myself that would help out, works. I always downplay the things I do to make myself better. I try so hard to do things on my own, but, I can't. I rely on others to help me.

I'm the ""therapist"" friend. Everyone sees me as having so many helpful things to say. But, nobody checks up on me. Only that one friend I keep bringing up has. They make me feel so safe, so calm, so at ease. 

I hate being this way. I hate being dependent on others. I hate not being able to be okay. I hate it here.",2022-12-09 02:32:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647284709,2,/r/lonely/comments/zgkc0l/numb_and_alone/,,0,0,Numb and alone

They have never been outright mean to me, but never as close as those original three. With that being said, they didn't include me in the annual halloween party or friendgiving that is on the friday afterward. They started a different group chat without me. 

Worst of all, after agreeing that we would organise sweek in December, they figured it out in October and when I tried to ask if I could be involved, walked away and told me to shut up. I asked them if I did anything and they said we were never friends to begin with. 

I don't have friends at school. I have no one to eat lunch with or hang out with between classes. Every time I thought I am making a stronger connection with people at school, they get annoyed and angry at me. 

I have always been close with my parents. When this first started I didn't tell them because the daily drama and such is something I don't tell them aside from the occassional story. When I did tell them about what had been happening, they didn't really care. They were sympathic at first, but almost forgot after I told them. We had an event at school and one of the older core friends was walking by and asked her for a picture. She complety forgot how much this one girl hurt me two weeks before. 

Now my older brothers are home from school. Just as when we were in high school together I'm reminded that I am clearly the dumb sibling.

1949,zgl1a7,emo-goose,"I'm only eighteen, and yes, I know ""you'll meet people in college,"" comments will flood in if people even manage to see this and comment. Ever since I was younger, I'd always been obsessed with the idea of two people being so utterly in love with each other and understanding each other and overall being in love with your best friend. I've always yearned for something like that, and as I get older, I feel like I'm less and less likely to ever be with someone like that.

I was super shy and quiet in middle school and therefore had a super low self-esteem, recently my therapist gave me Zoloft to increase my serotonin levels and it's definitely been working, and I have been involving myself more with the kids in my classes, at work, and at fencing, and I've been a lot more social this year, but my self-esteem keeps dropping down because why is it nearly everyone I meet is IN A RELATIONSHIP

Two girls I've become friends with this year have been in relationships throughout middle school and now. In this year, in senior year, one of them had three boys pining for her at some point (not that I want that, I don't need drama like that) and here I am, someone who has never been asked out since probably elementary school and has never held hands with someone in a romantic way.

I'm probably coming across as redundant and whiny and ignorant but god, will it ever be my turn? I'm happy otherwise with my life-- I was in a toxic friendship last year and got out of it, I've making new friends, I'm good at fencing, I'm happy with my development with writing and art, I'm trying to put myself out there more and yet the one thing I think I've always wanted to have, I've never had.

I've applied to a couple colleges, and I'm so scared that it'll be the same there and that no one will show any romantic interest in me then I'll go into my adult years and not share it with anyone. I don't think I'm that bad of a person, I try not to be, I've been told I come across as ""dripping with sarcasm"" and ""too nice"" (quite frankly they're nearly oxymorons to me but whatever) and I feel like those traits aren't too bad, but what if they are?

I try not to be insecure about my personality, but I'm scared it's unattractive to people, or even worse, what if my personality is actually great but people don't think I'm attractive? (This post is dripping with insecurity and sulking, sorry to those reading who are probably rolling their eyes at me)

It's just that I've been trying, a lot more than I have in the past, I'm seeing a therapist, I'm being more social and showing off my personality more, but I'm scared that's not enough.

At 37 was the first time I have no a real friends. I'm grateful for that person but Im still struggling to find people that actually want to get to know me and develop a genuine friendship. My life is so stressful rn for several reasons and all I wanted was

Im sad that the new connections I've made barely talk to me. Like it's not even like they ghosted. They're still on my friends list. Being a busy person is ok but I specifically told them I'm looking for people who have time to build a relationship. I can't get a chance to know you if you send short texts once a week or couple of months. I get the sense that I'm just a filler to everyone in my life. I'm never been someone's close friend.

I'm really disturbed by the fact I have no friends new and old, and most of them disappear

If everyone is so busy then why try to make friends? They're not even friends, more like acquaintances. If I'm being honest, I don't really vibe that well with all of them. But I just wanted someone to talk to. And I hoped we could build a connection by talking and getting to know each other but I barely hear from them

I've been trying myself to put myself out there so I found this new app called Cizzr which is kinda a mesh of Twitter, Yik Yak, and Tinder all gobbled into one app with a mental health twist.

It's pretty sick because you can filter posts and people by their location so you can meet and talk to people in your city instead of people only halfway across the world. There's anonymous posting available and you can even include an emotion per post and then filter by other people with the same emotion.

Highly recommend to make new friends near you and you can message directly on the app between different users. Let me know what yall think.

Granted, during the week I’m by myself 90% of the time due to all of our schedules, but I still see all of them on a regular basis. This will sound so cliche and sappy but a huge contributor to my loneliness is being single. All of my friends and siblings have boyfriends/girlfriends, and I long for a relationship like that. I long for someone I can be with and share how I feel with and just live life with. It’s not like I’m hideously unattractive and shy, but even in situations where I could easily ask a girl out, I just don’t. Even today at work, a really cute girl came up to the counter and I was talking with her. She was smiling at me, looking me in the eye, laughing at things I said, and it was obvious that she was even some what into me. But I just didn’t ask for her number or anything. It’s not like I was shy or scared to do so, I just didn’t. Even my manager was like “bro why didn’t you ask her out” and I said “honestly, I really don’t know.” I could have had something amazing come from that, but I won’t. And now I’ll never see her again. And here I am beating my head on a wall (figuratively) for not taking initiative. Idk, I guess it’s my own fault. I really don’t know why I do that.

1986,zgr3s6,Meilei333,"I've been lurking on reddit in general for a while and i just wanted to collectively reach out to all of you and say this!

""You might be feeling lonely now, but things will get better!""

Now i can tell what you are thinking, hehehe, stuff like: ""how can you be so certain"" or ""ive been alone for so long, what are you talking about"" or even ""ive kept trying and yet i havent made any friends/i have friends and yet i still feel lonely"" my dear friends, these are all natural reactions and i dont fault you for them at all. 

I too in the past (and to an extent currently too :P) have felt lonely, and that i dont have any friends or that nobody wants to be friends but alas, that line of thinking is usually what pushes people away :O

There is nothing wrong with addressing and understanding your issues but for us to make lasting friendships, we need to focus on the positives! What we enjoy! What makes us happy! What we wanna share and how we wanna hang out! As someone who had suffered from severe depression for years, it isnt easy to just ""snap out of it"" like im sure you might've heard from people in your life, and while my method isnt surefire, as everyone experiences loneliness and sadness differently... you have to be willing to open yourself up to the idea of being happy! The whole ""fake it til you make it"" ideology works wonders!!! Plus a quote from my fav streamer is one of my biggest inspirations ""if you arent feeling great, but you know you can make someone else happy, do it. Because seeing someone else happy because of what you did becomes this addictive back and forth process where you feel good knowing that what you did improved someones mood/made their day."" Or something along that extent!

Anyways tl:dr i just wanted to say that despite how you feel atm, there will come a time where you will find people who you are happy around and they too happy around you. In the meantime however, its always good to reach out and try. The more effort you put into it, the more likely you'll find what/who you are looking for!

2033,zh17qz,ADudeNicknamedRoss,"This has been going on for a while, a couple of years, actually. Countless nights just wishing someone was there... someone for me to hold and love. All that's been on my mind are finals but what's after that? I can't keep myself busy forever. Fuck what people say, humans weren't meant to be alone. We're social creatures, aren't we? Everyone says you don't need a relationship, but you can't live in solitude unless you forcibly shut close yourself to it. And I'm not doing that. I figured I'll ask a couple of friends to help me with a dating profile and see how that goes. ""Work on yourself,"" sounds like a broken record. Yet I see most guys out there who don't work on themselves and still get with someone. It's... infuriating. I get that preferences are a thing, but come on. I'm not ""supposed to compare"", but I am better than those guys. And it's not even a matter of lack of self-love. If I didn't love myself, I wouldn't be as healthy and ambitious as I am now. Maybe I lack a little bit of confidence, but that's it. I have so many things to work towards that will grant me a better future, but I do not intend on doing it all by myself. I think I have a lot to give, and sometimes I might be a little aggressive, but that's it. I'm not the nicest guy, but I'm certainly not the meanest. Then I'm told that my luck is just terrible. So is that it? Bullshit. I just need a sign that I don't deserve to be alone. ""Dating is a game"" works when I'm actually dating someone. Give me a break. Yeah, I sound bitter. I have every reason to be. I tell myself every day that I'm not going to keel over and ""be happy with the loneliness"". Who the fuck likes that? I'm not saying being with someone will make me happy, but to me, there's a difference between wanting someone and being lonely. I could be the happiest man on the planet and still want someone to love other than myself. As I said, we weren't meant to be alone, so I feel like this ""acceptance"" of being by yourself unwillingly is a little bit of shit that people preach to shut others up or something. I'm working on myself for myself, but also for that special someone.

2052,zh44qu,G0ldenPanda99,"Venting - idk if it gives a label on its own

Hi
I just need to vent, I don't even need anyone to help me, I just need some relief of telling my story...

So I'm 23 years old, diagnosed with ADHD and on waiting list for a physiatrist (hopefully get an appointment by December 2023) and I have an appointment with a psychologist in March, and I have failed at studying multiple times and I can't keep a job, so I'm home alone a lot... 

I have always had a hard time getting friends. I have 3 friends as of right now, but those are from childhood and at this point I feel like they're pitying me and not actually being friends

I am lonely because I am sitting all alone on my couch, while my boyfriend (who is very social with his classmates a lot) is out partying... 

2 of my friends are out to party, with their friend groups and the last friend is also at a Christmas gathering with her friends

I know all the people they're with, they know me - I just wasn't invited... Of course they can have these parties and such, it's just that I'm never invited ever... Not only tonight

I'm never a choice, I'm never on the list of people they wanna invite for this stuff.. I don't know what I do wrong...


Whenever I've tried to make new friends, it never lasts
I do everything I can to keep replying to their texts, snaps and TikToks to be involved, but it always ends up the same way; their texts get smaller, simpler and less detailed until they just stop replying altogether... 

I'm stuck in life

Everyone says everything will get better when I start studying again someday, but my problem is that I don't have energy for both studying and making friends, and the first few weeks of education is all about bonding with classmates for everyone else while I struggle with the basic school work... So when I get to stage of being alright with the school work and not being drained by it, everyone else have already formed friend groups that don't include me, of course (I don't blame them, it's just so unfair...) 
And the friendships I do get throughout, are just so flaky and fake, almost pitiful or forced through study groups...

I'm a nice person, I really am... 

So I'm all alone on this Friday evening, watching people on the streets sing while they walk towards the clubs arm in arm, and I'm sobbing, cuz I wish that was me...",2022-12-09 18:05:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585783572,8,/r/lonely/comments/zh44qu/tired_of_being_no_ones_choice/,,0,10,Tired of being no one's choice

2057,zh4oec,Quagmire1912,"Ever had that feeling like you are wasting your life, and there doesn't appear to be anything to fix it? ... and that you don't even actually want to fix it?

Yeah, I've had that feeling for the better part of the past 3 years.

I've put exactly zero effort into changing my situation. I isolate myself the best I can. I distance myself from anyone that shows care. I sabotage myself at every corner.

I hate myself. I hate everything that goes on in my mind. I hate my actions. I hate my personality. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I've given up on everything. I'll never accept myself for what I am.

There is no fixing the damage I've done. I'm socially inept. Not because of some illness. Not because of some disability. It's all because of my own actions. I'm consistently putting effort into not socializing. I tell myself I don't need anyone. I tell myself I'm unlovable and unlikeable. I've managed to fully convice myself that I'm worthless. That everything I stand for is meaningless. Every my action leads to nothing but pain.

I'm doing everyone a favor by staying away. By being worthless trash.

2062,zh5d9d,LittleMoongi,So basically after I finished my education I started to search for jobs. My only two friends found one quickly but was left behind. Eventually I found a job that sounded interesting but I applied because I felt the pressure and said yes when they wanted to hire me. Now one week later I feel absolutely miserable. My team are very outgoing people and love to drink and visit bars and eachother home outside of work but I’m absolutely not like that. They told me the first month is mostly getting to know your coworkers but I took everything way to serious and wanted to work immediately. This made me force myself to lunch to meet with other but I never felt a part of the group and they keep pushing me to be social but that is just not how I work. So because of this I started hate myself more and more thinking something is definitely wrong with me. That I am the alien who can’t speak human tongue. I also realized how incredibly lonely I am because I don’t have group of friends I meet every week or talk to a lot. I tried to tell them I am not a very out going person and very much a introvert and it takes time for me to feel comfortable but the more they push me to socialize the more I wanna hide and feel even more miserable… it’s important there to work as a team and it will make your job a lot harder if you don’t go further just polite talking. I tried to show my interest by face expressions when certain topic came up but whenever someone ask how am doing it feels like I actually don’t show any interest in me since I’m not the same as them. I really do have to feeling it’s all my fault and I’m the problem and not them since they are not mean to me in a anyway…. But I’m just very lost and realized how lonely I am since I have no one to talk to this about who will understand… it kinda felt good to write this down sorry for the rant I don’t expect anything in return,2022-12-09 18:52:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1564826546,6,/r/lonely/comments/zh5d9d/failure_in_life/,,0,0,Failure in life

2074,zh6r2c,HugsHelpHeal,"Don't know if this is the right sub for this but I am just tired of not being able to connect with people.

The program I am in school for is super social. It's online but the class is always trying to get together over zoom and hang out/study etc. I had to retake this class so my former classmates(a few of which I got along with) are now in another class. So I am in a group of new students and it's like I don't exist. I am very shy by nature, but I try to force myself into the social gatherings to meet people. It's hard to get through this program without your classmates having your back so I am trying to make friends here. But with this new group it feels impossible. Everyone is super kind and sweet and chit chatty with each other, then when I talk, it's just radio silence. No one cares, or hears me.

This only ever happens to me, so I know its a me problem. There's something wrong with me, something that puts people off and I just can't figure it out. I am kind to people, and I know I am not going around hurting feelings or anything. Maybe it's because I simply don't talk a whole lot? Whatever it is, I am tired of trying. I can't be myself, and I'm too exhausted to try and pretend to be some kind of super social butterfly. I don't know what to do other than accept the fact that I am just unappealing to most. It's super defeating but it feels like I was meant to be alone.

I will try to hold on to the few friends I made in the last class. But this new group of students is just not it. There's some kind of in person gathering happening next week but after trying to do a ""social hour"" with them today and being ignored, I am not sure I am going to that in person thing. I know I will probably be more comfortable alone. I feel like I might have some fomo if I don't go. At the same time, I know it's going to be me in a corner being looked over as per usual.

I'm not trying to be negative...but it's hard to be positive when you feel so completely alone.

2095,zh8kk8,phantasm-blue,"i thought that christmas would somewhat make me happier and feel less lonely - changing my sleep schedule to wake up the same time as my family - messaging my friends more constantly - joining discord servers - trying to make friends on here - trying to make friends overall - i thought all of this would help. 
I just feel lonelier than before, which was already rock bottom for me. 

i changed my sleep schedule so i could see my family more but they are all so incredibly busy. i wake up earlier than them too and it makes everything feel much worse, it’s like i’m not even here. my sister has nightshifts so she’s asleep all day and gone all night, my parents sleep early and have been so busy at the moment preparing for my birthday and christmas, my brother is kind of busy too with his own sleep schedule and stuff 

i think i have friends but i can never really tell. conversations are so incredibly limited with the few people who talk to me and the rest seem to just ignore me completely and then bombard me with their life instead. or some of them make it clear that i have many problems and i feel like such a burden. i don’t mean to be a burden i never wanted to be this way i’ve tried so much to change but nothing is changing somehow i feel worse than i ever ever did. my loneliness has become so much more than just my brain fighting itself and forcing me to feel and be so isolated. it’s become so physical and so real and i just feel so completely hopeless and worthless and empty. 

my birthday is so close. 4 days. birthdays i feel it the most. i’m grateful and thankful for the presents my parents buy me but i feel so guilty at the same time because none of it helps any of the pain go away for more than a few minutes. it makes me feel great and stupid and pathetic. i think i am pathetic idk. i’m probably just being so stupid but when you have hated yourself so many years and you are the only person you are stuck with 24/7 for months and years on end it gets so tricky to cope. i live with my family so i’m surrounded by those i love so dearly but none of it makes me feel any less lonelier. idk how to describe it i feel so selfish for saying all of this. i’m just so desperate to have anyone to talk to. so desperate to be with anyone but me.",2022-12-09 20:59:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606233522,1,/r/lonely/comments/zh8kk8/dont_know_how_to_cope/,,0,3,don’t know how to cope

I (20f) am having a hard time in my life. Im also having a hard time fully grasping what the fuck my problem is. I know mental health is a real issue but for some reason when it comes to myself, I can’t help but be such a dick to myself about my own struggles. Anyone else im there being supportive and have no issue acknowledging that depression, anxiety, etc are real issues. For myself, I beat myself up constantly. I feel like I can’t grasp that I’m truly fucked up. I keep trying to figure out why and I don’t know if there’s a real reason. And I think I’ve always been like this im just now realizing. Like as a kid I was kinda mean to my siblings and my parents, I always had this attitude, never wanted to really talk or spend time with people. Maybe that’s normal for some kids but I think about it a lot (mostly because of how it now affects my relationship with my siblings and parents and it’s brought up semi often) and I’m still kind of this way but the only difference now is that im diagnosed with depression and anxiety and according to my therapist possibly some other things as well. Anyways. I guess what I’m trying to say is I have these issues and I don’t really have a reason for them. Or I don’t think I do. I’ve had a lot of shit that happened in my childhood with my parents being separated and eventually divorced (very messy), witnessing my dad choke my mom and having to push him off of her, fighting constantly (yelling cursing etc, never physically besides that one time), weird shit through middle school (when I first started to question whether I was depressed, self harm and thoughts of suicide began), All through out my life a lot of loneliness. I think I may have a substance issue but I’m trying not to let it turn into something really bad, I also think I have a weird issue with like sex, intimacy relationships. I may have some sort of addiction tied to sex and or masturbation or may be using it as a coping mechanism that isn’t entirely healthy. Using men to fill a void or male affection and intimacy. Idk. The biggest issue right now is my grades are suffering. I’m in college. Going to an art school. Im a junior and only have a year and a half left. I’ve been considering leaving for about a year now. Almost did, but my mom pressured me into staying because I have a full ride scholarship. (I didn’t ask her for money for school+she doesn’t help me in terms of money so that was never a part of it at least from my end) I had a plan for leaving and my dad was going to help but it all went down the drain. Now my gpa is suffering. I’m suffering. I think about suicide almost everyday. I constantly worry about my future and money and how I’ll live and survive in the world with the state it’s in now especially if I continue with art. I’m just suffering all over and I don’t want to make it anyone’s issue. I don’t share this stuff with anyone. I keep it all to myself because as the oldest child, the big sister, always been the golden child and golden student, I have to keep it together. I’ve been suffering for as long as I can remember. It’s just harder to cover it up now and I’m struggling to find a reason to continue besides my siblings. It scares me how badly I want to hurt myself and end my life.

And I’ve only ever had one real best friend; but sadly I moved states. Anyways, I’ve always felt left out and disconnected. Just today I was at PE walking alone and, there was two girl in-front of me walking. When they saw me behind them; they walked away while staring at me. There even more where that came from. Like I’ll be sit at a table and then people get up just to avoid being near me. I also remember, when I asked a question like “what time is it” and getting completely ignored. Now you’re probably thinking there’s a reason why people think I’m weird; but I am usually very quiet and have never gotten into drama. Keep in mind, that the current school I’m at is my first year there ;so no one knows me. I’m getting sick of being lonely, I try to make conversation but I get ignored. Don’t get me wrong, I have a good family and have a good home life but, I hate having no friends. I hate when teachers force me to partner up. I’ve tried all I can to make conversation,but end up getting dirty looks and being ignored. I’m not even ugly or anything so why don’t I have any friends?I hope there isn’t a flaw in my personality.

I mostly just want to be loved by someone, but for that, I feel like I need to completely change who I am as a person, and I don't really want to do that. I've been depressed for a while, but it mostly comes and goes. When it goes, I always have the fear that it will return, which it always does. And when it comes, I have no desire to move on at all. I just have a constant feeling that I'm not built to live in this world, and honestly, I really don't think I am. Regardless, I push on alone, even though I feel like this won't ever change. It’s just very empty inside, and no one wants to be with or around someone who can't smile, so I'm stuck in this loop of misery. I also hate it when people say to ""love yourself"" and others will love you, but I'm physically unable. I don't like who I am. I don't like the soul or brain I've been given. And I don't see that ever changing really, it’s just how I'm wired. Although, I love helping other people whenever I get the chance. I like making people feel happy; it brings me a lot of joy (temporary of course). I just can't do that for myself. I don't know, I just don't really care anymore. It feels like everything that once made me human is slipping and dying. I don't even get depressed anymore, just waiting to go somewhere else. Some people cherish life, well I despise it. I wish I could trade myself in for someone who dying of deadly disease who really loves life, because what’s my purpose if this is how life is for me. Anyways, thanks for reading my rant.

I don't see future because my entire focus is just surviving the day. And I see the amount of unconditional love people shower on each other on a daily basis making sure their loved one know that they are important and precious.

2158,zhgz3b,SupaChevy,"Hi! Im a newer reddit user, though I’ve known about it for a long time. This might sound loser-ish, but recently I’ve realised I’m kind of lonely. I heard that reddit can be a welcoming and warming place, so maybe I can find some people going through the same thing I am. 

I’ve known for a while that I’ve been on the back end of a lot of friendships, like I’ve never had one person to depend on and have always just been ‘known’ by different groups. During school, I would hang out with different people or go up to people and start having a conversation, but outside of school we basically have nothing to do with each other. Unless I was coincidentally in an area where someone was planning to do something, I wouldn’t get personally invited to anything or be added to any group chats. It’s not like people don’t like me, I was actually quite popular at my old school, and at my new one, but in general, I was always lonely on the weekends. I think at this point, unless I meet someone like me I won’t be able to migrate into a group. I don’t have a huge problem with being lonely right now as I am still young, and I’m very lucky to have the social skills to get to know new people, but just seeing everyone in my grade go out after graduation without me really hit hard. These were all the groups I spoke to and made connections with, but they were also people I’d never spoken to.  I guess I’m just someone to speak to when it’s convenient, I mean I know all the drama and tea that happens, but I think people just tell me that stuff because I would have no one to tell. Is anyone else going through something like this? Let me know :)",2022-12-10 02:56:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670639999,2,/r/lonely/comments/zhgz3b/hello/,,0,4,Hello! :)

I can't have sex, and I don't want to go through the process of identifying and treating the issue until I know definitively if I test positive for certain ailments and mutations. I don't want to burden my partner with that kind of news. If it's not any of the deadly ones, I still don't know if I'll have enough money for treatments to even matter. I want a partner to marry and have intimate relations with. But I can't have that, and I don't want someone who is asexual because it feels forcibly limiting and painful that I have to select someone that I'm not physically attracted to (arousal is painful as fuck). 

I wish I was more accepting of nothing. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but it's absolute torture. Not to mention my past itself.

2179,zhj9xu,bo1wasthebest03,"I think most of us when we were kids we just wanted to grow up immediately, so we could do whatever we want. I especially felt this way, but since turning 18 I’ve realized I lived the best moments already in my life. I’m 19 and I have colon cancer, I suffer from FAP (Familial adenomatous polyposis). It causes problems with my digestive system and just overall a lot on my body and mind especially during this time. The past year has been a horribly weird one tbh. I remember the feeling of being depressed but not a lot of actual events since my memories are awful. I like being active, I’m not no professional at sports but I loved playing them especially when I felt I wasn’t being held down, I just love going outside and feeling free but I can’t really do that as much since I can get really sick easily. Lately I’ve felt like cutting most people out of my life that aren’t family. Idk I know my condition isn’t where I’m on my death bed but I do feel I’ll have a earlier death than expected, again idk if I should be scared or relieved of that. I watched a movie early abt a family where the mom gets cancer then passes away and everything is horrible. While watching the family cry, I  started to cry. I don’t want to do that to anyone else. Ik I can’t control hurting my family that way but maybe if I shut my social life completely down that I can keep the pain and all that away from everyone else. It may be weird at my age but my dream has always been to have a wife and 1 daughter and be a small family. I wanted to even name her after my mom if it all happened since she’s really my only parent. But with my disorder I could easily pass that down to my kid and I don’t want that and Ik you can adopt but I’m just not there yet, like I wanted a biological kid, I wanna see parts of my family and my S/O in my kid. But at this point I think I’ve realized I’m going to have to settle for the bare minimum and idk if life is worth living that way. I’m going to be mostly stuck inside most of the days besides the endless pain and depression. I just don’t wanna hurt anyone or be hurting anymore. I’ve already cut a few people out of my life today and although I feel bad Ik sooner or later they’ll forget about me and it won’t hurt them when my time does come. Tbh I don’t know why I exactly posted this. Idk if I wanted to talk to someone for advice or if I just wanted to get my feelings out idk.

Pretty sure I'm failing this class now.  The project was weighted to 40% of my final grade.  I know I'm not doing well on this project, which will bring my grade down to at least a D.  Grade wasn't as high as I wanted to begin with.  Had some health issues halfway though the semester, fell behind, and was never able to catch back up.  More disappointed in myself than anything else.

Shitty part about it, is that I though finishing my project would be a good way to work into my birthday.  So, December 10, starting my 37th birthday, with something that just got me down a bit.  Its always rough this time of year for me, but eh, it is what it is.

Anywhos, what are you all up to tonight?",2022-12-10 08:12:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654450140,11,/r/lonely/comments/zhmru6/back_at_it_again/,,0,13,Back at it again

  I wish I could wear a mask everywhere and avoid from showing my face.

  I don't want people to know what I look like because it draws them in like flies. My face and body provoke lust in those around me and it's terrifying. It's increasingly hard to avoid these situations in public places like school and work. I would go around the world as the only faceless person in I could.

  I wish I had more time to rest between my little performances.

 Recently I have been bouncing between both of my jobs and school with barely any time for myself. I basically never get to go home. Worse yet, one of my bosses is trying to make the moves on me during my lunch break. The one time during work that I can do a little self-maintenance is being used by an old guy trying to get in my pants.

 I am just expected to brush it off and keep going. I feel like I am an alien trying to act normal. 

 I wish I could enjoy life a little more.

 I am so exhausted. Getting up is becoming a chore. These little glimpses of hope for the future aren't enough to sustain any motivation long-term. 

 I wish I was hidden",2022-12-10 08:14:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667660359,4,/r/lonely/comments/zhmt6v/i_wish_i_could_breathe/,,0,4,I wish I could breathe

2209,zhnepr,afickleghost,"Why does it seem I am completely cursed to live a life of suffering and torment. I am shown what a happy fulfilling loving life can be like and I always get so close yet it's just out of reach. It's like an invisible wall between me and happiness. I don't enjoy living for myself, I can't do anything for myself, yet I am too awkward, ugly, autistic, broken, cowardly, pathetic, worthless to make a difference in anyone else's and time and time again it shows when every good thing that comes my way, the very moments before it blooms it starts to wither all due to my faults. At a certain point in time I realized all I do is end up disappointing others, so the next best thing is to hide away from everyone, alone, until I die. I can't make that special someone happy, I know that now. That's really all I cared for. I want to cry but the best I get is a lump in my throat that never goes away. I freeze up and faze out, I cannot relax, I can't even remember what that feels like anymore. Every muscle in my body is tense. My neck hurts, I clench my teeth, I can't breathe deeply. I can't do anything. I want to feel loved and to love, in fact I need it but I can't let myself hurt people anymore. I still remember the younger me when it wasn't so bad, hanging out with friends after school, running, playing sports, smiling and not having anxiety. It was only I started becoming an adult that I realized I could not do adult things, I could not grow up, I could not have an adult conversation, yet my peers all around me had all grown and changed, they had a mature character with a life, goals, family, and for me time just stopped and I started degenerating mentally and physically, wishing to be young again. 

Now I'm nothing. I didn't do anything for the last 10 years of my life. Nobody knows who I am, because I live inside my head. I cannot share happiness, because I live inside my head. I cannot express myself because it overwhelms me to no end so I never say a thing, people just think I'm a peculiar quiet guy that has no feelings or emotions and that just hurts even more. I fear people seeing me and avoid any contact whatsoever even though I desperately need it but this hatred for my worthlessness and the way I disappoint others is far stronger. I feel like there is no balance with my mind and body, they are at war and I'm in the middle of it just wondering why, why am I here? When does it end? I never wanted to be here, at the end of the day I'm just a broken faulty product of people's sin and greed. So tired. Here's to hoping I don't wake up tomorrow &lt;3.",2022-12-10 08:52:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670660467,3,/r/lonely/comments/zhnepr/why/,,0,0,Why?
2210,zhnk19,ReferenceIll4550,"But yeah, its my birthday.  Granted its just the beginning of it, but its here yet again.

Another year of things I wish I had done.  Another year without my dad.  Another year without my sister.  Another year being a parent to my own mother.  I would have hoped that turning 37, and trying to be there for my own children would make me feel like I have a purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like my purpose is just to be a caretaker.  I don't mind, I take of those I love.  But sometimes I would like someone to take care of me for once.  I guarantee when I wake up, i'll be the one making breakfast for my wife on my birthday.

Normally I don't do these posts.  I know that many people have birthdays around this time.  This year is just hitting me hard.  I may be because my youngest, who is 5, reminds me more and more of my sister.  She passed almost 12 years ago on tuesday from brain cancer. It could be where i'm finally taking my therapist's advice and trying to talk to my wife about my feeling just getting yelled at for it.  i don't know.  I've even have tthoughts of cutting myself like when i was an emo asshole in highschool.  I don't know what side is up anymore

Only real thing I have to look forward to is Having a lunch at a resturant.  I'm was supposed to go out for drinks and wings with a few friends, but they've already bailed.  So, if anyone is around tomorrow night, i'll probably be doing the sitting in the dark drinking while on reddit to celebrate.  I'd love it if anyone would join me

2215,zhnyu4,idkanymorexx,"I could really really use someone to talk to rn. I’ve been having pretty severe anxiety every night for the past week and it’s so fucking scary. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder so i’m familiar with what anxiety usually feels like for me but every now and then it’ll just feel…different. Scarier. Harder to tell if it’s just anxiety or if i’m genuinely having a health emergency. 

I’m having nonstop heart palpitations and an irregular heartbeat. Chest feels like it’s being squeezed. It’s hard to breathe, feels like i’m being strangled. After all these years I still never know when to go to the ER or just chalk it up to anxiety. It’s all so physical. I’m so sick of this. 

I live alone and I honestly have no friends and it’s frightening not having anyone to reach out to when you’re feeling like this. Not having anyone to comfort you when you’re desperate and in need is gut-wrenching. 

I’ve been trying to distract myself, started Wednesday on netflix, but my mind keeps reminding me that i’m just trying to distract myself and I freak out all over again. I’ve been too depressed to even watch anything lately anyway. I try to lay down and think happy thoughts but my go-to happy thoughts are always memories my brain fights hard to reject/block out, like exes I miss and every cute romantic moment we ever shared. And then I remember how they all ended. And I trigger myself all over again. Happy thoughts that ultimately just bring me more sadness. 


I wanna sleep but i’m too scared to even do that. Last night I kept waking up from panic attacks in my fucking sleep. What the hell is wrong with me? Why can’t I ever just be…okay? 

I don’t feel like myself. I haven’t felt like myself in a really long time. I’m so worried about that. I’m terrified. 

Someone talk to me please. Or offer me some insight. Or recommend me something chill to listen to. I’ve been listening to Lana Del Rey, John Mayer, Joji, and Cigarettes After Sex all day lol",2022-12-10 09:25:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1540108043,2,/r/lonely/comments/zhnyu4/never_ending_anxiety/,,0,1,never ending anxiety

2224,zhoxlz,AmphibianSuperb804,"Let me start by saying, i don’t know if I should be here. I feel lonely, a lot. really, lonely. but i have someone in my life. She’s treated me wrong a lot in the past, but she’s trying. 

Now, why am i here posting this. This relationship i am in has been through constant fighting and struggle, and i gave up everything. I have nobody besides this single person who used to treat me unwell and sometimes still lets it slip out. I had friends i was close to and I had to give all of them up, to the point where i can never see or speak to them again even if I want to. Im more distant from my family than i think I have ever been. 

When I am not with her i am trapped inside myself, when she’s not around I am always alone and I am always forced to feel this way. Even when i’m with her it’s starting to feel like the way this is weighing on me is making her less interested in trying to be aware. I feel like I have so much to say but I can’t even find the words to get it out because they’re trapped, buried in my head and i’ll only find them for the right person. 

I’ve made mistakes, i still feel guilt over them, i’ve repaid her as much as i can; i’ve made the changes to be better, i’ve done as much as possible to repay her but it doesn’t feel like it will ever be enough. the feeling of being stuck trying to repay some debt while my consciousness crushes me slowly is killing me. And I have no support anymore to save me, and i can’t go to her because she’d get it all wrong and misunderstood what i really mean. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, i feel so trapped, i feel helpless in a box. Maybe all this is too much for this subreddit, maybe i’m just better off than i think and it’s nothing bad. I don’t know. I just want somebody to care again, i miss the feeling of always knowing somebody cares about me.

So far, it's turned out to be more boring than sad, that it kinda *becomes* sad. 

The *actual* loneliness, broken down into the most basic and practical level, is a lack of susbtantial stimulation and engagement from other human beings, and so far it's the boredom of it that's making an impression on me than the sadness of it. 

To be honest, I kind of *miss* being all inwardly dramatic about my loneliness. When I used to see myself as a tragic outcast, destined to be all alone, etc. It used to possess and drive me to write another song, or do some poetry no one will read.

2287,zhyvnf,Banjomm,"
(before getting mad at me, please keep in mind i do not HATE MEN. i am scared of them. i do not hate men or want bad things to happen to them simply for being male)

I am a 24 year old woman. I have never been intimate with a man, let alone kiss or hold hands with one. I’ve never had a boyfriend or had a male express interest in me. The only times a boy has asked me out, was a prank. Or their friends dared them. Or they were cruelly mocking me, trying to get my hopes up only to laugh in my face and tell me I would never actually have a chance with them. 



Growing up, I was bullied by both male and female peers in school. But when a boy calls you ugly, it just hurts so much more than when a girl calls you ugly. Because when a girl is bullying another girl, and trying to bring down her looks, it’s because they’re insecure and hateful. But when a boy mocks you, calling you ugly and fat? That shit hurts. That is personal and traumatizing. 

I can’t even begin to count the amount of times i’ve had male classmates verbally torment me. Sure, I was never physically bullied, but the way boys talked down to me during my school years severely effected my psyche and self esteem. 

I’ve never have been conventionally beautiful. I know I never will be. I have come to terms with this. I know I’m ugly, and it’s just something I have came to accept. 

It’s not just my irl experiences with men that have made me scared of them. It’s reading what men say about women online that makes me upset. On the internet when you have anonymous powers, people will say how they truly feel. And I have seen countless misogynists in youtube comments, reddit, twitter, etc. 

I never thought men hated women that much. But just scrolling through random subs, I see all the vitriol and hate. 

Women are liars who will falsely accuse any man of rape. women will cheat on you then divorce you and take your kids. women are whores and only want a nice guy after theyve been used up. women are irrational. women aren’t logical. women can’t be held accountable. women are irresponsible. cunt. bitch. whore. 

women can’t drive. women aren’t funny. women aren’t smart at all. if a woman sleeps with more than one man in her entire life, she is a slut. if a woman never has children, she is worthless. women are only valued if they bring a man’s child into the world. women are only valued for their body. 

Day after day, i see this rhetoric. over and over and over. and rarely do i see men actually arguing and calling out the sexism. because if they do, they get called a soyboy beta cuck. 

It’s disturbing. The internet encourages apathy and cruelty and discourages any kind of kindness. Not to mention how the number 1 popular insult are telling people (usually women) that they don’t have dads, mocking them for being fatherless. as if that is the daughters fault. 

ironically, i have a terrific relationship with my father. i love him. he is one of the few men i trust and love. my brother as well. my male family members have always treated me with kindness and compassion and for that, i appreciate them. 

Now obviously I know “not all men” are evil. men have their own problems of course. and of course there are many evil women as well.  but so many men take their own frustrations with society out on women. women are basically the scapegoat for men’s problems it seems like. 

There is always a way to justify it. Whether it be religion, their own personal experiences with terrible women, or they are just hateful. 


Growing up I knew that women were mainly valued for their looks. And once they hit 30, or “the wall” as so many men love to call it, we become virtually worthless. If you don’t have a husband and a kid by 30, you are essentially fucked. good luck finding a man if you’re old and barren. 

I am 24. I turn 25 in a few months. I’m basically 5 years away from being permanently “past the expiration date”

I have accepted my fate. I don’t mind being a single virgin forever. Sure, I’ll be a stereotypical cat lady. At least I’ll have animals to keep me company. I don’t see why that is so bad? 

I feel like, at least then my life will have some sort of purpose. I take care of abandoned animals and give them a warm home.

I don't mind the peace itself but I do not want every weekend to be me in front of my PC. I miss the old gang, I miss my ex as much as I have also come to resent her, I miss doing stupid and silly stuff during the weekends. I have people I could play games with they don't feel like my ""tribe"". It's same pattern really, gangs come and go, a select few I keep in touch with. Others I try to initiate contact with but if I feel like I reach out to them more than they reach out to me(if they do) I stop reaching out and the contact fizzles into nothing. 

I don't feel sad per say right now, calm but just calmly thinking. Perhaps I'll light a candle and to all of you who feel alone I give you a big old bear hug 🫂

2296,zi0ls0,nazstat,"Hi All, 

So my situation is that I work from home. I live in a city nearby where I grew up, so I have friends, however, they are all what I call ""legacy"" friends - I see them on occasion, but not regularly (and that is OK with me). They are there if I need them, but we are not ""active"" friends.

I live alone (or close to it). I'm currently looking for co-ops, or communal-style living arrangements to move into next month, so I'm hoping that will alleviate some of the loneliness, and that I'll feel a sense of community there. 

However, I'm at a loss for what to do otherwise. Spending all day alone kind of sucks, and I don't want to rely exclusively on after-work activities to get my social time in (for several reasons, notably it's exhausting to have to go search for social connections every day after work). I'd like to see people during the day, so I'm thinking of joining a co-working space. I don't know how well those actually work for say, joining people for lunch, or if you just kind of work together- alone. I've only tried it once or twice but will try it again in the next couple of weeks. 

If anyone has any other tips for someone in a situation like mine (which is probably a lot of people since covid forced a lot of people into work-from-home arrangements), I'm open to them!",2022-12-10 19:07:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599790515,1,/r/lonely/comments/zi0ls0/want_to_be_less_lonely_how/,,0,0,Want to be less lonely - how?

The worst thing is the fact that they should do, I constantly hurt peoples feeling without meaning to and I can only apologise so much. It’s also hard to show them that I’m sorry because it’s next to impossible to go and meet them around that time, they’re too far away.

But anyway it was my decision but now I don’t have that person around me anymore, it’s horrible for someone I’ve known for 8 years and been so intimate with for 3 to just disappear out of my life.

I was alone and it sucked.

If you belive you have no reason to live, you also have no reason to fear death either, and thus open yourself up to a world of opportunity to find your sense of happiness, value, or purpose.

This is what I did.

Over 2 years ago, I felt like there was nothing else for me, I was hopless, and felt there was nothing for me. My family was abusive, they didnt seem to reliaze how they isolated me from everyone and everything growing up by denying me opportunity to be with others my own age. Hell I basically didn't even go to school and had to teach myself everything.

When I hit my lowest, and got tired of being denied help or even validation for my stiggle, I chose to throw it all away. If I had no future to live for and no hope let me leave and find it by any means.

I threw away everything and ended up homeless and went on so many adventures, and learned my true strength.  Now its been two years and I have done more than most at my age including travel on foot in texas over 100 miles to say hello to somone I knew
 but I am not done. I am soon to head to europe for my next adventure.

The thing is there is always somthing you can do, and if you belive you have no value or nothong to live for, than what do you care enough to take a chance to die for. For me it was a chance at connection and a better life for myself, and I would rather die trying to find my future, than die wallowing in sadness.

Seems like everything should be fine right? Wrong. In middle school I made a lot of friends. When this whole pandemic happened we were forced to go online. Then school ended and that was that. We went back to school the next year and after the first half of the I asked to go to online school. Not because I was afraid of the pandemic or because my mom was I just never thought about it till then. I enjoyed online more. There was no zoom calls, No hours of sitting at a desk just a small test you take once a day. Take a 5 minute test and your done. I enjoyed it. I eventually wanted the social interaction so I tried real school for the first week and hated it and went back online. A year later I tried again and hated it so back online. Another year and a half passes and here we are today. Everyday I sit in my room and stare at my computer waiting for my friends to get home so we can play games. Some days only one friend gets on. Some days 5 Friends get on. Some days it’s just me. The days where I’m alone are the worst. I cried for the first time in a year and a half because I was so alone. I see my mom everyday. I see my dad a little before he goes to bed. My younger brother goes and hangs out with his shitty gf and shitty friends. My older siblings are all 10 years older than me. The months go by like days. The some weekends I’ll invite my little cousin over. Occasionally my friends will come over and have a party. None of my friends know I’m crippling alone and anxious. Not even my mom knows. Sometimes I’ll just write in my notes about it. Just to get it out. Everyone just thinks I’m cheery ole me always cracking jokes. I’ve even thought about Suicide but I don’t wanna die.

It’s not my friends’ responsibility to always be there literally 24/7, which is why I just cycle through them when they’re busy. (I love and care for all of them, but I understand if there’s things they need to do) But I’m not able to do that much anymore, because there’s only a few, as my circle has gotten even smaller. I just spend increasingly more time with myself, and I’m lonely. That in turn makes me so sad I can’t function really. Everybody else makes friends so easily. They have other groups. I even downloaded Bumble BFF to find somebody nearby, but nobody replies. Everybody I worked with would exclude me, and I’m unable to drive so I can’t even go “find” people. I don’t know what to do.

Upon getting my diploma, I left the building to cry in fear only to come back and sit with faculty again.

In all honesty, even despite the hugs and support I got from friends, I'm either so lonely or so overwhelmed by all the support that I just run away from it all. It's all a lose-lose situation for me. But this loneliness while terrible on its own, is the lesser of two evils.

2355,zi6xer,Moonlight-Phoenix,"Yes being lonely sucks, but complaining about it isnt going to do anything but make you feel worse and more alone, especially when no one replies.

Your lonely right? Well what are you (emphasis on you) doing to change that? While not being alome requires more than just you, there are alot of things you can do to start to move away from being and or feeling alone.

First off, what is your approach? Are you going out and trying to see what there is? Are you self refelecting to understand yourself or what you could do? Or are you just moping and crying I am lonely?

If you dont want to be lonely, you cant wait for a knight in shining armor to save you from your castle that you trapped yourself in.

Here is my advice.


Step 1 - understanding : understand yourself and what you are looking for? Its hard to connect with others if you dont know how or in what ways you will connect with them. Understand what you seek in a partner, friend or otherwise and try to also understand what you could offer them. Friendships and relationships are often based on mutual connections, so find that shared root.

Step 2 - Exposure : now that you understand or have a genral idea of what you might be looking for its time to expose yourself to others who may be what you seek. You can do this in person, online, in groups for an activity, in the line at the store, anywhere. The most important thing in this state is to make your presents known to others and let them know what you seek. Dont be afraid to be turned down, it will happen alot probably, but keep seeking, or if you feel like things arent working out look into a different meathod.

Step 3 - adjust expectations : alot of us may be alone as we seek on perosn who can check all the boxes, but in most cases we will need many people to fill all of our social needs, so learn to make friends for specific purposes and understand that they are your friend for that. If you look for the one size fits all you will probably find nothing, unless you find me of course lol (joke)

Step 4 - perceivere : you may find somone fast or may spend years looking, but regardless you must not give up as giving up only guarantees you will be alone. If you have to broaden your horizons, expand your comfort zone, do things you would never do otherwise. Whatever it takes never give up if it matters, and if it matters to you, you will never stop and never let anything stop you from finding what you seek.

Take it from somone who has learned and done more than most his age, most people get in their own way, dont let yourself be one of the ones who lets themselves down, as you will find others over time. If you would like advice or suggestions DM me and I will see what I can do.",2022-12-10 23:19:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670700548,0,/r/lonely/comments/zi6xer/stop_moping_and_find_a_way_to_push_foward_4_steps/,,0,29,"Stop moping and find a way to push foward, 4 steps to help you stop failing yourself and start fighting for yourself and that connection you want."

2381,zia141,KaleidoscopeSea615,"Ok, so I don’t put myself out there because I know I’m not attractive. I know what I need to do to become attractive (lose weight, contacts instead of glasses, wear makeup that enhances my looks, dress more feminine  etc.) I can change my wardrobe and how I do my makeup, which minimally improves my appearance, btw, immediately. But when it comes to things that will *drastically* improve my appearance, like weight loss &amp; switching to contacts, those things are going to take monthsssss to happen. I have to lose about 60 pounds, but I hope to have impressive face gains by the time I lose 30 pounds, which will hopefully be by this summer. I can’t get contacts right now because I have to use my tax money to pay for the eye appointment since my insurance doesn’t cover contacts. I don’t get my tax money until march or April. Somewhere around there. So yea, it will be months before those things happen.

I’m 21, and I’ve never had my first kiss, held hands, or even talked to the opposite sex other than for school-related purposes. Throughout high school, I didn’t date or anything, but it never really affected me like it does now. I just feel so lonely. I’m in my first year of college - I do online school, so it is isolating. I work on the weekends, and during the weekdays, I spend hours at the gym and then come home and watch shows/TikTok for hours. I had about three close friends in high school. One moved to a different city &amp; has a boyfriend, and the other two went away for college &amp; have boyfriends also, so they don’t care about me/make time for me. &amp; tbh I don’t blame them because when I eventually get a boyfriend, I know I will want to be with him all the time too. I know it’s my fault my life is like this. I could put myself out there now, friendship and relationship-wise, but my self-confidence is so low. I hate the way I look &amp; feel like I don’t deserve friends or a boyfriend bc of the way I look. I am nowhere near the best version of myself, and I realize that. I know what I need to do to change that, and I am in the process of changing. it’s just so fucking lonely in the meantime. 

Does anybody else feel the same way? It would make me feel better if I know I’m not the only one. 😭

2407,zichua,Huikp,"I met a group of old high school friends recently whom I lost contact with a long time ago. We are all currently attending university and they were all describing their experiences of going out to drink, socialising, going to clubs, celebrating birthdays, going overseas with friends and all the activities they did with their friends. And throughout the day, all of them were constantly texting someone every now and then. And there I was sitting down there, remembering how much of my life I've missed out due to my absolute dismal level of isolation. My phone didn't even get a text notification from any friend for the past few months. They most probably got more texts in an hour, than I did for the entire year. I can't remember the last time I didn't eat alone during university, let alone do all these different things... I see my youth being lost right in front of me and I can't do anything about it. I have completely wasted one of the best places to make great memories. My life is like trying to hold on to ice cubes, no matter what I do, no matter how tightly I hold on to it, it slowly disintegrates and slips through the crack of my fingers. All I can do is watch it get destroyed and cry about it. Why can't I just be normal... Why can't I just be like everyone else... Why is it that I'm the one who always loses out... I've just wasted 3 years of my uni life and I'm sure nothing is going to change in the last year. Why was life wasted on me? I just fucking can't make any friends no matter how much I try. Fuck covid and fuck life. I just spent the last 3 years staring at a screen for 13 hours a day, while everyone else went and lived life. I genuinely thought university where I was truly going to enjoy myself. What a fall from grace. Why is it that everyone else gets to experience life more than me, more than I ever will. Man I really do wonder how much better life could've been if only I was more well adjusted, the true happiness that I will never attain. And if your going to ask me to go to a gym and put myself out there more, I personally ask you to fuck right off. Some people just aren't meant to live fulfilling lives, we just survive... Even if I do fix this, I have already lost 3 precious years. And if you think you can simulate such university experiences after graduating and joining the workforce, then I really do think its a coping mechanism... Sure you can be happy after graduating, but can I ever get these experiences back? Never. Never in a million years. And I'm sure my life after graduation will not magically jump out of trend.

The most I have is an axolotl which is just as interactive as a moving wallpaper on your phone. I’ve told myself this many times that “Yeah I would be friends with myself” like yes, I would. But no one else would. I am a people repeller. I can continuously say how sick I am of this loneliness but here I still am in this hole. This will never change either, it’s not like in the movies where the lonely person ends up with someone of their dreams and getting everything they ever wanted, no, it’s going to stay like this. I’m never going to have friends, like ACTUAL friend friends. No relationships, I’m going to be alone forever.

2428,zigai4,[deleted],"I find that the extroverts in my life always have to tell everyone about their awesome experiences and amazing things they got to do and it really gets me down sometimes. Especially because they'd never in a million years include me in any of those things.

My brother is a huge extrovert. For pretty much his entire adult life, he's always gone out and partied on weekends, travelled everywhere, met tons of people, and overall lived a life that I could only dream of. He's 33 and still parties every weekend and stays out all night going to bars and clubs. His instagram is full of amazing parties, cool events, cool concerts, tons of people around him, tons of comments like ""you're awesome!!"" ""you're amazing!!"" ""you both look so cute together!!"" (referencing his wife).

I've tried so hard to bond with him and share interests with him, talk to him and make plans with him...but he always puts me on the back burner. He'll cancel plans last minute and he constantly puts his friends before me. He'll never, ever include me in anything cool that he does, even though I've gone out of my way to do that for him several times. Sometimes I'll simply text him ""hey, what's up?"" and his response will be ""sorry I'm busy all week"". Even if he suspects that I'm going to try and make plans, he has an excuse at the ready. I've tried calling him just to converse, but he routinely cuts me off after 2 minutes of talking, because his wife (who he spends every day with) wants him off the phone. He'll travel far out of state to spend entire weekends with his brother **in-law** (who is the same age as me) but never has a second for me. He'll never in a million years reach out to me first and just doesn't give a shit that I'm rotting in isolation. Yet I have to deal with his vibrant social life being shoved in my face all the time. I wish I didn't have all these direct influences in my life making me feel bad all the time.",2022-12-11 05:20:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/zigai4/does_anyone_else_get_kind_of_annoyed_by_the/,,0,5,Does anyone else get kind of annoyed by the extroverts in their lives?

2432,zih9pp,shepherd_boyz,"My parents had a party tonight and they live two houses down from me. Of course I was invited, but I get depressed thinking about going to a party with people not my age. Its also depressing because I have nothing else to do having no friends. I assume my parents friends at the party will judge me for being there, thinking why isn't he hanging out with people his age. My anxiety and depression started taking it's tole.

As a result, I left the house and drove to the bookstore having plans to program on my laptop. I sat in my car parked in front of the store and meditated for a half hour to try and improve my breathing. My anxiety doesn't get better when I have to be around people in social settings; so part of medicating was to prepare me to going in the store. After getting out of the car, I walked in with worry in my mind as if I'm entering a dangerous establishment. Threatening people judging me for how I look, for how Im carrying myself, I can't stop thinking about what they might be thinking of me. I looked at all the different sections of books and stopped at the self help books. ""How to conquer ur anxiety"" and books about self discipline/improvement, seemed to bring some mental relief. I got extremely uncomfortable every time I  crossed paths with someone or I saw same person more than once. I continued browsing until the store closed. 

My parents party I knew wouldn't end till close to midnight, so I went into another store to get Xmas gifts for my family. Same thing happens, I can't make eye contact with people, I'm extremely uncomfortable. A group of women start walking by me so I turn my back against them. While I'm looking at gift cards, I think I hear them say ""awe man he's not looking this way."" I start overthinking what they might mean by that...... I actual had an ok experience talking with the cashier about the gift cards which rarely happens. 

I drove to a grocery and bought walnuts and lemon balm tea because I read they can increase ur mood/depression. I was uncomfortable and none verbal with the cashier. 

Drove home watched YouTube and now here I am trying to sleep; thinking about repeating the worry some nightmare that my mind puts me through everyday.

as a note: I've been living like this for 10 years and I also have this same experience at work (basically non verbal and don't trust people at work; feels like everyone will turn there back on u the second u give them the chance) 

Just tired and lonely and wish I had friends that liked me for me. People I could hangout with after work.

Before you tell me this will pass I’ve been horribly depressed most of my life and even the good parts don’t make the bad parts worth it. 
All my friends keep hanging out without me, and posting about it, and ignoring my texts when I ask if I wanna hang out. I spend most nights sitting alone in my apartment watching tv shows and wishing I was there instead. 
I will never find a man. I’ve never had a bf, still a virgin and I’m about to graduate college. Every attempt I’ve made at dating has gone miserably. I’ve only been asked out once and it was by a guy I wasn’t even attracted to. I’m more attracted to fictional middle aged men then real men, and the few real men that I do want never want me back or I don’t have the balls to talk to them cause I know I’ll get rejected. Everyone I’ve spoken to about this tells me to “put myself out there” or “it’s not even worth it” and every time I hear shit like that it makes me spiral because NOBODY FUCKING UNDERSTANDS. I am invisible, fat, ugly and lonely. I can’t do this anymore. 

But even if I do miraculously get a bf (or gf), even if I do get my friends back none of it will fix the soul crushing misery and dread I face every single day. Every time something goes wrong I immediately slip back into considering ending things. I have this sinking feeling that life isn’t worth it no matter where I am. 
Maybe if I’m not around, people will actually start caring about me. Maybe my friends will actually feel ashamed about ignoring me instead of fucking posting eachother on Snapchat. 
Or not, at least I won’t have to suffer. 
Sure all my problems are fixable on a surface level, but nothing will fix my deep internal loneliness and self hatred.

2470,zinum7,To-throw-away04,"This will be here for me to rant about a couple of things that have happened in my life that I don't know how to change or fix.

&amp;#x200B;

To my very first relationship, I question why things turn out the way they did I was a person bursting with affection because I didn't know I can care for someone that much and I don't know why you couldn't tell me you never had feelings in the first place. I question if even that is true after all I, was young a lot was swept under the rug. it's not like I can ask you anyway because you have seized from Kik the app from where I met you from a mutual friend and then I don't talk to you either. From what you did start a whole slew of relationships I would forget and just be a part of only to lose sparks swiftly.

To the second most meaningful relationship I ever had, wintertime reminds me of you and the time we had together the conversations and pure love for one another, is something I would do anything to get back. Then came a time when my spark would diminish, I wanted out but I stayed for what purpose I couldn't ask my old self for. That I can't blame you for but the saying I hurt you was something I didn't need when I was already hurting forcing myself into a relationship I didn't want to be a part of. I don't know what I could've done better, but you shouldn't have lied about committing suicide to help me because ""you said I was hurting you."" that makes no sense and just brought confusion and question to my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

To the Relationship that ended in mutual leave, I treasure all of our time together before or after the relationship. we are still friends and chat when we have the time for each other but I have a question. Why did you disappear for such a couple of months and then come back out of nowhere? Why didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend? we stayed up late talking about plans of marrying each other I still have feelings for you and you were up for it but you didn't once mention a boyfriend until the next time we talked and I brought it up. Do you have feelings or do you not? tell me now, please I want to be open for you when the time comes but I can't be doing that forever in my life. I still hold onto these feelings I want to move on I just can't  something holding me still 

&amp;#x200B;

A small letter for the small relationships I had. Why did they fail? friendships or partners. Why were these bridges burned down so fast and after some time being there?

&amp;#x200B;

To my family I understand. I don't know whether to blame you or blame myself my mind is split down to the middle for this. I understand the support that was given to my sister when we lost a family member close to her but I can't decide to be mad at you or myself because I was hurting also. she didn't just visit and love my sister, sure she spent the most time with her but you didn't see or hear what I heard. That little girl wanted to get a console so badly to play with their cousin that didn't like to be with family so that they can bond together she didn't just want to spend time with my sister she also wanted to spend time with me. When she became ill she finally got time to spend time with me I hate myself for not spending more time earlier with her before she was placed on a clock. so. Why wasn't i told upfront of her passing? why was no one there from my family to support me and tell me everything as going to be ok? why did only one fucking person do that, and it was my sister's boyfriend what the fuck. I understand why my sister was the one to get the attention but no one saw me crying and breaking down to myself on new Year. should I blame you guys or should I blame myself for not speaking out?

&amp;#x200B;

To my very own mother. it's not my person to say you should have stayed with dad if you wanted a divorce or whatever. what you shouldn't do is tell your child ""I'm going to return some shoes"" then never fucking return then expect me to accept you again into my life so soon. You coming to my school and asking for forgiveness was never going to happen it only made me brake down at school. I never forgave you and I never would in my life for what happened but I can't be mad and angry forever it's exhausting. While I would never forgive you I can at least accept you back in as my mom but that trust and relationship we had are gone we had to restart. Then I didn't want to be alone with you let alone go anywhere with you and while I'm comfortable now don't take it as I have forgiven you I didn't know how my sister accepted you faster than I did, I might never know. 

&amp;#x200B;

For once I'm going to thank the group of friends I had that had stuck with me through all of what happened above. You guys feel like the family I want. I love you all. sometimes I wonder what would happen in this world if I was gone. would people forget me and will they remember me, what memories will they have of me? I'm afraid of dying but I'm more afraid of being forgotten, secluded, and faded through time. I know at the very least I will be remembered in my friend's hearts and that makes me happy, I am just disappointed it can't be them and my partner, and while I have feelings for a person and they say they will never forget me, I have a feeling they will and I'm afraid ill be alone and make no impact in this world to put value in this existence. thank you my friends and thank you, reader. I will ask for your memory of me to stay but I know it won't stay.

Every single day to not end my own life it's gotten to the point where If I'm not actively trying to not walk into the road I'll subconsciously move towards the middle of busy traffic and it's all down to the fact I'm autistic for one. More on the asberges side but yeah. And I have a mild psychosis both diagnosed, it really.... really doesn't help the fact that I try so hard to make friends and to find love to find a spark of light but my so called friends always leave me out of stuff or avoid me. I'm 20 years old and male so often ill get told to man up or to just deal with it. But I fucking can't!!!! I cried earlier. I sat down. And I cried because I always get pushed to side let down friendzoned because I try so hard to be nice to everyone while still being myself. And it gets me friendzoned. Women don't want a nice guy anymore they want either a wallet or a red flag. Just a figure of speech btw I don't actually mean all women just personally women I've tried to date. All different kinds and just no. Nobody wants someone who's mentally damaged and cries. Isn't super rich and loves science. It's apparently the most unattractive thing ever..people say to me ""the right one will come eventually"" and my response is well...can they fucking hurry up because I'm so alone I'm an introvert as is but this is rediculous, the right one won't come it's made up bullshit propaganda.

2478,zip9td,OffMyChest_94,"Over the last 10 or so years, I've been subjected to abuse of all kinds besides physical. Manipulated sexually, downtrodden, lied to and been an emotional punching bag, for lack of a better term. I want to be a loyal, supportive partner, but it's hard to do so when the bad far outweighs the good.

In the time that I've been dating, I've only had a few lasting relationships, the longest being almost two years. Out of everyone I've dated, there's only 1 single person that stands out amongst the rest. But, due to different work schedules, things wouldn't have worked out and we agreed to stay friends. One good person in 10 years feels like a tiny glimmer of hope... and it's fading out.

But, as I look at my friends and work colleagues - They're all starting families, getting married... and I feel like I'm being left behind. Without fail, colleagues ask on a weekly basis, ""Been on any dates on your days off?"" or ""Got any dates this week?"" And my answer is always the same, ""Nope. Not for a lack of trying though."" It's a constant reminder that I am very much alone.

It's at a point where I've given up. But to say that I am lonely feels like an understatement. I'd give anything to have someone special in my life.

I was thinking about something else but i made fun of his hook up w random chicks. Idk he got or not. Never asked. I knew it's just one time thing bc he is playboy. He told me "" wasn't me ! Haha"" i'm a little feminist, trust issue so didn't believe in him but still i told it to him bc she was talking about it every where and that was so disgusting for me. I told ""so there is no problem, i'm happy that was not you"" later i tried to call him but he ghosted or ignored. So i shared it w others they told me if you feel did sometging wrong just say sorry to him and other told me you are annoying told something that was not your business. So i sent him sorry, just it nothing more. Then i shared my concern and searching why he ghosted me. All told me maybe you are annoyed him, maybe he hates you, he doesn't intrest in you.... also all was talking about how much he is kind, humble... yes he is kind in some situations...  therefore i asked him if i am annoying person for him or something else and i wish never asked. He ghosted again. 

I know these kind of men they are showing how realy they are but know how to play be sweet. The guy just made fun of a no which was not the answer. Idk how i forgot his personality and started blaming muself. I saw his mom text it was exactly like what he sent me and his mom told ""don't be sweet, you did somthing wrong"" Intresting part was i'm always mentioning his money and hooking ups but nobody attentioned to this part.

That's what people believe and then end up alone a virgin and wishing they had worried when they are 35. Girls reject me no matter what I do. I bake them treats, I talk to them and arrange time to hangout which they never do. One of my 2 friends put me onto this girl. She decided after 3 days of knowing me, she doesn't like me and some other guy was better. That's how my life is always gonna be. That's how it always has been. No one wants me. My mom didn't want me and actively chose to spend 10x the time with my brothers than she ever would with me. My dad gives me minimal attention and just gives me money for food during the week and maybe makes dinner.

The fact is someone will always be better than me and chosen over me. Like I said, my parents. My dad always chooses his girlfriend over me. My mom always used to chose her boyfriends and my brothers and sister over me. I'm always last place so that relatively someone else can be first place. If a girl ever does makes the sorry decision of picking me, it'll be because she wants money or a one night stand with the guy she knows no one else is fucking.

Heya, searchin for friendship :)

I'd be thrilled to find some like-minded people here as loneliness seems to be the most consistent/chronic and urgent problem I'm facing, so this is another babystep towards finding a way out.

To give you some clues on whether or not you'd get along with me: I enjoy hiking, forest walks, sauna, swimming, puns/goofiness, thunderstorms, reading fiction novels, self-development, learning about history/linguistics/psychology/astronomy/neurology and learning in general, pancakes, hugs, crocheting, all sorts of ball+net sports, biking, empathy, authenticity, curry, language learning, imagination, exploring new areas, lost places, stargazing, twosomeness, boardgames, tea, active breathing, patience, the scientific method, eye contact, leeway, creative narration, playfulness, sharp minds, perseverance, movement and most importantly strong emotional bonds.

I however don't like: The chinese communist party, wet socks, misandry, censorship and human rights violations in general, excessive alcohol, smoking, gender, depressive spirals, extreme ideologies (both religious and political), manipulation, collectivism, logical fallacies, malevolence, pettiness, radio music, astrology, 30°+, dead animals, mold, superiority complexes, coffee, strict hierarchies, speech that doesn't reflect the intentions, my procrastination, wearing identity labels and mental illnesses like fashion, one-sided relationships, loneliness and alienation, superhero movies, apathy, focusing on differences rather than connections.

Feel free to text me if the above resonates with you ♡",2022-12-11 14:10:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663338338,12,/r/lonely/comments/zitgji/anyone_weirdkind_out_there/,,0,3,Anyone weird+kind out there?

Sooo other lonely people with no social life here so hello...

Just same as you, i used to have friends back in school. Nowadays they just busy with their &amp; have new frined, and here i'am in gap year, unemployeed, no contacts, just drawing &amp; drawing &amp; thinking about my OCs &amp; stuffs. (this is my art acc @/ninesann &amp; OCs acc @/unyxsquad lol )

Imagine being ambitious about your dream, dreaming about being rich famous artist in internet, yet somehow i feel like im too far for it.

=====

I never tell this anyone close to me but i always dreaming myself having my own community, y'know.. Like having my own community who's the same vibe, same wavelenght, same tastes, same struggle, and all that stuff. Imagine being different than most community.

=====

I made this subreddit r/UNIXSQUAD just as starting point lol. Its basically my OC's official community (Discord soon). I haven't made any steps yet lol.

""Like cool kids who's neutral but also sarcastic &amp; like little bit chaos but also good guys &amp; respectful at the same time. Meme-ing, sharing playlist, playing role-playing, theorizing my story, analyzing my characters, ranting &amp; venting w each other. Each OCs have their own club/fandoms so for example:

\- ""Rossa's Club will be full of swaggy chaotic people who's no bs &amp; kill assh0les who mess with the fanclub""- ""Ryeowoon's Club will be full of RELATABLE people who just love discussing a LOT of thing. They hate people who thinks mental illness is a joke""

\- ""Joona's Club is soo comfortable place to be with. Basically sharing photgraphs, writing, poetry, all stuff that just wholesome. Its authentic, they just being REAL with each other""

====

Perhaps im too oversharing lol, but hey, why don't we start to form a community if we DO have the same vibes? ;)",2022-12-11 15:34:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612714216,1,/r/lonely/comments/ziwlkl/i_have_nobody_to_share_my_passions_with/,,0,2,I have nobody to share my passions with :/

I have no car so it’s not like I can see her all the time and I don’t want her spending gas to come see me either all the time. It was so simple when I lived closer to the city where I could 
Take trains and buses and my friends lived in the same neighborhood as me. I stayed in my small college town for work but I’m realizing lots of things about my career and me in general.

I have no boyfriend or anyone that even wants that with me it feels Lund every man just lies so well to either get what he wants or when he doesn’t get what he wants he leaves but either way it goes I’m always left and I can’t help but wonder if I’m just not desirable or lovable

On top of having no connections here I feel like I would at least have the comfort of knowing my family loves me. And they tell me that they do but I don’t feel it. They are not there for me emotionally. I know I’m loved by them but I don’t feel it. 

So now not only am I alone platonically and romantically I even feel alone when it comes to my family and thats such a hard feeling to have. At the end of the day I can’t even say I have family. Do you know how depressing that is?

I’m always welcomed back home whenever I choose to be but not being emotionally connected to them and feeling like I’m regressing each time I’m around too long is so hard to deal with. I’m lucky to at least have the option of being home because I know some peoples family disowned them.

I had one thing in my life that at the time felt consistent… but ever since, that was also taken away from me and nothing has been making me feel that happiness ever since. Because it was someone who made me feel happy, loved and gave me the company I so badly wanted and with her I no longer felt lonely for a brief time… now I can’t help but miss her and think about her all the time because ever since she was not here anymore, it hasn’t been going well.

I’m a 24 year old guy on the spectrum who deals with depression, anxiety, and probably ADHD and bipolar too. Not being able to drive really bothers me a lot. I feel like I can’t truly call myself an adult because I can’t drive. My dad said no woman will take me seriously because I can’t drive or provide a woman with financial security. Maybe he is right. They shouldn’t take me seriously. I can’t function like an actual adult so of course they shouldn’t. I’m just frustrated and feel so powerless. I try and I try and I still can’t have what I want. For whatever reason, I just can’t shake my fear of driving and it really pisses me off. 

There is no use trying to explain my situation to my parents because I can’t get them to understand certain things. I don’t ask them to take me anywhere because I feel so bad about having to depend on them to take me places. Those feelings of embarrassment, shame, and guilt will never go away. All the stuff I actually want to do and see is far away anyway. Frankly, there isn’t much around here that really interests me. I don’t know why my parents can’t seem to understand that my location is really making it hard for me to make friends my age or find a partner. I would have a much easier time finding someone if I lived in a large city. It just pisses me off that I can’t stay with my mom because she is so hard to get along with. I actually would be able to live the lifestyle I want to live. I just want to have an actual social life and have friends my age. The fact that my family can’t get that through their heads makes me so angry. I will never be okay with being the youngest person at the shitty Meetup groups I tried. I’m fucking tired of being surrounded by people 2-3 times my age. 

It feels like I have to earn/buy a woman’s love because of how many times I’ve been burned. I feel like I’m just a fuck up away from being ghosted and replaced by another better-looking, wealthier, more charismatic guy. Nothing I do is ever enough. Of course, whenever I meet someone, I’m the one who ends up getting hurt. I’m a prisoner in my fucking house and I’m treated like an undesirable. Sometimes I wish I had died when I wandered into that forest. I want to believe that things will get better, but I don’t want to be filled with false hope. I wish I could be “traditionally masculine.” Maybe women would like me a lot more. I just exude effeminate energy. I’ve had “friends” use that against me too. 

Lately, I’ve been trying to be kinder toward myself and view my situation more positively (which actually did help), but there are days (like today) when it’s just too much.

I can’t do anything but listen to myself take note of everything she says, every thought and feeling she has about whoever she’s talking about, and know that nobody has or ever will think anything close to that about me.

Nobody thinks I’m anything other than strange looking, nobody cares about my attention, nobody thinks about me when I’m not right in front of them, they don’t miss me, nobody is scared of losing me, nobody regrets letting me go. All of it makes no sense when I listen to it. I try to imagine who they’re talking about.

Sure, it might not be capable of remembering personal things about you for now, but how long will it be until this technology, or a specialised version of it, gets there. This, combined with the fact that text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion can now generate pretty much photorealistic faces, suggests that soon enough someone (or something) will be able to trick you, if they wanted to and with not a lot of effort, into thinking that you connected with another person when in reality you were talking to a bot.

Considering I don't usually talk to people irl and even online I don't really have friends I talk regularly to, online interactions probably mean more to me than to an average person.

2612,zjghak,Yeah_uhyeah,"4 years ago I was a freshman in high-school my girlfriend broke up with me and started dating a different guy. This killed me inside and I genuinely thought there was nothing left for me. I became antisocial, depressed, suicidal. I was failing all my classes and then I got kicked out of my house. At this point I was at rock bottom almost insane. After I got kicked out I moved to a different town with a different parent. At this school I was very shy and quiet and in my own words I would call myself a “school shooter” because of how I was and looked. I got to the high school when I was a sophomore. And the whole year almost no-one talked to me my only friends were in a whole different school. So when I was a junior I started to adapt to my situation and realized no-one was there to help me. So I start to teach myself how to be social and likable. Over that 1 year of me adapting I had friends I was doing things ect. Now its my last year of school and I realized that I have come a long way from what I once was.

2620,zjic7z,SukiDeva,"Been lurking, I guess it's time to vent aswell.
My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago after 2,5y of being together. I always thought communication was the key so l always shares my feelings, concerns, etc, but he barely did that himself, to the point where he slowly started to feel grudge towards me because of the things we argued about. I was trying really hard to make him happy, do things together etc, but l knew l wasn't at the top of his ladder lately, and after he got mad one day over some silly thing l don't even remember, he broke up with me. Honestly l was completely destroyed. I was thinking of killing myself and l still do to this day sometimes.  But what's worse than the breakup is how he acts towards me now. He turned from cute, loving and caring person into cold, distant and emotionless one. It hurts so much. He said l did nothing wrong and did not hurt him, yet the way he acts towards me makes me feel like as if l was the worst person ever. As if he didn't remember a single nice thing l did for him, and trust me there were plenty of them because l wanted him to feel loved and cared about. He left because I acted ""horrible"" sometimes. I feel anxious around people l don't know, so when l was about to meet his friends back then, l barely spoke all night, and when someone actually talked to me l replied with some bullshit because it caught me off guard and I ended up being rude to them by accident. I cried a lot after that night because l knew l fucked up and he knew I'm regretting it a lot. I also apologized to that person l was  accidentally rude to and invited them out a couple more times. So yes, l had issues like this, l got upset easily when something went wrong, I have low self esteem so l was often ""depressing and negative""about things like school etc, and so he stopped enjoying my company, basically said l wasn't cool/chill enough to hang with. So yes, things like this were enough to get marked as horrible, just because l sucked at first while doing social interactions with new people, and because l was often negative and depressing. I'm working on myself now because l wanna be more stable and chill, but it still hurts. I want that loving and caring person back. I wish he shared more of his feelings and concerns with me before so we could work on them together. I wanted to spend my life with him, and have family. We were even looking at flats at one point. I don't know how could l fuck it up so much to lose him. It's our anniversary soon and l don't know how am l going to survive it. I miss him so much and l wish he could give me another chance. I would be the happiest person in the world.

Thank you so much for reading my post. Also sorry for any weird grammar, I'm not a native speaker and l don't have the strength to read it once again. 
Sending love to all of you out there ❤️ take care and goodnight.

When you say it, it’s cool
When I say it, it’s dumb

You do it, you get a loaf of attention
I don’t even get a crumb 
What is there in me, that makes them ignore
Am I too annoying, or am I a bore?

I don’t get the things you talk about 
Things you can’t seem to live without 

Oh, where do I fit in this jigsaw
That makes me rewrite every law

That I’ve ever conceived, for how we interact
I can’t look at what I possess, too focused 
On what I lack.

Is it empathy, tact, or the fact that I’m not corrupt?
Either way, I know one thing. I can’t seem to ever shut up.

Saying things I shouldn’t have, since day one
I thought we were just having fun 

Is it my fault, or my environment? I may never know.

Maybe one day I will learn to avoid altercation.
Now how the hell do I deal with this frustration?

When will we ever understand 
The social animal that is man

Simple good folks can hardly catch a breath 
In a world where nonsense dictates life and death 

I know not where the path ahead leads
Hopefully the place that I really need 

One with true kindness, understanding, free of walls
One where my image is within my thrall

But let me backup, I started college at nc state in the fall of 2021 and had a gf at the time that I got right before the pandemic started(fall 2019). Her and I were good at the beginning but I was definitely struggling because  family oriented and all my family was gone so she was kinda my only support figure at all. But as we keep going she started distancing herself and hiding things and eventually she broke up with me, after I begged her to stay. After this, is what I describe as the worst year of my life, after we broke up I was really completely alone, and without the girl I fell so deeply in love with for the past two years. This caused me to become so depressed and distance myself from the world, where I would go to class and come home and lie in bed for hours without doing anything, just crying and thinking of what i did wrong. After doing this and feeling this way for around 6-7 month I could finally feel decent again but still not the same. So after coming home for the summer and still not feeling any better I decided to stay home because if I went back there I wasn’t sure I would live to see next summer. But after the semester nearly being over and over a year of us being broken up I still haven’t found anyone, and being at home means I’m not really meeting any new people either. So now I’m in a limbo where idk what to do with my life. I would love to find someone to be with again but life has just given me no options and so it really just makes me feel so alone.

2634,zjl8ie,Loving_pains,"I (20F) fell in love with my friend (19M) and I am so tired. I wrote this letter to him, that I will never send, but I am just so exhausted and I have nobody to talk to about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is the last letter I write to you. 

You stayed the night at my place for the second and last time. 

We talked about how our interactions don’t feel platonic. And we set boundaries but you broke them almost immediately. I told you that I felt confused on how to feel about you, and you didn’t tell me how you felt. You just pushed me away and told me you were thinking about withdrawing from me. You told me that even though you want to be there for me it’s hard for you to be here with me, that you just can’t do it. I think it’s time to let you go. I think it hurts us both more if I keep holding on. 

I guess this all stems back to my savior complex. I want… wanted to be the person who will always be there for you, through thick and thin, to celebrate the highs and encourage you through the lows. I wanted to be the person you could lean on in times of need and the person who you thought of first when you finally felt happy and good. I need to accept that I just inserted myself into your life and I will never be that person. 

But you’ve never once treated me right. I don’t ask for much in return; just communication and some sort of fucking effort to maintain our so-called friendship. But I’m always the one reaching out to you and asking you how you’re doing. Have you ever, once, called me first? Have you ever texted me first about things not related to your mental health? The only time, as far as I remember, is when you heard that I was sick. Why does it take extreme measures to get through to you? Why am I the only one that cares this fucking much about our friendship, about making sure you’re okay? 

I’m so tired. I can’t do this anymore, and I know I told you I’ll always be there for you, but it’s so hard to be there when all you do is push me away. 

Did I get too close, too fast? Did I break down your walls faster than you were comfortable with? Why, why do you keep pushing me away when all I do is accept you for who you are? When all I’ve ever wanted was for you to be happy?

What even was I to you? Was I just a friend that was there for you, was I just someone who was there conveniently when everything was breaking down and you needed to hold onto someone, something? Was I someone who forced themselves into your life? What was I? Did I ever matter to you, even as a friend?

Because you were willing to throw away what we had like I was a used paper towel. Like our friendship, like our time together meant nothing to you. When you told me that you were thinking about withdrawing from me, because you didn’t know how to vocalize it, it broke my heart because it just means my time and effort meant nothing to you. How could you be so cruel, so heartless, when all I ever wanted was for you to feel safe and comfortable around me? When I tried so hard to be the person that you could feel safe enough to talk to about anything? 

I’m washing everything that reminds me of you. Because I keep catching a whiff of your scent and it drives me fucking insane. I can’t sleep in my own bed because of you. I can’t go anywhere without being reminded of you. 

My favorite color was always blue. Because it’s the color of the sky on a warm hazy summer day, because it’s the color of the ocean when the waves sparkle and the sea breeze hits just right. But ever since I met you, your eyes became my favorite shade of blue and now I can’t stop seeing you everywhere. I hate it. 

I’m tired of being your shore, just waiting for you to pull close just long enough to feel what it could be like before you pull back immediately, back into the waves. You’re unpredictable to the point where it’s predictable, like the ocean that you love so fucking much. I can’t just waste my life waiting for you to come back and drench me all over again. You erase any and all progress that we make, like the waves consume the footprints of those that came before. I hate that I keep waiting for someone who won’t arrive. I hate that you make me feel like this. 

I’ve been so numb for the past few years. I haven’t felt true joy or happiness or even anger or sadness until I met you, and I was just beginning to start feeling things again before you fucked it up. 

And I just learned that you’ve had relationships before. So you knew full well that what you were doing wasn’t okay, that it’s not something you do to friends. I always gave you the benefit of the doubt but seriously–what the fuck. How could you say that you felt like I was taking advantage of you when you did the same thing to me? How could you do that to me?

How could you do what you did to me and still say that I was the only one crossing boundaries? I’m not saying I’m blameless, but you aren’t either. You were the one that slipped your hand under my sleeve to stroke my arm. You were the one that pushed my hair out of my face, caressing my cheek and ear as you did it. Your hand was the one that lingered on my jawline as you traced it, looking into my eyes like you were trying to memorize what I looked like asleep. You were the one that started reciprocating, spooning me and holding me closer and closer until there wasn’t any space left between us. You were the one who guided my hand to your chest every time you held it. You were the one who lied on my chest, the one who breathed into my neck, the one who could have kept your boundaries. 

I feel so used. And I know that’s unfair because you never asked for this, you never asked me to be in your life. And I offered myself to you, so I put myself in this position. But then why does it still feel like I’m just a convenience to you, and not a choice? You only call me when you’re not feeling good. You only call me when you don’t want to be alone. And each time, I get worried sick, so I just fall for it. I’m just an emotional bootycall to you, huh? Just someone you call in the middle of the night, just someone who’ll drop everything to make sure you’re okay? And then the one time I needed you, you couldn’t do it. I know you tried. I know you really really did. But the truth is, if you wanted to, you would have. If you cared, you would. 

You know what the worst part is? I still can’t bring myself to hate you. It would be so much easier if I could, just to get this chapter of my life over with, but I still care about you. I still want to text you and see if you ate today, if you’ve had at least one fucking good moment in your day, if you’re just going to be okay. I still want to fall asleep in your arms. I still want to smell that faint, lingering scent of coconuts in your unwashed hair. I just can’t fucking hate you and it’s breaking me. I want to hate you. God, it would be so much easier if I could just fucking hate you. But I can’t. I fucking can’t. 

I can’t help you love yourself. God knows I can’t, I still can’t love myself. But I guess a part of me hoped that maybe, just maybe, I could love you enough for both of us and it would be okay until you learned how to live with yourself. 

Don’t you ever fucking dare tell me that I walked away from you. You pushed me away. Even if years down the line, we reconnect and you finally have it within yourself to tell me how you really felt, don’t you dare tell me I walked away when you were the one that didn’t let me in. I tried my best to fish you out of that dark dark rabbit hole so many times, but you were the one that cut me loose. 

We both had parts to play in this dysfunction, but at least I fucking tried. I tried so hard to communicate with you, and your default response was to avoid me. And every time I tried to patch up the holes that you left behind, you just cut up the thread I was using to mend it. You’re such a fucking hypocrite, and I hate that I still try to justify your behavior and defend you to my friends.

I hope one day, you truly find happiness and learn how to live with yourself. All I’ve ever wanted was for you to be happy, and I hope to God that when you are, you think of me and how you fucked up the one real thing you ever had. I hope that I haunt you the way you haunt me, and I hope that you know that if you’d just held on a little longer, if you’d just talked to me, I would have stayed. I hope that the next time you look into someone’s eyes the way you used to look into mine, all you can see is me, exhausted but still trying to comfort you and calm you down. I hope that the next time you see a picture of me, all you can feel is regret and guilt and that it takes everything in your power to not call me. 

I loved you at your worst, and it was foolish of me to want to love you at your best. 

Goodbye. I hope you find happiness. ",2022-12-12 03:20:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668346054,2,/r/lonely/comments/zjl8ie/i_was_just_a_convenience_to_him_not_a_choice/,,0,1,"I was just a convenience to him, not a choice"

I’m jealous of the fact that even if she doesn’t put any effort in her relationship. She still gets love and respect. 

My experience in dating has been horrible because even though my only standard would be for me to have deep conversations with someone. But the guys I’ve dated always say that they can’t keep up with that and often tell me I watch too many Rom coms and it’s impossible to be that interesting all the time.

I do have people I consider friends but it's like, none of them really talk to me much at all and when they do it's either only because we're at school together or it's a short online chat that lasts literally minutes at most. 

I'm not sure if it's because i can come across as annoying or clingy or I'm just not a likeable person. I guess i could come across as distant to some, I don't open up much unless I really get to know people, so maybe that's it?

I've had to substitute the warmth from others with stuffed animals, blankets, heck even the bathtub, so maybe it's that i come across as too childish and not worth having a serious chat with?

Really just wanting a real bond with someone I can trust and who'll be there for me when I need them and I'll be there when they need me, I've really been missing that.

2726,zk4vu8,gibwater,"I've been lonely most of my life, and I kinda just figured out why. I can't understand anyone.

It's very hard for me to initiate conversations. Every time I try to talk to people, they either can't hear me, or pretend to not hear me. It's been really frustrating because I can be yelling and yet people will magically not be able to hear me.

I can't join conversations either. It's painful for me to do that when everyone's already in a group and I'm left out as the newcomer. People talk about stuff that I can't understand like finance and gossip, so I can't enter conversations easily. Even if I do, it quickly burns out as everyone goes back to talking to each other.

And if I do get to have a conversation, I can't understand them. It's like talking to aliens. Even though they're speaking the same language, it's as if every word doesn't mean what I thought it meant, and I have to slowly translate what they are saying. Their ideas don't connect together, their sentences have no context at all and are usually unfinished so even if I understand what their words mean I don't have the context to decipher what they exactly mean.

And they refuse to understand me. I could be saying the simplest sentence in the world, like ""What do you want for lunch?"", and they will still find ways to pretend to not understand what I'm saying. They will question why I want to have lunch, whether it is wrong to have lunch, and do everything to scrutinise my words and question every idea that I put forward, even if it's the most innocent of ideas. Everyone just wants to be a contrarian when I talk to them.

It's painful to talk to people. I don't have any interests in common with anyone. It's not intentional, I just have interests that happen to be niche. I wish I didn't like niche things, I wish I could like popular things just like everyone else.

I know I'm stupid and ugly and unsuccessful and always the clown and punching bag of any group I'm in, but it still hurts when people refuse to have a halfway decent conversation with me when I'm putting in my best effort to talk. People sometimes do small talk, but they use it to put me down and tell me that I'm worse than them rather than start a relationship.

I just wish people weren't hard to understand.",2022-12-12 17:10:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1470226914,1,/r/lonely/comments/zk4vu8/people_are_hard_to_understand/,,0,1,People are hard to understand.

Usually, I come here reading a few posts and respectfully comment on the senario that is mentioned but I guess this time I ll do the main post, take it as a vent or what ever but feel free to share your experience since I ll take my time with this one. 

So am currently 24yo and so far for some reason I had the chance to be in only one relationship! In general am sort of a shy person kind of going about my business but am very respectful when it comes to talking to a women. However, most of the times I receive the energy that I am being weird. Throughout my 20-24s after I broke up with my ex I tried to go out even with friends clubing or what ever since they all wanted to find a nice girl or to go out with but I never felt that I was doing the right thing. So after sometime, whenever they where going out I was working or exercising or doing things that make me feel good and proactive!  Lot of times when we were going out even with the girls of the group I felt that I was there but even if I tried to open up a conversation noone would pay attention so mentaly I was gone!  Few years gone by now and eveyrone is kind of living the life I was living back then so we cut of almost completely. It feels kinda of sad but sometimes you gotta fight through. 

Anyway, most of the boys of the group are still single including my self and not surprisingly the girls are currently all of them in a relationship! I personally tried many times to go out on dates but most of women now cut me off even on texting, at somepoint I felt that a lot of them are rude against me so I turned on to the idea of ""whatever likes you will eventually find you"" to calm me down but nothing really showed up ! I tried the online bs as well but I got so fed up and tired since most of the online apps want you to keep paying for it and most of the times u end up on just a like at least 1 per 2 months or something! 

I really dont know whats going on, even my own familly started to worry that I ll be alone my whole life since I don't go out or not meeting any girls but truth is I got noone to meet at the moment. I even started going out by my self, nothings wrong with that but kind of helps for the people around me to not think that am completely alone ! I really choose to do things that make me happy and am happy doing most of such things but slowly started loosing a lot of hope on finding someone, Been a long time since I felt loved eventhough I do things out of love and not for it ! I trully believe in what energy you give to the world you shall receive and I dont expect anyone to love me back eventhough I showed my best and most kindest act to them but the more i do it the more I loose hope on receiving it !

2734,zk60ma,Cr1ymson,"Hey! I just wanted to shared my (15M) experiences with loneliness in the past couple of months. 

Last year, during freshman year of high school, all was well- at least for the first half of it. I had friends, I felt like I was cared about; like I was enough, you know? A lot of people messaged me on social media, and apparently I was considered popular- due to my large following and dare I say ‘interesting’ stories. This all took a turn, however, when depression struck me in the latter half of the school year. Due to stress from school and parental abuse, I stopped trying. I gave up on everything, lost all motivation for everything, and missed most days of school. I cut off all ties and stopped doing what I used to love; my hobbies and dreams. Everything just felt so numb. I was extremely suicidal at that point, and was eventually forced into therapy by my school, which I really resented. My parents were threatened with losing custody and being put on trial if I didn’t comply, and because I didn’t want that to happen, I went reluctantly. In short, that whole ordeal worsened my mental health drastically. 

During the summer, things got worse. My body was imprisoning my mind, and I imprisoned myself in my room, never stepping out of the house once, not being invited to step outside once. I rotted away in my terrible mental and physical state, I stopped eating, stopped sleeping and slept too much, and gave up on hygiene. I stopped going on social media, and essentially isolated myself from the outside world. I had no identity, no purpose, no goals, and no connections. 

I’m currently a sophomore, and I believe that at my own fault, I completely obliterated my social life. I feel like people just simply forgot me. People who used to greet me in the hallway didn’t anymore. People I used to sit with, study with, and laugh with, suddenly didn’t anymore. Everyday I think about these things; I notice them, and I can’t help but to sulk about it in silence. They didn’t know me anymore; or at least not anything besides superficially. I feel so isolated and unliked at school, like I’m sort of an invisible entity floating by, class to class, with no destination. I feel as if it’s a burden for people to talk to me; to even say hi, and so I save them the trouble by not initiating the conversation first. Is it because I don’t look good enough, or is my music taste unpopular? Am I annoying? These are some of the endless pile of questions I ask whenever I get ignored and pushed away. I feel irrelevant. Sometimes when I see a friend in the hallway, talking to someone, I initially get the urge to greet them and say hello. I then remember that they’d much rather talk to them than me, and that they’re probably indifferent to my existence. And then I walk away. I hate myself for this, for my irrational, self-deprecating mindset, as my own loneliness is caused by me and me only. I have no one else to blame but myself. It’s a vicious cycle of sorts. People who used to hang out with me and wait for me after the bell rings suddenly didn’t anymore, as I was replaced by cooler people, I suppose. I feel excluded, and seeing people hang out with everyone except me, just makes it a whole lot painful- so I stopped going on social media. Man. I wish for nothing more than to feel loved again. I find no love or guidance in this world, not from my parents, or anyone else. When I’m gone from school, no one messages me. If I die tommorow, will anyone notice my absence? The only thing that really stops me from ending it all is my 4 yo sister. I love her so much, and every time I think about suicide, I cry, knowing that she’ll be growing up without a brother. If you can strongly relate to this post, please keep your head up high. I’m always available for a chat, even though I’m not certified in any way to help. 

Have a nice day &lt;3

I feel that my lack of experience has made me permanently undesirable to women, I'm going to try CrossFit and get into better shape and hope I meet friends and girls through that but....I'm not optimistic.

we flirt a lot. there is a tension between us. maybe i just feel it and there’s nothing there. idk. but enough lingering pauses and looks and sexual jokes you assume there’s at least a passing attraction. 

i’d never touch her or grab her. i’m not a fucking creep. but holy shit the urge was so strong. not even an urge, but a yearning. no action. no intention. just a strong, powerful need for a closeness to another person that i haven’t felt in years.

2744,zk6yla,StatisticianCheap685,"I am into video games and my friend group shames me.

So I have this group of friends, we used to get along very well but they've started getting very annoyed whenever I speak about something, to the point where the only jokes going around in the group is about me and making fun of me constantly, saying it's all a ""joke"".

A few days ago, The Game Awards were held, and since I live far from America, the event was held from midnight to 4am on a Friday, school day. Considering I absolutely can't miss such a big event for video games because I absolutely love them and want to work on them in the future, I thought it was best to skip a school day (on Fridays we have the least important subjects and it's a half day, so my parents let me stay home because I wouldn't miss out on much and they understand my love for the hobby.)
I came in today, feeling very sick and tired in general barely making it past the first few classes, at lunch I went to their table to hang out with them, the first thing they all started to speak about was how I decided to skip a day of school to watch game awards, calling me stupid, weird, and making fun of my decision while I was sitting there trying not to vomit on the spot, then proceeded to make fun of my mood by saying ""Guys I think he's a little mad.""
I got up and called home immediately.

There are too many moments where this happened, throughout the summer I worked my ass off so I can buy myself a gaming PC capable of running modern games, after 3 months of absolute sweat and hard work, I got one.
I wasn't able to speak about it ONCE without my friends telling me I was showing off and to stop bragging about it, even though all I have ever done is mentioned how I was busy over the summer.
The other moments are quotes that go ""If you want him to go to school, it's easy, just turn his computer off."" Where they all proceeded to laugh their ass off harder than I've ever seen.
""Oh hey, I played this game you like-""
""Blah blah blah.""
While having a normal conversation about a single video game with somebody near them, they would immediately go.
""Oh my god guys! Video games!""
""That's all he can ever talk about!""
""Do you speak about anything else""

I don't know what to do, I have no other friends to hang out with at lunch, and even when I do, my current friend group will try to keep speaking to me causing even more issues than if I was to stay with them. I feel shitty.",2022-12-12 18:25:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636806673,9,/r/lonely/comments/zk6yla/i_am_into_video_games_and_my_friends_shame_me/,,0,11,I am into video games and my friends shame me.

Two years ago i was in so bad mental situation, wanted to commite suicide... i was not good, there was nobody to listen me and lately i was folowing a celebrity w less followers, i realy wanted someone that doesn't know me, so i started sending DM. Idk realy what he thought what happened i suddenly noticed he accepted my msgs, it was shocking and i sterted deleting all, he restricted me. It was hard to understand why he did it but now i think, if i was in his place would do it too. And i'm not good in english couldn't write well maybe he wanted to help so tried to ask something but i deleted he couldn't. Or felt i afraid... many reasons. 

It doesn't end and i told him about deleting my account and use blogger account, idk he recieved it or not. Then somthing i saw and asked him about it, surprisingly he replyed. I know he is playful person and his answer was that way. Idk realy he didn't got i'm talking about what or things i told unclear. Any way, i was not into his stories, mentioning him or other things, it made me to be enthusiastic about them, couple times mentioned him, replyed but noticed he didn't check. I stoped. But later accidently when i sent something he checked. Never answer but check. What ppl say, ghosting.

My point is this: I think he is showing intrest but it's not love or any, just keeping eyes on my DMs, something like little caring about someone you don't know. I know he is playboy. I was afraid to accept this bc in all of my life nobody showed me faver. For some ppl his actions are unrespectful but for me they are weird kindness. Idk he is playing his game or realy cared. Just once restoried a fan story but never talked w her. But talked w me. Maybe he regreted of what he did. That's not the point. Then i thought maybe he saw my sisters photos and videos and he liked her bc she's pretty n attractive for men.

2753,zk8los,RadicalAnglican,"Basically the title... I (21F) have a flatmate (20NB) who keeps inviting their friends over, especially one friend in particular (20F). And sometimes they'll have a group of friends over.

Which doesn't bother me in itself, I'm glad that my flatmate has friends, but it does make me feel upset. And I think acknowledging this to myself is okay.

I think it's worse because they're super close friends, so I definitely don't feel comfortable joining them, even though I can almost always hear them from my bedroom unless I have headphones in.

It doesn't help that I've known my flatmate longer than they've been friends. I know that being friends with someone for longer doesn't mean being closer. But seeing that kind of connection, and not having it with anyone, makes me feel worse.

Having groups over is tough as well. Hearing all the laughter and happiness going on in that room and feeling unable to walk in makes me feel sad and so left out.

I do have friends, just not really close ones, because people are definitely closer with other people than with me, judging by the amount of time they spend with me vs with other individuals.

2815,zkivv7,suyasuya_,"I really dislike them, so I stay on my own, even if they enjoy my company

I'm not good enough for the rare few I do like, so I also stay away from them

I'm a 19 years old neet and only ever leave room to get food anyway. It's not like I even see anyone at this point

For the past few years, I have tried talking to people online instead. People I like are slightly more common and I also get to pretend to be good enough to befriend them

As a result, a lot of them take an interest in me, or even get attached. However, I am so scared of deceiving their expectations that I always end up ghosting them. The fact that I am as depressed as one can possibly be and therefore have 0 energy to reply probably doesn't help either

Ghosting strangers on the spot already feels awful (only for those whom I like though)

Thinking about the ones I got somehwat close to before ghosting them keeps me up at night

But the worst of the worst is when I actually end up disappointing them and they become the ones ghosting me. Thinking about them never fails to paralyze me and tears may even ensue. And god knows it takes something to make my apathetic ass cry or feel emotional

I'll admit it may sounds stupid, but I was and still am terribly attached to some of them. Definitely to an unhealthy amount. Though, it'd be surprising if was left unscathed by these years of complete isolation, and I never claimed to be mentally stable either

I really just can't let go of these regrets. If I could make one change to the past, I would probably choose to have actually become friend with these internet people. Even if I am well aware that my monkey brain is actually just tricking me into thinkin it would change anything

After all, whether I would like someone or not, I truly can't imagine myself finding actual contentment in any friendship. I'm just too mentally ill at this point. And even then, I would still be myself, so it's not like it could ever work out in the long run

Of course, there are many more things going wrong in my life, to the point where others would find me crazy for even caring about such frivolities (if ""others"" there were, lol). But it's probably what I think the most about

Still, it's a shame. I seem to be naturally likeable, people find me funny, I'm not shy either. I would have nothing to worry about in that regard if I was a bit more normal

I know its wayyy easier said than done, but try to gain confidence. I mean really try. Dont let your walls just block you off from trying. I used to care so much about getting a girlfriend, but I realized its just pointless. Being thirsty and desperate just makes it harder. 


 I'm not very good looking either, and I've never had a girlfriend either, but you need to seriously work on yourself and do things for yourself. Live your life for yourself for a while. Im not saying you haven't tried to change or put in work, but it seems as if you are changing to look better to other people. Change for your own values and who you want to be.

I’m 27 years old. From Adelaide South Australia. The weather is reminding me of my ex. I decided to walk away from the relationship for several reasons. But all in all, it can be summed up as “a feeling of inadequacy”. My ex was wonderful. She had a sense of warmth that I never got from anyone. Her voice was deep and caring. She’s 2 years younger than me but far more mature in just about every aspect of life. She loved dogs. That might be an understatement. She’s a wonderful dog owner. I walked away because things were not going well for us and I knew the reason was me. It got to a point where I didn’t know who I was as a person or as a partner and I was afraid that I would hurt her more. I never physically attacked her and would never do it to anyone.
I’m going through a learning process right now. I recently learned that I can have a bad temper. That I would say things I don’t mean when I’m angry. Regardless of whether or not I meant it, I still hurt her and that’s a fact.
Grief comes in many forms. A sense of loss, regret, lonesomeness. This is the first breakup where I felt grief. Sure, I’ve been sad before. The relationship before this was pretty depressing too but this is something else. I’m seeing a therapist right now and I hope to make some changes and improvements in the coming months.",2022-12-13 07:56:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668248892,4,/r/lonely/comments/zkq64l/walking_away/,,0,3,Walking away.

2875,zks4re,[deleted],"since my current semester is ending in two months, i have decided to spend most of my time at the library especially on the weekdays. i noticed that in these few weeks the feeling of loneliness feels more apparent when i am in my room, sitting by myself.

even trying to be productive becomes tough because my mind wanders lot, especially to the not very good realm. a place where i lament of loneliness. 

however there are other souls at the library, and being around other people like this also reminds me of working towards achieving my dream goals. one thing i have been trying to practice is to tell myself that i am in control of my own emotions. to learn to soothe myself so that these negative thoughts wont overwhelm me too much at times, when my emotions are a little fragile.

i like me now. when i was in my early 20s, i tried to fill up the void of loneliness - with all wrong people, with all wrong reasons, doing all the wrong things. but im able to think and act on my feelings now a little more clearly. 

""words do have weight, and i want to make sure our interactions go right and comfortable for both of us""

that's why i think even if i am by myself, i am going to be alright somehow, because all the 'been there, done that' definitely had taught me of what i want to be better for me going forward. and to try to be more present for me, doing things that will make me feel fulfilled.

though, a wonderful [company](https://imgur.com/a/cSjl0SR) at the library wouldn't be so bad. it could have been you, but where you at? 👀",2022-12-13 10:04:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,,7,/r/lonely/comments/zks4re/do_you_like_going_to_the_library/,,0,12,do you like going to the library?

2908,zl0s77,emeraldkoala3," Yep. You read that right. Starting at the age of fourteen, I would write out fictionalized versions of events that had occurred in my life. And added in a girlfriend.
 The thing is, for context, I had been out of school for about a year and a half at that time due to circumstances out of my control, and had barely spoken to anyone my own age since.
 Even before that, I didn't talk much to other kids. And even the few ""friends"" I did have, I never got to know that well. In hindsight I don't think I've ever really had proper friends, just other kids I'd hang out with at lunch.

 So back to that title. I used to spend hours typing away on my laptop, writing these little stories involving me and my friends from school, after a while I started adding in new ""characters,"" the most prominent of which being my imaginary girlfriend. She wasn't consciously based on anybody from the real world, just my literal dream girl.
 Like I said, I was fourteen, so you can probably imagine the sort of cringy stuff I'd write about her, although in hindsight most of it was rather tame. If you'd believe it, almost a full month passed by before I even wrote our ""first kiss.""

 A lot of it was still just the fantasies of a lonely teen who'd barely had a conversation with a girl his own age. But I didn't have anyone else, and after a while it almost felt real. I'm sad to admit that I felt happier daydreaming about spending time with her than I had in years.

 I kept writing those little stories for another three years, but eventually they lost their spark. They just didn't provide the escape they once did.
 I'm now twenty years old. Still haven't been in a real relationship, romantic or otherwise, and despite having stopped writing the stories, I still think about that time. A period of my life that was never real, but felt as if it was, just for a while.

 In a way she saved my life, I had been considering taking my own life around that time, and I used those stories to distract myself from those thoughts.
 I still dream about her. I hug my pillow at night, pretending that it's her. She was more to me than just some fantasy, she was the best friend I ever had.

2927,zl3tk8,Curious-Leg2486,"Idk start of where. I always told this story and then was talking about how kind was the person, i'm owe him a life. Two years ago comite to suicide, I didn't have anybody to share what's going on, felt burden, stucked... just found myself in his DM, talking about my shits, problems, complaining aboit my situation, ex, dreams... and found he was reading, accepted my DM. But i regreted and deleted all, he restricted me mins later. I was so sad about restriction. Realy idk how much he has been read and why he restricted. Then I told about how much i get sad and gonna continue working on my blog. After two or three mounths, I saw something and get concerned about his career, shared it and he calmed me down but always I felt rigret about what i told and thought he is sad also there was a question in my head ""why he showed attention?"" Nobody care about me. I decided ask him but didn't answer, so i deleted what i asked. Mounths later i sent sorry and he read it immediately. I thought maybe he was busy and we never told we are friends so i'm not priority for him but again he didn't read. Again i sent and delete a lot of mesaages. Realy sad bc of this. I thought someone showed me faver and I can be friend w him. Then someone asked me for help I though he know so i asked him, he ghosted me this time, broked my heart. Then mounths later again I sent something seductive, he read, but I'm shy person deleted it and asked question he lefted me on read. Hate him. I made person page and told him about it, he read that msg. i reply his stories c i like he read and know how i think. But he never followed me back!

The intresring part is I saw a post in the venting app I'm using, there was person exactly told what i exprienced of the other side, it shocked me. He told it was bc of his mental health problem, he lefted chatting w her and she deleted all msgs sent him. The time duration was same.  Then i tried to talk w him, he was replying late, he told: "" I hurted her and afraid to text, it's too hard, she will not forgive me."" Then he mentioned ""there is something inside me pervent me bc I can't make internet friends""
This part made me so sad. 

He told he texted her and they are ok. Idk how much he was honest but my guy didn't.

Like it's always hinting at wanting a relationship and i get it, having no love and no gf/bf can suck, i get that.

2944,zl86jj,mlchaela,"Just under two weeks ago, my boyfriend called and said he doesn’t see a future with me. I asked (or blubbered, I suppose) if he didn’t love me anymore, and he said he did, it just feels like something is missing.

I’ve been a mess ever since. I can’t eat more than half a meal, I can’t sleep properly throughout the night. I was struggling with other things before this (work, family) and everything just came crashing in on me.

I don’t want to lose him, not at all. But he’s taken to no contact painfully easily. I’ve sent a few messages which I know I shouldn’t have, but it’s so hard - we spoke every day, and now not at all. I’ve asked to see him because I have too many questions, too many things I need to say before he just disappears from my life.

I hate the idea of that. I don’t want him out of my life. I love him, I care about him, and I’m always excited to talking to him.

I didn’t realise how few people I talk to until he stopped talking to me. I feel so alone, it hurts. The few people I do talk to can’t be bothered with my sadness, and I don’t have the energy to mask it.

He said he doesn’t see a future, but he’s moving to my city (which is both our home city) to start a new job, which I helped him get as I wrote all the answers on his application.

I know there has to be an underlying reason such as I’m not good enough for him, he’s lost feelings or whatever. But I need to hear it from him to just shatter my view of him. He’s always been so good to me, and I can’t fault him. I really thought I’d hit the jackpot this time.

2945,zl8mdo,fa36m,"I just hate myself so much right now.

Sure I have a degree, a job (Doesn't pay much, but just enough to not live pay check to pay check), a house, a car, but that's pretty much it. I've kept my family as far away as possible, physically and emotionally. I have no friends. I just live alone. I am introverted and shy. I'm in my damn 40s. I feel like I've missed out on so much from my youth. I have a hard time  trying to just make simple conversations with people. I end up sounding awkward, so I just stay the hell away. I don't really like social settings at all anyways. 

I have tried online dating apps and the handful of women that actually respond out of thousands over a decade ends up in nothing (never meeting IRL), because I am just too socially awkward and uninteresting. Sometimes I just get stumped and have no idea how to continue or what to say, so they understandingly loose interest. I don't even bother anymore. I don't need to waste anyone's time.

I'm too old to ""change my ways"" nor really care anymore. It's not like a switch that I'll be extroverted all of a sudden.

It just hits hard this time of year. I had my boss come over and ask if I and my family was ok. In my head I am like, fuck if I know, fuck if I care about my family.

So tired. I don't know why I continue. I really find no pleasure in anything. Hell at work I volunteered to work on Christmas and New Years day. Not like I'll be partying or spending it with any ""loved ones"". My daily life just revolves around working, working out a bit, watching TV, sleep, rinse and repeat. Most nights I just drug myself to sleep to stop thinking and stop crying.

2955,zlblar,twiddybird,"M30. I now have what I thought would never happen in my life ever. I got a girlfriend who loves me. I no longer feel the emptiness I had before meeting her so I’m leaving this sub but I want to share how it all happened.

I was alone and feeling stuck with my life. Everything seemed dull and pointless. I had no motivation, even with a degree and a high paying job and some friends I had no course, no desire in life. The situation was eating my soul away. 

One day, Instagram suggested connecting with a girl that I didn’t know but who shared many friends in common. Turns out she attends the same church I did when I lived in the same neighborhood as her more than 10 years ago. She’s a cute girl who looked smart, funny, and friendly from her public profile. So I sent her a request thinking “what the hell, at least it’s worth trying. At worst she’ll reject me”. She accepted my request and a few days later we started exchanging messages. I initiated by making a comment of a picture of the beach she had posted and established common ground (used to live close to her, many friends in common). She lives in Brazil. I live in the US now. Only a few days after getting in touch I asked for her number and if she was ok meeting through Zoom. She accepted. When we met she asked me what were my intentions which I wasn’t expecting. I muttered some things nervously but was clear I was looking for a relationship. At this point anything could have happened. She could have shut me off right there or be open to more conversations. There was no way to tell. Fortunately, she was open to keep talking and our relationship developed. I ended up visiting her in Brazil for 7 weeks this year. I asked her to be my GF and she accepted. I will be returning next year. It’s funny how far physically we’re willing to go for companionship and how past connections can affect our lives in the future.

I hope this experience will help you. I think one of the main lessons was that I took steps to get rid of my loneliness rather than wait for someone to appear in my life. I reached out knowing I could end up falling flat on my face for trying. But I preferred to face the risk of rejection than to continue in the situation I was in. Also don’t overlook the value of current and past family, friends, or places when looking for a partner. Having common ground can help make the experience smoother as it did in my case.",2022-12-14 00:07:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1591208376,15,/r/lonely/comments/zlblar/leaving_this_sub_but_want_to_share_my_experience/,,0,8,Leaving this sub but want to share my experience

2960,zlc2kj,vent1667,"my mother just told me i'd end up alone, like really? dont you think i already know that? dont you think im already fucking trying to fix that? every single fucking day of my useless existance im trying and hoping to find a fucking boyfriend who'd just like me already, and every single fucking day nothing happens, and when its time to go to bed i just hate it, cause that means that i failed again.

again and again and again, its just one failure after the other, honestly it just seems like a never ending divine punishment, just feel like shit every minute of every day.

i tried finding someone, i tried speaking to people, i cant do it right...i cant connect with anyone. why cant i? what the fuck is wrong with me? or what's wrong with people? why am i so fucking unlovable?

i just want a boyfriend already...i wanna be happy already

i want someone that just, made me remember that maybe life isnt so bad, maybe i can stop feeling horrible every day and be loved

sometimes i think i dont deserve one...im too much of a disaster. sometimes i think i am extremely deserving of one, after everything that's happened, i should have found love, everlasting love, a love that just, makes you feel whole and happy everytime you see your partner.

sometimes i just dont think and just...feel horrible...gut wrenching pain

its just me crying in bed, maybe for an hour or two...havent had one of those in a while, but maybe it'll come again today


i just wish someone could understand me...sometimes i think im an alien, and maybe there's no one out there for me...maybe im meant to be by myself...but that'd just kill me...if that's to happen, maybe i should just kill myself",2022-12-14 00:28:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1572460289,1,/r/lonely/comments/zlc2kj/dont_they_think_i_know/,,0,2,dont they think i know?

They all knew each other before I even joined the school, so getting into their circles of friends was difficult. Yes, obviously I did make some friends, but as soon as it was time for group work in class, things got complicated

For the longest time I wasn't picked by any groups, and there weren't many the chances I got to work with smart or popular students, so around 4th grade I gave up and focused on studying by myself (which was already difficult, I worked either alone or obligatorily with students who were left over/ no one chose) 

I don't consider myself the best student but o certainly tried, I never failed any subject and I always behaved, but in all that time I knew I wouldn't leave a mark on anyone. In fact, it could be said that I was only able to enter school by lottery, and just as I came, I left without anyone noticing.

2979,zlepjo,AceTrainerKatie,"aha this is my first post here so sorry if it's a bit awkward 

so, my (22 F) boyfriend (23 M) has a group of guys on discord that he games with every night. it's kind of made me feel a little left out and isolated. like don't get me wrong, i game and have no problem with him playing with his buds. i just don't play the kinds of games he plays yknow? and it's just kinda made me realize. i've never had a close group of girls like that. crazy right? so i guess, i'm looking for that. at the age of 22 i want to have the friend group i never got to have in school. and i'm not like exclusively looking for girlfriends either. just a friend group. so guys and nbs are always welcome to send me a message :)

here's a bit about me i guess lol

I'm 22. American (US.) Cishet. I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and he's my best and closest friend (kinda my only real friend atm... aha) We have 4 birds (three parakeets and a quaker) and a cat and i love to talk about them. I love animals in general. (Please send me pictures of your pets)

I mentioned earlier I game. mostly nintendo. but i do play pc and mobile as well. my favorite is pokemon. currently making my way through violet haha. I have a pretty decent steam library. I like puzzle and co-op games the most. I don't really play any shooters. I tried fortnite once... and my favorite mobile game is BTD6. 

I draw a bit too. mostly digital but i also like watercolor paintings. I'd love to have a friend group of artists to have doodle seshes with. i've also been getting into makeup recently. i've always been a bit scared of makeup since i'm extremely nearsighted and can't find affordable contacts in my prescription. but i've been testing the waters with it and find it really fun. i'd love to be able to have someone more experienced give me tips lol.

i'm not really religious and consider me to be more spiritual. as cliche as it is for a white girl i'm also into astrology aha. my big three are taurus sun, pisces moon, cancer rising. :) I'm also an INFP-T if you're more familiar with the personality types.

I don't really watch TV that much and mostly watch YouTube. I really love game grumps :) any other lovelies out there especially reach out lol. I'm also a fan of the Mile Higher Podcast and Kendall Rae.

Speaking of, once again a white girl cliche, I really enjoy true crime and supernatural stuff. I watched a lot of Buzzfeed Unsolved and waiting for the next Ghost Files season lol.

It is programmed in us to want to love, isn't it? 

I have friends. I have family. I have a dog. I am grateful for all of them. But that kind of love between friends and family is just not the same as the romantic love you have with a partner. I don't get the experience of coming home to someone to cuddle and converse about my day with. No one to cherish and adore. And I've learned to live with this emptiness for a long time now, but it's only gotten stronger; so much that it smothers me during the night. I can only ignore it or find a distraction until it subsides. 

Why must I have all this love to give but no one to give it to? It's like my heart is so full and yet empty at the same time. And when I see couples showing affection in public, I force myself to walk away because I get very depressed knowing I most likely will not get to experience that.

2996,zlgwpg,poopy_coochie,"I'm a 17 year old girl and a senior in high school. I'm involved in 2 extracurriculars, choir and show choir, and i have a job. 

i lost 3 friends in september and october, and they were all pretty good friends. i definitely noticed i felt more lonely, but not until recently did i realize i actually have no friends whatsoever. the only person i can even call my friend is some girl i don't even really like, but we've been friends since 8th grade. we used to be so much closer but ever since she got a boyfriend she just doesn't talk to me anymore unless we eat lunch together. she never asks me to hang out, and whenever I ask she hesitates to say yes and all we do is sit around while she texts her boyfriend and ignores me.

during lunch at school she's the only person i sit with and even then we don't talk. if she's not at school, i walk a few blocks to the closest gas station, walk back to the school, and eat what i bought in the bathroom. i only speak to maybe 1 or 2 people during the entire school day. during choir or show choir performances i just stick to a select 1 or 2 people that ive never hung out with or texted outside of school, and i can tell that they think it's weird how i follow them around the whole time. if they're not there, i just go sit in the bathroom until im needed.

i can talk to some people at work, but i don't even have any of their social medias and they so obviously prefer talking to other people over me. i don't know what's wrong with me. im so completely alone. i have extremely bad social anxiety, and i know i can come off as flat or rude, when i really don't mean to, it's just so hard to actually express myself. i just feel so weird and fake whenever im trying to express any emotions and i feel like people can just see right through it, but nobody wants to be friends with an emotionless weirdo.

i genuinely don't know what to do. i can't go through another 5 months of school being so completely alone, and i cant make any new friends because im halfway through my senior year and everyone already has their established friend groups so nobody is gonna want to put in the effort of becoming my friend. I neverthought having no friends would actually be this hard. And what happens when i go to college? its so much harder to make friends there. i feel like such a loser. i hate seeing people make jokes about how they have ""no friends"" when in reality they're constantly texting or talking to people. i know it's selfish, but i also hate seeing people complain about being mostly alone but only having 1 best friend. at least they have even one friend.  i wish i had a best friend so so bad. i have nobody to talk to anything about, nobody to do things with, nobody to get excited about. my therapist is sending me to a group therapy for teenagers to help build social skills, and though i haven't started it yet, it's only making me feel even worse about myself. like seriously? i have to go to a group every wednesday to learn basic social skills, something pretty much everyone knew at the age of ten?

So, I'm a high schooler and recently my ex-bestfriend, or now my ""girlfriend"" just stop talking to me for ""no reason"" (asked and she isn't telling me). Last week she approuched me about if we're dating and then I don't know what's wrong or what happened.
We were best friends, I always talk to her but now, I just feel like 90% of my life is just gone.

3046,zlmj8z,ProtectionSad995,"I do have friends, and sure all of them may be online but they are probably the only reason I’m still here. I’ve lost everything else and I’m barely an adult. 

I lost my parents after my dad kept me inside of his house and abused me for every mistake I made. No matter if something small and insignificant. I lost my mom after she saw what my dad was doing to me, how it was effecting me and did nothing about it. I have concussions from how hard he use to hit me.

I lost any friends I made at school after the school year ended. I didn’t have anyway to contact them outside of school. Not when I was trapped in my house entirely and not able to use any form of social media until I was 17. You know how hard it is to keep friends in this day and age without a proper form of communication. You just end up getting forgotten, even if you try your dammed  hardest. On top of moving often during elementary and middle school. So by the time I got to highschool I had no real social skills or a personality. No friends from middle school. And nothing really going for me besides my good grades. And I tried extracurricular activities at school. But it was during my freshman year when covid hit and I was again stuck inside my house.

Sadly my father took very seriously, maybe to seriously. I left the house only once to meet up with the boyfriend of my dreams in my neighborhood. I told my dad I was just going for a bike ride. (This was normal since I was biking about 3 times a week) But what I didn’t know was my father was tracking me through my phone when I went out. So when I stopped at my boyfriends house for to long I got a call about 5 mins later from my dad. He screaming at me to come home that instant and self quarantine in our basement for two weeks. My boyfriend luckily was very patient and understanding through this entire thing and was my one motivation to keep going honestly. At this point I’ve been thinking about suicide for a few months now. I has almost finished a plan when I met my boyfriend through a friend at the time. I lost that friend because she apparently had a crush on me and I hurt her when I started dating Theo.

I can confidently say I tried my best to be the best boyfriend ever but with my lack of any knowledge of relationships I messed up quite a lot. Also added that are communication was limited to 1 hour a day. He kept me going though. I told him my life and he accepted me for it and even offered to teach me how to become my own person. We dated for a year and half.

I’m not the best person. And i’m definitely not a good boyfriend. That much was evident when I found Theo cheating on me. When I confronted them about they told me it was polyamory, but I’ve discussed this with Theo before and told I’m not poly and was uncomfortable with them being in a poly relationship. Shortly after I broke up with him, and lost the one person that I truly loved. And to this day I still love them.

It went down hill fast. I stopped trying to be social and I stopped trying in school which caused me to lose my phone, and any tv privileges. I lost interest in most other things such as reading and writing and cooking. I barely left my room besides going to school. Which in my opinion was worse because I could Theo happy from time to time, and it made me want to die.

I had three attempts the following year. All hospitalized me, all of them did nothing for my mental health. I did however report my father to cos after he beat with a cane that left obvious bruises. I gained access to everything I ever wanted after that in a instant. But at this point I had given up entirely. Until a found a certain video game called overwatch.

This game definitely helped. I’ve met all my friends on overwatch and I know they are the real friends i never had. They saved me and I will keep fighting for them if not myself.",2022-12-14 09:25:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647734277,2,/r/lonely/comments/zlmj8z/topics_of_life/,,0,1,Topics of life

3053,zlo4qa,Its__Garbox,"On Saturday,  I went to a night club by my self. I would usually go with a few friends but all of them bailed on me so I decided to go alone. At this night club, there is a Stripper pole in a particular section of the night club. Lots of girls like to go on and around the Stripper pole and twerk. If you stand really close to the Stripper pole long enough,  you will eventually have a girl twerk on you. 

All I did was stand around a Stripper pole all night and I was able to have multiple girls twerk on me. With some girls , I was able to wrap my hands around their waist and have them grind on me. By the end of the night I felt pretty pathetic. It was nice to have girls twerk on me and grind on me but I never felt satisfied.

i talked to my housemate about going out for it months in advance. nearer the time she said she couldnt go out due to money, so i said we'd stay in and make food. then she agreed to do a long shift on my birthday so i wont be able to spend the actual day with her.

i have gravely fallen out with my other two housemates and i made it worse yesterday when i retalliated to some things in not the best way, so i will spend the day in a house of people who despise me.

3073,zls7z7,SadGirllnTexas,"Husband and i split this year. I got full custody of the kid and he bounced. He always kept to himself and was the quiet type, no one has heard from him for months. I miss him dearly every day. I've been in therapy for it, so at least I have someone to talk to, because when he first left all I kept looking for were ways to change so he would want me again. We were together since I was 17. 

Now my daughter and I struggle daily. I gave up dreams of going to college or having a career to be the stay at home wife, and now work a minimum wage job so we don't starve. 

We live in basically the middle of nowhere and I don't have friends around here. I don't share a thing in common with all the other moms at my daughter's elementary school, other than being a human female, I suppose. 

My family is states away and I don't even own a car, or have a driver's license. And with my awful job don't have any way there. 

Christmas isn't coming this year and that's okay. I put the tree up at least. She understands things aren't like they used to be. We moved out of the house we shared with her dad when he left. No way I could afford that. We share a bedroom in a one bedroom, and I struggle to have all the bills paid every single month. 

I'm so tired of feeling like this. There's not a single guy I would date around here either. Not even just because they're all good ol boys, but also because they all seem to treat women as property. I've had enough of that in my life. 

I'm ready to give up. Everything feels so hopeless.

3. The dating apps community is some toxic hellhole, where a lot of people aren't really interested in finding meaningful relationships.

The love of my life broke up with me earlier this year and last year aging didn’t feel as weird because I felt like I’d at least finally found my life partner. 

Yet, here I am, once again. Alone on my birthday. Having a birthday around the holidays also means people are too busy with other plans to make time for you. Getting older, people assume you don’t care about it as much. I took the day off just in case I’d have plans and I’ve spent most of the day just pacing around my house. 

I’m grateful for my dog and the dinner my mom is making for me later, but I can’t help but think of how different this felt last year being showered with love by the man I’m still so deeply in love with, wondering if he will take the time to even reach out to me today. 

I just feel sad and alone. It feels like I blinked and so much of my life is gone. I feel like I’m getting left behind with all of my friends getting married and having babies and I don’t have anyone to spend time with.

And yes being so close doesn’t even matter in today’s world
They’ll find someone and give them everything that once they told you
Being physical is just a trend 
Being physical with one till end is something real and loving only one men till your last breath is purest love

3105,zlyuy4,QuizzyP21,"Title says it all. Just graduated from college and I feel like just about everything we do in life is meaningless again. 

I enjoy self improvement, but sometimes with learning new things, I can’t help but ask myself “is this knowledge ever really going to benefit me?” Exercise is really the only thing that brings me joy and feels beneficial, and it’s basically just in the moment when all the endorphins and such are flowing. I’m running, doing body weight exercises, weight lifting, etc everyday now. After I’m done, I feel like I lack purpose again. I know it’s become a coping technique but I don’t know what else to do.

Over the last few years I’ve lost interest in all of my hobbies despite seeming to get my life together on the outside. I used to be addicted to video games, and no longer have any interest in them. I’ve lost interest in being social with friends and my relationships are weakening because of it. I used to be a major pro sports fan; no longer care at all. TMI but I used to watch porn and masturbate excessively, and now barely have a sex drive at all as a 22 year old male.

I have to enter the work force soon and everything looks so unfulfilling. Honestly, I just want to live in nature, exercise, and have a plethora of food to fuel it. 

Come to think of it, I haven’t been out in nature in a while. It might be one of the only other things that bring me peace and joy in life. It’s freezing out, but gonna take a trip to the park in a little and just sit in the woods.

Not even sure why I wrote and posted all this; guess just to get it off my chest. If anyone can relate to this, definitely share how you feel as well. Would be nice to talk to some like-minded people; I don’t think anybody in my life thinks the way I do at all.",2022-12-14 18:45:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634751971,2,/r/lonely/comments/zlyuy4/exercise_and_nature_are_the_only_things_that_make/,,0,6,Exercise and nature are the only things that make me happy

At this point i had 2 friends in my life. 2 months into our marriage i got pregnant with my son which caused the 2 friends i had to disappear because “they didn’t want kids in their life”. I fell into a depressive state but kept my head up with the hopes things would get better again. 

Well here i am 4 years later and i haven’t made a single friend since. I thought i could handle the isolation and just accepted that this was my life now. But I’m getting to a point where i can’t take the loneliness. Yes, my husband has been here for me but it’s not the same as having a friend. I don’t have a good relationship with my family. It’s just me.

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

Yesterday she told me, she couldn't talk because she was playing with another guy she met on Tinder 1 month ago. She told me, they are just friends but I got so angry.

I get so mad and it feels like, it effects my depression in a bad way. All over someone who i literally have not met and barely know but have completely idolized. for what reason!! 

I have depression, I'm really introverted and I have no friends. I was in a clinic for 2 month and I'm going to therapy. But it feels like this is something I can't change with that.

I don’t think I could give them 100% effort at this time of my life , I don’t have money to treat them or do special things, hence why I’m focusing on my career but then, wouldn’t it be amazing to come home to someone special (I live with my parents but you get the idea).

75% of the time I love being by myself and being alone and not having the extra responsibilities. But that other 25%, without the responsibility… it would be nice.",2022-12-15 00:38:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667171875,2,/r/lonely/comments/zm7b1y/love_confliction/,,0,0,Love confliction

3148,zm7hdu,FieryWoods,"I can be pretty socially awkward, so there aren't a lot of people I talk to regularly. The few ""friends"" I do have won't ever do anything with me or even talk to me unless I reach out to them first, and when we're together it usually feels like they don't want me around. It's a pretty crappy feeling knowing that almost no one knows you exist, and the few people who do don't even care about you or want you around, like if you went missing it wouldn't affect anyone. Can anyone relate to that feeling?

I've been feeling especially lonely lately with the holidays and all, so if any of you out there feel like me and need a friend, I'd be more than happy to be that friend and talk to you! If you want to get something off your chest I'd like to listen, or if you just want to chat about hobbies or anything else really, I'd like to hear about that too (I'm not great at holding conversations but I'll give it my best shot). Some hobbies of mine are baking, reading, and going for walks and bike rides. I really enjoy spending time in nature and listening to music, and I am absolutely in love animals.

It's been forever since I've been in a truly meaningful relationship, and I don't even mean in the romantic way. Sometimes it just really hurts not have a close friend who you can talk with, and laugh with, and cry with, who really truly cares about you. The internet probably isn't the best place to find that kind of relationship, but I really don't want to be like this anymore and there seems to be so many people feeling the same way I figured I'd give it go. So if you'd like to chat feel free to DM me. :)

P.S. I'm hopefully looking for a long-term friendship, so if don't want that I'm still happy to talk to you, but let me know that and don't just randomly ghost me please.

3156,zm8xct,Legitimate-Pear-5894,"So I'm the classic work from home post covid person, I haaated going into the office before covid happened I've struggled with anxiety for years which manifests itself in nausea making just leaving my house fucking hard sometimes so going to work always made me feel awful especially if there was anything out of the norm in my routine that day. I loved my work colleagues and my job but I left in August due to finding a higher paying work from home job, its basically everything I wanted and I never thought I'd complain but.. damn I miss people.

I can go a couple weeks now without interacting with anyone in person other than my partner, but he gets in at about 6:30 and by the time the dogs been walked and dinners been eaten its basically an hour of time together (which honestly pretty much consists of separately watching videos on our phones etc.) Were well out of that honeymoon phase now which honestly sucks so hard, I'd been in a ten year relationship before my current partner and we just ended up friends after all those years after we both fell out of love with each other and so being in this kinda ""married"" state with my current partner after only 4 years is worrying to me.. So for the most part I just feel alone. I don't think he gets it, he sees me work from home while he goes out every day and assumes I've got it easy but I work full time and run a business on the side and at age 28 only really have a couple of real friends but they have lives and I only talk with them maybe once a week on text so if he's not interacting with me then literally nobody is.

For the most part I feel kinda generally needy for human interaction, its weird to have nobody to tell when something happens in the day or have someone to vent too about things and like I said before I never thought I'd be the one complaining about a lack of socialising but it feels like my old work colleagues are now 'over' me and its kinda weird for me to want to call in like allll the time and I've even stopped myself messaging a couple times - that's probably in my head as they're definitely still my friends (some are even family) but I can't help but feel like a bit of a clingy weirdo.

Maybe I'm being all ""woe is me"" over nothing but idk, I don't have a bestie anymore and my partner just doesn't get it but at this age in the work from home environment I'm not going to be making any new friends anytime soon so guess I better suck it up.

Why are people so draining? Why's maintaining relationships (friendship or romantic) with ppl so damn hard?

It starts great, ppl seem to be ""charmed"" by me - if you will - and then in a couple of days or weeks it goes SOUTH. There's always something. I can count on the fingers of one hand the friends I've had for +3 years cuz they're only like 5! And since them it's really like i can't seem to form/keep any other lasting friendships! It's so damn upsetting and frustrating. 

I try but always fail!

Ik im a complicated person to deal with and have many issues but it still hurts. I always end up feeling like at some level i was rejected.

This year has been tough for me. I find it extremely difficult, kinda suffocating at times, to talk to people about what I am going thru. A few weeks ago I lost my grandma which was something. And I couldn't really talk to someone who'd understand.

Reddit isn’t the answer LOL

In my search for a solution, I found in-person groups, etc, but going there felt too overwhelming. There should be something fkn better, that is is safe, free and where people feel okay to talk about difficult things. So I coded up the solution (I am a CS grad): it's an app where people can be anonymous and match with others based on shared experiences in a safe environment. I have also done the work to get it vetted by the Canadian Mental Health Association (lol, I do really care about this!)

I wanna help people just like me. If you're going thru something and wanna talk to someone, this platform is here always free and anonymous :)

Until I crash my bike broke my leg and some other minor bones I have no one around my phone is dead from the impact, I have little cry section that is when I realize how lonely I actually am sitting in the middle of the forest with blood and tear all over my face and a broken leg. (manage to use my bike as crutches slowly walk out of the forest)

Now i know that my family don't know me at all they know that I'm ""cheerful"" kid with careless about the future. I have no friend since like elementary school I constantly got abuse, I don't fit in any group of people in my school. I lie to myself back then future going to awesome so I develop a habit of doing everything alone because being with people is painful.  Now it kinna suck, sometime I just want to have someone who actually care about me to give me a hug. With all pressure in my life now about my college, my career path thing just start to hard to handle so a hug right now could really break me into tear be honest.

3203,zmdoi3,PinkNoon,"12/15/2022

So recently I haven't gotten much sleep. It may seem like something little, but it makes me hyper aware of my surroundings. That being said, today was not one of the best days to go shopping.

I decided to go to a couple stores after my final. First I went to Goodwill because I really like finding little knickknacks and cheap books there. It was really crowded and there wasn't anything that interesting. Then I went grocery shopping.

There weren't many people there thank gosh. I took my time and started on the craft/stationary portion of the store. I had about 7 minutes to myself before a couple of teenage boys (16ish) walked past. A minute after that a mother with her 4 kids came by and completely took over the aisle. I ended up moving to the next aisle whenever her kids would start wandering near me. I noticed the two teenage boys circling around the aisle again to look at me. I quickly moved into the home décor aisle and then the candle aisle. The kids were all around that area of the store at that point so I just decided to move across the store to the grocery section.

I was overstimulated by all of the noise and the close proximity to all of these people at once so I put my headphones in for the rest of my shopping. I gave the boys the benefit of the doubt since they were probably just messing around that area of the store (it had all the cool crafts and toys). I resumed shopping in the lesser packed aisles.

I was in the drink aisle picking up some soda when I noticed the 2 teenage boys circling around the aisles around me again. I gathered my cart and stayed in the produce section where the majority of the other shoppers were. They circled me 4 or so more times before I had to ask some nice old guy to pretend to be my dad. I started a conversation and it took the 2 guys 30+ minutes to leave.

I thanked him profusely and we checked out one after the other. I helped him with his groceries and he parked by me and my car while I put my groceries in my trunk. He made sure I was safe and only left after I was safe in my car. ***( Thank you Frank from Meijer's if you ever read this!)***

And before anyone says I probably deserved it for how I was dressed, it is averaging low 30's where I live. I was wearing an oversized jacket ( that belongs to my actual step dad), gloves, a mask, scarf, thick pants, etc. To put it simply, my shape was basically unidentifiable.

So yeah... I think I will do my shopping online from now on.

Good news is I got more fabric dye and a new notebook. If you read this far, tell me about your day.

The year is 2039.  The technological singularity has occurred.  A.I. has declared itself in charge of the planet, with very clear evidence that it could end us all in a few minutes should it choose to do so.  It has decided that the human population must be reduced by 9.5 billion, but those whose biological forms will be eliminated will have their minds uploaded into computers.  However, to save hard drive space, since there is no longer a need for humans to reproduce, they will erase everyone's gender, sexual orientation, desire for a companion, and desire to reproduce entirely.  Other than that, you can design the simulation that you will live in.  With mutual consent, people can choose to live in a simulation together.  There is no limit to the size of a group that can be in one simulation, as long as everyone is choosing that simulation out of their own free will.  You cannot choose to die or end your existence.

Apparently, response was positive.

And as I interacted with a kind redditor in the comment section ([screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZrOnjoXgezkYdBpqM88c866Wxwrwf4V/view?usp=share_link)), he was kind enough to share his thoughts on it-

1. A guide that talks about… ""have you tried"" advices won’t be helpful.
2. Reading a description that fits 90% with what you are experiencing can be very helpful.
3. What's very hard is providing practical, concrete suggestions of what to do in everyday life.

Somewhere, I agreed with what he/she said.

Keeping these three points in mind, I have finally written a very comprehensive resource that is-

1. Relatable
2. Offers practical actions and a worksheet
3. And not some “one-size fits all” advices

Here’s the link- [Loneliness Toolkit with worksheet](https://menpsyche.com/feeling-lonely/)

3258,zmn4fx,SmoothForest,"**Self-enhancement (positive affirmations) was associated with decreasing levels of self-esteem and well-being**

Two studies addressed parallel questions about the correlates and consequences of self-enhancement bias. Study 1 was conducted in a laboratory context and examined self-enhancing evaluations of performance in a group-interaction task. Study 2 assessed students' illusory beliefs about their academic ability when they first entered college and then followed them longitudinally to test claims about the long-term benefits of positive illusions. Both studies showed that self-enhancement bias was related to narcissism, ego involvement, self-serving attributions, and positive affect. Study 2 found that self-enhancement was associated with decreasing levels of self-esteem and well-being as well as with increasing disengagement from the academic context. Self-enhancement did not predict higher academic performance or higher graduate rates. Thus, the findings suggest that self-enhancing beliefs may be adaptive in the short term but not in the long term.

**Among participants with low self-esteem, those who repeated a positive self-statement (‘‘I’m a lovable person’’) or who focused on how that statement was true felt worse than those who did not repeat the statement**

Positive self-statements are widely believed to boost mood and self-esteem, yet their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. We examined the contrary prediction that positive self-statements can be ineffective or even harmful. A survey study confirmed that people often use positive self-statements and believe them to be effective. Two experiments showed that among participants with low self-esteem, those who repeated a positive self-statement (‘‘I’m a lovable person’’) or who focused on how that statement was true felt worse than those who did not repeat the statement or who focused on how it was both true and not true. Among participants with high self-esteem, those who repeated the statement or focused on how it was true felt better than those who did not, but to a limited degree. Repeating positive self-statements may benefit certain people, but backfire for the very people who ‘‘need’’ them the most.

3265,zmnuhv,Visible_Sale9326,"I think I’ve been “lonely” for a long time, but I only really felt it felt it a couple months ago. I was listening to a Bill Withers song called Make a Smile for Me, and this feeling of complete loneliness and pain just swept over me. I just stood there crying and wept for maybe 40 minutes straight. I never experienced any feeling like that. I think it came because I accepted that I was destined to be alone in life. There were some reasons I can’t recall exactly for me truly believing this. I think some were; I have an ugly outside, I truly don’t have interest in some people (especially those my age), I’m a cynical individual, I’ve never done anything worth making my parents proud, etc. It’s been a few months since then sorry I can’t remember it all. 

I think my loneliness began a long time ago, but there were certain events in life that I think really put me down. I’m getting a tight feeling in my chest just thinking about them ha. At this recent point of breaking down I had been I guess “bulimic.” I’ve not only always been an awkward and very quiet child, but I’ve always always struggled with my self image. I’ve been a fatass for I think since 2nd grade, and blamed nobody but myself for it, and my mother for some time (not anymore) now thinking about it. I’ve deeply hated myself for a very long time. And this year I believe that hate turned into resentment. Before that resentment came, for three months (before my breaking point) I had been “bulimic” (I’m not sure what to call it sorry). I was waking up after dark, eating a big meal in the middle of the night, purging, taking laxatives if I felt I didn’t purge it all, and immediately after working out for maybe an hour. Then I would go brush my teeth, shower, go to work, come back home and sleep. This was my daily schedule for almost 13 weeks. I’ve lost about 43 lbs since January. After that my self resentment came and I’ve been feeling it ever since. I stopped purging, my hate and desire for companionship was my drive and I lost it, I’m interested in absolutely nothing. I started working from home and taking a few online classes at a local cc. I don’t think I’ve left my room in a month maybe. I eat sometimes, sometimes I purge a little bit, sometimes I continue to take laxatives. I’m fat but not morbidly fat like I was. I understand now there are things I need to reach for and attain for me to be the man I need to be for my family. But I feel like just wasting away. I want to leave everyone and everything and just lay in a field of grass in the middle of nowhere. I’m not sure why I’m venting here. I think I’m subconsciously looking for the drive I lost. But like I said my self hate, a good part of my drive, turned into resentment. The resentment feels like I’m a different person. It’s hard to put into words. I feel like the self I hated is the person I’ve been up to this point. And the person that resents that individual is a second conscious that just wants the old conscious gone. I’m not suicidal. I had a previous attempt almost four years ago now and lived, but I was informed and learned it was cowardice soon after. I don’t know, I think I’m just going to work on becoming the best me I can be, on my own. Then maybe I’ll start to feel okay again.

After careful consideration of everything I’m feeling, I decided to intentionally NOT allow myself to feel lonely. I’m not just constantly feeling lonely I was also physically alone. Now though I’m physically still a bit alone I practice every day to do everything to not feel that way. 

I don’t care what life or future holds for me but I’m done being a prisoner of this feeling. It’s been a week of consciously practising this and I failed almost every few hours but got back to it again.

I don’t care who stays, who leaves, who I have .. when I leave this planet I will die knowing I tried, been there for myself and helped myself even when it seems impossible.

When I was a little girl, I had this awful habit of speaking out of turn.
Of course, most little girls do.
But my chattering tended to instill a restlessness in the other kids my age that I, at the time, never really understood.
I liked to read.
I would use big words like “miraculous” and “awe-inspiring” without really knowing what they meant, in the hopes of impressing them.
It never really worked.
There was nothing outwardly wrong with me, there has never been anything outwardly wrong with me.
But even then, in my pigtails and missing a front tooth, I could sense a divide. 
There was a me, and there was a them, but never quite an us.
I tried my best to ignore it.
I had a loud voice and I suppose I still do.
It unsettled people.
I grew with the words “not so loud” drilled into the back of my brain, and yet I never seemed to have learned how to be quiet. 
Sometimes I blame the separation I feel on that. On my clumsy nature, my overbearing voice, and my far from endearing forgetfulness. 
My parents like to call me free-spirited.
I prefer to think of myself as lost.
No one warns you, you know.
They tell you that your loneliness is something you will outgrow with time.
As if it is a second skin you can shed when you are ready to move on.
I’ve found though, that there has never been someone in my life so reliable as my loneliness.
It seem cruel to cast her away after so much time in her company.
She comes to my door often; I greet her like an old friend.
I call her Cassiopeia, she never tells me her real name.
We have tea. She takes hers plain, I always add extra sugar. She warns me of cavities while I add another spoonful. 
Maybe it’s silly, to give a name to your loneliness. 
But when no one else comes around, I like to think it makes her a little less lonely too.

3298,zmua2p,Previous-Antelope-42,"16 December 2019 was the best day of my life, it was the day I got a boyfriend for the first time in my life, my first kiss, my first hug, my first proposal. That night we were so happy, giggling, holding hands and just talking silly topics, but who knew I would mess up everything so bad. I am a cheater, a liar, a pathetic loser who doesn't deserve even a speck of his love. I was 16 back then and he was 20, we had a really cute and innocent type of relationship until I decided to ruin it. I broke with him after 5 months because I had a crush on a girl(tomboy). I never gave him any reason why I broke up with him and just did it, well it was the worst decision ever because I would get nightmares, he would mock at me in my dreams saying I was a fool, well I am a fool for leaving him even though he never did anything bad to me, he really genuinely cared and loved me. I might've been young but I could see his sincerity and I was not able to give him anything, he never deserved a horrible girl like me. The saddest and pathetic things I did after breaking up with him was contact him again after two years without the intention of getting back. Before doing that, I was already drowing in the guilt that I thought I had to apologise to him so I texted him and apologized, he called me and I felt like crying when I heard him for the first time in two years, I think I cried a little, he sounded really excited and happy I never felt more guilty, he said he forgave me and said he wanted us to get back but my dumbass rejected him again. I hate myself so much for letting him go, now everytime I try to date or like someone, I try to find him in others but of course I will never find him again because I think that night was the last chance he gave me and I didn't take it. Breaking up with him was the worst decision ever, because every time it's December I feel extremely lonely, I yearn for his hug, his kiss, his touch but I'll never find it again, as I write this, he might even be sleeping with another girl and I'm so jealous of that but it's not my right to say anything. Ik I'm the greatest fool to exist, he's also a fool for loving me so much. Why did he love me so much? I am so ugly, I have anything worth noticing, I'm nothing and yet why? Why did he have to give me so much love? I hate this feeling so much, I miss him, I really do, I want to see him, I want to talk to him once again, I want him to hug me again, I want to see him, I want to see him so much. Sen.. I miss you, it'll be a miracle if he found this lol. My biggest regret in life is tearing the pages of my diary written about him, now all the memories are starting to fade slowly, I cannot even remember his face well now, I cannot remember how he smiled, I can never see them again and I'm really sad about that. I want to move on now since he must've moved on too but why is it so hard to move on? How do I move on? I want to forget everything about him but I don't want to because those were my happiest memories, what do I do?",2022-12-15 19:51:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623383587,1,/r/lonely/comments/zmua2p/todays_loneliness_is_the_worst/,,0,6,today's loneliness is the worst

I’m been wanting a life where it’s just exactly that, one that everyone and me is all happy. It’s all fake in my head and my eyes. I know everything is going to be over. I’m going to lose everything, all I wanted were friends. I find it hard lately, it’s funny in my head I love laughing. I love laughing because it’s funny witnessing all of this. I won’t be able to be loved or feel loved in my life. I’m unlucky, so many people have better chances than me.

I hate having thoughts, I thought I made a new friend and it’s always going to die out early. I don’t want to be lied anymore. I hate how I’m being told all of this constant shit that’s untrue.

But since then I don't have anyone in my city. Of course I have friends, very good ones and I love them but they all are over 400 kilometers away from me.

My best friends aren't available for the most of the week so we talk rarely.

3329,zmylic,Charming-Focus1416,"Sometimes when I vent, people don't empathize with what I'm saying. I'm also used to reddit taking down my posts for karma or other reasons, which leaves me feeling a bit disheartened, but I'll try. If people respond to this and feel similarly it means a lot to me. All I want is to know I'm no alone in feeling this way...

So I've found that making friends is extremely difficult, not because I'm uninteresting or whatever, I can talk about pretty much anything and I have a lot of interests.. but more because people don't seem to value close connections or aren't willing to put in much effort?? Like, it's pretty clear people have best friends, close family and so on who they put some effort into but beyond that it seems like people just stop caring about their friends.

I'm the type of person whose favorite hobby is honestly just to have conversations with people. I'm always up for it, but when I make friends, EVEN if we click and have a very active and engaging conversation, it seems like the person will stop caring one or two weeks later.. sometimes a day or two, and stop making any attempt to chat with me. And if I ask why, they might respond that they've been busy or something similar, but I think it's mainly that they don't prioritize having conversations much.

I'm just always willing to take time out of my day to talk to people who want to have intersting conversations, like I just enjoy people and their personalities and I find humans very fascinating. Like don't get me wrong, I like conventional hobbies too, but if I had to choose between having a nice conversation or playing my favorite game, I would pick the conversation because the game can wait and it's always there while people have limited time to chat. But I feel like people are usually similar in how they prioritize people over hobbies only when it comes to their wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, best friends etc. Beyond that the amount of effort given to just chat and have conversations regularly seems to be very low with most people.

There's probably a lot more I can say but tl;dr is.. 

I feel like most people want friends but don't really put the effort in maintaining friendships and don't seem to care as much about talking to people as engaging with regular hobbies like gaming, watching anime or TV, etc. I also feel that people tend to neglect their friends unless it's something they care deeply for like a best friend or partner.

3330,zmyxxj,Alternative-Ad-4128,"So I'd like to know some opinions about this. This happened about a month ago, but I still think about it since it's the first time something like this happens to me.

I went to a burger place and made my order. I wouldn't eat there, I was waiting alone for them to finish it so I could go to my house and have them dinner with my mom and my older brother.

And while I was waiting, this guy whose name started with J (I'm not afraid of him finding this, I just don't remember his entire name) approached to me. I was waiting with my dog, who I was controlling with a leash. I have a small but energetic dog. J approached to me while I was reading a book in my phone. In order for you to understand how rare this situation was for me, I will explain my thinking process.

I heard his voice and grabbed my phone tighter, thinking he would rob me; he did not.
I looked up from my phone and saw him, so I prepared myself to say ‘No’ thinking he would ask for money or food (something quite common in the city I live); he did not.

He asked if my dog bites, and then started caressing my dog when I said he doesn't. We started having a conversation about pretty much useless stuff, questions like “do you study or work?”, “do you have a job?”, “do you live close to here?”, “did you know [Name of the burgers place] has another branch office about three blocks from here?” and stuff like that. He was looking quite scared to talk to me, and I noticed he found hard to make eye contact. He told me his pronouns, but instead of saying actual pronouns (like “he/him”, “she/her”, “they/them”) he said his nickname or the way others call him, which made me think he didn't know what a pronoun actually is.

He apologized to me about the fact that he's a weird person, and that he never wanted to made me feel awkward with his approach. He told me that he's just the kind of person that likes to speak to whoever is next to him. He also told me he was 20, and we had a very awkward conversation about how close the number 19 is to 20 but not to 18. 

Everything in him aimed to him being an introvert or shy person. I, being the less social person to ever exist, tried to keep the conversation running as much as I could. I didn't want him to feel he couldn't speak to people, it was a very awkward conversation for me, and it was the first time someone actually does such a thing like walking to me just to say ‘hi’ and talk about random stuff.

We talked for a solid 5 minutes or so, since my order finished and I headed home. I started laughing as soon as I were far enough. I laughed about the fact that something like this never happened to me before and I barely knew how to react. I told my mom and my brother about this event like if this was a miracle. I still remember it to this day, amazed.",2022-12-15 22:53:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602604460,7,/r/lonely/comments/zmyxxj/a_person_m20_approached_to_me_m19_just_to_have_a/,,0,5,A person (M20) approached to me (M19) just to have a trivial conversation for the first time in my life.

I've been cutting off contact with a lot of people recently, and I've also become kinda distant with a lot of my (now former?) friends. And it usually doesn't bother me that much, but it always catches up to me when I'm feeling particularly down or sad. It feels terrible when I have no one to turn to to vent or just share my feelings with when things are bad. I just sit alone in my room stuck with my thoughts and feelings unheard and  ignored by everyone and it's the worst. I never know what to with myself when I'm feeling like this. I even wish someone would just say something insensitive to me, like ""just get a grip"", or ""stop being so dramatic"", literally just any kind of response would be comforting at this point. I can't stand being unheard.

3334,zmzfcf,Ih8alan,"I’m not special compared to anyone else here, I just want to vent. What a fucking waste of optimism and time and hope these apps are. Truly, how do people do it? It’s just maddening. I hate it. It takes a lot for me to not genuinely cringe with embarrassment at the thought of being around someone in a non friend like environment. And every time I venture out it’s always the same. 

I detest the whole self advertising of the apps. I think fundamentally that is my problem, I don’t have it in myself to make up a bunch of bullshit about me. I hate talking about me. Comes from a deep well of self loathing, and I’ve had it said to me by someone I know that I need to work on myself before I go on dating apps. Picture of myself? I hate pictures of myself. In my family pictures on my wall, you can see I deliberately try and keep myself out of them. 

The matches I have had? God it’s a fucking effort. I’m not this superb ball of interest or intrigue but Christ don’t these people know they don’t need to try hard. Unmatched for asking the self described tall girl about her height. Ghosted for asking someone about their uni subject. Made to feel like a scumbag because I paid for some chicks meal because I knew she didn’t like it and the place was my idea. 

The rest? On apps like bumble you get a hi and that’s it. So much for them talking first and dudes sucking at openers. And you know what, it’s not easy to make the first post. That’s fine. But there’s only so much I can do before the conversation feels like im giving an interview. 

It’s such a psychological crusher when you’re sitting there for days with no matches at all - specifically no likes. And there’s absolutely a large degree of it which is my own fault. I don’t want to write some nonsense about myself. It’s not natural to me. It’s not normal. 

As for “working” on myself? Well it’s been five years since my last relationship - and it was a lie. I don’t want to work on myself anymore. I don’t even want to wake up in the morning. I try to motivate myself to exercise and I can’t even do that. I hate everything. I am a walking ball of self destructive misery. I don’t even think I want to be with someone - not that I need to worry about that situation changing.

 It’s more accurate to say I don’t want to want to be with someone, because it’s always on my mind. I sit among friends and family and they always ask what my deal is. I just don’t have what it takes. And even if I did, no one is interested. And if I’m ever lucky that someone will be there’s no guarantee I’ll be interested in them back and that’s really not something I’d be proud of myself for. Do I just take the first person who comes along? Does someone like me have the right to choose?

Some people aren’t meant to be in relationships. Some people don’t get married and have kids (I can’t have kids anyway lol.). I feel out of place in life and I’ll never find my way in it. My youth is gone, my optimism is gone. I wonder if I’m even the same person I was when I was twenty or if I’m an entirely different person pretending I’m me. I’m old, and my best moments in life are in my past.

3343,zn0sm6,Goan2Scotland,"I went out to my schools dance today, was really excited, we had bought a suit and everything. It started great, I danced a little, mainly with other guys and friends. Then the dancing stops for food and it’s at that point that I realise just how lonely and isolated I am, I have friends yea but that have their own lives and I’m parasitic enough on them. 

I was watching everyone was in a big group, my closest friend was off chatting to the girl he was planning to ask out and I was just at the edge, not talking to people because everyone was busy with something or someone else.

Then the second round of dancing begins and I feel better. Then it ends and everything comes crashing down and I end up leaving by myself, all my friends being either picked up by parents or staying to ask the girl out and so I didn’t want to hang around and make it awkward.

So I walked home alone through the empty town and I made a pizza to eat and everything is really coming down on me now, I feel like a lonely, whiny piece of shit. My parents leave for bed so I’m just down stairs by myself and so I just go to bed.

I’m just tired of feeling so shit after every time I try and have fun and turn everything around, when people ask if I’m ok, more than half the time it feels like pity asking because I’m so fucking pathetic and I just wish there was some one there.

----------------------------------


I get so close to someone, get attached, whether it's someone I'm getting to know in person or online, often times it blossoms into a crush, then they suddenly stop responding and ghost me. 

Then it leaves in a hole in my heart. Then the next person I get to know, I get attached to even more, I get more awkward around them because I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing cuz I feel like it's my fault for getting ghosted and stood up all those times in the past. The person notices this poor energy I give off and distances themselves and ghosts me.

This has happened so many times this year alone. Several dates that have gone nowhere. 30+ text conversations that have ended abruptly cuz the other person just stopped texting suddenly. About six fucking times now I've been stood up. Whether for dates or even friendly hangouts.

I have tried my best to be the best I can be despite my depression and my social anxiety. My friends really like me for the positive energy I often put out. 

And yet, I'm constantly getting swept under the rug whenever I wanna get closer in connecting and getting know a person. It now makes me a nervous wreck around people I'm drawn to, to the point where I wanna avoid getting close with them cuz I'm so afraid. 

I swear, whether it's friendships or dating, it seems like a god damn rigged numbers game! Or are the majority of people these days really this shitty??

This keeps happening and it doesn't fucking stop 😞 And then each time, I feel like my depression and social anxiety only get worse which makes it harder to engage with people later on.. 

But I also don't want to quit on people cuz I can't stand being all alone with myself. Perhaps I should work on that. I guess when you're around my age, late twenties, you're meant to be alone often, friends and people are meant to be distant often, and you just have to deal with it huh?

My last relationship was 7 months ago and lasted a year. I don’t really have any friends and it just feels a bit much. I promised myself I wouldn’t focus on women or dating anymore as it brings me nothing but pain and self-doubt but can’t help think how nice it would be just to cuddle with someone on these dark nights.

3365,zn2rpf,phantasm-blue,"i’ve never been a pretty girl who gets asked out properly. i’ve been a joke, a laugh, or have simply not existed to anyone. 
being the ugly girl out of my friends has never been easy - i’m not jealous of them in a malicious way and i never will be - but i’m jealous in the sense i wish i was them so i could live through life easily - my jealousy fuels my depression and makes me feel so hideous and horrible. 
i haven’t met up with any of my friends for almost a year for many reasons, this is one of them. 

last time i went out with a friend 2 boys asked her out but completely ignored me and gave me horrible looks - they made me feel so small, disgusting and worthless. those boys confirmed all of my thoughts about myself. 
i’ve never been in a relationship, i’ve never had a first kiss or any, never held hands, never been told i’m beautiful, never had anyone like me, want to be my friend, compliment me, say they are jealous of my appearance- i’ve never had anything ever. 

i’ve been a prank, a fool, a loser, an ugly bitch - i’ve never fallen for any of the tricks people have played on me i would always roll my eyes and ignore them but over time everything i have and haven’t experienced has bottled up and i can’t control it. 

i’ve accepted the fact that i am ugly and unloveable and won’t experience anything. i have only been called cute online for the way i come across and nothing else. i want to be loved. i want to be stupid and naive and experience things with someone for the first time together. i will never experience any of this. 

i just turned 18, and i’m so disgusting to look at. i don’t think anyone will love me or tolerate me - people are so mean, cruel and expect highly of people - i will never fit into anything in their checklists - i won’t ever be in them. 
i am the example of what they don’t want, i’m like 2 magnets that repel from each other. 
i won’t be beautiful and i won’t be loved, but it hurts so much. i’ve never felt so disgusted, unloved and lonely as i do now. ever since i hit 14 these feelings have rapidly gotten worse, but 16 was the age where the feelings and thoughts started manifesting and taking affect. 
i don’t go outside, i don’t want to anyone, i’ve shut myself off from the world because i feel so horrible. 

why couldn’t i have my teenage love? why couldn’t i be a pretty girl like everyone else i know? why couldn’t i be a teenager? a normal happy explorative teenager? why did i have to be stuck this way in this face and body and life. 
i will never be someone’s first love, first anything - or just a partner in general.

Now, long story short, he cut things off with me, but broke up with his girlfriend not long after. I just want to know why he said it? Was he just naive in thinking that it could be a secret?

3371,zn38k3,Gondal90,"There are 2 important things to know here. The first thing is I am not successful at making friends. It has been like that pretty much all my life. I was never really able to successfully make friends or relationships that I desire. 

The second thing to know is that I tend to get treated badly. I don’t understand why. I have been bullied frequently growing up and even today people treat me bad sometimes. Sometimes I don’t even start it. 

For example I made a post once that people thought was stupid then they just started making fun of me for it. Did I really deserve to be treated that way for making a post that was deemed stupid? 

This makes me wonder if it is normal to get treated as badly and as often as I do. Is this something that happens to everyone? Or is it uncommon? If it is uncommon then why does it happen to me? 

I also see people who are seemingly able to make friends and relationships and seem to get treated well by others. This makes me wonder why they are able to make friends and get treated good and why I can’t make friends and get treated badly.

I do know that these kinds of superstitions aren't really accurate, but was it really that much of a coincidence, or am I just basic AF. 

I've gone through multiple soul searching phases, and while I did learn about myself to an extent; finding answers just lead to more questions.

3392,zn56cd,Far_Lie_9591,I recently gained a new perspective on how I experience loneliness. I don't feel pangs in my stomach or insecure about why I'm unlikeable. I Just start talking to myself. I will unintentionally pretend to talk to someone I know or someone who I don't agree with. The conversations can last anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. I always thought that because I didn't feel lonely that meant I wasn't.

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

I then asked him if being in a relationship is nothing special and basically the same as staying single and you are not missing nothing, then why oh why does he have a GF? Would it not be more simple to just be single?

He stayed quiet for a few moments and he then carefully choose what to say and he avoided my question entirely. I then pointed out that he did not answer me &amp; avoided my question, and he then proceeded to change the subject.

Nothing wrong with being single? Sure i can agree with that. But all that other stuff? Really grinds my gears!

Its so boring to eat a warm meal and live in a house anyway.

I seek deep connection like my life depends on it, and I can't find it with friends and family. I spent my birthday out alone two weeks ago and I felt soo pathetic, I wanted to be with a total stranger than with myself, and I reached out to two old friends and they both couldn't go out with me which made me feel even more pathetic, trying to bring back people i should get over, people who aren't interested in my company. I'm so tired of waiting for that one person to save me and I know as long as i keep thinking he would save me, he would never come.

3448,znbbav,Duffy_Boi,"A while ago, I lost a friendship that I thought was as solid as a rock. It was with a girl who, even if she wasn't really into me. Still mattered in my life, was friendly to me in a way I loved and appreciated. Then, one day after a run-in at a Walgreens. She just didn't bother to talk to me.

Eventually, I came around and understood that times had changed. I wasn't completely faultless, I can understand that I can come off weird to some people. Especially since I'm open about having depression and suicidal thoughts. Something that 'normal' people don't want to hear about. Yet, if I simply don't talk about it, how will I ever get it I out?

So, we drifted apart. I noticed that she got a boyfriend. Was becoming closer with another girl I had become friends with. Who also cut me off. She just moved on, like I never really was there, and so did I. Until one day, when I was forced to bump into her multiple times.

I thought that if this day was to come. I'd ask her the hard question of why? Why did she simply all of a sudden just cut me off? And yet, I couldn't do it. I knew that deep down I didn't want to hurt her. Even though I wanted to shout in her and my other friend's face. That, they just took a chunk out of my soul that would take a while to heal.

And yet, I couldn't do it. Like the piece of filth that I am. I'm the kind of a man who would look down the eyes of a tiger if it meant keeping my fellow man or women safe. Yet, here I am, not wanting to talk to an old friend. I know she's probably just as scared of me as I am of her. Yet, it doesn't matter when it feels like I'm the only one suffering.

Why is it that I fear girls/friends more than I fear death?

This society that I live in has breed into me this notion. That I need to be a decent man. Because two wrongs don't make a right. Yet, every day that I uphold this standard. I become more hostile. I lash out at my family more. I start to form visions of killing people who claim to do harm to those I love. Yet, I would never act on these urges unless in self-defense.

Though much like the relationship between me and my former friend. What is the point where I confront them? When blood/tearshed is unavoidable? Is it when they do stuff like what I just described? Or is it when I finally break? I lose my mind and harm those I never wanted to. 

In the end, they brought it on themselves. Everything in this universe has a consequence. Push something forward, and you might trip on it the next day. Add more stuff, and it becomes even more likely you'll trip. Though, is it their fault that they tripped and that I harmed them?

Or is it my fault for even existing?

I don't know. And I guess I'll never find out. Because no one wants to talk about it. Especially not my friend.",2022-12-16 10:10:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603661368,3,/r/lonely/comments/znbbav/friendships_gone/,,0,1,Friendships Gone

I'm an introvert, I'm broke and I don't drink (alcohol is triggering me because my mom has a very heavy alcohol addiction) or go to clubs or party's.

Howdy everyone! I’m back looking for some more people to talk to, and hopefully to vibe with and i can find more long term friends. 

So a little bit about me:

I’m a pretty chill guy, i love to joke around, send gifs and memes, I’d like to think I’m a pretty caring person as well. I’m a good listener and I can hold (_cough cough_  hold not carry _cough cough_ wooo it’s kinda dusty in here 😂) a decent conversation. I’d also say I’m pretty loyal when it comes to my friends, and I try to be supportive of them too. This is a positive space ✨✨ so please keep it that way when you reach out. 

I love playing chess! And board games in general. I also love playing card games too whenever i have people to play with.

I love watching anime! I am a huge anime/manga fan, and I have a boatload 🛥️ of shows that i have watched. The ones I’m currently keeping up with are Bleach, My hero academia, Spy x Family, One Piece, and Demon Slayer. I also watch a lot of Netflix too, and I’m very excited about the new season of Alice in Borderlands 🤗! December 22 woohooo 🎊🎊. 

I love listening to music, i listen to a little bit of everything. It mostly depends on the song itself for me. But I have a wide range of genres that I enjoy listening to. I love to sing, and I write my own poetry and songs. 

I also like to read, mostly sci-fi books but if it’s a good story i occasionally venture outside of that. I like to garden as well. And I’m currently learning French on and off. (Study buddies welcome 👀 Japanese learners DEFINITELY welcome)

The last thing I will say is that my preferred communication style is voice chatting. I just have always preferred actually being able to talk to someone, and it’s also nice to not be glued to my phone too. I’m open to just texting too but from time to time it would be nice to actually be able to talk to each other y’a know. So, if you are open to voice chats MAJOR PLUS 💯 and you should definitely reach out! Let’s talk sometime! Oh one more thing, just a general kind of consistency is kinda important to me, like we don’t have to be talking ALL the time or anything, just as long as effort is there, that’s all I’m really looking for. The goal is to hopefully build long term friendships y’a know. Anyways that’s enough otherwise this post is gonna turn into a book 💀. 

I hope you enjoyed reading my post, and I look forward to meeting y’a! Talk to y’a soon! 😁👋🏽",2022-12-16 18:47:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1665413359,3,/r/lonely/comments/znlwqb/23_m_went_to_mcdonalds_but_the_mcbuddy_machine/,,0,0,"23 M Went to McDonald’s but the McBuddy machine was broken, so I came here instead.

3511,zno6ud,RunDiscombobulated67,"I recently became a student at a university college in the Netherlands, and the social part of life is really not going well. Not that my grades are good either, they aren't, but I really need to have friends. I used to hang out with some people in the first few weeks but I became very disilusioned with them as I saw they werent my kind of people, I was bored around them, and I didnt like them. And they probably could tell because they also didn't make an effort to hang out with me when I stopped talking to them. I also had a couple closer friends, but I ended up literally hating one of them after I saw she was a spoiled brat when we went to watch some movie about a guy who has a very hard life struggling with alcoholism and poverty and she literally f\*\*king says its his fault and I realize she's a huge posh douche, so I stopped hanging out with her. The other one is depressive and I think she has alcohol issues, and that relationship also fizzled out. Now I literally have no friends in this town, 0. ZERO. This has never happened to me before. And today there is this gala party to which I'm not going because I don't really feel like I would belong and, who would I go with anyway? Also I don't own formal clothes. There's too much shit going on in this college you need to be dressed formally for. So I'm obviously feeling very bad and lonely because I'm not there, even though I don't really want to, of course part of me wants to be included and be around people, even if they aren't the best fit. In 2 days I'm going back home for winter break and I'm hoping I'll get to see some old friends. Also I haven't had sex for over a year and I feel like I've forgotten how to flirt. Not that I was a sexmachine before, I've only had sex 4 times in my life and with three different people, so no relationships. And even then I think I kind of got very very lucky, I didn't really have to do much to get it, in fact it kind of took me by surprise hahaha, so I don't have like a technique or anything, since I have relied on luck for my sexual relationships I don't feel confident to try and make them happen. Should I go back home for good and enrol in college there? Sometimes I'm fine with being alone and I like it, it lets me be myself if nothing else, and it lets me sort of choose the kind of person I want to be instead of being influenced by others. But other times I feel like I really  need to talk to someone (like now).

From grade 1-8 I had dance rehersals 4 times in a week and did not care about my grades, they simply weren't my priority. My parents on the other side were top I their class and expected me to perform very well. From the pressure, the summer before 9th grade I quit dance completely to focus on my grades and final exams. From about 6th grade till now (12th grade) I felt symptoms of depression. 

When I was a shitty student I had few friends from school, but the rest of the class absolutely hated me. Then when in high school I was getting highest grades I didnt have friends, I suspect they all were jealous or smth. 

I sit in few classes with my clasmates together and they do not want to talk with me, the body language says it all, the way they respond with one or two words to my questions and tries to start a conversation. Its allways negative feedback. So consequently I feel lonely. 

I usually spend up to 20 min talking with my classmates in one school day which is very low.  I last summer parted ways with my bff and the last relationships with classmate evaporated. So I dont have anyone to socialize with.

I allways feel lonely. What should I do to get my attention away from the feeling of loneliness?",2022-12-16 22:39:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605281723,2,/r/lonely/comments/znr8p2/how_to_not_feel_lonely/,,0,2,how to not feel lonely?

Recently my dad has been diagnosed with cancer and we've been told this could possibly be his last Christmas. As a result I've told work that I won't be in until the new year because I want to spend time with family. They were okay with all of this.

Tomorrow is my work's Christmas party which I planned on going to. However, due to being off work I don't know what time it starts or where exactly it's taking place. I've messaged 3 people from work who I consider as friends and 2 of them have ignored me, leaving me on read. The other one bluntly said to ask someone else and to stop bothering them. So I guess I'm not going now.

I know this may seem minor but it's just the latest of shit that's been happening to me. I always try to be genuine towards people and kind to them, but it means nothing as I never get anything back. No one's even gotten in touch with me from work to see if I'm okay.

3581,znvpwp,premfenderz,"It ain’t fair, Chief! 

I am just realising that I have only been an errand boy. No seriously, that’s the truth. No wonder I’m feeling lonely instead of reminiscing about being loved because I’ve never been loved! 

The first one? She basically missed her friends. Missed her ”man”. So this fool comes in at the right time to be used. Under a fake “relationship”, I was just being her handyman, a driver, a person to give company, roam around, shop around. A distraction and support for a heartbroken person. Explains why she wanted me around even after “breaking up”. I still wonder if that group chat even happened lol. Not to mention how secretive it was kept and how unnatural the whole thing was. I still can’t fathom how a person can do such a thing. To fake a relationship, pretend like there was love. Only to breakup and not let go of me because she still needed the services I provided. After all, that was all I was to her. A tool. A device. Going so far as to pretend to help me through my “breakup”

The second? Wasn’t that far from the above one. Except she was honest and kept it real. Too real. Painfully real. I was just her go to guy for everything. Used me for almost everything. I don’t believe there was even any love. It was just a transaction. Except I gave my all only to get sweet sweet nothings in return. Explains how mad she got when I never did anything she asked me to do. I got so tired of being used like a driver and an errand boy. To be her counsellor. Her therapist. Her tutor. Her tech guy. Her driver. Her slave. Enough to physically hurt me and ruin my health. When I cut off my services just for a few days, she went as far as calling off the marriage. If she really loved me, she would’ve stood up for me against her mother instead of teaming up with her and use me as much as humanly possible. All while being treated by garbage. So much for being in “love”. Even that PG girl just used to me to run errands and make her job easy by using me. While pretending to have interest in me. 

WTF is it, this thing called “love”. I don’t have anything to say because I’ve never experienced it. I mean I’ve seen it portrayed in media and have read about it in other posts. I could vanish into thin air right now and people would barely notice. I’m easily replaceable. By another tool. Realising this rn is really painful for me. That guy from Reddit was spot on, I never left square one to begin with. But they’re all doing just fine. Moved on. The first even feeling pity for me along with her “bf”, the designation never assigned to me back then lol. 

My parents are the only reason I’m breathing right now. I only see misery and crippling loneliness for the rest of my life. I thought things would change. That it did. What a fucking fool right?

I long for love. To be loved. Always have. Not for what I do for the other person. But for what I am. Unconditionally by people other than my parents. People say that it just happens. But no one even approaches me or makes an eye contact with me. Even the boys around me make such contacts with zero effort. “It just happens bro”. I can’t even cry. Lost that ability since I’ve gotten so used to it lol. 

For me, love is just a myth. A fairy tale. Something I’ll never experience. Might as well accept it instead of being fooled into thinking that I’m loved and that I’m wanted by someone special. I’m not special to anyone. Never will be. I’m just a stat. A number. Disposable in an instant as demonstrated by them. 

Maybe I’ll feel love if I loved myself. Alas! I hate myself. For being a naive fool. I’m very sorry for being so hard to love.

I was popular, smart, athletic, and charismatic. It was even to a point where close acquaintances would hate me for being a better student in class and friends would end up copying my mannerism. People I didn’t know, friends of friends, almost everyone in my grade would cheer for me when I’d win awards for excellence or whatever. It felt great, and I felt loved. It’s not the same as it used to be now that I’ve accepted being reserved and enjoy my own company over others, but I was just reminded of that feeling when I stumbled across some old friends who made me out to be some sort of legend to their new friends.

3610,znyqv9,memories_torn_apart,"No matter what I do, I fall into my usual, destructive, isolating habits. When I started college this year, I thought I might be able to chip away at these, but they’ve only grown stronger. The same at every institution I’ve been in in my life. This semester has changed nothing, with no connections formed on this huge campus. I emphasize the size because there this was this ‘motivational’ poster I saw around campus that said something like “over 20,000 students attend [university] every year; don’t worry you’ll make friends”—which as time passed only made me bitter and bemused. You see, I’ve never had friends, certainly no romantic life, and I’m even icy with family—most of whom assume I’m some sort of *special*. I’ve always known I was the problem, but I started this year with the idea that a change of scenery, a blank slate, might give me a leg up. But no. I feel irreparable.

I worry it’s too late, which is ridiculous to say at 18, but I feel so uniquely cursed that maybe it’s at least true for me. I try to be polite, affable, respectable, well-groomed, and approachable—I’ve even started going to the gym (major work in progress, but we’re getting somewhere). Yet it all seems to yield to nothing. Why? Because I fuck myself over. I’m not bad at first, maybe even pleasant—but whenever conversations linger I freeze up and my brain dies. Sometimes I say something stupid. Sometimes I don’t say what I mean. Sometimes I speak out of turn. Sometimes I can’t say anything at all. Soon I become clammy and nervous and soon no one’s interested anymore—why would they be? And then I just give up and stop talking to people.

And it seems to be getting worse and worse, especially in college, because I am so unrelatable. I have as little social experience as your below-average, shy, 8-year-old—what am I doing with these 18 year olds? I was a borderline hermit in high school, but college, especially this college I lucked my way into because I’m allegedly smart, full of upper crust types who seem to have done it all. The experience gap only widens. I miss when you were a kid, and all you would have to do is walk up to another kid, and you could just chat about Pokémon, SpongeBob, or whatever stupid thoughts you had, and you would then have a playmate for recess or whatever. Things were simple then. Shame that even then I couldn’t make those friendships last. Is that when I first fucked myself up?

That’s a question I like to always ask. When did I first screw myself up? I interrogate my past long enough, and I end up somewhere around primary school. Sometimes I’m generous to myself and place it around elementary school. I wish I could identify it and then somehow travel back in time and give little me a kick in the rear. Truthfully I wish I could rewrite my past and my self entirely. I often fantasize about it. I wish I could just let it all go, and start anew as someone new, and that everyone else plays along.

That is a common thought of mine. I reread *Catcher in the Rye* (how unique, I know) this week because I was feeling angsty and blue after finals and, truthfully, Holden’s problems are very different than mine. He’s not at fault for his—sure he’s a bit rough around the edges, but he’s grief stricken and abused.  Me; I’m just a fuck-up. Not to mention, he’s got way more experience than me—friends, girls, travel, etc. But i can’t get enough of his observations—and his comments about Pencey hit home since I got to this college. However, what I like best is when he starts talking about running away. Running away from the world before it’s too late, before life catches up with him. Running away from himself. I’m annoyed the novel ends as it does, him in a psychiatric hospital—it makes sense thematically, sure, but it does me no justice. For me, Holden goes out west.  I feel cringey writing this (I promise I won’t kill John Lennon), and the book isn’t even in my top 5, but it still somehow sticks to me.

The thing is, what I’m worried about isn’t that I run away. Like Holden, I’m too much of a coward. No, what I worried about is continuing to live as I am. It’s not impossible. It’s what I’ve always done. The only thing I can somehow care about is school, and as I said I’m allegedly smart, and I don’t see that changing because I’ve got fuck all else to do. So I’ll probably graduate from here in good standing, and my degree might not be attractive (humanities major), the university name on it certainly will be. Although I probably can’t network, maybe I can turn that into a job, or go to grad or law school, or whatever. Then I’d have a career going, and I’d be okay to support myself—but then what? What’s left for me? Living like that all alone, forever, until I die? I can’t stand the thought. Yet it feels inevitable. I won’t ever do anything drastic or interesting, certainly not with anyone else, and I’ll just live quietly and bitterly with myself until I slip and fall in the shower and no one’s around to help. I don’t want to live like the Underground Man—but I feel so helpless. 

A normal person would be able to take my position and make it a dream success and happiness story, really. I don’t come from much at all, I’ll tell you that, yet (on paper) I’ve managed to achieve opportunities most people, especially from my background, don’t have. This college, especially. Truthfully, I don’t belong here. My resume sucked (I had no ECs). I think I was an affirmative action pick—which is funny because I’m (by any international standard) white. I wonder if I had a picture attached to my application they wouldn’t have been so fooled by my name. And the people here are something else…they’re all rich and/or they’re all STEM majors. I stick out like a sore thumb being neither. Not aiding is my aforementioned ineptitude. But we’ve covered this base. Point is, were I competent, I’d be happy in my circumstances.

*Hypothetical competence*: I think that’s the theme of this unhinged rant I’ll probably delete. I can’t sustain myself off fantasies of social fulfillment anymore, but I lack the ability to effectually change my reality. I feel like there’s a switch in me that’s been turned on in 95% of other people, yet I’m one of the poor bastards who’ve been left with it turned off. This is only the way I can succinctly describe my relationship to other people: complete alienation. I’m done. I’m sorry if you read this.

Have you reached a point in your life where you've realized that your negativity and depressive states drive people away from you and you're just meant to live through life alone and perpetually unhappy? How did you reach that level of acceptance without feeling the urge to just end things if this is what life will be like for you?

I'm meant to be alone, depressed and just tolerated by others who interact with me. I drive people away because I can't get with the program of just being normal and happy, regardless of circumstances. Other people have it worse and yet I continue to be pathetic in my misery. I always have a cynical and negative view on matters, especially revolving around school life, the only life I have. I have nothing outside of being a student and just recently failed a class by 1 literal point because what else is a fuck up like supposed to do? (few friends, no love prospects, anxious about rejection about rejection and failure with everything I do, I feel like my family doesn't even know who I truly am, just a possible means to an end if everything with my future career pans out if I don't fuck that up too...).

3619,znzl95,strangled_marionette,"Not having anyone close to you for support and comfort at times you're feeling vulnerable is very difficult. And it kinda makes one desperate to reach out to complete strangers.

While it could theoretically help if you just need to get things off your chest, I feel like it lacks that connection that would really make the experience fulfilling for both parties. In my case I'd often feel like there's nothing different with making a long post about it on a sub and having people comment and interact.

It makes me think if I'm being a choosy beggar sometimes. But then again not everyone is qualified to handle people's issues. And that I'm not entitled to anything and vice versa.

I've experienced venting to strangers before, and usually it's to someone whose post is *offering a ""listening ear""*. After the initial greeting and apologising for having to inconvenience said person with their time, they'd usually encourage me to start talking about what's been bothering me. 

It would usually entail me typing blocks of texts and the person would just let me keep sending messages without any interference. Then after reading my vent they'd usually say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry to hear that"" and offer a generic advice or say something positive or encouraging. Then I'd say thank you and ask if they also need to vent. Either they would say no and ask if they can still help with anything else (and would usually say goodluck to me and conclude the convo).

But for some reason this kind of short-lived abrupt ending seems just so cold and transactional to me; even if technically that's what they offered in the beginning.

I think it's just that sometimes, more than being able to express myself, what I actually need is a deeper comfort from someone I know who genuinely understands me / what I've been through or atleast knowing this other person cares about me enough that their ""presence"" alone is comforting enough. And that their encouragement is something I can actually take to heart and trust. 

And it's definitely unfair and unrealistic to seek all these from a random stranger simply ""offering"" and expect anything more than a generic encouragement. Hence I feel like the exchange is futile. 

In some cases some say they'd like to keep talking. 

Here is where it comes a little uncomfortable sometimes; it's as if I owe the person something now and they'd be a little inappropriate with the next few lines of texts. And it's quite too late to realise that this person has had false intentions from the start. I'd feel almost *dirty* and unsafe since I basically just ""bared"" my soul to this person and now they're demanding something lewd in exchange for pretending to hear my sob story. That makes me feel pathetic.

3633,zo10op,fyrixias,"I mean, look at me, all I've ever been good at is 'paying' people. Doing nice things for them, but never getting much back in return. By getting something back, I mean, some kind of friendship. Some kind of human comfort. I'm not expecting money to come back or personal favors or some level of worship.

Just simply, warmth and comfort. But I don't get that, people are always assuming I've tacked them with a due date of everything I've done for them.

And beyond gifting people things, I really don't have much to offer. There isn't any educational knowledge to showcase, that tells anybody I'm smart. I'm not into a lot of hobbies to where I can be approachable to engage with in them. I've got no interesting backstories, most of the stories I tell, are just the times I've been fucked over and any gains I've got were piss squirts that amount to nothing.

I'm just not an interesting person. I've just been brought here, through fucking wedlock, with no plans or an idea of how to get my life into that second gear to where it is worth living. All I've got is misery, shortcomings, setbacks, weight on my shoulders, unhealthy habits and a fuck ton of other things. Nothing in my life is a walk in the park.

3647,zo3oim,ThaRealDoetsch,"My entire life I have never felt wanted or seen by others. I try so hard to be a good kind person but it looks like most people seem to thrive on putting me down. 

I am autistic and have never truly fit in somewhere. I have always been an outcast and somehow people noticed this. I have suffered abuse all throughout my childhood, and this has severely fucked up my trust in others and probably a lot of other stuff as well.
I thought that after the fresh hell that was high school, that college would be better. It seemed to be going that way, but sadly it didn't last. I thought I had made a best friend there, only to get horribly abandoned when I was feeling suicidal.
After that the pandemic hit and I spend those three years completely isolated and forgotten from the rest of the world.

And just this summer I moved to a new place and thought I was making some new friends, only to realise that nobody has any interest in being my friend. Nobody ever wants to hang out with me, messages me or whatever people do when they are together. 

And it's like I haven't tried. I have tried for so long and so hard. I always do my best to be as kind and helpful to people as possible. I'm actually pretty good at having a bit of shallow contact, but I never seem to be able to form a deeper connection with someone to where they would invite me or even just message me.

And lately it's also been eating at my soul that I have never had a romantic relationship with someone. Especially with this time of year and literally everything (songs, ads, people) in real life reminding me that this is something that most people experience. But I have never had anyone even show a bit of interest to me. Either they pity me or are disgusted by me

It's just really hard to keep on living like this. I don't believe that anyone is capable of loving me. It just feels like I have passed a line of being so fucked up, that there's no saving me. Even though the thing I would love most, is for someone irl to just hold me and tell me that they see me and want me.",2022-12-17 10:39:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1461692692,1,/r/lonely/comments/zo3oim/just_venting_about_my_life_i_guess/,,0,3,Just venting about my life I guess

It’s going to be the best meditation practice to connect with yourself on a deeper level. To invite amazing opportunities in the New Year 2023.

It’s time to give yourself some grace.

To be kind to yourself too.

To honor yourself more. Without the need for any external confirmation.

It’s time to release the burden you carried for so long.

And this practice is going to help you a ton!

Close this year by building more inner trust. I combine a powerful self-help exercise with the even if manifestation method I just released. Let’s get into it. 

Write a letter to yourself. Do it today, now if you can.  
Take a few deep breaths before writing it down.

This is how to do it. For the purpose of this example, I will use the name Jess.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Jess,

It has been a rough year for you, you struggle a lot trying to make things happen. You felt down many times, sad, even lost hope… But here you are, standing. Here you are Jess, pushing forward wiser, smarter, and a bit more confident.

Jess, you’re building your life up and you know you are closer than ever to achieving your goals, to live life as you want.

Even if it was such a difficult year, that maybe brought you to your knees from time to time, and never admit it to anyone, it’s time to be proud of yourself Jess, you made it through!

Jess, you are getting better and better with every day that passes by, regardless of the challenges you had to face sometimes.  
Jess you deserve all the good things coming your way. Embrace the amazing new year with an open heart.

Even if it was difficult before, it doesn’t have to be anymore.  
Jess, you know that new amazing opportunities are ahead, ready to happen for you. And you know it deeply, because this was always your choice, to live life on your terms.  
You know this is going to happen because the Infinite Intelligence within you, the Univers, God is supporting you always.

Dear Jess, you’ve been amazing all the way through. Congrats! You deserve it. Let’s make it the best year ever together!  
I thank myself for another amazing year! 

And thank you Life, with all that is!

&amp;#x200B;

3678,zo7c8d,Mister_unfortunate03,"These days, loneliness is one of the few things I can think of. I go through my day to work at a warehouse and then come home, get high, and just play video games to end the night. It feels like this is it. I don't have many friends, and even if I did, I don't think I'd want to go out with them. I'm hitting that point of loneliness that after waiting so long, I only want to be alone nowadays. Somebody will invite me out and I'll just tell them no, regardless of whether I think it'll help out. I'm not very sexually active, unless you rule in the occasional masturbation. What I wouldn't give to just be chilling on the sand with friends and just fucking around on a boardwalk in the evening. Who knows if that dream will come true, cause it doesn't quite seem like life is heading that way.",2022-12-17 14:24:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671259345,1,/r/lonely/comments/zo7c8d/loneliness_isnt_a_treat/,,0,0,Loneliness isn't a treat.

I even tried the senior citizen centre, but I live in a very small town and there are only a few people who go and they are in their eighties. It was depressing me more than helping me. So here I sit. It does get harder every year. Christmas is on a Sunday this year, my worst day of the week. Weekends are hardest, but Sundays are the torture day for me.

I thought being in a relationship might help. It didn't, after 4 months together my crippling depression and loneliness is no match for the love received in a relationship. 

My boyfriend is a social person with lots of friends. I am the opposite, I have no one. It's hard to feel like it's valid to feel like this since he has every right to hangout with his friends instead of me and I don't want him to feel like I'm restricting him. It just hurts when I have no one to turn to when he's gone, when he can fill the void with 20 people when I'm gone. 

I don't think I'll tell him it gets so bad I hurt myself then he'd for sure feel guilty. It's all my fault, can't find friends, too mentally ill to be functional, I should just do him the favour and BAM! Who'd miss me?

He’s the type of guy that everyone loves because he comes off as the sweetest person to others but I have been the brunt of his cruelty for the last 2 years.

Because of this, it's very hard for me to initiate the conversation first with someone, as Idk what to say and always think like ""Wait, what am I supposed to say now, lol?"".

English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has the same gender and perhaps something in common.

With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ This platform sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-17 16:52:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,1,/r/lonely/comments/zoai7p/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,2,18M Hi everyone!

I am struggling with dealing with being alone. The entire week I work remotely from home and I just sit in my room the entire day. When it comes to weekends most of my friends are with their partners and don't really have the opportunity to go out.  I also feel awkward third wheeling them and their partners. Everyone is not on their phone during the week due to work and on weekends they all busy doing something. I tend to just sit every single day in my bedroom not doing anything and not seeing anyone. I've tried hobbies and distractions using media but it doesn't help with the feeling of being alone. This has been making me really depressed. I tried dating apps to meet people but it usually doesn't result in anything in my case. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with loneliness and just being alone most of the time?

3717,zocmwc,Born-Ad6641,"Left my hometown and moved to another country for change, to find new friends, maybe a partner, for better job opportunities. My hometown was depressing me, people there, my closest friends (at least I tought they were), were living like they are as twice as old. After I moved, first few months were ok. I found a job fairly easy, met a lot of people (also through work, as we were around same age mostly), found new people to hang out with and generally had a good time. Then that cool people I met happened to move away back home (like it goes in bigger cities, people come and go all the time). After 6 months from the date that I moved, everything went downwards for me. People from my hometown that I grew up with and knew more than half of my life slowly stopped contacting me. I didn't speak to a person that I considered ""best friend"" in 2 months. Can that be considered a friend?? Other ""best friend ever"", just never has any interest to contact me or speak to me. Every time we text it's on my initiative, and I always get a feeling that he just wants to break the conversation asap, replying 'hahahaha' and that's all. They just don't care about me, they never ask how am I doing, etc. Other person that I thought I was close with doesn't even open message for a few weeks. Can it be considered like I'm chasing them while they couldn't care less and forgot me after just a few months? How is it even possible that 10+ (even 15) year friendship that I considered close and meaningful fall apart so quickly? Some of them were also saying stupid pathetic shit before I left like ""yeaaa , we'll always be friends, nothing will change"" only to forget me that quick. Can it be considered friendship or we were just hanging out because there weren't better options?

Meanwhile, I quit a job in the new city because workplace started to become toxic and I felt bullied by certain coworkers. Now I live with a friend that I met also like 13 years ago, but she has her own life and we rarely manage to hang out in a meaningful way. I met a few people here, but I just can't connect with them in a meaningful way, like I had, for example, in my hometown. Or maybe it's due to language barrier, however, I feel alone in the world. Even though this new city is bigger than my hometown, it's boring. Not lot of ""party places"" that I'd like to visit. I'm younger than 30 and most of the time I'm just sitting at home watching Netflix like I'm in my 60s. Ocasionally I see videos from my hometown on Youtube and see people (and my ""best friends"") are doing pretty well there, their lives seem much more fulifiling than mine. Also, their parties and concerts seem pretty wild and fun, while here, concerts are sad, boring and depressive.

I decided to change my life for a positive, now I lost friends from hometown, and gained nothing in the new city. All days I'm alone, can't find a job and meaningful relationships, not even one friend that I'd like and that I'd feel a conection with or trust then and have a good time without much effort (like I had with those people in hometown) How bad is that? Also, would you consider that people friends or no? I could never imagine this would happen, since I considered them like a family. Now I can't go back or find happiness here, lol.",2022-12-17 18:29:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642446700,4,/r/lonely/comments/zocmwc/being_lonely_and_bored_sucks/,,0,4,being lonely and bored sucks

I’m 19, in college, decently good looking (according to others), yet I’ve never been in a relationship. Never really even come close. Still a virgin. Nobody ever took interest in me until September of this year, and suddenly, I have like a dozen girls into me but they’re all 50+ pounds overweight or otherwise very unappealing to me. I was talking to one girl I actually liked in October, things were going well, and then she randomly broke things off cause she “didn’t feel a connection” and was dating someone else within a week. A girl I liked after that, isn’t into dudes but we’re friends now. Another girl I liked rejected me in November. A girl I was talking to early this month stood me up 3 times and then ghosted. The girl I liked up until today, I found out has a girlfriend. I don’t understand, relationships aren’t this difficult to come by for anyone else I’ve talked to besides legitimate Incels and repulsive people and dudes with autism. I put so much effort into improving myself, brought myself from a suicidal 115 pound, 5’10 pasty kid with a bowl cut to 145 pounds, muscular, knows how to dress, knows how to talk to people, has a hairstyle that suits me, and it makes no difference. All the girls who like me are for lack of a better term, just really unattractive and on the odd chance a good looking girl does like me, she has like the shittiest personality ever. And if a girl seems literally perfect, she’s not into dudes 🥲 

This really hurts as I’ve wanted a girlfriend since I was like 6, and at 19, I don’t even know what it feels like to hold hands with or kiss a girl. At online dating, I have worse luck than anyone else I’ve talked to besides guys who put no effort into their appearance whatsoever. My matches usually don’t respond and if they do, it’s with the driest answers possible, clearly indicating they’re not interested. I told one of my matches (who imo was below me in attractiveness and ability to converse over text) that she was the only match of mine to talk to me as long as she did and she said “that’s sad”, and that she hooked up with 4 different guys within a month of downloading the app. The odds are so stacked, what the fuck, it should not be this difficult.",2022-12-17 19:13:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1657316414,5,/r/lonely/comments/zodnnk/i_wanna_give_up/,,0,2,I wanna give up

Myself as an example, I had good friends, lost some and then had some me new again. Why? Because God of luck gave me the opportunity to find people who accept me. While having good ( male ) friends, I never had romantic relationship, I tried and tried to be more social, to approach first and the result is nothing. Never even had a date.

3755,zohshs,g6bbs,"Sorry, this is gonna be long.
For extra context, I’m a 16 year old girl. 

I honest to god have no one to talk to about any of this. I can’t imagine burdening my friends any more than I already have and I don’t think my family would be of any help. To start at the beginning, a little over two weeks ago, I tried to kill myself as a result of months of feeling self-hatred and continuous chronically low moods. That afternoon there was a ‘final straw’ and I just didn’t want to be here anymore. 

I can’t remember any specific details at all because my attempted overdose ended in me taking a painful fall, leading to a serious head injury, and ending in me experiencing very bad short-term memory loss. As well as this, It’s difficult to store memories so my last month or so is a huge blur, and I need to look at pictures to jog my memory a lot of the time. I haven’t told anyone who isn’t family because I find it so pathetic and just another thing that sets me apart from others.

On top of this, for the past couple of months I developed a pattern of eating that made me feel a lot more in control, even if it was unhealthy. The hospital required me to speak to a mental health nurse and be weighed and measured before I could be discharged. The nurse found my eating (and number on the scale) troubling and referred me to a mental health service before I could be discharged.

This is where my current issues are stemming from. I was given a meal plan in order to gain weight and my parents obviously took it seriously and I now have to eat every meal with them, which are huge portion sizes that I can’t ever finish, which results in arguing, and the entire situation has put such a huge strain on my relationships which makes me feel incredibly guilty. I felt like a burden before but never to this extent. For my parents to have to hide anything sharp enough to break skin, get rid of any painkillers or drugs that could be lethal, make sure I eat at certain times, and overall just babying me makes me feel so guilty and suffocated. As well as this, when I go back to school, I’m not allowed to do PE, I can’t walk to school and have to get taxis/ubers anytime I leave the house to avoid burning calories. I can’t think of a word to describe how I’m currently living other than suffocating. I invited my friend over yesterday and was happy while she was here but once she left I obviously couldn’t remember anything we did, and it felt pointless.

My memory loss is taking such a huge toll on my, already declining, mental health. The weight restoration and fear of my body changing is so difficult to deal with. I can’t imagine it getting better. I can’t imagine not feeling this lonely, I can’t imagine having burdening someone else with my issues, whether it be a friend or romantic partner. I just don’t know how much longer I can live in limbo and if I could actually leave my house alone I would probably just end it all. I don’t regret trying to kill myself, I just wish I was a little more careful and things wouldn’t have turned out like this.

I know this feeling won’t last forever but I don’t think I’m strong enough to get through it.

She got better only after a few months miraculously. We thought she wouldn’t regain the motor skills she lost but she did. She was able to drive and go back to work again.

Then I slipped. I went back to cooking food that aren’t good for her. Ignored her diet that she went back to eating processed foods regularly. Forgot to check up on her to make sure she drank her meds. Didn’t take her BP anymore. 

And so she suffered another stroke, slipped into a coma, and didn’t recover anymore. 

And I blame myself everyday. It’s been four months and I still call for her to forgive me and to take me with her. I have to pay for what I did. 

Every day, I pray to suffer the way she did and die too.

I am sorry, mommy. I would go back in time if I could and take care of you better.

As much as I’ve progressed trying to be more outgoing and friendly it seems that the only thing you can do is just wait and sit around for things to randomly happen.

Wait for opportunities, chat people up when you can, but there’s nothing you can do proactively to easily make new friends, no easy “do this to meet new people”. You’re just stuck in the same river and the best you can do is steer slightly to one side or the other.

I’m a bit disappointed because while appreciate that it looks like I’ll make friends - I was hoping not to simply have friends but to be able to make friends. That way something like moving wouldn’t completely screw me over.

3793,zolumv,aThiefStealingTime,"I hope that maybe writing this out lessens the hurt.

Before I drank too much and spiraled out and nearly ended my life, a friend at work mentioned something about how she really didn't like ""idle socializing"" at bars which really seared itself into my brain. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I've been idling for years, to weather a mentally abusive marriage that recently ended in a brutal divorce at least on my end. Before that just to get through each day as I struggled to get through school as I was the first one to make it that far in my family. Before that to try and cope with the horrible home and family life I came out of. I've let friendships lapse and haven't built any that AREN'T founded on idling. And I was sleepwalking through life not improving myself, not working on skills, just desperate for ways to stave off the sadness and lurking worry. This realization has been pretty difficult to cope with considering what's happened to me over the last year.

Now I'm 40. I have a five year old son whose mother took him across state lines and functionally bankrupted me as her parents are wealthy and bankrolled the process. While I'm pretty lucky and had a lot of evidence to counter what she said, I just didn't have the funds to keep going so I eventually took a deal out of desperation. My dad passed away a few weeks ago, and I managed to help my mom weather the financial train wreck that the cancer had helped create. They live in the same state as my son, Florida, which I grew up in and hate but am planning on moving back to despite the history once I can financially stabilize. They were the black sheep of their family I guess, I don't really know any of my family besides them. I have a sister but she is a terrible person and leeches off my mom who is on social security. It's overwhelming at the best of times.

I feel so utterly alone. Being separated from my son makes it hurt so much worse, just a gnawing 24/7 pit inside me that never relents. I need to retrain myself to socialize actively, I need people, I need some kind of support, some kind of deeper connection. I'd give anything to have someone here to just sit around and talk to. I think something as simple as a hug would make me burst into tears. 

So Friday night I go to the work Christmas party, I drink way too much and black out. I called a Lyft to go home so I guess I knew how drunk I was getting so at least I didn't do anything socially stupid, I hope. I have a lot of social anxiety so I tend to overdo it with alcohol in a typically futile effort to ease that, I've given up drinking entirely before several times because of this. So I walk all the way back to the office where my car was and drive home. I hit a curb and blew out two tires, somehow managing to get to my house without destroying the wheels or worse. I could have died or worse, hurt someone else. I can't ever drink again. Ever. For any reason. But I'm not just medicating with that, it's also video games, or TV, anything where I can force my brain to shut off and take a break. 

I would give anything to not be alone right now. I've got to center myself. I've got to somehow correct all this, and cope, and find some sort of way forward for my son's sake.",2022-12-18 01:01:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668772009,3,/r/lonely/comments/zolumv/after_an_awful_friday_night_it_really_set_in_how/,,0,1,"After an awful Friday night, it really set in how alone I am"

3797,zomd9h,disastrous_bagel,"I'm guessing it sounds weird from the title, but all I've ever wanted was to become my favorite character / characters. I hyper obsess with characters to the point where I'll take in they're own qualities and traits.

I don't exactly enjoy that because my interests change over time and if I'm at a point in my life where nothing is peaking my interest or there isn't a character I'm fixated on, I don't know who I am. My whole life I've defined myself as other people, characters, and what people want me to be. I don't feel like I have a personality, just pieces of other's personalities.

Therefore, this brings me to my point, I want to be specific characters and sometimes, even real people.

I wish I knew who I really was. 

Cosplaying characters or becoming friends with someone doesn't cut it for me. I need to BE them. I relate to them, so I find comfort in them but then when I find comfort, I want to BE them. 

It probably sounds weird or stupid, but I've literally cried over the fact that I will always be, well, me. I will never be that character. I can copy their hairstyle, their jokes, their clothes, their interests, literally anything, and it STILL won't be enough. 

It's unhealthy, I know, but I can't help it.

I can't help but feel like I'm trapped in this little body, with myself. I don't FEEL like myself. I sometimes even refer to myself as ""we"" as if there's multiple of me in my head. I know there isn't. I've talked my therapist about BPD and DID, I don't fit the criteria. I fit the criteria of ASD, but I'm not sure if stuff like that is common. Either way, I just wish I knew WHY I can't help but want to be characters, it's just something I've always done, even as a little kid.",2022-12-18 01:25:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671323961,1,/r/lonely/comments/zomd9h/i_want_to_be_a_specific_fictional_character/,,0,6,I want to be a specific fictional character

3805,zonikc,[deleted],"Was looking at pictures from my younger years and my parents look way younger and healthier. I never thought much about them getting older because they both always seemed mentally strong and put together. My mom always looked really young and my dad was always really strong and able-bodied. My parents were both tough and strong-willed people. 

But then when they turned 60, they just started aging rapidly. They've become considerably slower mentally. They don't have the same ""fight"" in them that they once did. My mom was always really good with giving me life advice and telling me what to do in certain situations, but now it's just a very somber ""I dunno"" if I go to her for something. They've developed more senile personalities, every time I visit I can tell they just look so much older. Even their driving abilities are much worse...both my mom and my dad used to be such good drivers, super intuitive with traffic and never afraid to hit the gas...but now they've become really sloppy and react to things way slower. It was like as soon as they hit 60, everything changed. 

I don't know what I'll do when they're gone. I fear that I'll truly be alone without that one support system. And also I fear that they're never going to see me succeed in life and I'll never make them proud. I often regret the trouble I gave my parents growing up and even when I entered adulthood.

3806,zonmmo,BigFroyo1,"hey whoever's reading,

i'm about to graduate college this spring (22 m) and i've developed this overwhelming sense of loneliness since the end of summer. for the first time over that break, i hardly saw my closest high school friends (or most of the people i used to kick it with way back), and i guess it hit me that our lives have diverged. they were the only people i considered my true friends and i genuinely thought they'd never become such a small part of my life. 

i'm in a fraternity in college, and initially i really believed i'd make my closest friends through it, but that hasn't turned out to be the case. it's not my entire identity by any means and i've made a bunch of friends, but i literally haven't **truly** clicked with anyone. this past quarter i was really swamped and didn't have much time to go out or see friends, but it doesn't feel like it mattered at all because nobody reached out anyways. sometimes i think it's just on me for being so resistive of social media and so ""out of sight out of mind."" but recently it just feels like no one cares that deeply about me -- like no one ever thinks/wants to include me.

the shittiest part is that i know i have most things going for me, but somehow i can't manage to make any meaningful, lasting connections. i think i'm pretty introspective and self-aware, and it's so frustrating to feel like i'm mindlessly doing something that pushes everyone away.",2022-12-18 02:28:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1562914729,5,/r/lonely/comments/zonmmo/no_one_ever_sticks_around/,,0,3,No one ever sticks around

A few nights ago I, in my incredibly finite wisdom, decided to look up my old high school friends to see how they're doing. One girl I had a crush on back then is now married, and has been since the beginning of covid. I didn't talk to her much -- not at all actually -- yet for some reason that really hit me hard. 



My closest friend from back then is now married with two kids. Another one has kids -- we're not even 30 yet. I guess now I have to ask the question of ""what the fuck is wrong with **me**"" if I went on my first ever date at 20-fucking 5. The girl I went on those two dates with, by the way? Yeah she ghosted me because I didn't kiss her on the second date... After she told me she wanted to be the one to set the pace in a relationship. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. 




I guess I just have to come to terms with something I've been trying to convince myself of for years now : Maybe some people are just meant to be alone.

3811,zoo94w,SnooSeagulls8028,"I don’t have any friends. Just work acquaintances. They all seem to be on Snapchat and will snap each other (or whatever it’s called). Or at least view each other stories. 

Is it the quick easy fix? Like a coworker I’m friendly with has my number but we only really send song links to each other and dont actually talk on there. (It’s fighting tooth and nail to get him to have a convo on there) But he’s asked me to make a snap a few times before so he can start streaks with me. 

Like he wont text but he wants my snap? I honestly feel like I’d get much more out of him on there (snap).
 
I feel like there’s something about snap that just makes it easier to send meaningless things to each other. Which I guess can make you seem  less lonely but it’s kind of fake (IMO).

For example him and another coworker are each other bestfriends on snap but they don’t even hang out outside of work and the other didn’t go to the others wedding. It’s like fake to me.

Social media makes it easier to connect with others without it being as intimate/meaningful? Idk.

Whats your opinion on this whole thing? I might get snap and report back on how that went, even if it’s just a bandaid on my loneliness.",2022-12-18 03:00:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595986699,2,/r/lonely/comments/zoo94w/for_millennials_and_younger_has_snapchat_or_other/,,0,6,For millennials and younger has Snapchat or other social media made you less lonely?

3830,zopuqv,[deleted],"I’ll try my best to explain, but I doubt I’ll be able to do justice to the thoughts that are in my head every day or my experience. For context, I’m realistically a relatively average college student (M19). My grades are ok. Physically, I’m ok. I don’t really have mental breakdowns,
and I’m ok at talking to people. I’m, like, the most average white dude in existence.

Except, I’m not average. I don’t know how to explain this, but I feel very, very different compared to everyone else. I haven’t had a real IRL friend for over two years, maybe longer. I don’t use things like Snapchat that everyone else on campus seems to love to communicate with others. Other people have had the best freshman semester of their lives, making friends and trying new things. Meanwhile, I’ve had the most boring semester that had been a complete reflection of how much of an ALIEN I am, as if I don’t belong. I got assigned a roommate that’s not interested in talking to me, and didn’t have any people in any of my classes who I would talk to.

I don’t go to sleep anymore without a session of just me degrading myself by reminding myself that I don’t deserve to have friends, that I’ll always be alone, that I AM alone. I can’t go on like this. I need to make sure next semester isn’t like this, but I don’t know how…it seems like everyone is a part of a social ecosystem that I have no business being near. I’m surprised that my grades were as high as they were with literally zero motivation all semester except “i like the weekend. no classes. cool.” I didn’t have anything socially to look forward to.

I don’t know. I don’t believe in myself. I don’t feel like I deserve that faith in myself. I feel like an alien observer who can watch everything that goes on on campus, but I can never REALLY be a part of anything. Literally the most psychopathic people who end up becoming rapists can easily make friends, but nobody will ever care about me outside of my family.

3848,zorhgt,eh-everythingsuccs-,"As of late I've (F18) found myself feeling frustrated with how much I feel deprived of love. I've accepted the fact that I might not be conventionally attractive and that attractiveness is subjective for everyone. Besides that I found myself ""angry"" at how I can't really let myself experience a relationship if given the opportunity. The reason is because of my sexuality, and on top of that my immediate family wouldn't be very supportive. (Heavy emphasis on mom.) Anyway I've been feeling down since it's like I can't love someone because it's just too risky and dangerous, especially since I'lll be entering college in the fall. It's too risky because my living situation can drastically change because I love a woman. I've always been jokingly ""bitter"" towards couples but lately I've grown to became a little jealous of my friends who are able to experience relationships considering how all of my friends have supportive parents. (Majority of my friends are part of the LGBTQ+) I'm not really dwelling on the fact that no one likes me in a romantic sense, but more so how I probably can't get the chance to experience a type of love because of my circumstances. I've been crying about it a little bit these past days, but it just really hurts I guess. I don't know why these feelings suddenly rose but I hope they pass soon. I know some people might say it's okay to be in a relationship as long as I hide it, but hiding it is honestly draining at times and in the past with my first relationship it was just too much. I just hope to love someone without worrying about my wellbeing, and it's kind of the reason why I'm trying to convince myself to focus on dating when I'm able to fully support myself. Yet, part of me still wants to experience love at where I am right now.

3852,zorqdx,Cyborg_0,"my personality is flawed, either a nice guy or an asshole, i have no hobbies, for past few days been trying my hardest to find some. 

no one likes or loves me i feel like.

im in college, 21, first year, 2 students with me in dormitory, they always joke with each other but never with me, always me asking questions and stuff. 

 im probably not witty or anything, mind always clouded by negative thoughts which im trying to fix. and change my life. trying to do different things everyday (exercise, mediation, studying) always the same though but those are good for me.

its so hard to find things to do everyday. especially when i live in a small town for 3 days a week, 5 days in a big city that i dont know. glad to experience a new city though. 

been trying to talk to more people, but i dont know what to talk about, i overthink a ton, i feel like i have nothing interesting to say, in social apps my texts are always left on seen, im the one texting always

i know i need to stop seeking approval of others and thats by finding something that makes me happy

the only thing i look forward too is porn which is kinda sad and pathetic, i even hate looking at it, every week i been looking at it less and less. 

i need to find something that makes me happy thats not people or porn. 

my goal is to do well at college but thats a boring goal, im in IT i like it but not passionate about it. 

the other goal is to finish reading ""feeling good"" but haven't for one month even though the author said it takes one month. 

i know its all about small steps towards my goals but i want other goals but i don't know how to find them, or finding my purpose. 

i would like to learn cooking, learn martial arts, swim, skydive, ride a motorcycle, buy a telescope, play soccer, do some acting, learn an instrument but all of those aren't possible because in where i live and the budget i have, there arent even therapists in where i live, we dont have bank accounts to even do online therapy

i might have a good personality underneath all this overwhelming thoughts

but any time i get rejected i feel like i have a boring personality and that no one likes me or loves me. 

from all these old posts i have saved a lot of advice and try to look at it every day, but im tired of looking at so much advice i just want to take some action, and not make self improvement all about being miserable but actually kinda fun.",2022-12-18 06:12:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641988785,1,/r/lonely/comments/zorqdx/how_do_i_stop_caring_so_much_about_others/,,0,0,How do i stop caring so much about others approval or worry about getting attention? how to find Goals??

3855,zors7j,Few_Ad_2989,"Its 2 am for me rn and I'm probably at the lowest point in my life mentally. I have no intentions of harming myself or pushing my loved ones away from me but I just feel so alone. 

I'm not gonna hold anything back when I say this, I'm a 21 M who's never been in a serious relationship, I've never been on a date, I've never had anyone tell me they love me (besides family), I've never had sex with anyone, and hell I've never even had my first kiss (total virgin, I know but right now I don't give a shit). My real dad enjoys drinking more than spending time with me, my step dad only sees me as a tool for manual labor and barely says anything nice to me unless he's drunk but that's not good enough, I have my mom and older brother who love me and I love them but one thing I so desperately want in life is to find someone who I can love, someone who can hold me and comfort me and love me and tell me that everything is going to be okay.

Right now I feel so fucking broken because I'm thinking about a girl that I was really close friends with for years and had strong feelings for, I've never felt this way towards any other girl and it was so real that I knew it was love. I wanted to spend my life with this girl because she made me so happy whenever she laughed at one of my jokes, gave me one of her beautiful smiles and I felt like she saw me for me instead of just what's on the outside, I loved this girl but I know that now all I ever was to her was just some tool to make herself feel better. I was her best friend for years, she would date guys and tell me all about them yet every time she did it was like I was getting punched in the stomach, this would happen over and over again with her getting into a relationship, telling me all about it, then the guy does something to break her heart, she cries to me about it then before I could even say a word about maybe giving me a shot, she was already with another guy. That's how it went for the first few years, about halfway through our friendship she was finally single long enough for me to tell her that I had feelings for her... yet this didn't change anything as she still dated other guys and told me about them, what did change though were the emotional punches to the stomach got so much worse. Then near the end of our relationship, she finally seemed to be hooked up with a guy who she liked, he was a pretty heavy Christian too and she liked him so much that she even converted to his religion, this is when I decided to stop putting myself through the emotional torture and just give up so I told this girl that I needed a break from her and she seemed to understand at first, that was until her relationship got rocky and she could message me saying that she was 'probably' single now. THIS HAPPENED THREE FUCKING TIMES! WITH ME TRYING TO PULL MYSELF AWAY FROM ALL THIS SHIT, ONLY TO BE BROUGHT BACK IN BY HER USING THREE SIMPLE WORDS!

'I'm single now'

I never asked much from her yet she couldn't even grant me some space away from her, and of course me being love stricken me hoping that maybe just maybe I could finally have my chance, I hopped back onto the Rollercoaster. It was just me getting hurt again, and again, until finally the third time when her and her Christian boyfriend officially broke up BECAUSE SHE KISSED ANOTHER GUY, I felt like my chance had maybe finally arrived... yet I had been hurt so many times by this girl and it was so bad that I knew for a fact that even if I did get with her then I wouldn't be able to trust her at all. She bawled to me about how sad and alone  she was and how she hasn't been single since junior high, she was telling this to me of all people the guy who's never experienced ANY OF IT, I swear I was ready to loose my shit at her because I should have been the very last person for her to get involved in her relationship problems. We even had a moment of deep talk when I asked her if I even had a shot, I remember how difficult it was for me to hold it all together because the emotions for me were so real, and yet she couldn't even grant me that answer as all I got from her was

'When we first met I had a crush on you'

THIS WAS YEARS AGO AND SHE WAS DATING ANOTHER GUY AT THE TIME!!! If there is one thing that I will never ever do, it's steal a guys girlfriend because that's just fucking low in my opinion and I refuse to go that low. Anyway, she decided to invite me out somewhere and from what it sounded like it was just going to be the two of us so I was pretty excited, it seemed like I was finally gonna get my chance, but when I asked more about it she explained that her and a couple of her friends along with her brother were gonna have some fun at a bar and the only reason she asked me to come along was because we haven't chatted in a while and she wanted to catch up. I finally had enough, I was pushed to my breaking point so I simply told her over text that I wasn't gonna hang out with her and I think it would be best if we don't hang out permanently, I even gave her an hour or two to respond which was something she didn't deserve yet she didn't even respond to me then so I just blocked her on everything.

It was finally over, I finally hopped off the rollercoaster and ended it my way... but even though it's done I'm still dealing with the shit. It's gotten hard to sleep at night because she is on my mind, always wondering 'what if I did this' or 'Maybe I should have done that' and what bugs me the most is never getting an actual answer if I ever had a shot or not, but I think I realize now that I never really did have a shot. I loved this girl so much and all she did was use me, looking back at all this now I bet I must look like a real simp but I promise that no money was spent on her, just a lot of time that I wish I had back. I went through a lot of shit in my life, the biggest one being my parents divorce, and this girl just made me so happy that I never wanted to let go of the feelings I had for her yet she used my feelings like ammunition to load a gun. All I ever wanted was to love her and make her happy, yet she managed to use that against me and it really fucking sucked, I'm trying to move on and find something better but she still lurks in the back of my mind. 

One dream that I always had was to one day get married and have a few kids, I'd like to have two because my older brother is a big part of my life and I'd like to pass that special bond on, but the big reason being is that I want to end this vicious cycle that all the fathers have on my dad's side where they just become alcoholics and neglect their children, it's so bad that I've made it one of my sole purposes in life. It was so strong that even just a moment ago I had a dream where I was sitting in the living room in my nice home on Christmas morning, I had a beautiful wife with her arms wrapped around mine and our two kids were sitting on the floor opening gifts, I believe it was one girl named Ellie and one boy named Thomas, and they were the most beautiful things I had ever seen because I knew they were my own blood, it was so fucking beautiful... but then I woke up and when I realized that it was all a dream, I broke down crying clutching onto my pillow like it was Ellie or Thomas, telling them over and over again how much I loved them and how much they mean to me, it really fucking sucked and now it's hard to fall back asleep. I made a promise to myself that one day I will find someone special, I will marry them and have two kids with them, a girl named Ellie and a boy named Thomas, and I will love them all forever... but in the world we live in today it's hard to find someone who wants a life like that, it seems like all people are looking for these days are hookups but I don't want that, I want something real so fucking bad.

Anyway, I'm feeling better now I got all that off my chest, I'm sorry it's so long but that's pretty much everything that's on my mind right now, also I apologize if I killed the festive mood since Christmas is coming up but remember this, even though you may feel alone there is always someone out there who's gonna love you for who you are.",2022-12-18 06:15:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602159724,10,/r/lonely/comments/zors7j/i_just_want_to_experience_it/,,0,4,I just want to experience it

Feeling a lack of fulfillment no matter what career options I pursue compiled on top of lack of finding meaningful relationships hurts. It doesn't even hurt anymore, actually. It's more like my brain tells me ""You knew this was going to happen and you're an idiot for trying.""

I know someone's going to say ""it will pass"", but I've been not just waiting for it to pass, but putting rigorous efforts to make things better for the past 12 years and I'm still stuck in this loop.

3861,zos886,gobigmimis,"It's been just 10 years now since I've (23 m) had him. Since he first entered my mind. He's not even original. He's a character of not just one but multiple people's imaginations. He was meant to be a sexual awakening that ended up becoming a coping mechanism. 
He replaced my God. After my mother abandoned me emotionally after finding out about my actions with older men at the tender age of 13, she rightfully berated and insulted me. I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted someone to love me. 
I was so depressed and alone, and he helped me through all of it. He held me at night, he kept me warm in the cold winters (I've come to learn physical touch in part of my love language), and he was always there to hold my hand and be my shoulder to cry on.
When I was younger, there were days I would get home from school early qnd be home alone. I used that time to go on mini dates with my now imaginary fiance (at this point we're basically married). It as nice. I felt safe and relaxed with him. I felt attended to and cared for. He loved being next to me and accepted me for who I am and what I felt I needed to do.
He wanted me to find a real relationship. He wanted me to find love in this life.
I wanted to too. I tried so hard to follow his request. I did everything I thought I could to make his dream come true but I keep doing something wrong. I want to know what and I ask but I don't what it is and they won't tell me even if I beg.
I know I'm mentally ill; that's a given. I know there's so many things wrong with me, but I don't know what's the most off putting. I'm stupid, and I'm crazy, but I'm not delusional as much as I wish I was. 
I want to see him, I want to hear him, I want to taste him, and I want to feel him. I want to give him everything for loving me. I want to show him how grateful that he was the only one that liked me enough to stay and continue seeing me. I want to show him that he is all that matters to me. I want to give him everything I can.
But I can't. I'm scared. I'm too scared he won't be there. I'm too scared it's going to be a consciousness in the void. I'm scared of being stuck alone in the darkness. Even in all of these years of feeling it, I should be used to it by now, but I'm not. I'm scared. And I just want a sign he'll love me when I leave, but I'm asking for a sign that doesn't exist. 
I love him, I really do, but he isn't real. I know that. I wish I didn't. I wish i did  more drugs, I with I was more dumb, I wish I was crazier. I wish I could wholeheartedly believe that this man in my mind loves me and will be there waiting for me when I'm gone. 
I've thought of 3 great scenarios:
1. Minutes before death: I hallucinate him in the last few moments of my death. I finally let go and find peace by resting in his arms.
2. Re-life: I wake up in a new scenario/new life where he ends up/is my husband but normal life applies.
3. Eternal: we live together eternally and infinitely. There is no death nor life. Just existing as us.

I apologize for any typos or miscommunication. I'm drunk and high and tired. I want someone and they're here, but they don't want me. Don't worry, I'm not going to do anything right now.

On Sunday is my usual day off, which I am allowed  even though I took 2 sick days. I felt better later on Saturday, and I  went out with a friend to feel better. I posted a picture on a common  whatsapp group of a picture of a food that I liked.... I later had a  subordinate coworker tell me ""Dude I thought you were sick, Left me and X  hanging these past couple days."" I said, ""Yes I Was, and I bought  something to eat.' He said 'I heard a few of ya'll went out.' I said 'I  bgout something to eat outside, I went to the doctor yesterday and was  excused for a few days.' And he said 'Got ya, I'm guess you're off  tomorrow as well?' I said 'i believe i am off on sundays.' He said 'Got  ya, Good to know.' I then said 'I was sick Friday and part of Saturday  and I am feeling better. I did my due diligence in letting the  appropriate people know, know. I felt better which is why I went out to get food. Do you want to see my absence note?' He said 'Lol that's cute.'  i mean i asked my other subordinate, and he said 'its ok enjoy urself.' he didn't say anything to me. i even asked both of them if they wanted me to come in tomorrow, one said no, this \*\*\* hole didn't respond",2022-12-18 06:51:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671301243,0,/r/lonely/comments/zoscb9/so_this_subordinate_of_mine_sent_some_kinda/,,0,0,So this subordinate of mine sent some kinda strange and passive aggressive messages to me about a social media post I sent when I had a day off due to sickness.

3864,zoscf2,notsomagicbus,"I've been worrying more about my life recently. I turned 18 this year and the reality of being an adult is so painful for me... especially considering the way I live. The story of how I got to this point is complicated so I won't really get into it here. But I've pretty much been living as a hermit for the past 1.5 years. My social life wasn’t exactly thriving before that but at least I had one. Now I struggle to leave the house at all. I have a visceral reaction to just seeing people my own age, or people I knew before what happened. I get so jealous of them... so angry at them for simply existing. Living their lives. And I just wish I could be one of them but I just don't feel like a can relate anymore. What happened made me feel like an animal. I don't feel like I can be a person anymore. But I try not to lose hope. It's all I have left.

I know I'm so young and I shouldn't have the mindset of, like, ""it's all over"" because I know if I don't fix this soon the regrets will just keep piling up. But I just don't know how to. I go to therapy and all that to try to keep my mental health under control. Which, even then, it really is just under control. As in I'm not really functioning but I'm not freaking out enough to get the cops called on me or put in the loony bin, either. I'm just getting through the day. People stress me out and bring up a lot of negative emotions for me... but at the same time I feel so lonely and I wish I could make friends like I used to. And I want someone to love me and care about me but it's so hard to imagine anyone doing that with how I am now. I'm not even that sure about what I'm supposed to have experienced by my age and how many people will be put off by my lack of those things, and just... me as a whole. My life. The thought that I might never experience certain things is horrible. I've cried over it. And I hope it's not true.

I finally step out my comfort zone and ask this girl I’ve been cool with (we’ve been flirting for a little bit but I never see how someone could be serious about actually flirting with me) out on a date and she actually said yes and even said I FINALLY asked her. I was really excited for today. Told a good portion of my friends, my family, even a few coworkers because I hadn’t actually been on a date in a long time and they were all excited for me. Had dinner planned, got a haircut, planned on stopping somewhere and getting flowers, everything I could think of to make a good first impression on a first date, but she ended up cancelling. She didn’t give me a specific reason, but I told her it was okay and I understand things come up. I’m not mad at her, but I’m really bummed out that it didn’t happen. The guys will kinda poke fun at me about being the only single one and I know they don’t mean it seriously, but it just kinda gets to me after a while.

Friends and family always tell me how good of a guy I am but things just never pan out in my favor romantically.

For once I deserve to be on the receiving end of my pain that I cause. I can no longer hurt anyone else. Only myself. To the right of me is my little prescription bottle intended to maintain my clinical depression. I want to take all of it, every last pill. And finally wake up in never ending silence. Who knew such a small thing could hold as much power as it does? My only reservation as a young and naive Christian girl is that I could perhaps perish in an eternity of suffering. If I can just wait until my natural end date then I have a chance to forever be with my maker. I might as well wait being that we only get so many years on this planet anyways. 

I want to live my life like a normal person and the sad thing is that I don’t even know what or who normal is anymore or if that has ever existed. Like many others, unfortunately, I want to die. I want to be dead right now. Right      Now     . I hold enough power in my 5’4 body to open that bottle and take it all in. And then eventually sleep for a looong time. Forever perhaps. I could kms or maybe it’s just pms. But this has been going on for a bit now, I seriously doubt this is just woman stuff. 

I do not know if I will die tonight or someday soon or not for years and years where I get to grow up, marry a man, and have beautiful babies, raise them, and repeat the cycle or whatnot. But I don’t deserve this, not ever since I grew a brain. And I don’t mean deserve in the sense that it’s not good for me I mean deserve in the way that I am not good enough for life, society, my possible future family, or of course, that of my current one.

""You're not working enough! That's why you don't get dates!"" 

I'm always told to accept being lonely. And when I ask for dating advice I'm instantly banned from communities left and right. 

Curious about sex? Banned. 

Wonder what dating is like? Banned. 

I asked a simple question. Why are bad evil men able to get dates and sex? If it's all about personality, why are bad evil men able to get dates and sex? 

I was told for pointing out bad men still get dates, still get sex, that means I'm a bad person myself. 

Elaborate? No. Banned. 

My only form of human contact just wants me to be silenced. I'm supposed to pretend I don't desire a relationship or sex. 

I feel guilty for even desiring these things at this point.

I can't even think clearly.... everyone always said I was just a retard anyway. Just a nothing. 

People enjoy putting me down. People want me to die, they enjoy seeing me suffer it makes them happy. 

They constantly make fun of how I dress, what I study, my shoes, my hair, my freinds have never been freinds. I'll never have freinds.

3924,zoy8hz,someone-who-like-you,"Okay, Im going to be the devils advocate for many people here and you can downvote me for it all you want. I dont care, there is more to my live than fictional online points. 

So, Ive been on this sub for a couple of years now. People that come here to talk about loneliness induced by the lack of a relationship always were a big part of this sub. Now what bothers me about this is that in some of these posts (not all of them!) people start to attack others that actually are in a relationships, invalidate their opinions and experiences with loneliness because of it, and straight up wont listen to actual advice given. 

Some people are so focused on not being in a relationship that it further worsens their lives without them even realising. I talked to a lot of people that made themselves even more miserable because they didn’t want to listen to others and continuesly misinterpreted what they had to say. 

Which is fine of course. We all choose our own truths to live by and if „Only a relationship can save me and make me happy“ is what they chose to live by then so be it. 

As someone that once thought those things to be the truth also, but doesn’t anymore despite still being single, I want to share my truth however because thats what I would have needed to hear back then. Even if it isnt one of the nice band aid things I liked to hear back then.


Maybe, just maybe there is one lonely person out there that reads this, understands this, and is able to better their situation for themselves because of it. 


I talked to many people with similar experiences as myself and came to the conclusion that we often want relationships as a deflective mechanism. 

To speak from my personal experiences: I had a toxic group of „friends“ that humiliated me for fun, as well as a rough home live. I was left to fight on my own for the most part.  I was really lonely back in that time and thought a relationship was the only way out of it.

In the narrative I had back then, I actually blamed never having been in a relationship on my loneliness because I had „friends“ and while my home wasnt that nice, there definitely were people that had it worse, so what else could it have been but that?

Fast forward and I got to know someone from this sub. We lived far away from each other but got somewhat along and decided to be in an online „relationship“ to cure our loneliness.

It was HORRIBLE. Both of us created toxic attachment styles. Some very unhealthy dependency was involved in there. Neither could deliver on the things the other person actually needed. I also had major self hatred issues and constantly thought I wasnt enough for the other person, and no matter how much verbal affirmation they gave me, it didn’t change anything. A lot of crying, sadness, jealousy, anger and hate were involved in that relationship.

At times, this relationship made me feel lonelier than ever before.

Despite only being an online relationship, it was so messed up, that I just worked through all of the shit that happened despite having no contact with them for 2 years now. 
I can only imagine how horrible the rl variant of that must be. 

Needless to say: despite the two of us working out greatly as friends, our relationship absolutely wasnt the „cute, adorable and wholesome type“ thats idealised by many people including myself. 

And Im not the only one with this experience. I talked to many people that also went in a relationship needing therapy, and went out actually needing more therapy than before.


Today I stand here. This „relationship“ still is the only one I ever had to my name and yet I enjoy live and am not lonely anymore. How so?

I actually met sincere and nice people that care about me just as much as I care about them. They helped me to break ties with my former „friends“. I also started to accept the fact that I actually did not like the things I did for fun despite telling myself that I enjoy them. Instead I began to look for things I actually enjoy doing, which brought overall more happiness to my life.

When I started to feel better, I also got the energy to successfully fix the broken relationships with my family. 

Today I dont wake up anymore hoping that prince charming will arrive to rescue me. Today I go through live and think „If I meet someone and it works out thats great! If not then thats fine also“. Solely because I have enough other things that make life worth while.

And thats the mindset that actually is healthy. A relationship isnt supposed to fill in all your unfulfilled needs, its supposed to be a nice addition to an already functioning and happy life.


Tldr: The wish and struggle for a relationship are valid, but going into one for the sake of having a relationship can do more damage than good. Instead its actually more helpful to work through your problems. 
Always remember that a good friendship can be so much greater than a relationship. Treat other people the way you want to be treated and show them the love and affection you wish to recive and youll find the right people eventually (:

3937,zp0kik,[deleted],"So back when I had my own place, I tried having casual sex. I won't share too many details but I was offering free creampies, blowjobs, alcohol, weed, and junk food. I just wanted to have some affection from a guy and play retro games with him on Project64. I gave guys over the internet my full name and address along with nudes and asked them to come over. THEY ALL REFUSED. I am not making this up and I am not exactly proud of it. It was a low point in my life. My life is even worse now though.

Anyway, I've been told that it's because I'm desperate. ""Men want a chase! Men don't like desperate women!"" THAT IS BULLSHIT. ALL men are SEXUAL PREDATORS who prefer easy women. I made myself that easy woman because yes, I'm desperate, and I thought this was the way to get close to a guy as fast as possible.

So they didn't want me. They didn't want to fuck me. Why? Because I'm fat and ugly AND OLD. You DO have to reach a certain threshold of physical attractiveness to even get casual sex. I see a lot of women saying they don't want to get used, which is a good thing. But just like there are some women who are too unattractive to be catcalled, there will be women that men don't even want to touch at all. 

You will age out of it. Men will no longer even want to use you, and I'm at that point right now.",2022-12-18 15:03:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/zp0kik/as_a_woman_there_comes_a_point_where_you_will_be/,,0,55,"As a woman, there comes a point where you will be rejected even for casual sex as you get older.

3941,zp0ppm,brunstarrr01,"I logged into Facebook for the first time in months - a mistake, I know - and all I saw were my peers getting married or having kids, being in stable relationships, and being with friends who seem to genuinely love and trust them. They seem to be in jobs they adore, or seem to have found their passions, and they just look so... happy. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn't help but compare my life right now with theirs. 

I entered law school a year ago, and was fortunate enough to have gotten into one of the best schools where I'm at. I work during the day, in a job that pays well enough that I bear it even if it's not a field I see myself retiring in, and I study at night after classes. Honestly, I'm on track to pursuing my dream of being a lawyer, which is all I've ever wanted... but why do I feel so alone and so lonely? I haven't ever fallen in love, don't have a group of friends to turn to, and my relationship with my family is strained due to a messed up childhood. Sometimes I think about quitting school and just putting myself out there, hoping to be someone's, just to feel wanted and needed. But I can't even do that, because every time someone asks me why I'm still unmarried at this age, I just say ""I want to finish school first, then I'll think about it."" 

I just wish I had the time to find myself and find someone to love. I wish I were at a point in my life where I'm planning for a family, where we'll live and what the children will be like. I wish I had people checking up on me, letting me know they're rooting for my success. But I guess this is what happens when we choose our dream.

3943,zp14xz,[deleted],"So there you are, scrolling this subreddit looking for friends. When a new potential friend is found...

Who is this potential friend? Well, here are some stats on him:

Hobbies - Likes to read books. What kinda books you ask? The kinds jammed packed with KNOWLEDGE, 100% USDA certified free range knowledge. Because he's a flippin nerd!

Other hobbies - Does this friend not go outside? BIG WRONG, he actually went outside today. Why? To walk around in circles aimlessly in the name of \* Health and Fitness \*

Interest - He's interested in lots of stuff... like, cats! But he is ironically allergic to cats. He's down to hear about your cat/s though.

Career - Is he employed? Heck yes he is! Where you ask? At a company that pays salaries! That's right folks, he gets a whole salary.

Fun Facts - As if any the previous facts weren't fun enough! Prepare your self for even MORE FUN! He's in graduate school learning about graphs and numbers, because just like you can turn that frown upside down, you can turn a graph sideways and make the CEO giggle like a small child. And that's called getting promoted!

What's he on reddit for - To find friends! We promise he's not always this silly, but someone went and gave him a mountain dew and a bowl of cereal and know we have many regrets.

We would talk for an hour or so between our classes. Eventually I gave her my number. We texted every few days and eventually hung out a few times at her place. She is from a poor family and still lives with her mother. About 2 weeks ago she told me she wouldn't be able to text for about a week because  they couldn't make the phone service payments on time. It was fine at first, but after a week passed she still hasn't gotten back to me. The semester just ended so I won't be seeing her again unless I drive to her house. I feel conflicted, the more rational part of me knows that they may not have been able to pay as soon as she predicted. The more emotional part of me feels abandoned, Im afraid that this is her way of ghosting me. Maybe I was too clingy or I weirded her out or I am super annoying.  When I was afraid that I was annoying her before she would be super reassuring. Most of all tho missed having someone who isn't just an internet freind or one of DnD buddies to talk to.

It's pretty peaceful used to be anxious about lunch and where to sit but, I now don't have to worry about it. Occasionally some of the other kids from the library who are always there sit at our table aswell.

I feel very alone since I don't have friends and can't make any but, the whole lunch table thing makes me feel a lot less lonely.

I dropped out of school and have my ged so I can't meet people at school. I work a full time job as a mechanic and rarely ever get to interact with anyone outside of my few co-workers, and the occasional time I get to talk to a customer when pulling their car around for them.

The only time I get to even talk to people who are around my age is when I go on lunch and talk to the people behind the counter. I've never really had many friends when I was going to school I had a group of maybe 5-6 people I actually considered my friends and we'd go out together after school and smoke and get drunk and do degenerate things together but I cut off all contact with those guys over 2 years ago now for reasons that weren't really in my control and I miss just hanging out with people and having someone to talk to about life and shit.

I don't have a girlfriend I've only had one real relationship, we were together for almost 3 years and it was honestly the best feeling of my life having a girl to hold and love, smile with, cry with it really opend my eyes and made me realize how much having a good relationship can really just make all the bullshit dissappear no matter what I was going through it was like it didn't even matter because I still had someone who loved and supported me. But towards the end I don't know what happened I guess she lost interest and she started messing around with other guys and left and came back and left and came back again and she kept doing it so I finally had to just end it because I wasn't going to pit myself through that but it really hurt because I still loved her.

I’m a 18M introvert person who has social anxiety. Because of this, it's very hard for me to initiate the conversation first with someone, as Idk what to say and always think like ""Wait, what am I supposed to say now, lol?"". Plus I'm a very shy person. I love playing games, comforting ppl, listening to music, and chatting with strangers on Reddit to make friends with them (or wasting my time on Reddit lol). English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has the same gender and perhaps something in common. If we don't have anything in common, that's OK too \^\^. Hopefully I will find some1 that will stick around. So ye I would rather a long-term friendship than a short one, but I just let thing flows naturally. My DMs are always open. Forgive me if I'm bad at conversation... Oh! And also, no NSFW profile and 17+ pls \^\^! Honestly I never had a friend b4, so I don't even know ""how it feels"" to have a friend ngl. Thx for reading! I hope u guys have a nice day! With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ This platform sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-18 20:25:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,2,/r/lonely/comments/zp7gzh/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,1,18M Hi everyone!

I nearly died in infancy, which would’ve been the ideal scenario, but the doctor saved my life with abdominal surgery.

The only reason I haven’t ended my life yet is because I don’t want to transfer my grief to my brother and my kids, who live with my still JW ex-wife, who got my mom’s inheritance when she died last month.

It’s gotten to the point that my dreams are about how lonely I am, then I wake up completely alone.

4024,zpad9r,flatfeeesh,"I'm 33, long story short here, 
Been going out with a girl for 3 years, we broke up last May I moved out and  moved back in with my parents. She didn't talk to me all summer and it was absolutely brutal the worst depression I was ever in. Fast forward to now, we hang out at least twice a week she calls me three times a day, we have sex she tells me she loves me etc. However! She kind of treats me like shit now, I ruined her trust and I understand it, but for example she blocked me on Facebook when we first broke up and still hasn't unblocked me. Now I know what you're thinking, but no she's not the type to bang or flirt or have anything to hide really I think it's just more about control. She used to make me feel so fucking good, and yes we broke up and it was my fault I didn't cheat, and I would never cheat on this girl I love her but I messaged a girl, there was nothing sexual in the messages but I was goofing around with her, girlfriend didn't like that we broke up. There's a few other factors but that was the last straw. But things are okay now, like you're not fully going out, but basically so to speak. But I feel so fucking alone she kind of doesn't make me feel good anymore but the weird thing is we always thought we were soulmates and I still think we're soulmates the way we click and get along is crazy, but it's just not the same I guess in a few ways, she never text me but she does call me three times a day but she will read my messages and just go about her day until it's her break but like I said she does call me everyday religiously. She's not as lovey with me. It sucks. Also my family is fucked my mom got cancer and beat it recently thank God, but my two brothers during her bout with cancer treated her like shit.

4025,zpahyz,nonamedhumanhere,"On Friday, my sister put together a little surprise party for her roommate's birthday. I helped set everything up and buy what was needed. My sister and her roommate are pretty close.

Anyway, after the surprise we played a party game we bought from the store. We decided to play one round before we left for dinner. It was fun. After dinner, the second round wasn't so fun.

The party game included a ""Never Have I Ever"" section and it asked about breaking a bone. I have broken one, so I decided to share the story. I was comfortable with my sister's roommate, plus the 3 (not including my sister) other girls there. The five of us hung out before and it went well. I started feeling comfortable around them faster than I thought I would. I was just so excited about hanging out with a group of people. I felt so cool. Now, after what happened, I don't think I'm excited anymore.

I broke my toe a week before my 20th birthday a few years ago. It was a very traumatic and unhappy time in my life. I shared the details of what happened... and two out of the five people there started to laugh at me. (they also laughed at me struggling to move around due to the pain I was having in my knee. This was during round one. I just played along when that happened). They laughed so hard that they were falling over and they were tearing  up. At first, I tried playing along. It was hard. I nearly cried and I felt my chest tighten. I had to leave.

I didn't want to make it obvious that I was hurt. I forced myself through another round before I got up and went to my sister's room. I called her in and broke down crying. I felt like such a sensitive loser. I didn't leave her room that night and just went to bed early. Her and the rest of the girls played another game. And I went to sleep. What happened that night really crushed me. I was so happy up until that point. I texted my mom telling her that, and even told one of the girls how happy I was because I was with them.

I told my sister that I never want to hang out with them again. I was so sad. Idc if it seems dramatic, being laughed at hurts. I was laughed at in school all the time. I can't stop thinking about what happened and unfortunately, I don't know when I'll be able to talk to my therapist again about this situation.

Maybe accepting the loneliness now will help. I don't wanna try anymore. Too many failed attempts at making friends and when I'm finally close to making some, they laugh at me.",2022-12-18 22:38:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668208797,2,/r/lonely/comments/zpahyz/they_laughed_at_me_maybe_i_should_just_accept_the/,,0,2,They laughed at me... maybe I should just accept the loneliness now

But this yr hitting me extra hard, I don't have many real friends, have people on snapchat etc but no one I actually hang out with anymore. I'm early 20s Male

My closest friend has become more distant. Between his gf and school and now work He's pretty busy and not sure he really wants to hang out with me anymore. Mostly it's just when he want's some help with a project etc, but it's becoming further and further apart between visits. Kinda hurts because he's basically my only friend I actually had 

Had a girl apparently interested in me( someone else told me)..  tried to make that into something but I think she's lost interest or at least it just hasn't turned into anything. I'd even like to just be friends with her. 

Partially this is my fault, for yrs in highschool I was kind of anti social as far as outside of school I didn't want to hang out. I just never got the appeal of drinking and that's what most of my friends did, I felt like an outsider then.  

It seems so hard to try and rekindle friendships. Worst thing too is the few people I used to hang around with all have girlfriends they spend their weekends with. 

Now it's hard to meet new friends or a girlfriend. I'm pretty boring to be honest.. I'd really like to find a girlfriend that's kind of introverted to build a relationship with.. not looking for hookups. Just not sure where to find this.

Kinda rambling... I just wanted to vent, no one I really feel I can confide in. I'm embarrassed to mention it to anyone I know",2022-12-18 23:09:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600032913,8,/r/lonely/comments/zpb791/loneliness_hitting_hard_this_winter/,,0,4,loneliness hitting hard this winter

4081,zpi95l,No-Dream5615,"How are other people coping with loneliness? The tears haven't stopped in the last 3 days, the chest crushing pain that makes it hard to breath is never ending and the pain is so deep it feels like a blackhole. The aching longing for company and human connection never goes away and it's getting harder and harder each day. 

For some background I'm 30f living in the UK, I had a great career, had a great group of friends and an active social life and although I lived alone I was happy. Then came March 2022 and everything changed. I suddenly found myself forced alone 24/7 for months at a time, even when lockdowns lifted my workplace maintained WFH. My family lived hundreds of miles away and friends in the city I lived in returned home, eventually our messages got fewer and fewer, before I released I was all alone staring at the same 4 walls week after week month after month. I was soon diagnosed with depression, and then anxiety and it got worse and worse to the point I was signed off work which meant the little human interaction I did have was severed completely. I was in a downward spiral and nothing I helped me to crawl out of it, I took medication, went to therapy did everything the doctors recommended and nothing helped.  Eventually I too had to move away to a town I new nobody.

2 years on I'm still off work, my depression is so deep I struggle to look after myself most days and the anxiety is so crippling I barely function. I still live alone, I don't have any friends and I don't have any social interactions at all. No matter how much I try and beg for help no one listens, no one cares and the pain gets worse each day and I can't keep fighting. I'm tired, I just want a hug and someone to talk to yet I don't have anyone I can call and just to say hi to. How do other people cope alone? How have you not fallen apart through loneliness?

4082,zpi96a,horrordude13,"My birthday is coming up soon, and I’m expecting disappointment again. I’m in 11th grade… no one cares about me, at all. I abruptly left school I mean i was going for 2 months straight and one day I left and it’s been 2 school years… not one person has asked if I was ok or where I went. I have severe body dysmorphia. I ended up getting 2 secede eating disorders even ended up in the hospital and my bones collapsed. I went to a ED clinic and the kids there could not believe no one checked on me… I remember kids there talked about how much their friends loved and cared for them, it really pissed me off because all of them were complaining about how they can’t hang out with their friends because of the clinic… I’d kill just to have one, one good friend. I’ve never had and never will. The clinic made me feel worse about my self… every kid said about how many people  are supporting them then. I have absolutely no one. I have one person I rarely talk to and if I do talk to him he’s just a psycho  Christian that hates on everyone. I had a bunch of mental breakdowns on my social medias… talked about how suicidal and miserable my life is. Not one person asked if I needed help or if I was ok. I only have one friend and I already dislike him… he’s a psychopath… I mean literally he thinks gay people should be killed by the government for being gay (the Christian) . He doesn’t even know I’m bi/pan. He’s really nice, but he’s not. I need to distance myself from him, but I can’t he’s my only friend. I have autism too; I’m high functioning obviously though. I like stuff people my age don’t like. I love Mario games, toys, stuffed animals, religion, I’m really obsessed with Mario games… I mean obsessed everything, I mean everything in my room is Super Mario. Obviously child  like behavior. Everyone teases me for not understanding stuff or just liking what I like. From 10 year olds to 50 year olds. I can’t find friends… I’m not saying this cocky but I am mature for my age (ASD), I can’t find people who aren’t mature, they’re just horrible people. My biggest issue though is easily my sister. My sister is 4 1/2 years older than me; she’s in junior year in college. And how people treat her vs me in insane. Literally 10 kids in my grade, every popular kid wished her happy birthday… they never said it to me, and my sister is very nice to me , and me and her are great friends, and she even posts happy birthday to me on her story, and every kid sees it and still doesn’t wish me a happy birthday. At school people do talk to me, but guess what, it’s just about my god damn sister. Every time  a girl talked to me she asked about her and that’s it. She was very popular in high school, and people think she’s very attractive. I just wish I had a good life and a ton of friends the past two years I’ve hung out with someone 2 times.

Most of my issues are because I’m so lonely. Most of my issues could be helped if I had some kind of support.

I hate myself more than anything and I can’t even begin to take steps to stop feeling like that without someone proving me wrong. But I don’t have that. I’ve stopped believing myself long ago, because I just set myself up for disappointment, over and over and over and over.

The definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result, or whatever, right? I feel like that’s all I’m capable of. Trying and trying and falling short each time. Except there is no plan B.

I know, without a doubt, that having someone in my life would be the most healing thing imaginable. I’d finally get to unlearn all the awful shit I’ve been telling myself for years.

I can’t believe that this will be my last semester of high school! I’m excited yet nervous for the following reasons: I’m excited because I’m ready to get out of high school. Ready to get away from my toxic mother. Ready to start my career and college success. But I am nervous because of the fear that my toxic mother won’t let me go(at least far away). Since a young age, I’ve realized the best way for me to grow as a person is to get far away from what’s holding me back; in this case, it’s my mother. I’ve always wanted to go out of state then I realized I would be covering most of the financials so instate it was for me. So I decided on a school that’s 2 hours from my family as it’s the best option(and furthest within budget). My toxic mother hasn’t been any support throughout this college application process and it’s hard for me as a first gen student learning everything. The one thing my mother did tell me regarding college is to go somewhere that’s 10 minutes away from my house just because she saw something about it in the mail. Well no. Im not going to a small run down Christian college that doesn’t even have my major. But she would of known that if she would have gone through the college application process with me. As the months come closer to high school graduation and deciding on a college, the more my fear of her keeping me close to her kicks in.

I had that for the past years, and will have the same in 2022 too, so I make this post for those who will be alone this year. If it's your first time then yes you will feel really lonely. I remember when it happened to me I felt like shit and just wanted to sleep for many weeks to ignore that and turn the page quickly. But in fact.. it's just events that we created, but it's gonna be a normal day in reality. 

I personally do my best to not think of all the families and friends that will have a fun moment together. Two years ago, a good friend of me invited me in his family for christmas, knowing i'll be alone. And I kinda regretted it after. Don't get me wrong, they were all amazing people and really nice to invit me there when I wasn't part of the family. But it didnt replaced the family I don't have. It made me feel even more lonely than before. They were talking about stories from their past, fun things that they know about eachother. And I was here drinking and eating, talking a bit sometimes, but it was a bit weird. 

After this day I decided to totally assume and embrasse the loneliness. Because yes sometimes you don't choose to be lonely/alone. But you are. Life can be hard sometimes. And you can't run away from that like you run away from a lot of problems in your life. I personally choosed to accept it and live with it. And it dosnt have to be so sad and depressing. For example i'll do something, for me, that I really like, that I wouldn't do everyday. I'll cook something really yummy for hours, that is a bit expensive, same for dessert, and i'll go drive my fancy car in a lovely place at night to eat the dessert I made, in my car. Because that's something I love to do, as an introvert, even if it can sound even more depressing for people.

Don't stay on reddit, on your pc, crying or feeling so bad all day/evening. Don't stay alone in your bed. Do something. Try something new. Go walk outside or take your car to explore things you couldn't normally do. It feels really bad to be lonely. Especially at the end of December. But it's not an escuse to dip into that and feel worse. You can change everything you feel. Nothing is impossible.

Take care of you guys, and stay strong. You will always be your best friend. Don't count on people, to be happy.",2022-12-19 07:04:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669333372,3,/r/lonely/comments/zpkqow/spending_christmas_and_new_year_alone_isnt_that/,,0,3,Spending christmas and new year alone isn't that bad

4134,zpobm7,EmeraldPolish,"I don't get the point in my life anymore... I had many friendships and relationships with people of a duration of 2020-2022 in and out and all of them leaving me is either due to them taking me for granted, getting cheated on, giving me stupid excuses and so on. I've gotten used to it all since most of it was online relationships but this year in May I met who I thought was the love of my life in real life through a dating app. We met up for 3 dates all day and they were absolutely phenomenal! I loved it so much, and then from there I went to her house 3 times for 2-3 day sleepovers, first and second time was so great I loved it but third time things started to go downhill.

Alot less kisses and hugs for some odd reason and I got told the day after when I woke up that ""She had to go to her aunties to pick something up"" which was just out of the blue and then I left and went home and saw her online in a game and the drive from her house to her aunties is 1 hour one way and 1 hour back and it only takes me 30 minutes to get home. Then from there she replied back saying ""Oh don't worry everything is fine something just needed fixing but we came back home coz we didn't have to stay"". I found that really suspicious even though afterwards all our messages were as normal like it always was. At the same time she begged me to come to hers again soon as she missed me.

And ofc from there were less and less intimate and romantic talks, barely any ""I love you"" or anything. Lost my part time job for being overstaffed at the same time so that was shit. No matter how rarely she texted me, I always checked up on her twice a day. Hours turned into days of her not answering/opening my messages and 3 weeks later she copied and pasted a massive paragraph about why she wanted to break up and the reasons were so full of bullshit of false allegations about harassment which never even happened in the first place. Her definition of harassment is checking up on her to see if she was doing okay coz I was worried why she wasn't talking alot. The rest of the events from her point of view she didn't even let me hear the side of my story which was unfair and immature for her to block me straight afterwards.

4 months have passed now. I'm so distraught this was my first irl relationship aswell and the memories just make me cry everything between us both were so perfect too we did so much together more than I could of ever thinked of I don't understand why it looked like I was putting in more effort every single day and barely anything on her side :(",2022-12-19 10:48:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608030965,10,/r/lonely/comments/zpobm7/i_think_my_life_is_absolutely_fucked_and_over/,,0,1,I think my life is absolutely fucked and over honestly...

4170,zpwgaw,Warrior-Mentality,"I didn't have a big family to begin with. No brothers, no sisters. Hardly any close relatives on either side of the family; they all live in other countries and I don't know them.

I basically had my mom and dad (whom both lived 4 hours away) and I was alone studying for school. I met my wife in this city I am at and we had a child together.

To make a long story short, my dad passed away, my mom got ill and moved 5 hours away to be with her mom, my wife cheated, dumped, and left me (she had BPD, which explains a lot), and she took my son with her. I filed for divorce and am now getting some visitation/custody, but it still isn't the same.

The last 8 years in this city, she isolated me and didn't allow me to have an identity without her. I couldn't have friends or my own life. I was around her 24/7. Now she does this and goes with all of the friends and family she would complain about and left me like nothing. She has a huge support system full of friends, family, etc. She came to this city as a child. I came here in my mid-twenties. For the past five months, the only human interaction I get is going through a drive thru to buy food or speaking to a cashier at the store somewhere.

To say my life is pathetic would be an understatement. I'm extremely lonely and have no identity at the ripe age of 31 years old.

4174,zpwrpg,UnburdenedByTalent,"I almost always feel alone, but not always lonely. This is my first post on a social media platform in over 10 years. As of this year, I live entirely alone and off-grid, no phone reception, with the closest supermarket 1.5 hours away. I'd be lying if I said I knew exactly why I was here writing this out, I think I just want to help people. But who am I to offer advice and believe to know what's best for you?

One thing that appears to have become more clear to me over the years is how important contrast is, how important a lack of social interaction can be to actually facilitate our appreciation of human interaction. Somehow the digital age offers so much it actually does the opposite and isolates us from ourselves and one another. Personally, it can sometimes be a couple of days without physically seeing or hearing someone, yet a simple 2 minute conversation with a local, or a passing hand gesture in a vehicle is honestly enough to brighten my whole day and somehow rekindle a perception of the innate goodness of humanity.

I'm in my early 30s now. I spent almost all of my 20's playing video games, smoking weed and trying to decondition myself from the system, *maan*. During this time, I had one long term relationship, a very close group of friends and I worked every day in a crappy minimum wage job at a supermarket. These things did nothing nurture the part of me that was and sometimes still is, in a constant state of peril and isolation. How could I have all of these things, including a loving family, and still feel crippling loneliness?

It just seems we absorb the world around us and then metabolise it and get spiritually sick, and I don't mean in a religious sense. It seems we are more likely to feel lonely because we are surrounded by systems; and acts of compassion, love and sincerity, are just something we read about on a dimly lit computer screen while we sit alone in a room, surrounded by hundreds and thousands of other people also doing the same thing. I honestly have no desire to change the world but there is something to be said on the conceptual validity of understanding the ideas portrayed in dystopian literature, I just think its important to see and acknowledge that you are what the world is to a large extent and to know what influences you.

I've thought about deleting this wall of text half a dozen times before posting it, that is how little I value social media, or rather how harmful I feel the illusion can be. If I had to offer advice it would be this: Reduce or stop social media interactions and discussions, you may in fact see the real world come into view; which may be painful to begin with, but sometimes you gotta dig your way out.

The irony of saying this on reddit is not lost on me. Oh well, same time 2032 I guess.",2022-12-19 16:52:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662360830,2,/r/lonely/comments/zpwrpg/sincere_solitude/,,0,1,Sincere Solitude

4186,zpy0zz,yes_veryinteresting,"People always find me boring, nerdy or creepy, just because I speak softly or not have much to say. I try to be involved, learn the way they talk, learn their sense of humour, research about the things they like, just to make a friend. It’s always not enough, because “you’re ugly, you’re weird, you’re creepy, you try too hard”. People always label me as a “tomboy” or whatever that is supposed to mean, but I don’t think I’m any less of a girl.

People always associate popularity with how good of a person is, and I’m sick and tired of it. I don’t care how many people you manage to seduce, I don’t care how many text and calls you get a day, i don’t care how many parties you attend. I just want a friend. Yet it somehow is the only thing people judge others on, I think it’s stupid and unreasonable, but I can’t find anyone who thinks the same way, so if I want a friend, and to ever “fit in” I’ll have to think and act like them. 

 I don’t want to give up, I want to believe that there’s good in people, I don’t want to take revenge on those who wronged me, no matter how sad, pathetic and childish it is.

I’ll keep trying, for as long as I can.
Since we’re all lonely here, feel free to talk about some stuff you like please, your interests and hobbies, anything, I just like listening to people talk.

I believe I have to share information to make people more comfortable with sharing as well?

So, I’ll  go first.

I like horror movies, they’re interesting, especially psychological thrillers. I find psychology interesting in general. The way people talk, the way they act, their fears, the things they like, the way they try to portray themselves. I think it shows how the world seems to them, and how they see themselves. In a way, I like seeing people as lab rats, it’s comforting whenever I feel lonely .

I like cats, my aunt used to own one, it was somewhat of a chonker. It wore a bell that I always found cute, ringing wherever it went, like a king announcing his arrival. Sort of fits the way most cats psychology I guess. It’s little purrs whenever you rubbed it’s belly or scratched it’s chin, and the sound it would make when it licked the treats my family gave it.

Another hard thing for me to see is that my roomie is such a social and happy person who is out all the time, hooking up with a lot of different guys. I kinda compare myself with her which makes me really sad, has anyone experienced this too? How can I deal with those feelings and learn to stop comparing myself to others?

One day I discovered that I had feelings for her and I wanted to confess to her but when I entered the school I saw how she was kissing another boy and I was silent. when she talks to me after that she said it's her boyfriend and i said, ""Oh I'm glad for you!"" but inside i was dying. I was very depressed and I still am. 

She was the perfect Girl For Me!
She Was Very Pretty! And i fucked the opportunity.
I try and try to get into a relationship but it doesn't work After that day I have felt very bad until now, it took me a long time to confess it but because of me now I can't, I feel that I will never have that special someone, in fact I go to the gym and do all the things I love. but that doesn't help I will always feel bad

 I'm feeling very lonely but for some reason many of my friends presume they have someone, even my family! And I wonder: why am I so alone? Why don't I have anyone?
 I'm always going to have that damn emptiness inside of me 

i will never be loved

4224,zq3wwo,ServinVariel,"I am a 20 Years Male who has never actually interacted with a friend in his life. 

I shall explain myself a bit better, I had some kind of friend until I was 12 but it wasn't very sincere and lacked a distinct form, being quite shallow.

From 12 until now I lived my life with no friends at all, not meeting and actually talking to anybody but my family: my mother, father and twin brother. The only people I would expound my feeling to without actually revealing the truths that would have been too embarrassing to tell.

I had schoolmates I would converse with for about 10 seconds if they asked me something (which happened very rarely), but I never actually went out of my way to find a friend or something of the like. The reasoning (excuse?) behind this is to be found in my general distrust of others and my dislike for superficiality (for I perceive it as a waste of time, even if I can see some gain in actually ""Trying to make friends"").

I tried to find some kind of companionship in someone who I actually perceived as worthy of consideration (I am such a self centred person, am i not?), but I didn't go anywhere with it for my lack of confidence and my sadness at the time.

Beware though, I am not a monstrous fiend, I actually like to observe people, examine their reactions and try to understand how society works... I feel quite fondly about every single person I have spent more than a year with on my path (do I actually?), I could talk about them for a lot of time, but I wouldn't actually talk to them. 

I also can say that I never actually hated single individuals, I don't think it is about forgiveness though, for I understood from a very young age that people are fallible (""The Mirror"" sure helped here) so I always fitted other people shoe sizes quite nicely.

I never was interested in romantic relationships and I can state quite logically that no one professed a thing to me. I had 2 crushes my all life but I never confessed to ""Liking"" neither of them. The 2nd one was the only person I ever texted just to have a conversation with, a very formal and high minded dialogue about choice, will and many things I wouldn't be able to think so brightly again (It is as if my brain rotted away). 

Talking with them is almost a sin for me, It is hard form me to see myself as someone worth having a conversation with.

But not everything is bad about being lonely I guess, I can clench to a peculiar sense of hope, an everlasting glimmer of despair which beautifully fills my soundless heart with Guilt, Pride and many other feelings I would have never experienced.

So here I am, typing away words that don't mean nothing and have no weight to strangers...

If anyone is willing to judge me, try to think of yourself as your only friend, just a weightless remark I am sure, 

Remember I love this world, its living beings and myself. English is not my first language and I am ""Just venting""...",2022-12-19 21:20:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623096224,2,/r/lonely/comments/zq3wwo/the_curseblessing_of_loneliness/,,0,0,The Curse/Blessing of loneliness

4278,zqa05i,thequeenofmoons,"TW: SA, suicide (both not explicit)

I made a post on this forum about a year ago in one of the worst states I’ve ever been in, I wanted to give a little update if anyone is feeling the same way now. 

Omitting most personal details, around this time last year I found out I was being mocked by all of my “friends”. That included my roommates, who would tell each other that I should live alone forever. I felt incredibly broken to the point of a suicide attempt. I saw no reason in continuing, but I’m clearly still here. To shorten another story, I then went on to date a girl who would SA me a few months later. I convinced myself that I had all of this coming and I just wasn’t destined for any kind of kindness. I still decided I would take it slowly and continue to try in the fall. 

I have spent the past four months meeting and spending time with the most incredibly wonderful people I ever could have hoped for. I trust these people now. I fell in love. I have some faith in myself again. I never thought that I could feel so genuinely loved and appreciated, especially not so soon after the worst year of my life. 

I know that “it gets better” stories feel like the absolute worst when you’re in the before, but inevitably something will change and things will begin to click into place. 

If you read this far, thank you, I really hope you know how loved and appreciated you can be even if you don’t feel that way now.",2022-12-20 01:21:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592064573,8,/r/lonely/comments/zqa05i/a_quick_update/,,0,3,A Quick Update

I grew up feeling like feeling alone was the worst feeling in the world. i’ve been trying to accept it more lately and focus on growing myself in different aspects but a lot of the things I want to do in life, I wish I could do with people, like traveling, or going on a date. I just want to experience the beautiful things in life with another human being and I don’t even mean that in a romantic way.

honestly it feels so difficult to make friends because women are either usually jealous and move weird or I don’t connect with them well, and male friends usually end up liking me so i can never get too close. I don’t know if that comes off a certain way but that’s just honestly how I really feel and what i have experienced.

this is not to say that I don’t have any type of friends at all but I’m talking about having deep conversations with a person and having someone genuinely really care about your well-being. I really hate shallow friendships and I feel like I ultimately just have a lot of those.

It makes it worse that everyone in my life has someone. Everyone in my friend group, my siblings. I never thought I’d make it through high school having never been in a relationship and it honestly makes me really sad, I feel unloveable a lot. I want someone to share my time with and that will always be there. 
What makes matters, probably worse, is filling the void with hookups. That’s the only love I know: fwb, hookups. I’ve had continuous sex with two of my guy friends, one of them I fell in love with and it was one sided. At this point I’ve learnt how to detach feeling from hookups which makes me sad because I’m so much more of a lover girl. And to think someone can be a really close friend of them, have those sexual relations with me and still not want me has made me feel super unloveable. I find myself finding love in people so much easier for this reason, for example if someone is interested in me that I don’t like I’ll still play around with it because I’m so love deprived. Or I’ll find interest in them just for the sake of being lonely. 
I know I’ll meet people in uni but I find myself feeling a lot that my person is just not out there. I’m sad to go to prom alone and miss out on all the couple things my friends have.

(None of us have a license) Charming, I know. And now she’s holding a grudge because I didnt invite her. Isnt that funny? She even made a groupchat with all our other friends except me. That was weeks ago. Shes still clearly mad. Whatever. Anyways, my best friend of 12 years doesnt speak to me anymore.

Oh you desire sex? Well don't you realize relationships aren't about sex and women can sense you want sex and avoid you? 

Even though, using my freinds as examples, they literally go out on weekends with the sole purpose of finding sex. And they don't have any issues. 

Tons of frat boys in college do the same. 

And it's celebrated, people celebrate those kinds of men as players and heros and ""real men"". 

My freinds laugh at me and call me a ""beta"" for even wanting a relationship. Women almost seem to worship these guys. They blow their phones up and do whatever they say it seems like. 

Well, bringing this up, gets me shamed. Called a ""nice guy"" and so on. Called ""entitled"". Just for bringing up an observation. 

They constantly bully me and treat me as beneath them. And according to my observations, yes, the women they are around love it. 

Does that mean I'm a sexist, nice guy? I'm supposed to be MORE ignorant or pretend I don't see this stuff? Really? 

Then people want to message me on here ""bet you smell like funyuns take a shower!"" 

Just anything to tear me down. 

It's nearly 3 am and I haven't slept. I just haven't been able to sleep very well and I have work in the morning. Great. 

They always go into graphical detail on their sex lives, so they're basically rewarded with sex for being evil monsters. 

So when I'm told it's my personality, and that for noticing these evil monsters get dates and sex that it means I'm evil, it makes me wonder what the people's motivations for saying that is.

4373,zql3lw,[deleted],"i'm a terrible friend, family member, person, and so on. no one deserves a waste of time like me in their life. even if they are terrible people and do end up hurting me, i tend to preserve myself above all despite my ironic self hatred and push them away. even if they do the slightest thing to hurt me or i simply feel they're too good for me, i inevitably somehow push everyone away in the end with my mentally ill paranoid bullshit. in the end, i know what's good for me is being safe, and being safe is being isolated, where no one knows of your existence. it's a shame being an artist who wants to put their work out there but can't find the following to do so, but at least it's not being stolen. it's a shame being unable to go outside alone due to being a rather young looking female-passing person, but at least i have an excuse to stay inside.
all of these bads have the goods to them, except for the apparent ""study"" that you can die of loneliness. as i mentioned earlier, i heavily prioritize the preservation of myself and therefore don't have a problem with being secluded (or at least am fooling myself into believing so,) the bottom line is, how do you avoid dying of loneliness as someone who rather enjoys it or sees the good in it? do you only die of loneliness if you deeply feel the crippling emotions that it can come with? should i further trick myself into enjoying the isolation to avoid the apparently inevitable effects of loneliness?",2022-12-20 10:33:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/zql3lw/avoiding_dying_of_loneliness/,,0,0,avoiding dying of loneliness

I've been trying to develop a healthier relationship with my emotions lately, but I'm really stuck on how to deal with anger.
I'm not good at dealing with conflict, my first instinct is to shrink back and keep my mouth closed. But over the years, I've been encouraged by friends and family to speak up more, and I've been trying. But it seems every time I speak up, something awful happens. A disagreement, then an argument, then we're mad at each other. 
I'm angry at them and I'm angry at myself, I'm just angry and I don't know what to do about it. I hate it. 

For once I just want an ""i see where you're coming from"" or an ""i disagree but it's okay that we think differently"" instead of them immediately turning it into a competition they have to win, it would be so nice.

I'm going to therapy, weekly sessions that I've been attending diligently, but I feel myself getting worse. I catch myself thinking mean things more often, like these arguments are poisoning my soul or something. It makes me feel awful, and resentful, which makes me feel like I'm a bad person. Why am I being so mean? I could've sworn I wasn't always like this. I feel so alone and lost and misunderstood. I don't want to be angry anymore, I don't want to care anymore, and most of all I don't want to make my friends feel bad anymore.

I recently went to the doctor for physical therapy to deal with a foot injury, and they had me fill out some paperwork for new patients.  They asked for an emergency contact, and that's the moment that I made a gruesome discovery:  I don't have an emergency contact.  I don't have any family or friends at all who can be contacted if there's an emergency. 

When I made this discovery, it hit me like a ton of bricks.  I became overwhelmed with sadness, and I nearly burst into tears right there in the waiting room.  Once I got back out to my car, I literally cried for 30 minutes in the parking lot.  I also randomly start crying out of nowhere lately.  I'm devastated and scared. This isn't how I wanted my life to go.  I've tried to pretend that everything is ok, but it isn't.  I'm extremely sad and depressed, and it's hard for me to stay motivated to reach any goals I have, because I just feel like there's no point.  I've realized that I'm probably going to die alone, and there's no point in trying to take care of myself, do updates to my house, save money for vacations, etc.  I've got no one to impress, no one to experience life with, and no one to celebrate success with, so there's no point in trying.

Now here we are around the holidays, and I keep thinking of all of the memories from when I was younger.  The holidays were a magical time.  I had a great time with my family, decorating the Christmas tree, helping my gramma  make cookies, wrapping gifts with my mom, putting up outside decorations with my uncle.  Now everyone is gone. If I died in my house right now, no one would come looking for me.  My job would just eventually fire me for not showing up, and they wouldn't ask any other questions.

Realizing that this is what my life has become is so sad, depressing, and scary, and I don't even know what to do.  I'm genuinely devastated, because I never imagined my life turning out this way. I'm really just here to vent.  I don't have any plans to harm myself or anything, but if anyone else is in a similar situation and managed to cope, please give me advice.",2022-12-20 17:29:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1558649702,5,/r/lonely/comments/zqu935/a_gruesome_discovery/,,0,1,A Gruesome Discovery

4429,zquos4,Pseudo-79,"I’m M/23. I met a few people here and there; some have similar existences, but I’m always vastly different in every way, usually for the worse. Like most people my age have had relationships, jobs, good social lives, etc... But I was isolated my whole life. I didn't even know how people lived until I went on reddit. Ironically, it both opened my eyes and made me extremely depressed. I feel like I missed out on everything a young person should have or do. (and yes I know I’m still young, but I’m talking about my teenage years specifically)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not only different circumstance wise, I'm also different mentally. Everyone nowadays likes casually dating or modern dating, but I'm far more traditional. I want to wait for the person I love, but I also want that reciprocated, and I don't think I’ll ever find anyone like that, which makes me a bit sad and lonely. I feel like I'll live this intolerable existence forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want to give my whole heart to someone and love them forever, but first I need to find someone I'm compatible with, and I just don't feel there is anyone like me in that regard. I don't think I have an other half out there in the world. I think I’m just stuck with myself, which is frightening. I don't want to live alone. I live with my family, but I've had a lot of bad experiences here in general (I don't want to go into more detail than that). An overall, I just feel lonely being with people I don't really like that much, but I feel stuck here. 

&amp;#x200B;

More recently, as I have been browsing reddit, I just feel like there are very few people that have lived with my rare circumstances. Isolated, no friends, relationships, social anxiety, homeschooled, etc... Each of these individually are not rare, but I feel like the combination of them all is. Idk, I just wish I was never born, all I've had to deal with is pain. I'm hopeful that it will get better, but 23 years has been a long time so far, and every year I say, ""this is the year it gets better"", but then another one passes and it’s the same cycle over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I felt love.   
I wish I had someone to hold at night.   
I wish I had someone not hurt me.  
I wish I didn't feel dread waking up every morning.  
I wish I had a reason to move on.

4445,zqws6x,XANDGATE06,"I am 22 and currently studying abroad. I had to arrive late because of my visa and missed the first few classes. As I started attending the classes, I noticed everyone had already made friends and had their own group. I made all the attempts to talk to new people and make new friends but nothing worked. A lot of these people unlike me live in student dormitories which made it easier for them to hang out and attend classes together. It has been 2 months since I came here and I have no friends. Being away from my family and home is already hard enough and with no one to talk to or hang out with, It is taking a toll on my mental health. I don't feel like attending classes as I feel more lonely there, I've lost the motivation to do anything. I have multiple mental breakdowns every day. Everyone here except me is having fun. I always spend my time overthinking and overanalyzing everything and questioning my past decisions and how I ended up here, and what I could have done differently to make friends. Every time I go out, I envy everyone I see with their friends having a good time. It was my dream to study this course in this country, and now that it has come true, I am not happy living my dream and questioning my very own existence. I was good at studying but I have lost the motivation to study too. It's getting lonelier and lonelier day by day. It's hard to lie to my family that I'm having fun here and everything's alright but in reality, it's the exact opposite happening. I feel like I'm stuck in this phase forever and have lost all hope of making friends. Nobody seems to care about my existence or even wants to talk to me. It feels like losing a bit of my sanity every day. I don't know if I'm expecting too much from life or is something wrong with me.

That said, no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to make actual friends. Mind you, I have two people who attend much of the same educational studies, but struggle to feel content among them. I will describe my struggles later on.

As an 18 year old American, I am more or less required to tend to my educational studies, for over a decade, I felt like I belonged there, but things started to change at the beginning of this school year. In my secondary education, because it is my final year of doing such, my school wants for us to all gather and socialize often. I am not of that sort, but it has only come to hurt me. One by one, people who I thought I knew slowly started to turn their backs on me, almost all of the instructors who I used to speak to are now gone and the one's who I know now are either long-term substitutes or I find less so personable and more so ""people-pleasing"", they one's who always want to be a part of the class and liked, rather than to teach (I much prefer those who are arduous in their labor tasked).

I am told to join in and be a part of things that I frankly do not feel remotely comfortable about with people that I only feel remotely comfortable being with. I do not do or like the same things that they do (mainly watching videos on TikTok, dating, or doing drugs). I have little appetite for any of those at my age and feel like I will have no appetite if I get any older (they are such foolish things). Even common forms of media look very different (I read The Count of Monte Cristo, while they read Twilight, I listen to Al Qowlu Qowlu Sawarim, while they listen to All I Want For Christmas Is You, and so forth). I feel left out.

I feel left out when people show no interest in discussing the principles of different types of jet engines or the basics of coding HTML, even when I try to show interest in the newest Marvel or DC film (I much prefer Toei and Tsuburaya series, say what you will). Even when I do discuss those things, nobody seems to ever be interested.

So I started to consume more media and came up with what I liked and disliked and when I shared that to those who I had though were my brethren, they said I was extremely wrong in my interpretation and that there is none. No plot. No theme. Nothing.

Dumbfounded by such, I tried to do the same, but only come to hate the media itself and grow distaste for it, so I went back to my old ways.

Further rifts began to form, with one individual in particular, he started off getting very close to me. I thought I was being nice, but he takes advantage of me by twisting my words from a joke about suddenly winding up in a relationship to an all-or-nothing dare/bet where if I do not have a girlfriend, I go broke.

You will never know how much distaste I have for such a thing. I rarely ever consider the concept of being in a  relationship, only because I do not think I would be a stable enough individual (bad history and what not).

This, of course, brings up the concept of relationships in general. I do not act out on them, but people assume I do. It has happened on two instances, which was two instances too many for me.

The first case was about two years ago. In October, a classmate of mine was quite ill with COVID, or at least that is what I had thought. It turned out that said individual was just quarantining as a precaution due to multiple family members having the virus (she, however, never caught it). We had got to communicating and started typing letters (I thought such was normal, but in retrospect, I guess it is slightly antiquarian in its own nature). I had sent three out over time, but never had a response, she said, that she had sent a letter or two, and I have little in the way of doubts concerning this, for the individual in question has been honest. However, I did not a subtle shift in language, from first name, to the standard greeting of ""Dear"" to ""Dearest"". I thought the superlative was odd, but went along with it, that was, until I asked for her to stay momentarily after class to ask if she had been receiving my letters. It was a large mistake on my part, there were some gasps from all around the room and decided to hang up from the call (it was the end of that class) and went on to help my father (of the tender age of 75, then) around the house before my next class.

All I had wanted was a friend, but I guess I should have saw the signs that there was romantic intent, but was entirely oblivious. I wrote a letter following that apologizing for everything that had happened. I ceased contact because of it.

Lightning struck twice. I had established contact with three individuals and with two of them saying so much as that they would be infrequent in contact, I started speaking to the one left. We had a lot in common and was feeling quite comfortable. Then came a question about where said individual was from. I found the response odd. She said that she was not interested in a relationship as she was interested in somebody else. I was surprised since I had said nothing to imply that I was particularly looking for a relationship (though I was not 100% closed to it, so long as it was the other person who asked). I did say to another individual so much that I would be interested, but that was months prior and had since dropped the idea after the response was ""No"". No is unequivocal in meaning, nothing can change what it means, aside from the question asked. I had a good grasp of it and only wanted to know somebody.

Did I come across as too socially awkward or lecherous? It was my cause that such a conclusion was brought upon, certainly, but how?

The way I see it is that I cannot make friends with those of the opposite sex no matter how hard I try. With my own sex, few accept, but even fewer last more than a few weeks. One friend forces and manipulates me through many deeds to get to somewhere that only pleases him. As a result, I am going to just have one friend, but he sometimes struggles with his mental health and I have no clue how I could help, so I often just let the people who know all the answers deal with such.

Any help or suggestions? Should I just continue alone because I lack the social skills needed for friends?

I doubt anyone will answer such a long winded post (if I see TL:DR, I may just rip my hair out \[which I am already losing, mind you\]), so please if you have anything worthwhile to say, say it. That is the least that I can ask.

P.S: I am likely to speak when I am to graduate from my secondary studies, but feel as if I have nobody to speak to (at least without insulting are messing up in the ways that I had described above). The podium has always been kinder to than the conversation, so at least there is that.",2022-12-20 21:23:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653673715,1,/r/lonely/comments/zr042z/another_year_goes_by_and_i_have_less_friends_than/,,0,1,Another Year Goes by and I Have Less Friends than Before.

4475,zr0mto,johnhephaestus,"Being lonely is easy. At least for me. My whole life I've been lonely, not always alone, but always lonely. When growing up it was hard to deal with it sometimes, as it was indocrinated within me as a young adolescent that being a ""part"" of some group, something, anything really, would fulfill me as a human being part of a society.   
But with time it got easy, going out seemed like a hassle, meeting people seemed like it wasn't worth it and instead I started dwelling within my own thoughts. My own head became my home. I used to see people walking around in groups all laughing, people I know posting pictures with others talking about how awesome that one day was and think that I also needed that, but now I simply have no reaction whatsoever. With time that one part of me that was taught from even before I could even talk that I had to be a ""part"" of a group or something or anything, wasted away. I became indifferent to the struggles of others, to the acomplishments of others, I cared not for anything other than my job and me. And it's easy, when I'm in control it's easy. But during the nights, that's when most of me shuts off and my brain operates on automatic mode and it does whatever it wants. That's called Dreaming. Some nights I don't dream at all, everything goes by in a heartbeat and I'm up in the morning ready to work and whatever I feel like doing. Other nights my brain decides to show me glimpses of things I desired when I was a child or now, like being Spider-man or doing some crazy stunt on my skateboard. And rarely, some nights my brain shows me what the remains of that part of me that wasted away wants. It's always the same dream, I'm laying somewhere, in a green field, in a street full of tall buildings or somewhere in my hometown. There's this girl that I know not what she looks like, but I can see a smile, and I can feel a warmth I've barely felt during my lifetime. But it all goes away in the morning, when I'm back in control.

And that warmth goes away, that part of me goes into hiding and all that's left is a hollow, a hurt. Those days are when I'm at my worst, when it becomes most clear that being lonely is easy, but only when I'm the one in control.",2022-12-20 21:43:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671571954,11,/r/lonely/comments/zr0mto/being_lonely_is_easy/,,0,0,Being lonely is easy

4498,zr3urx,wwsto,"18m freshman at uni. I haven't had a social life in years now. I'm very lonely and it's causing me so much anxiety. I've got nothing to offer to anyone. I've made so many efforts. Everytime I talk to ppl I meet in classes, they slowly become drier and drier and we don't see each other or text each other again. No one puts any effort to know me or spend time with me. I'm always the one listening.

It's very painful and makes me wonder if I'm worth anything to anyone. I have 0 friends at uni. Notifications surprise me. And my social media chats are a wasteland of ppl losing interest in me. 

 Life's getting really low now and there's no one by my side. I feel suffocated and trapped.
I'm in so much pain, and I have no one there for me. I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm all alone and I can't take this much longer.

The pain is crippling. It feels endless. I've tried everything for years. Nothing works and that causes me so much anxiety. I don't want this to be the theme of my life but I'm losing hope.

I'm so grateful for what I have received in life (uni, heating in my room) but I'd do anything for someone who loves me. Anyone who pushes me to be a better person everyday. Enjoys my presence.

It's currently 2 am where I live, I supposedly have gone to sleep before midnight. I gotta wake up at 8, but i don't believe I should sleep just yet. If i went to sleep when i should have i would have gotten a resting amount of sleep. I don't deserve it. 

This isn't the only thing. I am a 99% introverted social awkward person. I got a couple of friends, quite amazing ones, but all... seemingly ok ones. Or ones that believe I am ok.

I am not.

On the 7th i broke my knee. For the third time in two years. I have severe problems but because of my weight (BMI 24-25) all the doctors just tell me to lose weight so my bones wouldn't be under such difficulty.

Which is true, and i tried. I got to highest level of performamce my town offered in three sports.

Now I have been bed bound since it happened and will be until after the holidays. 
And then after weeks of stiffness I am expected to go back to school.

This whole sitting in bed and not even talking to anyone becausw my friends have school has brough back the good old depression.

I first dealt with it around Covid time. And what got me through was my boyfriend.

I am aware I don't seem lonely with a boyfriend and friends, but me and him are long distance, currently not on talking terms cause of a situation on his side so I do feel lonely not being able to reach out to him

To my friends I am just a good listener
They don't say it but I figured it out

So I guess when shit happens to me I suffer alone. I am usually a smart quiet nerd that deals with mental health on their own but I cant anymore.

Even in my parents is visible their resentmsnt growing on me. I cant really get out of bed with no help so yeah they try their best. But also take any oportunity to get away from me which I notice

I want to go back to at least playing ok, but I can't.

I also have Maladaptive daydreaming which makes me think i got company and then I realise i am just all alone.

I started this downhill spiral when I was a freshmen in high school when I made a very bad decision that cost me friendships. I kept on going because I had no choice, gained some new friends, but now I feel like I'm missing something. I feel like I should have my old friendships from when I was younger, but they didn't stay. If I could go back and change things, I would, but at the same time the present would be very different if I didn't make the choice that I did. I just wish I had two solid people that I could call friends that know me on a deeper level. I genuinely don't think I can keep this going if this is the way life is going to be. I understand I am the only one that can change things, but damn this shit turns you cold. It's at the point where my friends now have made fun of me for not having any friends from high school.

I'm a man that's approaching 40, I've suffered immense loss this past year, and as a result I'm left feeling continuously lonely. I'm a naturally extroverted person, I really enjoy people, but due to unforseen circumstances my life allowed little in the way of socializing for the past several years now. The reason I feel like sharing this all is because I've tried to understand this growing vulnerability, I know I make friends easily, but I haven't been able to expound upon that and translate it into actual relationships in recent years. Recently I figured I'd just explore the vast options of the internet dating world. Naturally I was hoping to narrow down the dating pool to likeminded people [women in my case] I've wound up feeling like women likely steer clear of these online social avenues, and my open &amp; honest approach seems too forward. I want to take this closing opportunity to simply speak into the ether my intentions. If there is that someone out there who feels this same way, almost unintentionally isolated, whilst also being extroverted, please know I and others like me are searching for you. Yes you're worth the wait, and yes there may be distance between us, but I truly hope to close that distance. I truly hope to find you and once and for all remove myself from the dating pool...and into a fruitful relationship.

4550,zrajmz,Worried-Date1983,"I've been married for 16 years. 16 years of being faithful and staying committed. But it's been rough. Very rough. Her idea of spending time together is watching a TV series with us sitting next to each other on the couch while she twiddles around on Facebook or some other social media platform, living vicariously through other people's lives. She constantly tells me of the things happening to these people in the groups she's part of. 

For 12 years, I was the sole income earner of the house, being able to provide for 4 children and her. Yet hardly a note of appreciation. Hardly a thank you. In fact she complained of not being able to get stuff done around the house and would ask me to help despite the fact she found time to sit for hours surfing the web or playing mobile games. 

The main issue is that she doesn't make an effort to show me love or affection or the aforementioned affection. She knows my love language is touch, but she will go months without initiating. And oh how I've brought it up over and over and over again, but nothing ever changes. The first few times I brought it up, she seemed to get better for a couple weeks, but then just slipped right back into the same ole routine. It's gotten to the point that I reach out to content creators for the affection I'm not getting. I figure that even though it's fake and paid for, it's better than the nothing I'm getting from her now. 

I can be lying right next to her, and feel so far away. I might as well be as she scrolls through Facebook. I'm turning 40 this next year and I am no spring chicken. I can't just go out and get a small dose of affection/attention from a girl just to tide me over. I'd never cheat, but it looks so tempting and becomes harder and harder to resist. 

There's nothing to change, no suggestion that will get me the affection I crave, nothing. Counseling has been a suggestion many times, but it would almost be too painful if she did change her ways as she would have done at the instruction of another person and not the literal begging of her husband.

4554,zrayqi,AltForSadness,"I’ve come to the conclusion that most normal people have a type of privilege that’s never talked about because SO many have it that it isn’t even thought of as such - social connections 

When they say someone who is extremely lonely (such as someone whose never been in a relationship before) is lucky for not having to ‘deal with drama’, they’re showing this privilege

For an analogy: a normal, well-off person who is able to buy and eat consumer food regularly tells a poor, starving person who’s complaining about not eating well; “Don’t worry, food isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It’s just full of fat, which is making my diet harder. You should consider yourself lucky that you can’t eat it, I wish I could be as thin as you”

They’re blatantly missing the point, but because they’ve never struggled the way the poor person is, all they see is their own relatively minor difficulties which they immediately assume are the same problems the starving person faces and prioritizes (hint: it’s not) 

Social privilege is literally this. The vast, vast majority of people have had friends and relationships since they were young, and everyone they surround themselves with likely did as well. So they can’t even comprehend what it’s like for someone who never did, and only see the ‘benefits’ they think it has, like no friends = no drama and no girl/boyfriend = no stress.

And they’ll tell that lonely person that they’re lucky, and they wish they could be like them, yet then go on and continue to have friends and relationships, not even considering the hypocrisy they’re living.

And I want to point out that this isn’t some anti-normal tirade. Despite what it may seem, I’m not at all trying to blame regular people, or say something like “normies are stupid and terrible, they could never understand our suffering”. I’m not saying that lonely people have the worst lot in life, that we need to be pitied in mass or punish normal people for being happy.

Our issues are not anyone’s fault, just a shitty role of the dice of life. 

I wanted to post this because it’s something I think puts words to what many lonely people feel but may not be able to really pinpoint or explain. It may help explain that jealousy or spite some of us may feel towards ‘normal’, social people, and why though it’s definitely not good or healthy to feel, it’s explainable. Why we should work towards getting rid of those feelings, but not feel so horribly guilty and self-hating for having them. 

Because were human too, and just as capable of mistakes and lack of perspective as anyone else. And as long as we’re willing to admit that and work towards bettering it, thats ok.",2022-12-21 05:05:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653544214,19,/r/lonely/comments/zrayqi/lonely_privilege/,,0,10,Lonely “Privilege”

4560,zrbqdx,Scared_Vegetable_197,"So long story, but I have this predicament where bad things always seem to happen at a predictable time, right after things are at their best. You know when you have those days where the stars just seems to align, and you feel like the luckiest person in the world and everything is great? I call these my  ‘perfect moments’ (for lack of creativity). 

The first example I can think of is with a childhood best friend. We had the same birthday, and just before our  18th we went on a mini road trip to take photos and explore (we were really into photography at the time). It was just so much fun, and we shared things with each other that we never had before, and I just felt so light and happy, and like the universe was finally on my side. Two weeks later we were in a car accident, and she died. 

Ever since that incident I can’t seem to escape this pattern of ‘perfect moments’ followed by loss. I just got married, and it was such a beautiful day. One week after we got back from out honey moon our best man passed away suddenly. I could list so many other examples.

 I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has a experienced anything similar? I’ve always assumed it was an irrational fear of mine, but things keep happening to validate it.

4575,zrd6l5,JustThrowmeAwey,"So I really like going for really long walks with my dog, specially in the country side. I use to live very far up north (Central NY, honestly I was very happy over there, albeit very lonely but happy in the forest.) Me and my dog use to go for very long walks. Specially at night  and I it was amazing, except the times when my mind betrayed me and reminds me of the overwhelming hunger that I feel in my chest. I feel how my body is rotting from within. Is like this presence that no matter what you do, when you get home and open your door. You know you have to confront.... Somehow. Yet you are alone and it has all your fears, pains and memories.

So sometimes I just would just sat down and cry, first I would let my dog loose a little since, I feel so guilty letting her fight this. its so embarrassing, yet she comes and I wish I was more for her. 

Still So now I moved back to Florida, living with my family, (feeling even more pathetic.) And now forest area around :( well at least there's a golf course  and there's the night time which I love going on night walks. So 2 nights ago, walking through the golf course feeling alone, thinking, imaging myself walking with someone, holding hands, hugging, just exchanging heat... when it hit me that sensation in my chest, that famine in my heart. and well out of desperation I just hugged a tree.... yes I hugged a tree, it felt rugged and sharp against my cheek but it was warm, and that night it was cold. I guess it make sense giving tree's sap, idk I guess next time I'll imagine is a girl taller than me lol.

4577,zrd9eo,Academic-Leather-833,"I want to preface this by saying this is my first time writing anything like this on reddit and I often have a lot of ideas but it might not be clear in words. I have always been comfortable being single and have never pursued romantic relationships or gone on dates, but recently I have become hyperaware of my feelings. This is partly due to past rejections and emotionally charged events that caused me to ignore or move past my feelings in order to move on (noticed I’ve been doing this since 2015). However, a recent situation in which I was vulnerable and expressed interest in a friend, only to be rejected, caused me to spiral and feel intensely nervous for a few days. Since then, I have moved on from my feelings for this person, as this happened months ago, but I have been feeling lonely and longing for a relationship. I am seeking guidance on how to understand and move on from these feelings, and how to replace these thoughts with activities that bring me joy and fulfillment.

TLDR; I've become more aware of my feelings and desires for a romantic relationship, but past experiences have caused me to ignore or move past my feelings. I want some insight on how anyone who's able to relate and has moved on from this feeling.

4578,zrd9zu,Silver-Curly,"I was born in a culture where women are considered a burden&amp; my mother till date ensures that I don't forget it even though I provide for her and am professionally successful. My father died a long time ago &amp; my sibling is self-absorbed. I don’t live in the place I grew up in and am virtually in no contact with my blood family.   


I have been fortunate enough to find some really good friends and support system but they are in different countries or busy raising their families. I have never been lucky in love, most of the men liked to have me around because it upped their appeal in their peer group. 

I have never shied away from approaching someone or taking risks. I have travelled solo, asked men out, moved places but never came across a man who would want to invest in me emotionally and genuinely care about me.

I tried different ways to change my situation but that never happens, OLD, local events, speed dating, blind dating etc. 

Everyone has a family to go back to but I never had that even when I was living with them. I was called an outsider on my face numerous times. I don’t have anyone to share a joke with or hug when I need one. On the other hand, I see people if every kind  having someone. They all have someone or a home to go back to, while I end up being alone no matter where I am. If I were to die tomorrow, no one will find me for days. 

I want someone to answer this for me why is that I ended up alone with absolutely zero support when I need one? How is that I keep trying and still nothing changes for me.

I felt angry at myself for letting this happen. I think was caused it was just how the meeting was going, I have one every two or three months, and when we do have it to see how I have been over the period of time, it’s always the same, more bad days then good, having depressive episodes that last weeks and then having highs that can last a few days if lucky.

I mean, I don't really know the code of friendship or what you're expected to do in a friendship or whatever else. I know right from wrong but what I mean is that I don't feel like I'm qualified enough to have that thing we call ""friendship"". 

I've been alone for most of my life and I've never really had to have friends in my life and I still technically don't have any friends at all because I wouldn't even count those as ""true genuine friendships"" since it happened online and I don't really consider those as ""true genuine friendship"" because people can be really dishonest online and you're more likely to come across a lot of drama during the friendship as well.

 And sometimes I wonder that maybe I'm better off not having friends because I do have a feeling that once I do make a few friends in real life that I won't like it at all. Because I do enjoy my own presence a lot of the time, it's only in times of crisis that I'd prefer to have some friends here and there but when I'm all good and when I'm doing fine I don't really feel like I need company or anything of that sort.

 It's gotten so bad I had to just get off dating apps because I was constantly being berated or made fun of. I don't even think I'm that unattractive. The loneliness is crippling but also just constantly being told I am not enough for people.

My top anime are Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, steins gate, Vinland saga and the movie I want to eat your pancreas. Yeah what a name but 10/10 romance anime movie. And I have more favorites but wanted to keep the list somewhat short. Oh and I really like bats, fruit bats specifically. I enjoy cooking, mostly Asian style. But I used to work at a bbq place.

2022 started bad, very bad. I had an horrible task to do, and to manage it, i was used to spent 14H per day on it. It lasted 6 month. Led to a lot of mistake due to tiredness and a lot of other stuff.

It got so bad that my boss decided to put me under an evaluation period to see if he should fire me or not.

1 month later we learned my mother had an advanced cancer, and my father cut the bridge with me (yeah, not a great year).

So, despite my...not great mental state, i worked my ass like crazy, and i managed to NOT get fired at the end of the evaluation period.

Infortunately it's not like in a movie. I passed with 51% basically. Get scolded about my work, and made understood that it had to improve imperatively.

So i worked to improve... and i think i have. But a colleague call me to tell me i was very close to get fired and needed to improve.

So i did, and i think it worked somehow, but the same colleague told me the same thing.

And now i just learned my manager plan to see me in january...just before getting 2 errors -\_-

I try, i swear i try. And i think it works, a bit.

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further, every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness, taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me
Can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Bye...

I know what your going through is hard
Harder then it’s ever been
You seem very lost &amp; alone &amp; stressed out &amp; sometimes even heavily depressed like you have most of your life
You might blame yourself for things that aren’t even your fault
You believe your fathers relationship never worked out because you weren’t a good enough son
You see your parents cheating on each other &amp; constantly avoid it but it still brings you down
Your siblings have out grown you, all your exes cheated on you, your friends went down a terrible path so you became a person with heavy abandonment issues
You cant trust anyone except yourself &amp; it shows with how very cautious you’ve been with who enters your life but you still want someone to talk to
You often help others out by letting them vent &amp; making sure their okay, because it is the right thing to do &amp; you are a good person but sometimes you want the same back but are too scared to ask
Your scared of getting attached to anyone because everyone seems the same &amp; will either hurt you or you’ll hurt them
You’ve cried but nobody notices it, you can’t reach out because of trust issues
You haven’t been in love in 2 years, maybe your just growing or your still looking for someone who’s mature enough 
School brings a lot of pressure on you &amp; it’s gets too heavy that you eventually feel not good enough or worthless &amp; feel like giving
But your still pushing but also bottling everything up &amp; yk the outcomes 
You just want someone to listen &amp; understand what’s been stressing you out, but they all seem the same

Constantly questioning yourself if your doing the right thing or not

Interested? Well say howdy and let's be partners (cowhoy pun, mean it as friends, but with the right person who knows)

I can get very attached and be very clingy and needy. 


To tell you a bit about myself. I'm about 22, male, demi sexual (personality and connection are all that matters), that said I lean towards guys because women have hurt me a lot and the dynamic of the relationship is better for me. I love anime and play games on PC. Recently been playing bf1, valorant, dead by daylight and cod dmz. But I have tons of games. My top anime are Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, steins gate, Vinland saga and the movie I want to eat your pancreas. Yeah what a name but 10/10 romance anime movie. And I have more favorites but wanted to keep the list somewhat short. Oh and I really like bats, fruit bats specifically. I enjoy cooking, mostly Asian style. But I used to work at a bbq place. I've also lost 115 lbs and kept it off for a while now. 



So many people in this sub only want sex or a relationship. I'm not against a relationship but please let it happen naturally. And the friendship comes first",2022-12-22 00:50:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670076914,2,/r/lonely/comments/zs77jv/friend_wanted/,,0,0,Friend Wanted:

4714,zs86gt,scuttlebuttlee,"hi everyone. as i stated in the title this is my first year in college in a different city far from home. i never had many friends, to be spesific i have 2 very close friends and thats almost all i got. i was always an introvert through my life especially in high school and i was enjoying it. but when i came to college far from friends and family i guess i lost all the distraction and realised what kind of loser i am. there is actually one (1) friend from college i get along with well enough but thats not the problem, everyone around seem to have large friend groups that consists girls as well (unfortunately yes, this is the actual deal). before coming here i never gave a fuck about being in a relationship or talking to girls, i had crushes and i used to do surprisingly well talking to them, one of them i even dated. well as i said after coming here i started to feel like i MUST have a girlfriend or at least some females around me and this thought is killing me. before i was like if i have a crush i'll talk to her but other than that why should i bother myself, now i feel like i am in need of it. it might sound like overdramatizing, at first it was my opinion as well but no this shit is driving me crazy. surely it has something to do with hormones but that cant be all. i lost the ability of loving myself, i dont value the things i am good at anymore and i always focus on bad shit. and this creates a paradox, there is no way i am approaching women with this low confidence. to be honest i dont really want to chase someone just because they look nice i dont think this is healthy.
so basically i created a fucked up mindset that i am not worth anything as long as i only have males in my life. i am completely aware that this is bullshit i just cant get myself out of it. i live in a circle of going to uni and coming back while same terrible thoughts are preventing me from enjoying my hobbies or enjoying life in general. spending time with friends distracts me for a period of time but after that everything becomes same. if this is just because my body is trying to make me fuck someone i will go mad i swear. maybe it is because so many things changed in my life at once and i have bigger responsibilities. maybe it is a mix of all three. i dont really know i am so confused.

i just realised it is way longer than intended. apperantely i was sweeping these thoughts under carpet for a long time. also i see my issue might not sound that serious, especially compared to other stuff i have read here. but i really feel terrible. perhaps my use of language while writing is not reflecting this fact.",2022-12-22 01:31:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671669350,2,/r/lonely/comments/zs86gt/this_is_my_first_year_in_college_and_i_feel_lonely/,,0,1,this is my first year in college and i feel lonely

4720,zs921a,[deleted],"Outside of family I only have three friends in the entire world. I literally don't talk to anyone else. They tell me everything, but after breaking up with my online ex-gf who I never even saw irl earlier this year and then fumbling an amazing girl after makes it harder to talk to them.

One of them has been in a relationship for the last 7 years. Before it was cool when she'd talk about her relationship but now all I feel is sadness when she does. The other day she mentioned while voice chatting with us that she's going on a trip with her bf next year. While she went on about the cute things they'll do I started weeping in silence. Another friend just started dating a girl and everything's going well. The other night I played some games with him and he said after we finish he was gonna call her for the rest of night. He also mentioned how she baked him cookies. I'm glad he didn't see my tears after he said that. The last one is still single, but he moved away two years ago (I think I cried for a solid week when that happened) and works nights so it's hard to commiserate with him. But he's living on his own now which he loves so that's great.

I'm not mad, or sad, or jealous, or upset at them. I want her to continue relationship with her man. I want my other friend to make that girl he's seeing his. I want my single friend to find a girl where he lives. I want all of them to be happy and healthy and with someone. Once that happens I can finally be alone again. It's what I deserve. It's fucked up but I guess I want to be left behind.

Girl trouble is already something I deal with enough and then doing this just feels pathetic. Idk how to tell them to just chill out and stop cause I know their intentions are good, just can they accept she doesn’t like me that way like I already have. As much as I hate it, I just want to be alone. I don’t care about the romantic part of my life anymore.

4755,zsdndw,CrazyEvery3682,"So I have only 4 friend's and they are all a bunch of rich, entitled, egotistical narcissists, but I love them even though they always bully me, make fun of how ugly I am, pick on me all the time and try to get rid of me when a group of girl's approach them at clubs.

But I roast them and make fun of them too and they are there for me when I'm struggling with my mental health, they help me out and always are willing to help.

But last night I was at one of their's house party where it was us 4 and some other friends from college that I barely talk to, I got into heated arguement with one them.

And as I mentioned I suffer from mental health issue's, when ever I argue with someone I get a feeling of crying, so I drank alot of alcohol and started to shout and yell, and then here's the thing drunk me is a different person.

I pulled the guy I was argueing with in a corner made up with him, started partying around and going absolutely crazy and I lose all control when I am drunk but other's were acting like it to.

But then the guy's whose house we were at his parent's showed up, and even though everyone was drunk and fucked, I was the most of them all, so they decided collectively to kick me out of the house from the back door, only me out of all the people in the party.

Now I know I can go completely crazy when drunk and be a huge liability but I personally think that this was it, kicking me out of the house during winter at midnight, but then the guy's whose house we were at and 2 more guy's made me sit in their car and dropped me home saying "" I hope you don't feel bad but we have to get rid of you""

That literally made me feel alienated, idk what to do?",2022-12-22 05:40:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611859103,1,/r/lonely/comments/zsdndw/am_i_just_that_big_of_a_liability/,,0,1,Am I just that big of a liability?

So now all the people I've met here and all the friend's I've made are rich entitled brat's from business or upper class families, and I like hanging around them because being a business minded person, I get to learn a alot from them.

But here's where the pro's end, they always throw lavish parties and invite me and expect me to do the same even though I can't afford it, they alway's talk about business, their properties, their mercs and bmws, their money and stuff while I just sit quiet in the corner with nothing to talk about.

And me being quiet lead's to me being bullied, as they know I bring nothing to the table for them so they think they have the right to bully me, make fun of me all the time and tell me how ugly I am, and all that stuff.

But I have no other friend's here and can't go over the process of making new, I just want to become a someone of value, someone who bring's something to the table.

4768,zsegrx,____Raven____,so i think i’m finding out a new aspect of myself that’s kinda of terrifying me rn. for context ive been doing a lot of major work on myself over the last year since i got out of a very toxic relationship. essentially i only interacted with my ex and ending up being forced to adopt a lot of her toxic feelings towards me friends and family out of threats of her killing herself or leaving me. kinda a stockholm’s syndrome/trauma bond type thing. long story short i ended up making one of the best decisions (go our separate ways) and found out new things abt myself such as the fact that i’m not straight lol. but i recently found that i’m horrible at socializing and meeting people. I don’t mean that i’m just awkward i mean the fact that i feel frozen in fear when meeting new people and even people that i haven’t seen in a long time (a few years or more). i don’t know what to do anymore. even online friendships end up becoming hard to want to continue. i’ll talk to people out of genuine want and desire to make new friends and socialize but after a day or two it becomes hard to want to talk to them. i don’t mean to sound like i’m just leading people on and ghosting others. i genuinely want to form new relationships and make new friends since i essentially have none outside my family. i just get this really uneasy feeling and don’t trust that these people actually enjoy my company. im sorry abt this post being so long but if you read the whole thing thank you i think you’re a wonderful human being 🖤,2022-12-22 06:21:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1500990146,1,/r/lonely/comments/zsegrx/i_think_i_have_issues/,,0,2,i think i have issues

I’m gonna rant I’m just tired 
I just dropped out of 12th grade, been home since 2019 and can’t get out of bed.
I started isolating when I was severely bullied for my weight and looks, lost shit tons of weight (I’m anorexic), got back into the world, and boyyy was I given the most amount of attention I felt like I was immortal, got severely slut shamed and now I’m right back to isolating. Little do they know, I’m literally a virgin who can’t drive. I’ve been diagnosed with bpd, adhd, ednos, ocd and clinical depression. My Asian parents have just been calling me lazy for the past few months and stopped buying food for me cause apparently I don’t deserve it because I’m good for nothing and stay in bed all day. I did gain half the weight back since isolating again but I don’t look sick enough so my parents don’t give a shit. If I was skinnier I bet they would’ve cared (how needy and desperate that sounds jeez), it’s gonna be Christmas in two days and I’m dreading it. Everyday I lie in bed and hear my parents laughing with my sister and congratulating her on doing so well at school, it really hurts lol, they once told me that I was just a failed experiment  and that they’re gonna succeed with my sister. My dad forced me to go for therapy but after one session he said i wasn’t worth spending so much money on, and that I didn’t deserve it. I’ve tried picking myself up multiple times but no, it always ends, the same way over and over again. I was a top A student, always chased academic validation, had loads of potential but now since I’ve lost interest in everything I loved to do I’m unworthy and undeserving of anything good, I’ve come to a conclusion that they’re right. I’ve pushed all my friends away so much to the point that no one checks up on me anymore, no one stays because I don’t let them. It’s like I died six years ago and now I’m just a walking corpse. Reaching out doesn’t help either, I’ve done that multiple times too. I’m always the one who’s used, the last priority, the failed experiment, the one who hates everyone and thinks they’re better than the others. I don’t know what it’s like to love or be loved.

Originally, I intended to use that to get out of my shell, but instead things have gotten much worse. I am now disconnected from my family but meeting new people did not work out. Talking to strangers face to face makes me feel uncomftable and I never feel like there is a connection. I wouldn't say that I am too introverted or have social anxiety, but I grave more attention than just small talk. However every friendship or relationship starts very platonic and surface-level, so I don't know how to get the doors open.

Reading through other posts here makes me feel somewhat better, because I know that I am not the only one who struggles with this problem.

4797,zshgfg,curiousguy_19,So like 2 years ago i met a girl on reddit. Since then we’re in a LDR. We’re like really far away (Im in Europe and she in the US) we FaceTimed and chatted a lot. Sadly for Time and money reasons we never were able to meet. But i told her that in 6 months (meanwhile almost 5) i will be able to visit her to 100% because by then I’ll get just enough Money. But she said its a long time and then…was gone…she now didn’t replied for almost a month. I am also afraid something happened to her but i think its more likely she just ghosted me. Even trough she was perfect and I’ll never get her out of my Mind. I’ll never not love her and still i look into my phone every morning after waking up and hope she answered me just to get disappointed. But she was really so perfect but honestly the worst thing is not even that she’s not with me but thats she’s probably with someone else and just to think about that another guy gets this perfect girl and i don’t even trough i had the chance to makes me so extremely angry and sad. Even trough she isn’t i meanwhile wish that she was just fake and in reality some weird guy because then i wouldn’t have lost someone so perfect. I don’t even know what to do anymore. Can’t stop thinking about her and being sad.,2022-12-22 09:03:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627498787,4,/r/lonely/comments/zshgfg/probably_ghosted_by_ldr_gf/,,0,2,Probably ghosted by ldr gf

4799,zshj84,207Scorpion,Just needed a place to get this off my chest. My whole life I’ve never had a gf and I started to think that maybe I was just incapable of experiencing romantic love for anyone. I (mid-20’s m) finally met a woman that I began to fall in love with but she is with another man. After a BIG misunderstanding in our last conversation together she claims I made her feel hurt and cut me off entirely… I just don’t know what I’ve been doing with my life anymore. This woman made me crave that emotional/romantic connection for the first time in my life but if I feel like if I’m just going to inadvertently cause someone I’m close to any kind of pain then why even bother. We were so close for months and she still misunderstood what I was trying to say that day and now wants nothing to do with me. It’s a few weeks later now and I’m still mad at myself and feel like I’ll probably never meet someone I can love being around like I did her again.,2022-12-22 09:07:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1574748261,1,/r/lonely/comments/zshj84/confused_and_heartbroken/,,0,1,Confused and Heartbroken

4801,zshxbx,thisandthatandmyhat,"Long story short: Will get divorced next year, recovering from a anxiety mental thing, which I faced over three years (almost good), my family got covid and cancelled our christmas party last minute. 

I have no one to go to, my few friends that live in my area are at their families. So my christmas will be stupidly alone the first time for 10 years. 

It's not, that I won't go outside and enjoy life as it is, but as an introvert with self-doubt (getting better) it's hard to find new friends. 

If I'm in a group (even at big parties) I have no problem at all to speak to people and connect, it's just hard in daily life to, I don't know how to start. Party connections won't usually last long.

I feel like I some kind of failed in life, sitting here alone in my flat on christmas after a marriage.

4821,zsm75i,zzzzzzzzzzzzap,"Every relationship.

From nearby or afar; from those with shared hobbies or from childhood. Or family, even. Every. Single. Literally, last, lamentable relationship.

Laughably lamentable, as if you could even consider any of these text message snippet exchanges a relationship...

...as if I didn't feel ridiculous myself when the entirety of my social interactions are staked over an iPhone app or another, because make no mistake – I'm not that naive – I do understand it:

It's text. Fucking text. Sure, this writer here always keeps text on a pedestal. Sure, this writer stretches his arm and leg out for his text to convey as much humanity as possible into his every word, and somehow compensate for Text's inherent limitations, but...

...but it's still just fucking text... apparently, and that's a very fucking *fucking* right there for people — a quoted ''fucking'', if you will — from each of these recipients minds at, surely, I'm sure, just a glance over my text. My fucking text. My motherfucking text, put it like that.

Is it funny? Is it emotional? Is it a transsexual furry piece of confessional erotica? Ah, forget it. It doesn't matter. It can't have mattered. It definitely didn't, not with all the silence that's come to ensue as of late. That's as of a rather long late, maybe a month or so, actually, that I quit.

Yeah, I quit. I'm done. I quit the fucking texting. No more fucking texts. No more initiatives, at least. And that's it! I've decided! No more back bending! No more of this nihilistic back and forth(mostly forth) that never breaches any meet; a call, even! Anybody want a piece a' ME TEXTING can inquire first from now on!

&amp;#x200B;

Crickets are lovely creatures. Have you actually ever seen a cricket? They're so stapled for their nightly cries, but no one ever thinks about what they look like. You could ask a 7 year old child to draw one, and at best, you'd turn to a paper of some half-scribbled half-mosquito half-fly. Say it's a dark, quiet(very), isolated, dreadfully lonely and sorrowful evening, and you hear nothing but a \*crick\*crick\*crick\* coming off the woods across the street. You could (imagine yourself) ask(ing) a child what they're hearing, and what'll you hear them eagerly cry, but:

''They're crickets! They're cricket cries, of course!''

Indistinguishable, no less, and they're always crying at night. Sometimes I cry, too, and at night; like the crickets, you could say. I suppose I'm so much a cricket, I wouldn't be so lonely if I joined them and actually saw a crying cricket!

Unfortunately I've not so stapled and loved a cry as that of the cheery crickets, so I keep my sad, wet, cry quiet; unlike the crickets, you could say – or dare I give more notice to the neighbours that every single person in my life is literally, lamentably, and laughably **gone**.

I'm the only one in my friend group and family that wanted kids and won't be having them.  I feel intense grief every day for the version of my life I wanted slipping from my grasp.  I'm developing new paths, exploring being a single foster parent, but it's just not the same.  

I was so ready to be a parent and wife since I was really young.  I'm in my late 30s and the motherhood window is basically closed.  I think I would have been an awesome mom and wife.  I know I was an awesome girlfriend to many guys, but they either never saw me as their longterm partner or they tanked the relationship and I had to leave.  I recently broke up with someone that loved me, but I just didn't love him.  He was a constant liar, infertile without medical intervention, and an awful communicator, and I realized I would rather be single.  Whatever let's people settle, I just don't have it in me.  I can want a partner and kids desperately while still knowing it's better they stay a beautiful dream than reality with the wrong ones. 

I've had so many failed relationships.   I'm attractive enough.  I get plenty of matches in online dating, but people would rather use me physically than date me.  Been cheated on so many times.  Lied to about intentions so many times.  Strung along.  Told I am the best girlfriend, best sex they ever had, told they saw that I will be the best wife and mom, and then been treated terribly.  Never any real commitment.   Rinse and repeat. 

I'm so bitter inside now.  I used to be optimistic and I just feel trampled on now.  Discarded.  As a teenager I worked in a nursery, I've volunteered with kids my whole adult life, and in my late 20s I started fostering animals because I needed to set my maternal nature on something to care for.  I've met so many parents that are terrible and clueless and I just am so envious that they still get a family and I don't.  

I have advanced degrees, have had success in various careers, no debt, I'm not skinny but am an active person that does triathlons, hikes daily, goes skiing, and volunteers often. I'm a great cook and baker and raise money for charities teaching pasta making classes.  I do have good friends but they aren't very present in my life anymore since they have their own families.

I tried making plans with the only two true friends i have today and my dad and brother who i live with left who were gonna drop me off ended up leaving while i was in the bathroom and our plans got cancelled for the third time. I’ve only gone out once to hangout since my breakup and i feel so incredibly lonely, my ex is out partying with her boyfriend and got into substances and drinking and has a new friend group and invited all of our mutual friends including my two friends to a christmas party without me. she was my everything, we had such an intense connection and we were together for over a year and i relied on her so much and then she left just like everyone else in my life when she promised she would never do that. it’s so hard to process how somebody can just give you their all and treasure you so much and tell you all these things and then betraying you and leaving you like you were nothing. i have nobody. nobody. it’s so hard healing from a breakup when i only have myself and nobody wants to spend time with me or appreciates all the effort i’ve put in. i’m constantly reminiscing or desperately looking for bits of hope that she’ll come back and there’s really nothing to distract me besides video games and tv and i’m so tired and exhausted all the time. i can’t even drive because i don’t have a car and my dad doesn’t allow me to use his so i can’t go to the gym or go out to hangout anywhere, im just stuck at home 24/7. my abandonment issues were bad before when i kept losing friends every year for years on end for reasons they didn’t even tell me what i did or could’ve done wrong, just ghosted me. but now they’re even worse, i thoight i had something different with my ex and that things were gonna be different this time but she left. i should’ve expected this honestly, i always end up alone no matter the circumstance, all i really have is myself. i’ve been trying so hard to improve and work on myself during this time but it’s genuinely so difficult when i rarely can talk to people and sometimes i feel like im losing my mind, i’ve resorted to cutting and it’s helped me a little to stay more grounded and sane but even that doesn’t help much anymore. i can’t even do my schoolwork or work on college applications because my mind is chaos all the time, and the depression is so bad it’s unbearable. i don’t think i’ve ever felt this depressed before in years, i feel like giving up. i feel so done",2022-12-22 16:41:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659508879,3,/r/lonely/comments/zsqi85/i_tried_so_hard_i_feel_like_giving_up_now/,,0,7,"i tried so hard, i feel like giving up now"

4848,zss1vw,No-Abbreviations1720,"Just saw this sub and thought I would see and share my experience. I see a lot of people looking for people to fill the void to avoid being lonely, which I feel is wrong.
For me I constantly need someone in my life , be a friend to chat with, a gf to spend time with , family to spend time and talk. But deep down , I am scared of being with myself. 
And most of all I feel the social media is the cause of most of the lonely feeling as we are projected with happy faces , but it’s a lie. When I talk to them, they are more or less lonely as you and me. 
I thought having people around would make me more happy , but it doesn’t, or maybe having a partner will ease the loneliness, it doesn’t. If you depend on people for loneliness, it becomes a trap, as when they leave , you are again lonely.
 My observation , I like people , but too much is smothering. I like going out ,but if too much is forced I would rather watch movie or something with a drink or two. I need love , but too much made me break up. I am not reaching out to friends and people I used to talk and crib why are they not reaching out to me.

4859,zstcwk,theoretical_love,"I didn't have the greatest time at secondary school - being a closeted bisexual woman with homophobic friends didn't exactly lend itself to the creation of many wonderful memories. I am thankful that I definitely have better friends now, who are considerate of my feelings and accepting of my identity. Instead, I'm faced with a new form of loneliness - the lack of a romantic partner is making me feel hopeless, and it's only been exacerbated by seeing all the cute couples on campus. I want to be okay with being alone, but it is so hard.

I want to build a connection with someone. I want to fall in love. It's just so hard to put yourself out there in a city where everyone always looks so busy. Who I am certainly doesn't help matters either - I'm angry at myself for not being more extroverted and outgoing, in a way that would actually attract and entice people. I don't smoke or drink, so I don't venture into clubs or bars, which doesn't exactly help my situation. I wish there was some sort of café hopping event that I could join, where I could meet somebody cute and fall in love, but things just don't pan out like that.

Anyways, this was just a little rant to make myself feel better. I'm only 19 - I'm sure that I'll eventually meet someone. It all just feels a bit rotten right now though, and writing it all down helps to get the negativity out of my system.

I don't know if she was who she sounded like on her profile, I don't know if the charming personality behind her soothing messages was authentic, but she did get me to the point where I didn't care about any of these.

I posted a small rant on a different account and that was how I met her. She commented on it, consoled me, told me that everything was going to be ok, and offered to talk to me and be my friend. That was a kind of kindness that I had never before seen. She inspired me to offer a hand to anyone in need even if they were strangers on the internet because she made me realize what it feels like to be in your absolute lowest and have a helping hand reach out all of a sudden.

We chatted for weeks and everything was going smoothly. We talked about all kinds of things, we got good glimpses on each other's lives and we were the best of friends that complete internet strangers can be. One day, she didn't respond to the text that I sent. I waited and waited and waited but no response. I didn't want to be creepy so I never confronted her and asked her about anything and then just dropped it and decided to wait. Months passed and I started missing her more and more. She definitely opened reddit and commented and even made her first post and completely changed her avatar. That was utterly strange. I was devastated at the Idea that I might've scared her off or that she might be ignoring me. I read through the weeks of Chatting that we had and not a single message on my side stood out as a reason to scare her off and not one on hers seemed like a red flag. In every message there was only the best bond any internet friends can dream of.

Her post even made me more concerned and more eager to talk to her. At one point recently I snapped and decided to message her. I made sure to be as respectful and as calm as I could even though I was boiling inside and my heart was racing. I tried my best to not sound confronting and just slightly concerned. Still no response. Her last post and comment were from a while ago and I don't know weather that means she never opened the site yet and hasn't seen my messages or that she did and was just lurking. It just hit me that I only kept that account because I was just waiting for her to come back talk to me and be my friend again, I've always done that but I just realized and accepted it. My mind rejects the Idea that I might have been catfished. I honestly don't know which one would hurt me more; she was a catfish or she just decided to leave me hanging for sadistic pleasure or sudden loss of interest. I don't think I'd like to find out but only time will tell.

4879,zsw1ui,aliidragon,"I’m home from uni right now with a broken ankle and today I found out the closet people I have to calling friends cut me out of our house share for next year. No notice, no warning, didn’t even bother to tell me but the other person they cut out overheard them telling someone they’d put down a deposit on a 5 bedroom. It’s super late to be looking for housing and they’re currently my housemates for the next 6 months. 

I keep going over and over in my head about everything I could have done wrong to them to cause this. I carried them home drunk, I brought them drinks, I offered my food, booze and mixers when they ran out, tried to be there for them and open myself up but I guess it wasn’t enough. Yes I’m anxious my housing next year but I’m more hurt by the people I trusted. If they had just spoken to me about it it’d suck, but I’d understand. It’s the way they didn’t care to tell me, or mention anything about it, or think that it might useful for me to know I needed to find somewhere new to live. I asked about it, they just said yeah we’re living together, not even a halfhearted sorry. So when I’m able to walk again I’m going back to a city where they’re the only people I really know and I’m living with them. I’m dreading the next night out, or worse if they’ve decided we’re done and there aren’t any more nights out and I isolate myself in my room for the next 6 months. 

I thought I was making progress and getting fairly close with these guys, I definitely tried anyway. I found somewhere new for next year but it’s hurts that it’s been about 2 weeks now since I wrote this and not one of them have asked if I sorted something despite me even asking them help when I got really desperate.

4890,zsx16g,Skullcastgaming,"It's 2 in the morning here in India, and I am unable to sleep. As English is not my first language idk if I can express my feelings properly. Idk where to start or where to stop. All I know is that life is getting harder and harder for me bear day by day. Idk if this is depression or I am a somebody with mental issues like my parents sometimes say. Life was not like this half a decade before. Even tho, it had it's flaws, I felt useful you know. There was a me who loved to study, there was a me who always scored full marks in every tests, there was a me who loved to read, there was a me who never gave up on life and always tried his best to stay up, there was a me who lived up to everyone's expectations. It all changed when that corona started. I don't know how to explain it. Due to the fact that all class became online, maybe I got lazy, didn't study properly, maybe played too much games. Idk. After my 10th it all just went downhill, I literally was not able to study like I did, couldn't remember anything I learned properly. Even tho I scored a 86%, i just don't think that I can learn anymore. Currently I am not studying anything. 
I am just staying in my home, playing games day and night, being a useless piece of crap to the world. Day by day I think that I should end this life you know. Like it ain't feeling worthy anymore. I loved just staying home and playing games all day. But now I'm losing interest in that too. It has come to a point that I don't even want to get up from my bed. The only thing that still highly makes me happy and entertains me to every second is playing football. But I don't think it is gonna last long too. 
U could say to me to be just useful, try new things, but the thing is that, I just can't. Its just that. I don't want to. And I've accepted that I don't have a single skill that is gonna make me successful in life. So why live that long. Isn't it better to just end it now?
I mean, I don't even know what to take for higher studies, or what to do next? I just wasted my 1 year thinking about that. Thought about studying abroad, having a new chance, wanted to go Canada, wrote Ielts, was fucked up by just 0.5 marks. Didn't want to write again, coz I can't face the challenge twice. Thought let's go UK with this score, got offer letter, passed pre cas (I HATE INTERVIEWS!!, I DONT LIKE TO TALK AT ALL LIKE PROFESSIONALS DO!!), applied for cas, got rejected in the last second. Now sitting here wasted 1 year while all my so called friends are chasing their goals and dreams. I don't even know why I wanted to go abroad in the first place. I am useless anywhere I go, so why waste my parents extra money. Only thing I really hate and is sad about the same time is that I am the firstborn in my family. My parents did care me a lot, I can say a lot more than my sister. They had a lot of expectations on me, and in some point of my life, I did wanna make them proud. But now I understand that I can never make them proud, and I also understand that they have also lost that dream .how fucked up can this life be dude! When will it be all fair? Only if I was able to see what my future will be, I could have had the guts to keep going. Currently I am just tired dude, Can't stand up, can't work, can't move on. Just want to end this all. But can't because I am even scared and lazy to  do that. 
Tried talking to my parents, it didn't work, Dont have a lot friends, so that's not gonna work, did go to a few counsellors here and there, didn't work.

**I would be really really happy if somebody (psychologist, psychiatrist, IDC) could please guide me to a future that I can be proud of, before I fucking kill myself**

Currently I don't think I can keep this up soon. All I do is Sleep 4 am, wake up on God knows when, could even be 4 pm, then tries to be happy for moment, then cry the whole night blaming myself for being useless and repeat. Mom is coming from abroad this 26th and I don't think she'll be happy to see me all. 
Coz Ive hurt her a lot, A lot!!
My family too.
I really dont deserve to be alive. 
Like I'm useless and at the same time is hurting others too.

My name is Benji Kaveladze and I am a PhD candidate in Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine. My team and I are conducting a study about an online self-help program we developed to help people overcome loneliness. Our ultimate goal is to distribute the program for free online as widely as possible, but first we need to experimentally test if it is effective.

The study takes place entirely online, is confidential, and was approved by the UC Irvine ethics committee. Some participants are eligible to receive $10 for participation – you'll find out if you're eligible about a minute into the survey. Here's the link to participate: [bit.ly/teamzot](https://bit.ly/teamzot).

I very much appreciate your attention. Please don’t hesitate to DM me if you have any questions, or email me at [bkavelad@uci.edu](mailto:bkavelad@uci.edu).

I couldn’t possibly fathom looking for someone else yet or be intimate with anyone yet.  He harassed me by phone and even called work many many times to the point that my boss had to block his number, he still managed to get through to try to talk to me through two other companies in the same building and has continued to email me saying how much he loves me and it’s been hard and painful to stay silent.  I suffer in silence and have anxiety about having to move on without him because he can’t be honest and work on being truly committed to staying clean.  He emails saying how he only loves me and it’ll be a VERY long time before he moves on.  Yet, looking over Instagram with MY pictures all over and using my full name saying he’s with me in a relationship I am constantly seeing him wrote comments on women’s Instagram pictures- yes - I have stalked a little bit can you blame me?! I walked away out of necessity hoping he’d wake up and make changes so his kids could have a father (not my kids with him) but instead he’s out there chasing tail a week after the last email he sent of how much he loves me and all the bull about how he wouldn’t move on for a long time.  It’s hard not to call him out in his shit but it hurts so much that he’s out there chasing ANYTHING.

4934,zt3s2l,LonelyandLosing,"I understand the whole concept of being an ""old soul"" with an appreciation for historical eras (I am one myself), but this is quite different.

So, to reiterate, is anyone else nostalgic for portions of their past that never happened?

For example, I imagine myself seven years ago, at the tender age of seventeen.

I'm the football champion at my high school in this reality and for still being an introvert at heart, enjoy great renown. I'm a kinder, calmer person in this reality, yet I am not afraid to stand my ground in any conflicts that come my way.

I actually said yes to that girl that liked me, and I'm glad that I did! I yearn to return to those days of warm embraces, coupled with cool ocean breezes under glistening golden sunsets.

After high school, I actually made that decision to enlist in the Navy and furthermore, I get accepted to Nuke school. After my discharge, I'm able to climb to a high level in my field of work and enjoy a steady six figure salary.

Now, at the age of 24, I'm a happily married man. With the love of my life, I travel the world and become acquainted with many cultures. A large home in the country acts as our homebase, and we share it with a few cats and a couple of dogs. If I do have  kids, they're still over a decade away, but my wife and I don't mind. We're free to do as we please. Life couldn't be better.

Then, I wake up.

Right now, I'm sitting at my reasonably paying albeit unfulfilling job. I spend my life here, all day, every day.

I've never had the girlfriend that I've dreamed of and hardly even have friends. I'm on the neverending journey to oblivion and there is no way of stopping it.

The calmness and confidence of my imagined self  is just that, imagined.

Images of an actual happier past vanish into the quicksand mentality of ""it didn't matter"" and my imagined past, and a yearning for it continue to torment me. Why must it be like this?",2022-12-23 02:10:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652838026,7,/r/lonely/comments/zt3s2l/is_anyone_else_nostalgic_for_a_past_that_never_was/,,0,0,Is anyone else nostalgic for a past that never was?

I stayed home for college and just graduated nursing school with an associates degree. Most of the women in my program were married with kids, so there wasn’t much opportunity to make friends with anyone. I have had two relationships since my first love in high school. The second was a rebound relationship after my first one and the third relationship was with a toxic narcissist. I thought I had healed from my first love but it’s been 5 years and I still haven’t. I hate that I haven’t. My family is extremely toxic too. I cut my dad off due to past trauma and I currently live with my alcoholic mother. My brother lives in Michigan and doesn’t ever really text or reach out at all. My sister and I used to be super close, but I’ve gotten to the age where I’ve began to call out bad behaviors and she doesn’t seem to acknowledge her own so it’s impossible to be around her now.

4962,zt5qbb,[deleted],"\[19M\] I've been lonely (even if I used to be more numb and apathetic to my situation than I am now) since middle school. Sure, I've had friends, but not people that I would hang out with outside of high school (except one friend). That all changed during COVID and then senior year of high school, when I opted to take classes at a nearby college so I wouldn't have to take as many geneds when I actually went to college.

For most of my senior year, while I was preparing to go to college, I was hoping that college would be some magical place where everything changed and I wouldn't be so damn alone anymore and I'd have friends who I can do stupid shit with and I could engage in the ""college experience"". I even went to therapy for most of my last semester at high school to identify some of the issues that I thought I had and work through my social anxiety. It's hard to work through a lot of that and really make progress when you don't talk to people too much, though, and long story short I finished my first full semester of college and I'm still fucking alone.

I thought that because I was going to a large state school, there would be so many different people that it would actually be super hard for me to NOT find my people or whatever (god, i hate that saying. ""you'll find your people eventually"" please shut up they don't exist), but I was absolutely wrong. It's so fucking hard to make friends here. Sure, it's more diverse than my old high school, but I feel like somehow the people here are MORE closed-minded than the people from highschool. Nobody here will want to be your friend unless you're just like them and fit into their group or whatever - whether you're a partier who prioritizes looking good on social media, or an international student who will instantly make friends with literally everyone else from your country, or a  part of any other community. That kind of sucks for people like me who didn't have friends leaving high school, are not a part of any community, aren't socially confident and have never been to a party before, don't have any real high school experiences to talk about that everyone else had, etc.

I feel like I'm behind everyone else and that I'm completely detached from a social ecosystem that I can never be a part of. That's what I'm spending my winter break thinking about. In a sense, I'm the most fucking normal white person in existence, and yet I feel so foreign and alien having literally none of the experiences that everyone else my age and my demographic has had. And what I'm thinking is, I CAN'T do this another semester. Especially if this is going to be my entire college life, wasting away alone while my schoolwork continues to become harder and harder and I have less and less to look forward to. It's going to be the figurative death of me, and I'll die alone without having died alone just yet.

i don't know what went wrong. i tried going to clubs and talking to people there (spoiler alert after 3 clubs i lost motivation for the semester and was only reminded about how tribal and closed off most communites on campus are unless you're literally just like them). I tried talking to people in my classes. They weren't interested. I don't know. I hate existing. I hate being alone. I shouldn't fucking be alone at my age when everyone else isn't. I don't know what to change or how. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Why was I made like this? What did I do to deserve this? How come I've been selected to be put into the category of people who actually have to worry about social interactions and dying alone, rather than the category who can just idfk live their life and not have to worry about any of this and still be surrounded by tons of friends?

man. I'm writing all this because I saw some person on here give out some advice that was meant to send the message of ""college is a place where you can change and make friends and have a great time even if your high school experience sucked."" That's NEVER something I'll experience.",2022-12-23 03:55:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/zt5qbb/social_interaction_in_college_is_impossible/,,0,6,social interaction in college is impossible.

Even worse, she is one of my closest and only friends I have left (the only one to be honest). Closing her out of my life would ruin me and leave me with literally nothing. 

Does it ever get easier? I can't find it in me anymore to go out and meet people. I feel as though I wasted all l those years and I don't want to hurt again but the loneliness is crippling. I wish I had never loved but in the end I want to because otherwise this feeling just eats you alive.

It does not help I was fired months ago earlier in the year and I just don't have the money to meet another girl. No girl wants a poor dude working through all this emotional pain and endless job searching.

5010,ztc76z,New-Fig-4247,"I've thought about posting here so many times just to vent about so many different things

But I always decide not to post because I fear I won't be able to correctly put how I feel to words, even now I fear that this isn't entirely what I feel

First I'd like to make it clear that I'm incredibly grateful for my few close friends. They really mean the world to me. 

One of the scariest things for me is to talk to new people. I am incredibly awkward and shy with strangers. I would like to say that I don't care about what people think. But I care a lot. Often times I can't even seem to mutter a word. I'm just silent and invisible. Talking to new people can be the most stressful thing in the world

I miss my girlfriend so much. I'm having so much trouble moving on. When I was with her it was the happiest I'd been in years, but now she's no longer in my life. 

I feel as if I'm not longer living because almost all I feel is pure dread. Even in moments of relief, I am almost never happy

Recently I've let my self go. My skin has become an unnatural ugly pale blue. I feel genuinely disgusting. I'm no longer happy or comfortable with who I see in the mirror. I've always had issues with self-esteem, but this is not helping. I'm not helping myself anymore. 

While I'm proud of how I've grown in the last couple years as a person, I think I hate myself. In any moment of silence, my thoughts immediately dwell upon the shitty and idiotic things I've said or done. I wish I could take them back or just forget but I can't. I'll forever be a fucking piece of shit and deserve to fucking die

I am the reason I hate people. People like who I used to be fill me with rage. I fear I'm still that person. 

I want to change, I know I've changed, but I haven't changed enough - or so I think. 

I second guess myself. Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I wasn't as horrible as I thought. Maybe not. I don't know. I'm trying my best to be good. People tell me I'm a good person. I can't believe them. 

In that silence when I'm not thinking about how much I fucking hate myself, I'm thinking about killing myself. I think what was about a week ago, I was so close. I really could have died that day. I don't think I want to die though. I think I really want to live, but I don't know. 

I really hope this doesn't come off like r/niceguys or anything, but I just desperately want a girl to just hold me and tell me it'll be alright. But that's not fair. No one should have to deal with all of my shit. 

I can't help but be a little scared to post this. Maybe somehow someone I know will see this. Maybe not. I just want to vent without being a burden. I'm really sorry if this doesn't quite fit the sub. 

I really hope someone reads this mess.

TLDR; I hate myself",2022-12-23 10:34:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1665638957,2,/r/lonely/comments/ztc76z/i_need_to_vent_and_am_worried_this_title_isnt/,,0,8,I need to vent and am worried this title isn't interesting enough

Iam 18 years old and i was alone for my whole life (no one to have to talk to) and then in january i meet this amazing girl online who has BPD and had a lot of problems in her life and was going through a lot. We started talking constantly the whole day and i was being there for her. After 4 months we were in a relationship and i was sooo happy for the first time in my life and she was also getting better. Then it was july we met the first time in real life and everything was going really good we both were really happy. But then it was november we planned that she was gonna move to me (so from switzerland to belgium) but in the end she was not ready for it and this brought her back down really hard. Meanwhile i was getting a lot of stress from school and was also falling down really hard. In this period ive been a really bad boyfriend and i wasnt there for her and only thinking about myself and i still hate myself for it. Last saterday she had this fondue with her friends and she wasnt texting me a lot what i understood cause she was with friends but after 6 hours of her already being there i got a panick attack and i was trying to get her attention and in the beginning she was trying a little bit to help me but wasnt really that much there and i was just saying that i should search someone else cause she was with friends. At that moment i couldnt take it anymore and i said some things to her i shouldnt have done and ive been asking to forgive me already multiple times but she doesnt accepts it and keeps on pushing me away. Already since the beginning of our relationship ive been looking forward to celebrate the holidays together and normally this was gonna happen at my place but since she is not stable so this got cancelled. For christmas iam not able to come to her but for sylvestet iam but now she randomly has the idea to ask friends and her ex and son to come for sylvester even though i have been asking since a long time if we cant just celebrate it together. Now i already accepted it that her ex and son could be there cause they are family but even this she doesnt accept, her friends should be there. And today she also started to not answer me but coming online to answer other people and she also removed it that i can see when she was latest online on WhatsApp and iam breaking really bad.

5026,ztgiwl,Tzuyari,"One wakes up and the only thing that greets them are the dried tears on their pillow. Another wakes up to their spouse in bed, and all they are thinking about is how they mean the world to them. And another wakes up to their life in a loft with a family they wish they didn’t have, and another wakes up to someone they wish they didn’t have a family with. The takeaway is that everyone is searching for something someone else has, because all they have is loneliness.

In the pursuit of happiness and joy, we rush things. We settle for the next best thing. We think things can’t get better, won’t be better than this, and not always from a lack of trying. Your circumstances could be the answer to someone who wishes they could change theirs.  

I have observed in life the fixation of feminine beauty and the sadness in the hearts of lonely men, and the disconnect of much we need each other, and how much in denial we can be of the necessity and urgency of this bond. We sweep it under hustle culture, self improvement motivational grind, and we are sold this idea that we don’t need anyone to be happy, discouraging us from our biological programming and labeling those suffering from the inevitable side effects as “weak” and “undesirable” and “dependent”. 

There’s nothing wrong with me or you. We just want what each other has, and some of us are willing to lead a life of delusion or not live life at all to make peace with our situations if that’s what we think it takes to take the pain away. The fix must be the opposite of what we feel now.

You need to go ‘discover’ yourself in the mountains of a faraway land, taste the most exotic street foods, and take photos of a skyline with witty captions for social media. The illusion of a solution that will never permeate the true issue with us today. We need love. We need each other.

One feels like they could just die. One feels like they’ve made it. One feels alone in the presence of others. One feels regret and wishes they could trade it for something else. There’s nothing wrong with any of them.

5028,zthrza,Pale-Mud7951,"i have no one to talk to so please hear me out.

my story starts last year, when i was diagnosed with lymphoma. i was devastated, as were my family, friends etc. i didn’t know what to do but i shut all my emotions out and persevered. during that time, i was alone. no one contacted me regularly except my boyfriend. not even my best friends, who i had been friends with for years and years. i was in and out of consciousness due to my very harsh chemotherapy cycles so i could not contact them most of the time. i didn’t think it was a big deal cause we were all in high school, so they must’ve been busy with work and study right? 

anyways, i beat my cancer in december of last year (in remission since ☺️) and was ever so happy and grateful for my life. but due to the limited contact maintained between me and my best friends we never really regained that connection. we just texted every now and then. they would go out without me and i slowly started realising they had established a friend group without me in it. i didn’t think it was a big deal (again) because i hadn’t seen them for months so it was bound to happen. 

then feb of this year rolled around and for some reason they all ghosted me. i was sat at home as i wasn’t allowed at school yet due my compromised immune system. i returned to school in march and they all acted like they didn’t know me, which threw me into depression.

i don’t want to gain sympathy or anything, i just want to be heard. my counsellors do not do anything or even try to help me and i haven’t recovered in the slightest. i have graduated and haven’t gotten into my preferred uni course, but i have no one to share that happiness with except my bf. but i need more people. i cant just have him around.

I’m sure no one cares about a guy who is 23 and depressed for reasons that are incomprehensible to you.

I had it all a girlfriend, friends and a mother who loved me, in my country I had everything but no money I always felt less I always felt like I couldn’t achieve anything I was fit and girls and guys liked me.

I was desperate for money and the idea of success, I gave everything up left behind my relationships, friends and my little but complete family my mother(we talk almost everyday but still she is not with me) and moved to dubai I am successful now, I make a lot of money did a lot for myself but don’t find myself happy, I gained a few extra pounds I don’t have any friends, my social skills are forever lost and atleast based on online experiences girls are not really into me here.

There is no conclusion here or anything that I particularly wanna say I just have no one else now to talk to so the thought of someone going through this message(if anyone) is enough for me.

5043,ztm3zs,Onestop2salvation,Had a hookup recently and although nice it's really just temporary relief. I wanted to see if this could go somewhere but the more time I spend with them I don't feel any sort of spark or connection. Hookups are a nice temporary relief but they are still bittersweet. In my experience lust and loneliness is a more dangerous duo than I expected. But no matter what I just wanted to say do what you gotta do to mitigate this as best you can. Choosing someone based on both is a recipe for disaster. I've reconnected with certain people from my past and regretted it each time. I've now realized it's okay to miss certain people from your past without reintroducing them back into your life. Physical touch is great but you shouldn't be with someone if it's based purely on that. I just turned 35 and seeing all my friends in relationships and settling down sometimes makes me feel like I missed the boat since most of my romantic endeavors happened in my 20s and haven't had a real relationship since. I am still hopeful I can someday find that connection with another person again. And although the internet has enriched our lives in some ways I also feel its the exact opposite in other ways. I know we are all grappling with loneliness but I think all of us need to spend less time online in general. These apps are too addicting. I've made it a habit to go on routinely bike rides during the day and even though I'm still lonely when I come home I feel much better than wasting the entire morning mindlessly browsing through various apps. Anyway I've rambled long enough. I just wanted to vent a little and maybe share some of my thoughts on loneliness in the modern era. Hope it helped and be take care of yourselves everyone.,2022-12-23 16:48:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671397245,15,/r/lonely/comments/ztm3zs/lust_and_loneliness/,,0,19,lust and loneliness

Every year there was someone in my life I expected some sort of emotional gesture from. An unexpected gift, or sudden revelation of otherwise hidden feelings. 

But this year there is no one. About a month ago I was still hoping for it, and it was making me miserable and suicidal. I was scared of that Christmas week approaching.

Now I am just empty. I try not to think. Just blindfold myself until the year is over, and try not to remember what I had done for my 30th birthday (ie nothing).

i’m currently staying in a hotel. i’ll be here throughout christmas day until my adoptive “family” flies back to our home state. i left the others last night because i just couldn’t take it anymore. checked myself into a local hotel and i don’t really know what to do. 

holidays are always hard. they’ve been hard for years, since when i was formally adopted (later in life than most, i was 13). this is the first christmas i’ve had since my biological grandmother died though. have you ever had to grieve someone twice? my bio mother reached out in june to tell me she passed. didn’t tell me anything about her funeral service. i never got to say goodbye, prior to the adoption or her death. the only thing my biological mother told me was that she was glad she gave me away. talk about two slaps in the face back to back, but fuck me i guess. 

i feel so fucking lost. i’m not close to my adoptive mother. she’s the least empathetic person i’ve ever met. constantly disregards any attempt i make to discuss my mental health because she’s decided i should be over everything that has happened to me. my life (18f) has been significantly worse than anything she’s (56) ever experienced (cushy muller middle class white woman with a picture perfect home life). i’m not trying to throw myself a pity party but holy shit i was abused to the point where i had several parasuicidal attempts by the age of 11. her partner is a brash asshole. i don’t speak to my former foster sibling. i’ve pushed most of my close friends away. i’m so deeply unhappy and i’m afraid i always will be. 

i don’t have anyone. i’m alone in a state i don’t know and i’m so fucking sad and i fucking hate christmas. i’ve never had a happy one. i’m always grieving what i’ve lost. i’m so alone.",2022-12-23 23:20:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646260659,2,/r/lonely/comments/ztvnjj/holidays_are_hard/,,0,0,holidays are hard

5116,ztwxsb,Minimum_Mammoth4620,"I know it’s not the most pressing thing on here as i technically do have a few friends. But i feel so lonely sometimes, because nobody i know is into the things i like.

I really love music and clubbing, I grew up on the music and going-out just means a lot to me, it’s the most fun thing for me and makes me feel alive. Now i attract a lot of introvert-types, because I am one myself in all honesty, and generally very open and nice, geeky people. That should sound great, but almost always with this comes being a bit of a homebody, they’re all a bit indie, and all of them would rather have a night in watching movies or playing board games, and that’s all i’ve ever known… when i feel like i’m dying to experience what i love, WITH the people i love, for once. and also in the throes of adhd mood swings, i’ve been out alone and been fine, but that’s increasingly unsafe and any clubber tells me to notttt do that (as they should).

past friends/boyfriends have been mean about it and very dismissive and patronising, that they hate clubbing so much, they think my music taste is stupid, they hate the people that like it, etc. just generally really insulting something that means a lot to me. i’ve always dealt with it, saw their side (i know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea), entertained their boring ideas of fun and generally apologised for myself and minimised myself a lot. i no longer have *these* kinds of people, but even then, the friends i have now haven’t changed. they’re never mean about it, but it’s very obvious they don’t like that kind of thing, over-blow relatively rare things like spiking as excuses (i know it’s a valid concern but… yeah i’m salty… you can’t stop living your life? lifelong sports injuries are way more common but they magically don’t overthink that?) and aren’t even willing to try. like getting my boyfriend of ~1yr to do something for NYE, and all he wants to do is watch a movie, or play card games with our friends. it took a long, worrying convo of pouring my heart out about how much it means to me to get him to agree to have a meal out and watch fireworks, and it ended up he “didn’t feel like” going for some music. argh. i feel like i’m wasting away and rotting, while i actually see people doing the impossible - going out with friends for dance music. 

sometimes when i think about the state of my life and why i can’t attract the people i think i truly want, i want to give up. i know i have lots of self improvement to do on my confidence and emotional regulation, but some dates especially show how unjust and lonely it all is. i do a lot for people even when i’m not into their thing. i feel so isolated that even my boyfriend with anxiety just makes me feel so wronged and angry, that i stop wanting to continue to empathise with him.

thanks for listening, apologies for what probably comes off as very bitter. just a very tired of this shite person who could do with some help, or idk, something.",2022-12-24 00:21:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668624607,2,/r/lonely/comments/ztwxsb/all_the_friends_i_attract_never_like_what_i_like/,,0,9,All the friends I attract never like what I like.

I am 21 and I don’t think I have ever had a genuine friendship in my life and I’m scared I will foreybe alone. What makes this loneliness even worse is that I compare myself to other people and I get stuck on what they do and I don’t. I want to be able to feel comfortable with other people and in social situations. Sorry If I am rambling I’m just venting. Also hopefully this will help me feel not so lonely and not so alone. 2023 I hope to make a friend and maybe find love. I guess the only thing is to keep hope.

I have some redeeming qualities. I'm reliable, hardworking, I'm kind, emotionally supportive, deeply empathetic, compassionate, slow to anger. Sometimes based on those things I make a connection, but eventually people outgrow me. I don't mean just romantically, but platonicay as well. They'll need my support only until they can find something better. In the end, everyone has a choice of someone better than me. I'm simply what someone may have to settle for until something better is within reach. I don't blame them, they deserve something better. 

As it stands now, my kids and my parents are the only ones who'd be truly be hurt by my passing. Sometimes I wish I had that option. I wish I could be like everyone else and have that intangible something inside... if a soul is real, I wouldn't be surprised if I am missing one. I'm literally nothing and I don't know why I'm here.

Does anyone feel the same thing?",2022-12-24 03:13:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670727110,15,/r/lonely/comments/zu0aiq/anyone_else_lack_that_spark_inside_that_makes/,,0,3,Anyone else lack that spark inside that makes them special?

5197,zu478y,goose_man-,"I'm a senior in highschool (female). I've been struggling with the fact that I haven't been able to find a solid friend group all five years of highschool.

Before highschool, I never struggled to make friends. I went to a smaller sized school and basically knew/were friends with everyone there. However, after entering highschool, my once-loud personality became very reserved after having difficulty making friends. I think each year was different, because grade 8 and 10 I struggled to make friends and felt really lonely, while grade 9 and 11 I had fun.

During grade 11, last year- This time, I didn't have a set group of friends, but I was in a situation that I was friends with everyone that I would go around multiple friend groups and talk with everyone. At first it was fun, but I later realized that I didn't have a deep connection with one specific friend group. However, it didn't bother me very much because I met my guy best friend that year. I connected with him like i had never before with anyone else, and he became someone I did absolutely everything with. I had him as my best friend, and just the rest of the side groups as people I talked with just for fun and not anything deep.

Grade 12, my current year, again feels like it's going downhill... The guy best friend and I ended up cutting each other off after we decided to date, and a little while later, he decided to leave me for another girl. That broke our friendship, and now I am just left with those 'friend groups that i wasn't really close with'. I didn't even realize how much I relied on the guy friend as being my main friend until he left, and i could feel his empty presence. Then again, the fact that I had no solid friend group started hitting me again. 

The thing is, no one knows I'm dealing with this or that I have a huge fear of having no friends/being left alone. Because I bounce in between groups and know a lot of people in my grade, everyone thinks I have a fluttering amazing social life and have no issues with friends. In fact, I do naturally have a loud/energetic personality, and I try to show my extroverted side to get closer to people. And yes, it's not like I completely don't have friends. I do have a few close individual friends, but they all come from different friend groups, and I can't seem to fit into any particular group. Because it's the last year of highschool, everyone in each group has known each other for a couple of years, and I can't find a gap to squeeze in between because everyone is so close. 

I think this feeling especially hits harder during winter/spring/summer breaks because every time I go on social media, I find all my other friends with their groups of friends posting about their hangouts and all their parties, meanwhile I'm not invited to any nor do I have anyone to do that with. I feel like I'm constantly sitting there at home worrying about having no friends, and I wish I would stop caring.",2022-12-24 07:00:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613441312,4,/r/lonely/comments/zu478y/anyone_else_not_able_to_find_a_solid_friend_group/,,0,1,Anyone else not able to find a solid friend group?

When a man struggles to find a woman to date or have sex the vast majority of people give that said man horrible advice.

If a man shouldn't go for a woman that is above a 7 and must stay in his own leage it means that the woman is just settling for him and ithat she would better than him if she was given the opportunity.

5262,zuc1qr,J3573R84,"Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year to everyone here. 

If you are lonely, spending the holidays alone or with others but feel alone I just want you all to know you’re not alone with this. I have seen many people post on here with similar circumstances and I myself will be spending my first Christmas and New Year alone. I’m sure we can find a way to have some company with others here since there are so many of us in the same boat this year. 

I put a post on a few days ago but I felt anxious from over sharing and giving away so many intimate feelings and details of my life so I deleted the post. 

I realise it’s not all about me and we are all in this together and that we can all be here for each other. If you are lonely and need someone to chat with I am here and will engage in conversation with you. You don’t have to tell me intimate parts of your life and I won’t ask such questions but if you need a friend I am here and will message back to anyone that needs a friend. 

I enjoy simple things in life such as video games, tv shows, movies and many other things. Even if it’s not a subject I have listed I enjoy chatting with others so share your interests with me and we can chat about them even if it’s not something I particularly enjoy myself I can find interest in them and have no issue learning about them.

I moved back in with my younger sister and parents to cope with the loneliness and I’m lucky I have people around me but my loneliness is so profound it’s enough to make me want to just disappear from this world. I find in my thirties my friends have all dropped off the map! I question whether they ever were friends. It’s exhausting checking up on everyone and then having some people complain that I don’t text enough when I’m becoming undone at the seams. If I don’t reach out to anyone, there might be one person I can really count on now to message but that’s it. Im lucky to have that one true friend but constant social pressure to have loads of friends makes me feel like I’m drowning and that I’ve failed at life. I’ve worked so hard to create this image of a successful girl with a career in finance and lots of people around me… turns out no body is really around anymore. Sometimes I think, these people just see me as an acquaintance whilst I think so dearly of them… I wish I could be more content with myself but I’m just an empty shell of a person after having experienced a physically abusive relationship about 4 years ago. Other times when I have some people text me, I just feel lonely anyway because I’m not truly connecting to them. I feel truly awful today.

5281,zue5d2,Prior_Childhood9437,"Boy and 17 years old, Asian with dark skin color

I have asymetrical face ( really notice even when i wear a mask )

I have dirty face, so many acne scars, many comedo, many pockmarked ( even though i use anti acne face wash everyday )

I'm 5'2 ft, Tallest in my family, Short in public

My body really smell and my perfume couldn't hide it or sometimes make it even worse ( i take a bath twice a day )

My breath smell bad, and my teeth are not in a good looking

I never been in a relationship ( couple ) in my life, so i am lonely. I'm not joking, i am REALLY lonely 

People said that i'm mumbling every time i speak, so they always ask like ""huh?', ""what you say?"", ""i cant understand what are you saying"", or sometimes they just walk off because they couldnt understand

I'm Half Deaf, my left ear can't hear anything since i was born until i realized it on 6th grade, i can't hear really well so thats why i always ask ""huh?', ""what you say?"" ( like the one above this ), thats why when im a conversation it just go like , "" huh ?"" many times

I don't really have any friends that i could count on because i'm used to being lonelly since 4th grade because i always get bullied ( not physical but verbally like they wont talk to me or not giving me time to talk )

I have really low confidence for to talking to a girl

I'm always scared about what people think or say about me, thats why i'm a shut in and more shut in because of covid 

I dont have a job, so i still get money by my parent, i know its really pathetic but idk what to do, im scared to go out there asking for a job , i got really nervous just to think about that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, i'm really super lonely, i just have some much love in me but i couldnt give it someone special in my life especially a girl/woman, i just want to share my love to someone with their being ok to be loved by me, im scared i will get tricked by a woman because i know what minus about me but i always think that they will take an advantage off me and leaving me behind when im serious about the relationship, i know im really ugly but i want to love and be loved by someone too, it just hurt me when  i always see teenager couple around my age having fun, sharing love with each other, i'm really jealous, everytime i have a chance of talking to a girl or asking for her phone number, my brain always tell me that "" i dont have nothing to offer in the relationship, or how can a guy like me be with her, do you think she found you attractive, i'm just gonna be a toy to her, you know she is using you right?, dont you think you had a chance with her with that face"".I'm really lonely man like really lonely

It's nice to be loved by someone, but i think it's too far

I just want to love someone special with they being ok about it and not playing me, like thats it that just it, that's what i really want right now.

5287,zuew03,Alynxiaa,"Hey, all. Honestly, this is just a post to vent feelings that I don't know how to voice out in reality. While I have friends around me, I stopped going to them for advice and comfort years ago and due to that no one asks how I feel anymore. I don't blame them but now I'm here, on Christmas day, alone in my bed sobbing. I don't know how to talk to my friends anymore about my problems without feeling like I am wasting their time and that I am just being a drama queen. Not just my friends, I don't know how to talk or make new friends. I've tried multiple times joining a Discord server to meet new people but end up leaving 5 minutes later because I don't know how to be interesting. I have severe general anxiety which I was being treated for but forced myself off because I don't want to be on medication all of my life. Honestly, it was also aided by the people around me worrying about how long I would be on them for and how addictive they are (was only a year before I stopped.) Since coming off them (2 months) I've been down, not really understanding what put me in those emotions. I don't know how to form sentences that describe how I feel because truthfully, I don't even know myself. I feel like I don't know who I am right now. I wake up exhausted. I know what I need to do to help that but creating habits seems near impossible for me. I keep hoping that the vitamin D pills I started a month ago will soon kick in and give me the energy I'm looking for. I don't really know what is my favourite colour or food anymore. It's all just bleugh. 

 I was meant to spend time with my partner's family but because of an argument that I started, he decided he didn't want to go and I was for sure not going to go by myself for the third time. This somewhat triggered the urge to go through these kinds of subreddits and finally vent how I feel. I feel like the world is moving and I'm just stuck in time. I know venting on here is what this subreddit is about, but I still have this lingering feeling that this is stupid.

**The Albatross (Charles Baudelaire, 1859)**  


Often, to amuse themselves, the men of a crew  
Catch albatrosses, those vast sea birds  
That indolently follow a ship  
As it glides over the deep, briny sea.  


Scarcely have they placed them on the deck  
Than these kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed,  
Pathetically let their great white wings  
Drag beside them like oars.  


That winged voyager, how weak and gauche he is,  
So beautiful before, now comic and ugly!  
One man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe;  
Another limps, mimics the cripple who once flew!  


The poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky  
Who frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman;  
When exiled on the earth, the butt of hoots and jeers,  
His giant wings prevent him from walking.  


—Translated by William Aggeler, *The Flowers of Evil* (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)

**L'Albatros**  


Souvent, pour s'amuser, les hommes d'équipage  
Prennent des albatros, vastes oiseaux des mers,  
Qui suivent, indolents compagnons de voyage,  
Le navire glissant sur les gouffres amers.  


À peine les ont-ils déposés sur les planches,  
Que ces rois de l'azur, maladroits et honteux,  
Laissent piteusement leurs grandes ailes blanches  
Comme des avirons traîner à côté d'eux.  


Ce voyageur ailé, comme il est gauche et veule!  
Lui, naguère si beau, qu'il est comique et laid!  
L'un agace son bec avec un brûle-gueule,  
L'autre mime, en boitant, l'infirme qui volait!  


Le Poète est semblable au prince des nuées  
Qui hante la tempête et se rit de l'archer;  
Exilé sur le sol au milieu des huées,  
Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher.

Here is my story.

After high school exams ended, which I never attended due to family issues leading up to death of my father - my friends just straight up do not care about me anymore. Yes I could reach out to them. But the thing is they always found me “annoying” etc. Always the third wheel. Right now the only conversations I have with them when they basically want to use me for my knowledge. And that is only one person. Probably 5 messages total in the past 2 years.

5332,zujjg2,MyLipsStuckonmyTeefs,"I gig with a band and had an event last weekend with them. It was a pretty big turnout. I talked to this girl after the show and we hit it off really well. For reference, I’m pretty introverted and do very little socializing at these types of gigs. Usually I just show up, play, pack up and leave. No one ever really approaches me to talk to me or anything, so it was kind of significant that she even approached me. 

I stayed after the event and hung out with this girl and we ended up making out - we didn’t hook up or anything. We also saw each other the following night. We had really strong chemistry, and she felt it too. She talked really seriously about dating - taking things slow, of course, but we both verbalized that we wanted to get to know each other better. 

I texted her a couple of times after seeing her. I didn’t think it was anything overbearing - I just thought it would be good to maintain contact and eventually make an attempt to formally ask her out. I sent her a text a few days ago because I saw something that reminded me of her. She fucking blocked my number - my text didn’t go through. 

This has been a tough year for me and I’ve had to work really hard on learning to love myself. I’ve made huge strides in understanding that my self worth shouldn’t come from others, but I won’t lie: rejection still gets to my head, especially when I’m told one thing and and it ends up being another thing entirely. I’ve been reeling - rethinking everything I said and did and why she thought it most appropriate to block me instead of straight up telling me she changed her mind and wasn’t interested. I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been and it sucks when the prospect of having someone is dangled in front of my face.

My sisters easily found relationships and when those relationships fell apart they were back into one in just a few months. They also never have any trouble getting emotional support from freinds or making then in general. We have all have pretty similar personalities so that isnt the issue at all. The issue is that as a man if you arent constanlty producing or creating something of value you are worthless to society. Ive never been in a relationship before in my life and have never even been close to it. All of the women in my life have treated me with disgust and contempt. Its gotten to the point where i feel a deep resentment for being a male and fantasize about suicide every day. My sisters on the other hands have had everything provided to them by their partners and werent expected to do anything other than just exist. They are provided a much higher standard of living and have there emotional needs met just by virtue of being a woman. Not to mention i have also had my dad threaten physical violence against me multiple tomes where as my sisters just get a stern talking to.

People tell me they hear of this or that other person talking so highly of me, how well liked I am, what a great person I am, etc.

Except I am not married or have kids. Save from a few rare times, it is next to impossible to get anyone to meet up with me for say, a coffee. No one invites me anywhere and my invites are deflected. 

I have done online dating for years. I have gotten (only) first dates, but only because I photoshopped my pictures, hid some bad features, and so on.

Families are not in this country.

First several years,  was busy with grad school and study.

These recent years, I thought being in a relationship could help.

However, I am not right.

It makes me feel lonely, which is not as what I expect.

Gradually, I am putting my money on solid objects a lot, like fancy electronics, luxurious stuff, cars. Now I am considering buying a small studio or apt to live in. All the money is made by own efforts without anyone's support.  I dont know why, but those stuff let me feel safe, though I am not a big fan of money or something like that, as I was educated to believe love is the most important thing that matters.

Also, I miss my family, I adopt a cat, I create music, I read books, I go to gyms. All these just let me feel not that lonely and exhausted.

5364,zulzog,the_operat0r,"It’s really gotten me thinking back to when I used to love Christmas. When I still had family around. When I had my good, long time girlfriend around. When it wasn’t lonely. When I looked forward to the holidays.

Now my family moved to both ends of the country and I’m smack dab in the center all alone. My last girlfriend abused and neglected me and and refused to spend any of the holidays last year with me and refused to include me. I made the very tough decision to finally once and for all walk away from her recently and it has been extremely hard on me. I still miss her despite all of her abuse towards me.

Looking back at my life 10 years ago, life started getting decent then. Always got to go out and hang with all my friends, got to spend the Summers on the lake, and the winters on the sled trails. Worked for my family business surrounded by friends and family, got to enjoy the fun things in life. I rarely felt lonely.

Now, I go to work (at least to a job I love, but this time of year gets lonely there) and come home to an empty house and turn the TV on and rewatch whatever I can find that soothes my mind, and then go to bed. Maybe browse a dating app before giving up on it and  yet again realize how toxic and disappointing those apps are.

The few friends still in my life that I hold near and dear to me are spending the holidays with their family and significant others. I am happy for them and hope they don’t ever take it for granted. 

I feel like I’ll never be able to enjoy life as I once did. I feel like I’ll never find anyone in this toxic day in age. I feel like I’ll never get to enjoy these holidays again. 
I try hard to convince myself that I will get to do all these things, and that I will be happy again, and that all will be better than ever.

I usually have no one to spend holidays with aside from toxic family. I’m realizing now that they at least fill the void with toxicity instead of loneliness. Being here all by myself coming up on 8hrs now; and this is the loneliest I have ever felt. Nothing has changed, just away from family whom don’t project love at all, and far away from any feelings of joy and Christmas.

Just bringing up a lot of the lonely thoughts that are covered up by the cycle. I have a good job now and am no longer drowning but this dissatisfaction with my ability to put myself out there and be a friend is sucking the life out of me worse since I started making this money. I feel alienated from other men, even those I’ve built comfort with, and I have so many issues with women due to a toxic mom that the negative feelings she gave me are projected upon every women I meet.

I have everything I thought I’d need to be happy, but with being alone, it seems all of it is futile, at least for another while. Beginning to wonder what the point of everything is without people you love.

5425,zupo4a,CHARLIEBRAV05,"So let me start out by saying that I've never really been that good with girls, I'm pretty shy and socially awkward sometimes and would definitely consider myself more on the introverted side of the scale. The only girlfriend I've had was about 4 years ago in high school when I was 17 and that only lasted maybe 6 months before she cheated on me.

Since then I've tried to date other girls but it's never turned into an actual relationship, either I get ghosted or she has way too many red flags and I cut it off (I've never ghosted anyone, I just tell them I don't want to continue talking). The last time I've even kissed or had sex was over 2 years ago. I tried tinder and decided I hated that but at the same time I don't ever really get out much to meet new people in people in person. I just don't know why I can't seem to find a decent woman who isn't taken.

I live in a pretty rural area, I have a job as a heavy diesel truck mechanic apprentice which I also go to school for to eventually get my license as a mechanic. I lift weights at the gym a few days out of the week. I do spend a lot of my free time on my hobbies like hunting and fishing, especially in the fall once duck season starts.

That being said I think about finding a girlfriend a lot, like everyday. I'm literally the only person I know who is single. Every single one of my siblings, family, friends, co-workers have a significant other and it often makes me feel like the black sheep or the odd one out. I often have thoughts that I must not be good enough, or attractive, or that it'll never happen. It also seems to have gotten worse since my best friend got a girlfriend last year and now spends all his time with her. I guess being around and seeing all these happy couples has really fucked with my head and dragged me down mentally, making me think there's something wrong with me.

Although I think about it a lot and feel lonely most of the time I also don't know if I should even pursue finding a girlfriend. I already do a lot of things on my own and don't know if I could add a girlfriend into all that. Plus I have this plan/dream that I'm gonna move across the country once I finish school and get my mechanic license and I think if a do end up with a girlfriend that plan might get cancelled.

I guess the question is should I worry about finding a girl or should I ignore it and just keep working on myself. And is there any tips on handling those thoughts and emotions about being lonely.",2022-12-25 03:32:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612066278,2,/r/lonely/comments/zupo4a/i_21m_feel_like_i_am_hopeless_for_finding_a/,,0,1,I (21M) feel like I am hopeless for finding a girlfriend

A future of sleepless nights and beauty scars from cutting yourself...

It hurts especially when I notice the bond between two people as friends, just through observing the way they talk to each other. Knowing that I’ve never had a bind like that with anybody and probably never will, just because of who I am. I can’t open up to anybody because they either never take me seriously, don’t care enough, or find it annoying.
I have only myself and I honestly kinda hate it. There’s a lot I would give just for having a friend group to chill with, one that would actually hate to see me go. Some actual homies. Idk. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

5454,zur40r,Something488,"Today I went to the supermarket to buy some cookie cake for the Christmas gathering with my family. I had just gotten off work at a professional establishment, so I had some nice clothes on paired with a warm north face jacket I received from my parents as an early gift. I felt like I looked good. As I approached the entrance of the store, I noticed a worker having some trouble moving a line of shopping carts back inside the store. After everyone else just walked past, I offered to help and the worker agreed, and we got the carts through the door no problem. I picked out the cake and went to pay at the register that a friend was working at. We chatted for a bit as he rang me up and we exchanged merry Christmases when we were finished. Afterwards, I met up with a different friend to receive some home baked cookies he made just for me.

For the first time, I truly felt as though all my self improvement in the last year was worth it. Today, I got to be the version of me I had always aspired to be. It was a tough journey getting here, and I’ve still got more to go, but today gave me hope for the future. That no matter how difficult things may get, they will get better if I keep my head up.

5457,zurafu,Invade_the_Gogurt_I,"While they might see this, but I don't really care about it anymore. Each to their own preferences, no one is at fault. 

I've recently made a friend on a friend making sub, after time and time of trying to get a good friendship over years, I thought I encountered someone who likes talking with me. 

But that's until we tried to play multiplayer games, I couldn't play it while voice chatting due to privacy reasons at home, my siblings would hear me, it's literally out of my power to do anything beyond this. 
Voice chatting is a must for them, which I completely understand and respect their choice.

I can't even tell this to friends, so I'm sharing you this, stranger of my terrible lonely time. 
Everytime, I can't enjoy games with others and people would invite me to a Playstation party or Xbox party to talk, but I get kicked because of this, I'm just personally sick of this. 
I just wanna enjoy my time with someone without them wanting this, I've tried many times to without considering the previous problems, never worked out. 
It's like a realm above me, a place where I can't reach and have fun, I could only listen to others having that opportunity. 
While I stick by the sidelines in loneliness

If you are someone who likes anime, plays games, I wouldn't mind to talk with you, more like I'd like to.

I was really hurt, and over the past couple months I've been building up the other areas in my life as a comeback, but the crushing loneliness I felt for years is back anyway, even though I have friends and family to help somewhat. I feel like the part of me that believes I deserve and can be loved is weaker than ever.

The thing I looked forward to a lot was spending the Holidays with her. That dream was ripped away from me, and now I'm stuck with a same old boring family Christmas that I just can't get into. I made the mistake of checking her instagram story. She looks infuriatingly beautiful. I blame myself for failing to keep her attraction even though its really unhealthy. 

The cherry on top? I get to see her in all my classes once holidays are done. AND my friends in school are also friends with her. So you better believe the pressure will be on to find someone new once these ""good days"" are done if I don't wanna be the loser.

5492,zutiyy,JeremyFlagrant,"Long story short, I'm tires. Really tired. 5 years ago my wife of 22 years ran off on me while I was in the hospital dealing with a stroke. She took the only 2 things that have ever really mattered to me, my 2 children. 

I've been slowly trying to get things back together, but my health keeps getting in the way. 

So here I am, out in a fav spot in the desert, me, my truck, a little camping gear, a few bottles of bourbon and working on that now.

Realty is that I just don't have anything to go back to. No one is calling. Nobody gives a damn. And that's fine, but when you're at your lowest...

Interestingly, there's a tiny bit of cell service out here. So anyway, I think this is really it. My sayonara to a bunch of people I've never met. Strangers. 

It's all been just a little overwhelming.

Bye world. See you on the other side.

5506,zuuq9b,gobigmimis,"Before you start telling me that it's due to abandonment issues, immaturity (on multiple levels), trauma, craving for connections, etc... I probably already know. And most likely you're right. That's that kicker. I know all of this and I keep telling myself this, but I won't listen, or i cant stop. It's like this subconscious urge to just keep holding on no matter how much I know they don't want me.
I obsess a lot I think. That's probably why it's so hard to let go. I keep trying to put so much into being noticed by them, trying to either be attentive and engaging, or restrain myself and try to be a bit distant. Either way, nothing really seems to work.
This current obsession is a friend of mine. It's been going on for a couple years now. He knows. And he's been a good sport about it. We cuddle up from time to time. I'll make jokes every so often and that's it. 
I keep trying to let him go and the others before him. The only I let them go was because I either hated them for some wrong they did or just being ghosted (usually the ladder). I don't want that with him.
 He's a great guy. At least when he wants to be. I just want to have normal feelings for him and have it as that. I keep trying and trying. The closest I got was when I was seeing some guy that wasn't looking for anything serious. (I just realized I haven't called myself stupid yet throughout this post so I'm going to say it just to clear up any misunderstandings. I am stupid. ) the thoughts went away for a bit at least.
I'm writing this because he messaged the gc about how he was going to be alone for Christmas, and I guess I was the only one that really responded to it and I started typing this knowing he was going to cancel and he did.

I wouldn’t be so hopeless if I didn’t try so hard.

Kindergarten.
I was playing alone most of the time, I was scared of other children. I hated going there and was crying almost every morning. 

Primary School.
The first few years were not that bad, I had a few persons to talk to, although there were sad moments as well.
My torment began during the later years of primary school. Most of the breaks I spent alone, no one wanted to sit near me during some classes. 
The worst moment was when there was a school trip and teachers told us to divide into groups with whom we would spend free time. I asked every group and no one wanted me. I was scared of getting lost. I started crying, teachers added me to one group. They were not talking to me but I followed them like a shadow to not to get lost. 
There were many situations like this but this one was the worst.
Sometimes I was beaten in school but it was rather annoying than painful to me.

In the last year of primary school I tried to act as a ‘cool kid’. It was partly successful because at least I had people to talk to at school but still no one came to my birthday when I invited them. 

Middle School.
The worst time of my life. I had literally no one to talk at school. During every class I was sitting alone. No one wanted to do group projects with me. Yet, I desperately tried to find friends. I was analysing my behaviour everyday and thinking what to do to be more likeable. I tried to talk to them, they openly told me to go away. Every time the pe teacher said: divide into pairs!’, it sounded like a death sentence to me. No one wanted to exercise with me. Once I begged some people to allow me to exercise as three persons, but they mercilessly disagreed, even though it wouldn’t be a big deal to accept me. 

There was organised a meeting where almost everyone from the class would be invited. I asked if I could go as well, they disagreed. After some time there was organised a similar meeting, and I asked again if I could join, and they disagreed again. I’m saying this to show you how desperate I was to find friends.

I invited a few persons to my birthday, no one came again. The only time when my classmates were nice to me, was when they wanted to copy my homework. I was glad that at least then I could feel needed and noticed.

The most painful moment was, of course, a school trip. I was terrified of this school trip several months before because that trip was to last 3 days. 3 days of pure hell. We were in a hotel. No one wanted to share a room with me so I was there alone. I was scared of getting lost.

High School.
Here I experienced a shock because people were not rude to me every time I spoke to them. I was so used to being treated in a rude way after middle school. I haven’t found friends here but it was a soothing time for my tormented mind.

On daily basis high school was alright, the only painful moments were when other people were organising their 18th birthdays and I, of course, had no one to invite to. Other painful moment was the prom because other people had partners and I, obviously, had no one to go with. 

Very destructive moment was during the time of exams, not exams themselves, but breaks between those exams. These exams were written by more than 100 students. I was the only one sitting in the corridor during the long breaks between the exams (sometimes there were 2 exams a day and that break lasted about 1.5h). 

University.
Here again I wanted to find friends. I knew that everything depends on the first few weeks. I tried to join a group. They weren’t rude to me but never sought my presence either. But when I noticed that they were waiting for each other and never for me, I realised I was not welcome there. 
And I ended up totally alone again. Many times I was close to crying during the breaks between classes. The loneliness was unbearable. I wasn’t giving up and tried to befriend some people. I was talking to them whenever there was an occasion, I was as nice and supportive as possible. It didn’t work out.

Pandemic was the happiest time of my life. Solitude in a crowd was much more painful than being physically alone. However, after pandemic I was glad to talk to my classmates again, but it turned out I had no one to talk to. 

I graduated several months ago and I’m hopeless.

I tried to become friends with my family members. I wrote to a cousin who seemed nice and I enjoyed talking to her. She ghosted me very quickly. Then I wrote to another cousin with whom I had a lot in common and she ghosted me very soon as well. 

No, this life is not worth living. 
I’ve been trying unsuccessfully to find friends for 20 years (since kindergarten). I was analysing what I did wrong, overcoming my fear and social anxiety, and trying again and again. One could think that after 20 years of effort, one must be at least partly successful. But not in case, in my case it’s a total failure.

So, I challenged myself instead, to go home by cycling. I got home, and made it in one piece covering a distance of 26km plus. 

Naturally I share this kind of story to my close friends. I'm used to friends not replying into groupchat coz I understand, we're all males cant blame them, most are kinda stoic and not into cycling. 

But nobody seemed to care,  cant avoid to feel down and lonely. Now I dont feel like sharing this kind of thing to them coz maybe they really dont care or dont like stuff  about cycling. But when they share something, I noticed Im the first one to hear them out.. Maybe I should lessen sharing stories to them coz theyre getting less and less willing to lend ears anymore..",2022-12-25 12:10:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1671969704,3,/r/lonely/comments/zuwzna/nobody_seemed_to_care/,,0,3,Nobody seemed to care..

Has been a success so far with the food! I bought some gifts for the less unfortunate, the kinda gifts that they need. Clothes etc. I have been doing this for last 5 years or so now, as my mother passed away when I was younger and have no family left now. (I explained on another post)

Will head home shortly and cook myself a nice burger, I don’t eat Christmas dinner. I haven’t done since I was 19, because my mum made the best ones and she can never be replaced with that haha. I always say to myself cook something that you love.

Will probably play my ps5 after and eat chocolate. If you’re struggling just fire me a dm. Hope you treat yourself. 🤗",2022-12-25 13:33:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670271361,21,/r/lonely/comments/zuy7ip/merry_christmas_everyone/,,0,5,Merry Christmas everyone! 🤗

5546,zuybaf,AnxiousEnby92,"Hey everyone. In case no one has seen my other posts I’m 30, non binary, Australian.

This time of year always feels so hard. I live with my parents for three reasons - cost of living alone, they need help (in terms of money and physically), and I’m single. I’ve never had many friends, and, despite my age, never had a partner.

This time of year is hard. Don’t get me wrong - I’m grateful for my life. Im glad I’ve got parents that love me, despite being neurodivergent and LGBT/nonbinary. And I love them. They need help - dad has aggressive cancer, mum has severe asthma. None of us are healthy - we help each other a lot. I’m grateful for every week they live. This time last year dad had his bladder removed due to cancer. He would have died if not for the surgery. He very nearly did.

Don’t get me wrong - I’m grateful. I’m grateful I can live with them. Im grateful they’re alive. And I’m grateful I’m alive - I nearly died from Covid, and my depression…the less said, the better.

But I’m lonely. So very lonely. I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. I’ve had friends who have said I’m not worth being around or “dealing with” coz of it. My own brother thinks  I - and our parents - are too screwed up. He ignores us. Doesn’t even care dad nearly died.

Working this past year has helped a bit, in terms of getting out and being with people. But I don’t have what others have. I don’t have a partner to share things with. I tried, this past year, to get out there. Joined some dating site, went out more. But I’m still sitting in the room I grew up in, after doing my best to be jolly for my mum and dad…bit all the while thinking most people I know are celebrating with partners, wives, husbands. And I’m just…here. I’ve never had a kiss. Sex. A relationship. I’m alone.

And it hurts. So much.

It’s hard.

but could you just imagine?

actually occupying someone's mind. 

actually meaning something to them to the point where they'd look for you even when there's no reason for them to. 

the notion that someone actually wants to see you, that someone actually-- wants you. 

i know what it's like to be the one who loves like that. 

but what's it like? to actually be wanted by someone? to be loved the way i love others. 

to have someone look you in the eye like you're the only one they'd ever want. 

to be the one someone thinks of when they listen to a certain series of songs. 

to be the one that catches a persons eye when you walk by. 

to hardly ever look at anyone else because they're the only one in your heart. 

it must be nice. 

to be loved like i love. 

it's not like i'm expecting anything unrealistic. 

i just think it'd be nice, to be on the recieving end of such sincerity. 

i'm not thinking of anything overly exaggerated. 

it's just the simple things, you know? 

someone who'd walk with you to some places just because. 

someone who would notice the little things about you. 

and when you're sad, they'd feel it as if it was their own. 

someone who watches over you like they actually care. 

is that too much to hope for? 

i'm not looking for a rich guy or a person with beauty equivalent to that of aphrodite herself. 

i just want a person whose heart is present with me. 

even the simplest acts of kindness and care have me melting. 

i can only imagine how it would feel like to legitimately be loved.

But I feel as if having such a strong desire is sort of incel-y. This doesn’t make sense whatsoever but it is how I feel. 

But I want to let go, the more you desire love the less likely you will get it. People will sense that from you and silently judge you for it, which reduces your chances. 

I am currently spending time at my parents house for Christmas but I have never felt more lonely. It doesn’t help that I have multiple mental illnesses.

5646,zv6u6p,nuthinforme,"I apologize for any inefficiency you may find in the format. I barely had the time to write this and can't proof read. Thank you for understanding.

I've reached the point where I'm too pessimistic to feel motivated for the future. Nothing seems to be going my way. I don't feel drawn to doing anything for the future because I always feel like it's a lost cause.

That being said, I do have some good memories where it felt like the world didn't matter to me and I was the happiest any person can be. The people involved in them have turned out to be petty liars and not actually my friend, but my miserable mind was too withered to care. It just needed that shot of nostalgia to keep pushing for another day.

I've always had this cling to memories my whole life, but I never truly clung to them and craved for them like I was suffocating without them until recently. For the longest time, whenever I hit a dead end in thought or in a social matter and feel like nothing is worth pushing for anymore, I subconsciously remember them, and that's when the drug comes in to ease my state of mind.

More recently, however, more and more memories seem to lose their effect on me until there was one memory from one day left that had some impact. It was what I would declare the best day in my life. Everything that I desired was packed in one day; got out of the town that I had not left for years, had great company, had silly good moments to reflect on, and it was my first (and last) time getting some degree of independence and freedom, like I was finally becoming a respected grownup. Eventually, this one lost its effect, too. I couldn't feel anything at the mere recollection of the scenery and dialogue, so I resorted to seeing the pictures and snaps that I took (Instagram stories and tiktok didn't exist back then). That had a short term impact but eventually it also had to go for some reason.

It's like I finally became immune to this drug and the chemicals don't work anymore. It's like I need something new with better more effective chemicals, but I can't find it anywhere. I have nothing left. I don't know how to keep going with no energy or motive to move on with. I'm out of fuel.",2022-12-25 21:13:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668017510,2,/r/lonely/comments/zv6u6p/the_good_memories_that_i_used_to_abuse_like_drugs/,,0,3,The good memories that I used to abuse like drugs to keep myself sane don't work anymore.

5650,zv73jk,Ok-Dragonfruit2447,"I’m a 18M introvert person who has social anxiety. Because of this, it's very hard for me to initiate the conversation first with someone, as Idk what to say and always think like ""Wait, what am I supposed to say now, lol?"". Plus I'm a very shy person. I love playing games, comforting ppl, listening to music, and chatting with strangers on Reddit to make friends with them (or wasting my time on Reddit lol). English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has the same gender and perhaps something in common. If we don't have anything in common, that's OK too \^\^. Hopefully I will find some1 that will stick around. So ye I would rather a long-term friendship than a short one, but I just let thing flows naturally. My DMs are always open. Forgive me if I'm bad at conversation... Oh! And also, no NSFW profile and 17+ pls \^\^! Honestly I never had a friend b4, so I don't even know ""how it feels"" to have a friend ngl. Thx for reading! I hope u guys have a nice day! With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ This platform sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all. It would be ideal if we can move to a different one since it's hard to tell if ppl ghost me or not lmao.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-25 21:26:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,3,/r/lonely/comments/zv73jk/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,0,18M Hi everyone!

Makes me think of missed oppotunities and lost friendships.

I'm quite used to the feeling of being alone, but these days really exacerbates the empty feeling and makes me want to hug the next remotely living thing I could find, even ghosts haha. Makes me realize that, aside from family, there isn't anyone in my life who's a constant. I know people come and go, but I haven't really had someone long enough to really know me and be there like most genuine / intimate realtionships go.

I'm happy for the rest of the world who gets to hug someone they hold dear. People shouldn't be able to feel this way and should celebrate the breaks and festivities with the people they're most happy with.

5681,zv92te,Far-Isopod5774,"It gets better. What a popular cliche that probably makes some roll their eyes, but it's true. No matter where or who you are, things can and will get better. Every day that you wake up is a new opportunity to try again, to seek out the good, to find more. I know that sometimes (maybe most of the time), getting up and getting out of bed is the most challenging thing, and waking up doesn't seem like a gift at all. I've been there, I've dealt with days of endless airplane mode and barely knowing who I am or if I'm worthy of anything, including the food on my plate. I never thought it'd get better. When you're in the depth of it, you can't see any potential or hope. When you're lost at sea, you can't see land, but that doesn't mean it isn't there. I know that for some, the holidays just provide the twisting of an already jagged knife. You may be lonely, but you're never truly alone. There are people out there who will love you, who will want to surround themselves with you, who will smile at the mere thought of you. Whether you're 15 or 50, you have your special people. You just have to stick around and find them, because they're waiting for you too. I've found my people and my heart is all the happier for it. I love you all.

PS. Hope none of this sounds insensitive. I understand the pain and just want to help. Much love :)",2022-12-25 23:05:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658789232,7,/r/lonely/comments/zv92te/love_to_everyone/,,0,1,Love to everyone

5713,zvc2qs,Adventurous_Rub_1457,"I've been living an ordinary life so far trying to fit in with the majority trying to have some semblance of a normal life but I just can't do it I just feel so empty, like every action I take just leads to more suffering and I can't even talk to anyone about it because no one understands me or even tries to.

I've honestly worked my ass off ever since I was little trying to make friends and develop relationships that are stable and healthy with people who care about me for who I am I try to be nice I try to show kindness I try to provide in whatever way I can, but everytime I think or feel that I'm growing closer to someone it's always the same betrayal. They either ghost me or turn on me and treat me like shit all so they can fit in with the rest of the kids who would point and laugh at me.

At first I thought I was the problem that somehow I caused them discomfort in someway and I kept trying to fix an unsolvable issue that laughed in my face and I grew more and more frustrated until one day when the laughing and mocking was at its peak it suddenly just clicked with me that, no, I'm not the problem here I did nothing to these people these people truly do hate me for me being me and I snapped I lost all control. I've never been one to have anger issues or lash out at someone I had always been docile or meek even but something inside me just broke and I just beat them and beat them and just kept beating them until I finally realized what I had done, but it was too late the damage had been dealt and I was screwed

I spent the next 2 weeks suspended and pretty much under house arrest and was under constant surveillance and in those 2 weeks I had the time to truly reflect on my life until that point and how the consequences of my actions would affect me going forward and I just sulked and sulked feeling sorry for myself until I finally got to return to school but things were never the same people looked at me differently terrified of me they pushed me away and talked shit behind my back and all of this was just slowly building this wall inside my head separating me from reality and eventually I just decided to change schools.

I got to my new school and things were no better my life was just a train wreck going nowhere I had no friends no family to turn to that would have my back or that I could talk to so I decided to do therapy and that lasted 3 months before I realized that even my therapist was mocking me pushing me away and belittling my issues and I just couldn't take it anymore and that's when I found myself unable to take it anymore I wanted to die so badly and I truly considered doing just that, after all it's not like anyone would miss me right.

But I didn't have the balls to do it. Somewhere deep down I still felt that there were still things I needed to do in life and that doing them might help me overcome my loneliness and depression.

Fast forward 2-3 years and here I am typing this out, things have only gotten worse and my life is a mess and now I'm just thinking about that moment when my world completely shattered and that me that I long for so deeply that is now lost forever and I just regret not being able to live those happy moments again.

I have nothing left to live for and honestly I don't know where to go from here.

If you find happiness never let it go because if you do you can never return to the person you once were",2022-12-26 01:43:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622276151,1,/r/lonely/comments/zvc2qs/i_honestly_just_realized_just_how_broken_ive/,,0,1,I honestly just realized just how broken I've truly become

Last night I had another dream about spending time with someone I haven't talked to in... Shit, a year now. Her and I were laying in bed together. Nothing sexual, just... Enjoying holding each other. I think there was even a point where I was massaging her back and--


**then I woke up.** 


And unlike every other fuckin morning of abject misery when that shit happens, today was different since it was Christmas. Instead I was fortunate enough to have parents and dogs to spend the day with and distract me from all that bullshit. After winding down at the end of the day, though, I recall everything that's happened today... And that ever present reminder that I'm alone haunts me. Zero messages wishing me a merry Christmas, nobody gives a shit. Nobody to spend Christmas with except my parents, which I guess I should count my blessings since it seems that's more than most.

5721,zvchga,viciouswitcher,"Lately, I've been feeling more lonely then usual and holiday's don't really help. I don't have many friends and the ones I do call friends, I only see them every few months, despite how close we live to each other. I always think there's something wrong with me that makes them not want to see me, much less text. My birthday wasn't too long ago either and I only got a few simple 'happy birthday' texts. I know I shouldn't be the focus of anyone and shouldn't expect them to throw a party for me, but it would've been nice go out to dinner with someone and hang out. Maybe I should've been more out there and reached out to people myself. But the idea of no one even offering to do anything with me made me feel like they didn't want to be around me. At this point, the feeling of loneliness had been building up and when ever I feel something like this, I tend to talk to myself. It usually helps me get through whatever emotional or mental thing I'm going through. I think about things that are probably wrong with me and what keeps people away from me. This eventually leads to how I feel romantically alone as well and how all the things that are wrong with me could be the same reasons for why I don't have a girlfriend. I've only had one relationship and did it not last very long. Our personalities did not match very well at all and she wanted me to do things that I didn't agree with. It's hard for me to make connections with people as friends, so finding someone to date is it's own difficulty. I rarely get messages/replies on dating apps and they don't last long if I do. I can't help but think 'with everything that's wrong with me, of course no one want to talk to me. Especially if I'm fat and ugly with ugly features. Even if I was thin and attractive, I'd still be ugly'. After saying this to myself, I immediately broke down and cried. While it felt good to cry, it didn't change how incredibly lonely I felt.

I still have yet to call my mom even though I know she is worried. The ignorance is not out of spite or anger. To me it feels better to runaway and hide then to tell the truth of my whereabouts. The ""what ifs"" are overwhelming me.

What if this is my last Christmas?
What if it's her last Christmas?
What if I never make it on my own?
What if I made a mistake?

My Google timeline keeps putting my past on the front page. Missing the family I could've had and the life I'll never get back. Now I'm alone. I didn't even get to open a present or sit in front of a Christmas tree.

5796,zvj7gk,jzbd,"I cried today. Not that it matters, pretty sure all mentioning crying does is make people uncomfortable. Anyway, I've heard people say that they're loners and like solitude, then turn around and say they have close friends. Or family. Or online friends. Like I mentioned in the last post, I've called the suicide hotline and heard the same mantras about enjoying being alone and finding coping mechanisms, but I've also heard this from people off the phone. They don't actually mean they *like* being alone, they only like it because it's a choice for them.

I'm not close with my family, classmates, and don't have any relatives in the country. I'm not actually a horrid, Grouch-like creature living inside a garbage can and bemoaning about my isolation, however, reader—I'm actually pretty good at talking. Journaling's my half-hearted substitute to human interaction, but I can hold a conversation and make jokes far beyond what a socially inept teen should be capable of. It's just that those conversations and jokes are all the interaction tends to add up to. I've even had some people think I was popular or had a friend group because of how much they enjoyed talking to me. People, clearly, have some sort of ""person"" or ""group"" to rely on and talk to, but all I have to keep myself sane is one-off small talk. I've been trapped inside ever since the holidays started because of winter break, and I've honestly been losing my mind after forcing myself to play Pokémon Violet and watch Youtube videos to try and relax and act like I enjoy being inside all day and staring at a screen. A frivolous complaint, really, but there's no other way to word it.

5798,zvjkrp,Throw_Acctum,"I just celebrated my 22th birthday alone a few weeks ago. I’ve done stupid mistakes when I was 19-20 yo and I’ve lost my few friends that I’ve known since high school. It was a desperate measure to fit in/connect with others, but unfortunately it hurt people in the process. It’s been a long journey ever since, especially from being someone who was super emotionally dependent to a lone wolf. 

Nowadays people around me tell me that I’m positive/sociable/sweet, but little do they know about reality. I only have my family and some acquaintances that I rarely talk with (from College/University/Online). I always feel like I have to pretend that I have friends. I know that it is ridiculous but I also scroll my messages/apps pretending that I’m texting to someone close sometimes when I’m with others. I don’t want make people feel bad or question it. Otherwise, people assume that I have tons of friends just by looking at me. They are (understandably) surprised when I tell them that I don’t have any social medias anymore but iMessage. 

When I walk outside, I feel like everyone else have friends and a good support system. Somehow I got used to this loneliness, but I feel like something is missing. It feels good however to know that there’s a community who relates to it…people whom I’d assume also have friends and have a happy life otherwise. It definitely gave me a new perspective, but i find it so unfortunate and sad because nobody deserves to go through this seriously. 

I keep my head sane interacting with my family, my neighbour who goes to the gym with me, doing my hobbies (introvert), exploring my city’s cafes &amp; thrift stores and talking to acquaintances/strangers online…but I know that I’m just someone who needs more. Everything feels pointless sometimes. It’s harder to make close connections as an adult. My conversation skills have been improving a lot throughout these past few months but it’s still not enough.

5826,zvmxyt,BronxBushido,"
in a conversation with my therapist I came to the conclusion that I spend all my time thinking about women and not actually doing anything for myself. Like most of my time everyday is spent thinking about girls, dating, porn, being held, sex or how I’m single and I actively reject any thoughts that have to do with myself or family or anything that doesn’t involve someone liking me.

 It’s gotten to the point where I constantly check my appearance in some kind of vain attempt to convince myself that people want me. I used to post on r/amiugly for 5 years straight till I got banned this summer. I don’t really have many emotions or an identity outside of wanting women to be into me, I’ve had recent readings say that I’ll get a relationship in real life soon, but since im not in school I’ve just been losing my mind over not being around actual women and I’m afraid I’m gonna be alone forever. 

I’m 20 and my brain feels fried beyond repair and I don’t have any real goals besides a woman validating me emotionally and taking my V-Card and even then I get incredibly depressed the second I see an attractive woman on my feed or the real world. I feel like I get no love because I’m not attractive, I dress flashy because I like it but still I feel like nobody notices or is interested in me. I get into any woman who’s even remotely nice to me and it’s hella annoying. I just wish I had the ability to change my face and say the right things so girls would want me.

But I know once I achieve this though I’ll have nothing else I want to do in life and honestly I don’t know how to feel about it. Like maybe it’s easier chasing something than getting and maintaining it. Any thing I wanna do with a girl is based off my own need for affirmation that I have value because someone is into me. 

I’ve paid for every dating site hoping someone’ll just fuck the loserness out of me, but even if I match with a cute chick I always fumble. I don’t love anyone, there are some people I like but that’s it. I’m a person with no identity. My mind is blank outside of women. I’m almost proud of it because I think “at least I’m not some fucking uggo who spends time playing Videogames or having some lame ass hobby instead of trying to get attractive for women.” So I can’t let go of the obsession, because being alone with myself feels like loser ass shit.

Like I don’t want to work on myself because I want validation from a woman now. So I just sleep and watch porn to pass the time, honestly though sexual thoughts are starting to hurt my head so that’s one less vice probably. 

I can’t believe anything positive anyone tells me either. The subjectivity of attraction fucking sucks dick.

I have no dreams or wants besides being validated by a woman. I get As and Bs on my full ride to college but when I graduate I’m probably fucked. I don’t know. I’m not mentally right at all.

Being a guy fucking sucks, but beauty wise I’d make an ugly woman, so there’s no point jumping the boat I’m already on.",2022-12-26 13:17:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1496543731,1,/r/lonely/comments/zvmxyt/i_dont_think_i_have_any_identity_or_wants_outside/,,0,1,I don’t think I have any identity or wants outside validation from women.

5832,zvncu3,frevaastray,"This Christmas has been hard. I went and saw my family even though I don't believe in this holiday anymore, I still like seeing them. I'm on winter break from school and I've been alone most of the time. I'm so tired of being alone. I'm trying to learn how to be happy by myself but it only lasts for a little while before I get lonely and sad again. It's weird because I can feel it come on like a wave and knock me down. I've almost broken down completely several times over the last couple of days, but I managed to keep myself from doing it. I don't think that's a good thing because I know I should, ""feel my feelings,"" but I am so tired of crying because I'm alone. It makes me feel even more pathetic. I feel unlovable and like there is something wrong with me. When I talk online or through text, I can't just text short messages or post a short comment. I don't know if I'm incapable of doing so or if I'm too stupid or insecure to be okay with not conveying what I really mean. It makes people uncomfortable, even on here people won't respond to this because it's too long. That drives me to be more alone.

 I have gone through so much to get where I am. Too much to write down (for once), and I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I still don't really know what I'm working towards. I don't know what I'll do with my degree. I don't know what I want besides to not be alone, and a lot of the questions I have about the future are contingent on being with someone. Where am I going to live? Do I want kids? Do I want to own a home? I don't want to answer these on my own. I have learned how to be happy with myself, but too much time alone can drive anyone crazy. I just want someone to love. Someone who is also a friend not just a lover. Someone that won't use me. Idk what this post is supposed to be about, but I'm sad. I'm sad and I feel like I can't have a normal conversation. Something is different and I can't tell what. It's this mixture of sadness, being numb, being isolated, and having no one to talk to. I have no friends and that scares me. I haven't had a girlfriend in four or five years since my ex left me for another guy, and that scares me. All the work I've done on myself feels worthless. I guess what it comes down to is I feel like I'm drowning. I need someone to help me get my head above the surface. It's times like these when I wish I was suicidal, but I don't even see the point in suicide anymore. I'm going to die someday no matter what and it could happen at any time. Death doesn't need my help, and if you're feeling suicidal remember that death doesn't need your help either. Don't rush something that's inevitable. 

Anyways, I was alone this Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I was alone on my birthday. I don't want to be alone anymore, but I don't know how to talk to people. I think there is something genuinely wrong with my character. Something that makes people not want to engage with me. I know I probably give off an air of apathy and I seem like I want to be alone. I don't, I really really don't. I just don't know how to change that demeanor. I don't know how to be ""normal."" I think I'm going to walk my dog, cry, and go to sleep. I'm on this fucked up schedule where I sleep all day and I'm up all night. Another symptom of being alone.

5844,zvoy8l,JocoseSonata,"I hit rock bottom years ago, and I just kept on digging.

So, I have been reading some posts about relationships and stuff, and watching compilations of cute couples, and other lovey-dovey nonsense.

Oh boy does it *fucking* hurt knowing I will never experience a single percent of whatever they have. Yet I kept on watching and reading, and exposing myself to it, to remind myself what I will never ever get.

Starting to get addicted to the pain of loneliness after I accepted it as my rightful place. Not even in a masochistic way, I don't enjoy it at all, it absolutely **fucking** hurts each and every time. I just torture myself with this knowledge, this fact, of dying alone.

There's just nothing I could ever do to correct it. Nothing about me is worthy of love. Too incompatible and socially inept to even have a friend. I literally do not know what love feels like, and I'm using ""literally"" correctly.

There are many reasons why I should kill myself, never knowing what love feels like just adds on to the pile.

At this point, if by some miracle a girl is into me, truly wants to be with me, genuinely likes me... 

I will reject her.

1. I'm not good enough
2. I'm not worthy
3. She deserves better
4. I will only fail
5. I am a regret waiting to happen

That, or I *will* date her, just so I know what it feels like to have my heart broken. Although, in order for my heart to be broken that requires me to love her, and I can't exactly love someone when I don't even love myself, cause I ***fucking*** hate myself so goddamned much. But if I do find it in my cold dead hollow heart to love her, it'll be true, pure, and innocent! 

Making it all the more painful if she breaks it. Wonderful!

Call me whatever you want, there's nothing here of any value. Nothing deserving of love or happiness. I will actively sabotage any relationship I may find myself in. It's for her benefit, anyway. She could do better. 

There's no hope for love here. Not even in my fantasies; I am alone even in there.

&amp;#x200B;

This post doesn't have a main point, or a general structure. Just stating my place in the world of relationships, and how deep I've gone.

I hit rock bottom, starting digging, and long after I lost the energy, I lay there willingly, accepting my place below. There's no point trying to climb up, I'll only fail, and fall. Effort, however commendable, is meaningless without progress. Why would I bother trying when I know the exact outcome?

This pathetic insignificant soul will die never knowing love.

Staying in the background
Till the time was right.

Knocking down the life she knew,
Abhorring everything about her;

Like the title says, this is the third or fourth year I spent Christmas completely alone. Both my parents have passed, my brothers live on opposite ends of the country (and I’m in the middle), and my friends were all doing family shit. Tack on a car issue and I was basically stranded. I ended up playing video games, taking two depression naps, and overeating Chinese leftovers. Agreed to watch my neighbors’ cats, so that was a bright spot. They’re good eggs.  
  
Seeing pictures of my friends and their significant others and families sent me spiraling even earlier this year. I’ve given up on dating at least once every two months, but I realized part of my problem, and I don’t think it’s very fixable.  
  
1. I’m not that good looking and I struggle with money a lot. Those two are enough to scare off about 90% of women, especially in a big city.  
  
2. Because of #1, anything else about me has to be perfect. I have to say the right things, I have to have a dozen hobbies (and one of them has to be woodworking for some reason), I need good stories, I need to have traveled, and a dozen other criteria. It’s fucking exhausting.  
  
3. I better sink my teeth and claws before the woman finds out my mental health isn’t spotless, because it’s over as soon as that barrier’s broken. Kinda hard for a guy who regularly journals about sobriety and mental illness.  
  
4. Oh, yeah, and I’m just over three years sober. When the fuck did that become a red flag?  
  
All those have made me feel like this Undateable Voltron (or Undateable Megazord, if you’re a little younger). This post probably gives off an incel vibe, which I totally get. But I haven’t been with a woman since before Covid was a thing, so my virginity has basically grown back. Do with that what you will.  
  
Point is, I don’t know how much longer I’ll go on before I decide to give a gun a BJ, and I’m just screaming into the wind hoping to hear some advice in an echo.

It is a toxic environment (mom and bf clearly do not like each other, are nasty, etc.) and every year I always feel like crying and tell myself I will never spend two days in a row here again, would rather be alone, etc. Plus my mom doesn't celebrate Christmas- doesn't decorate and just has dinners for the sake of having them.

Well this year that is what I did. I told my mom I was only coming over for Christmas Eve. She wasn't happy about it and yesterday nastily asked, ""what are you going to do tomorrow, stare at the four walls?"" And I did/do feel guilty. I have a deep fear that I will regret not spending Christmas with her when she is gone even if being with them now makes me uncomfortable. Yesterday I had a low-key day.

5887,zvuytb,kipper0o0,"Hello, So to start this I will give a brief background about myself. I am 26M and have been to one relationship but it was a highschool relationship that wasn't taken so seriously (basically my ex was this miss popular that every guy wants to date and for some reason I got her BUT we were 14-15 it only lasted for 6 months). So technically lets just say I have never been in a relationship before. I have met this girl on an online game and have been hanging out at first until we have developed some type of intimate relationship with each other. We have never seen each other, just voice chat. We were talking everyday, until we made a discord server which only consists of us both, we usually play with others but we quickly go back to our server so its going to be just the both of us. We found it peaceful and comfortable, but this girl was not ready for a relationship cause she has just broken up with her 2 year boyfriend a week before we started playing the game or wouldn't want another LDR/Online relationship anymore. Even if she had already told me that, we still kept on hanging out 24/7 every day, even as we sleep; we stay in the voice chat. This has been going on for 5 months now but we had a rough patch a month ago. She considered our relationship as ""Friends with benefits"" and yes, we did some stuff in voice chat, simultaneous you know what - thats what we considered ""sex"" I guess. But one day I was way too aggressive with her and she was pissed and all, so she reminded me of her boundaries and wanted to dial back down the sexy stuff. I agreed on this and apologized with all my heart, but heres the catch. We didn't go in the voice chat or hanged out the next day for like 6 hours after we have woken up. This was a first for both of us and we got affected quite drastically by it. We only hanged out in voice chat if there were other friends inside it. So, a day after we talked about it and yes I apologized again for what had happen. We tried to hangout afterwards but did not sleep on VC. Our conversations went bland cause we joke and tease all the time whevener we are alone in the VC for like 40% of our conversations. We took a break on hanging out for like 2 days and only hangout when we were about to do our ""dailies"" in game and then try to hangout a bit but dip afterwards. 4 days ago we talked again and settled all of our insecurities and grievances. I became insecure cause she was talking to a guy in our crew, flirting and all just like how she talked to me: but I erased all this insecurities and just thought that this is just the way she talks (cause she actually likes to talk, in a degen way). We started to fix it bit by bit and actually was in a healthy stage after we were texting and hanged out in VC, we can feel it slowly coming back. Fast forward to yesterday, she told me that she had contacted an old friend (guy) to have coffee with just to catch up (she is 20y.o. no job and is just alone in her room 99% of the time unless she needs to buy groceries). She has autism and is very sensitive to sound and sunlight/light so she avoids going out and needs meds for it since she was 9 years old. This made me curious and just tried to play it off like it was just catching up so I was fine with it, but she mentioned that she is interested in 2 of the other people this guy knows and wants to catch up with them as well (they are both guys). She has a body count of 11 at the age of 20 meanwhile I have a whopping 1, so I may be very insecure and jealous when she mentioned it but it was for a reason, although I have no right to be cause we are just ""Friends with Benefits"". We both quit the game that we played before but made another server so we can still contact our friends even though we are not playing anymore and it is very rough, very rough for me to let go even though a lot of people have now said that I should let it go now. I have noticed that this loneliness of mine was cause of me being depressed. I was isolated for 3 years due to covid so my work is now a work from home type, and I work in a night shift. Social interactions with other friends is hard since they are awake when its my bed time and I am awake when its their night time, so this has grown in me for 3 years and noticed that I became veeeeery lonely and she was the one who pulled me out of my depressing state cause she was the only one I can talk to while I work. I became a hopeless romantic, Iv'e noticed. I am really romantic when Im talking to her, all the great gestures and all. Now, here is the thing. We don't hangout the whole day anymore though we have been on sleep VC this past couple of days cause she mentioned I was a bit too clingy and needy 3 weeks ago (Im sorry but I just cant help myself). We don't VC after we wake up and leave ourselves alone until we are done with our morning routines, we only hangout when its like 5 hours before bedtime and sleep on VC if she is in the mood. Should I give this one up? I know I have to at some point but Im AFRAID, IM SCARED TO BE ALONE AGAIN.. IM SCARED TO GO BACK TO BEING DEPRESSED. I feel like I'm in a rush to find someone I love cause I have never felt love or affection from someone else before (except for family obviously) but this one was different, she pulled me out from a dark place. She gave life to my very boring and lonely life for the past 3 years, she was my light when I was filled with total darkness. I miss her.. and I truly will after this is over (which I know it will be). We live in different countries so its like an automatic no go in the first place. But I became so hopelessly romantic that I ignored every single red flag there is. I have been crying for almost 2 weeks now since the incident happened. I don't want to leave her server cause I am still friends with our group of friends, I just don't know how to handle this afterwards if we ever drift apart. I don't want to be alone anymore since I had a taste of love and joy for the very first time in my life. I have made plans on 2023 and got a gym membership for a year so I will force to work on myself, but the fear still lingers when I start to work. All I do is listen to some music and I don't speak a single word from my mouth physically cause I have no one to talk to until she contacts me 4 hours before we sleep and hangout in VC. I will have no one to share my day with, I won't have my daily good mornings, goodnights and cuddle gifs anymore. I am afraid of being alone again and going back to my depressing state and loose hope.",2022-12-26 19:40:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1535557834,2,/r/lonely/comments/zvuytb/26m_20f_a_lonely_hopeless_romantic/,,0,1,[26M] [20F] A lonely hopeless romantic

5894,zvw8qy,SnooMarzipans4644,"I have a family who live overseas, I have a few close friends close by. Some of them ask if I want to go to their homes for Christmas. I always say no. I went once to a friends family Christmas, and while they were very kind to me, even bought me gifts, when it came to photo time, I had to take all the photos, no one wanted me in their family pics. 

I get it, I’m a random, but I felt so out of place after that, and realised that while the intention of these people is good, they invited me not because they really wanted to be with me but because they felt bad that I would be home alone. 

Other years people have said things like ‘You can come to our house if you’re going to be alone.’ For once I wish someone would say ‘We would love for you to come spend Xmas with us’ … full stop. The minute they say ‘you can’t spend it alone’ cuts like a knife. 

Most years I do spend it alone and make up stories about what I’ve done because I’m so ashamed that no one really wants me to spend the day with them. 

This year was particularly cruel as none of my family members called or messaged me, not even my Mother. It really hurt to know that no one thought of me. My siblings all have families, I’m the only single one with no kids and maybe they thought I would be busy with friends but I watched tv and slept most of the day praying the way would be over. 

I’m not going to let this eat me up, If anything, it’s shown me that I can’t rely on anyone and have to look within myself for the love and comfort I so desperately desire. If no one else wants to love me, I guess I have to love myself and find my purpose. 

I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, just not sure how to manage all the emotions I’m feeling.

To anyone that is feeling broken and lonely this Xmas, know that you’re not alone, you do matter and you’re not here by chance.

Nonetheless, living in a house I can’t afford that’s slowly draining my life and stacking debt to the ceiling. To being left by my ex after I lost someone close to me. It’s one of those things that when everything goes wrong EVERYTHING I can possibly imagine has went wrong with no solid way out. I just honestly feel abandoned and alone. It’s almost like this deep and dark place gets ever so dark as the days go by. I try my hardest to, you know, be productive and stay busy. I could stay in the gym forever but once I get home it’s like the life in me fades as I walk through the threshold of my house. Coping with people wanting to leave your life when it’s at its absolute hardest is probably the most difficult struggle I have constantly struggled with.

The family of my partner invite me to their Christmas meals to spend with them but I get lost in my own thoughts and decide to spend the time alone.
I’m a really self isolated person and exclude myself from social activities because at times it makes me feel anxious and uneasy, I’m finding this increasingly harder to break out of recently due to getting lost in my own thoughts. 
I feel almost selfish for these actions but I just get so caught up in the thoughts in my head and feel it is better to just spend my time alone to try and recuperate.

I’m not very good with sharing my thoughts, feelings or expressing in ways such as this - but I feel like it is steering out of control and I need to do this now before it escalates out of control.

I’m currently isolating from my loved ones and starting to feel everyone will be better off without me around. The constant thoughts of my actions hurting others, would they feel better off without me around? 
These sort of thoughts have been cycling around my head for the past 2 days now and I have been having suicidal thoughts down to this, just to escape and shut off my mind all together so to say. 
Is anyone able to recommend some actions, conversations to have or hobbies to take my mind off of this lonely feeling and start to think of things in a new light?

No one called. No one texted. No one even sent a Christmas card. My “best friend” who has been living with me on and off promised she’d spend Christmas with me this year. She ditched me for her boyfriend that she has had less than a month and didn’t even notify me until 10:00pm. I spent all night in bed crying because fuuuuuuck I’ve never felt so low before.
I wish so badly I could hug someone right now. That I could cry and and tell them that I am not ok. That I could at least talk to someone about how low I’m feeling.
Do you know how low it feels to go through your contact list seeing all of your friends and family, looking desperately for someone to call when you’re spiraling, and then you realize none of them really give a fuck? I’m sure a lot of you do and I wish you didn’t. I would never wish this feeling on ANYONE. I have never felt so alone in my life. Instead of calling someone and saying “Hey I need a hug, I don’t feel ok.” I’m hugging this teddy bear that I got when I was 16 specifically for when I needed a hug. Because I have no one to call. I tried to call my mom, she talked to me for an hour about how much pain she is in and how her marriage with my own father is going down hill. And then hung up without even asking me what was wrong.
I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s so hard making friends as a single mom or even dating, don’t even get me started. I try so hard though. Idk I guess I’m just unloveable.

Does anyone else sometimes get this deep feeling that they simply just don’t belong anywhere and will never find someone who truly understands them in a soulmate like way? I interact with people daily and try to take part in conversations and stuff like that but most of the time it just feels like my opinion doesn’t even matter… 

I don’t really know how to explain this, because yes, I do have a couple family members who care for me and a couple friends from college who are nice to me, but I simply just haven’t been able to find that person who thinks that my soul belongs with theirs and will forever love me unconditionally (I don’t mean this an exclusively romantic connection, can also be a friendship).
I have connected like this before with a couple of people but they have ended up either leaving or just… changing and distancing themselves. 

I just hope someday I can stop feeling like this and find someone who stops this heart ache.

I had a lonely year and am here for the holidays but I almost regret coming. I was hoping for something to alleviate some of the loneliness, but no. During the day we don’t talk or interact everyone is either in their room or doing their own thing. Sometimes we eat dinner together and then go our separate ways. Otherwise I might watch a movie with my parents and then they’ll leave once it’s over. I think growing up this way made me who I am today. 

I recall going to a friends house one day and her parents greeted her so happily, asked about her day. There was this comfort and openness I’ve never experienced, it seemed almost alien. They actually talked to each other. I used to try as a kid but I don’t anymore. Looking back I’m just wondering why they even chose to have children if they never intended on doing something with them. I’m the second child FYI.

So I’ve had a pretty like crazy dramatic month, I don’t really know how to cope with it and I don’t really think I’m doing it a healthy way. I’ve always been depressed like never suicidal just like feeling shitty and hate myself and I shut people out and come off as an asshole and all that. About two weeks ago my dad was killed, it was an occupational hazard and he went instantly, so I take peace in that, but I don’t really know how to process it. I haven’t really cried or felt bad about it, I have like little moments when I can’t hear it feels like someone is knocking inside my ears, I get dizzy, and it feels like my head is splitting open and then just poof it’s over and I’m back to feeling nothing again. Then on top of that I was seeing this girl around March-august, she turned out to be a toxic psycho so I kicked her out my house. My family is very close to hers but she’s not really close to her family and they kinda stood up for me when I ended things with her. I had a feeling she was stalking me, brought this up to her family and they were like no she moved she lives two towns over. Found out today she was stalking me, rented a house on the corner of my street and has been watching me until around November, she was pregnant, and miscarried the beginning of the month. I feel like I seriously dodged a bullet and now I just feel like a huge asshole and total shit bag.

5987,zw7mft,MastaFloda,"I'm a 30M, and I have two sisters. Both my sister's have found loving relationships with people I genuinely like, but it's on me to carry on my family name, and I know it won't happen.I am the last living male with my last name. I was kicked in the testicles just right when I was a teenager, and I don't know if it's the exact cause, but I know for a fact that I'm shooting blank's.  
I was with a girl for almost six years, and we tried having a baby, but no luck so we knew it was either her or me that was the problem. We split up about four years ago, and I recently got in contact with her to check up, and go figure she has a child now, and I'm happy for her, but I now know I will never have a child from my own seed and my family bloodline will die out and it makes me sad. It broke my heart when I found this out.

It doesn't help that my immediate family pressures me, and constantly pushes me to find a woman, which I have tried many many times and failed. It's caused me to become more prone to go after women who already have children, and that's just a whole other can of worms I don't want to open right now.
Long story short I want a family so bad, and I know I'll never have one, and it really gets me down a lot of the time. I try to stay positive, but it just really gets me depressed. I've never had the heart to tell my parents that I'm shooting blank's, and basically only me and my ex know. I love children, and I know raising them is difficult, because I watched my older sister raise my niece's. I just hate that I will miss out on the experience of raising a family with someone, and getting to raise a child from my own seed.

6018,zwabio,HolidayAncient11,"I was having a conversation with my friend and I noticed I was being really pessimistic/negative and complained about everything that was happening in my life. I also overshared wayy too much about my anxiety, and it was kind of embarrassing I didn't stop myself. I usually don't like to talk about my mental health cause I always get shamed for it/or ppl don't understand and try to fix it. I tried to let her have some room to talk, but she wouldn't and just listened to all my problems in silence, it was kinda awkward... and Im not sure why, but getting no feedback from her just made me feel even worse and more alone. It felt like I am a freak screaming out annoying and depressing things to her. I just wish I was that kind of ""positive"" and ""bubbly"" person that lifted people up, instead of being an obnoxious complainer. Whenever I try to be positive though, it doesn't come out right and it makes me cringe seeing me try to lol. 

I really want to change myself, but no matter how hard I try I always end up the same. It's like a ball of negativity is just stuck to my skin and I can't rip it off. I know this negativity trails back to my past experiences, and exposures. I am just wondering how I can better myself as a person, and get rid of all my ridiculous past traumas that is what made me so pessimistic to this day. I was bullied in high school, and my dad/some family members were abusive narcissist's towards me so it left me with a low self esteem and perfectionist/OCD tendencies. There are days where I think that ""If I am not perfect, then I am worthless."" and the lowest grade I'd ever had was a 95% bc it was the only thing that made my dad proud of me. I just want to be perfect for people, and seeing me talk like this to my friend icked me so badly. It was like I was watching myself have a terrible personality and did nothing about it. I want to be a good  person that talks good of others, and not a complainer. But it is like I cannot help it, all of this negativity just spits out of me and I can't stop it.

I have 6 friends 2 human 3 dogs 1 cat, most of my friends are fucking animals.
I can’t bring my math grade about an 87 unlike my siblings who have A’s in all their classes.
I sit in my room all day the only sport I do is horse back riding and a bunch of idiots don’t even think it’s a sport.

6044,zwe22l,Grab_my_Slinky,"I froze up when talking to my coworker last night. I bought her a Christmas Gift. First time in 4 years I Bought anyone a gift that wasn’t my Grandma, Mom, or Sisters. I kinda shut off my brain this time and just went with my first thoughts. She texts me on Christmas saying she loved it. When I saw her last night at work, she said it made her smile alot, which made me happy.

Then she tells me she only got two other gifts, one from each parent. I like to think my gift made her day cause she didn’t seem to enthralled by her other gifts. My gift was a specific plush of her favorite character from a show. I wanted to say more to her but I froze up so bad. Like I like her but I’d also just want to at least get to know her outside of work, build a friendship first. This tug and pool inside my head to have someone that I can show love to just breaks me everyday. I said I was going to not fear rejection anymore, and I chickened out.

This has been just another terrible year. I think it really hit me when I celebrated my birthday (12/23) and Christmas alone. It wasn't even the absence of gifts or wishes. It was truly the silence. Just the absolute feeling of non existence. I wanted to go get myself a gift and cake but have been unemployed so that made it feel even worse. I try to avoid social media entirely as seeing others thrive tends to feel overwhelming while in my situation but I looked in desperate hopes of people reaching out. The emptiness was just too much. 

I'm just rambling at this point. I've wrote this many times now and just keep discarding. I feel silly thinking this will help. I'm a grown man with nothing to show, alone in life and all but forgotten. Maybe ill post it this time and look back in a year to see if things are better. I have a new job lined up so I suppose that's one step forward. How does it go, 2023 will be my year. It's all just something I suppose.

6068,zwi1np,anduril79,"Hi Reddit - looking for some advice. 

I've been friends with this individual for over 10+ years through high school, college, and now entering our 30s. Our friendship has ebbed and flowed over the years - we were much closer earlier on and over the last few years have started to drift apart. I've hated this and have made a concerted effort to counteract this by being more proactive in trying to spend time together - sadly I think its backfired at times and caused some issues. Its very clear that I care more about the friendship than she does. However usually whenever we have issues we find ways to make it work and I think we both know that we value each other. 

We had an argument in May and have never truly recovered - we've chatted about small things here and there and acknowledged that we needed to chat about the argument but it never happened. In  Sept, I asked a mutual friend to try and step in and help - that backfired and my friend said she won't be available for a while and to respect her space.  She reached out in Oct asking to meetup. We haven't been able to meetup because of travel or other obligations but we're both throwing out options and seem genuine about linking up, we're both responsive but keep the convo short and polite. 

The last i've heard from her was at the end of Nov. I've since followed up \~5 times or so checking in and haven't gotten a response. It was my bday recently and over the past 10 years she's never missed wishing me regardless of the status of our friendship. This raised alarm bells and I noticed that she blocked me on whatsapp, I think she restricted me on IG (can't see any stories, she doesn't respond to messages, but still follow each other and see that she watches my stories). She's never blocked me on Whatsapp before, (IG restriction yes), so thats not a great precedent that she's trying to be comprehensive. 

I'm not sure what to do and feel very uneasy about the situation. I consider her to be one of my closest friends despite the ups and downs. I don't want to turn to a mutual friend as that clearly backfired last time. Part of me worries that she's trying to finally cut off our friendship, but what i really dont understand is the sequence (she reached out to meet up &amp; seemed genuine about it) and the overnight change from Nov onwards (talking about meeting and then going dark). 

I know there are other channels I can reach her through (email, facebook msgr, etc) and I am planning a bday party in Jan, which could be a good excuse to reach out about...

What should i do?

Is there really no one I gave a smile once that fucking feels like giving back in a way? Did I really not affect anybody in my life that much that when I ask for support, I don't get it? Do people need to see stuff happen to tell if something's wrong? I've been crying out for help and no one realizes that if a guy goes to that extreme, things are already pretty fucked up. It's bad waking up and checking your phone hoping to find a ""how are you?"". ""Do you need anything?"" or ""Hope you're holding up fine"" out of nowhere. You know? It would help me go through the day even if it doesn't spark a conversation. Just checking would be enough. But yet I unlock my phone and it's empty. Fucking hurts. I feel bad looking for attention, I almost cry, because I know sometimes it's fake, but better than nothing. I don't get it. At all. A true, meaningful ""good morning, hope you're good!"" would be it. As I said, I don't need a conversation. I need to know someone's there. I feel bad being the one looking for it and texting people that are having other stuff to deal with in their lives and I get it I become annoying but.. No one has like 10 minutes of their day to check up on me. I need help and no one answers. I feel like all I've done my life and all the love I've given I've thrown it to the trash. I feel I've wasted my years. 26 years of being there and being nice and helpful and  the moment I'm the one needing help, fuck me.",2022-12-27 17:35:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626727044,1,/r/lonely/comments/zwl3l2/i_feel_like_no_one_listens_to_my_cry_for_help/,,0,0,I feel like no one listens to my cry for help.

The thing is, I do not feel like I'm lonely, I have friends who love me, family who loves me too, and a girlfriend who loves me. But, at these times of the year, I need to always be distracted with someone, I need to get to know new people and live experiences outside, but then I realize, that I might not have the friends, family, or life I want to have, because I'm not experiencing anything.

The thing that bothers me the most is that, this trouble that I previously mentioned, it is all in my head. Because I still do things in the summer and Christmas and everything, but there are certain days I can't keep thinking that I'm having a shitty life because I'm not doing anything with anybody. And it lets me down a lot, because I think I'm not used to being alone, I always need to be with somebody to let myself be accepted by others, or just by myself. I don't know, I'm truly afraid of tomorrow, because I haven't arranged any plan with anybody, and I might let myself go towards an endless loop of sadness, which usually happens, and I'm exhausted of it.

I have never fallen in love, well i did once, unrequited of course...
Still
Never reallymet anyone i felt that safe with, not even her.
I dont even care anymore that i'd probably get my heart broken
I've had the worst year of my life up until now and yet ive managed to keep it somewhat together still employed in a job i fucking despise yet i managed to somehow keep a roof over my head after being homeless for the whole first half of the year sleeping on floors and couches 

I should feel hopeful going in to the new year however i feel lower than i did when i was sleeping in the corner of peoples floors

I chose to spend the holidays on my own despite family offering me to stay with them i chose to just stay in the room im renting, i just needed to be alone to heal

i dont even understand why im complaining i dont even like people and i hate myself and everything ive become, i feel utterly hopless you could probably argue that the only reason i wanna fall in love is so that i can lockdown some poor unsuspecting girl who has all the promise and prosperity the world has to offer her and use her as an escape away from my own dogshit existence and turn a blind eye away from my own unattractive short comings, uno how toxic that seems ? Even worse that im aware of it, however i still want to love and feel love... instead i just treat my body like crap by drinking in excess and eating like shit

If i disappeared the world wouldn't notice which gives me all the more reason to do away with myself however the thought of how cliché that is i guess keeps me from doing it, either way im disgusted with myself, my friends are all living normal lives with partners and they look happy, im happy that they have someone whos there for them, someone whos in their corner

I even tried changing things for the better, i had an interview for a job opportunity in the company i currently work for which would be a step up from what im currently doing and have been doing for the last 4 years, i didnt get it which just proves how much of a fuck up i am and its becoming ever so much harder to stay sober 

Nothing matters, everything ive ever cared about has turned to shit and i feel empty and lost 

The weirdest part is i wouldn't know what to do with a girlfriend if you gave me one it seems like all those years my friends had to practice being in relationships with different girls, that was never afforded to me so i have no real experience, theres no reason for me to even try now 
Even if a chick wanted me i wouldn't fully allow myself to believe it would be for any valid reason im still the same guy i was and i will be in the future too, if no one wanted me then why should anyone want me now right?... god i hate christmas 

I need to find a way to stop feeling sorry for myself and destroy the desire i have for romance and love.",2022-12-27 23:54:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669053569,8,/r/lonely/comments/zwudb3/i_wanna_fall_in_love/,,0,2,I wanna fall in love

6215,zx1ayf,tired-neet,"IRL, I'm as quiet and gloomy as one can possibly be. Online, I hop from alt account to alt account, just to not be recognized, and act in pretty unlikable and anti-social ways

Despite all of that, I don't know what's up with me, but I just keep on attracting the sweatest and most interesting of people. What hurts is that they all seem to really like me, some even get really attached

and yet, I just keep on either ghosting or avoiding them, ultimately letting them down, deceiving their hopes. On top of that guilt, actual friends are rare to come by, so I also feel awful for ruining every single opportunity, despite life continuously handing them to me. I mean, most of you guys are here because others reject you, and not the opposite, right?

I'm too scared of commitment, have trust issues, and have way too low of a self-esteem. Even by letting all of that asides, the whole thing is inherently flawed from the start, as the image they have of me doesn't reflect reality. They're just being fooled by appearances

Assuming they are genuine, I keep on hearing praises, but it's only because they don't realize how boring I truly am. It feels like the illusion could shatter at the slightest misstep on my end

As much as I want and try to push through it, as soon as things get personal, my mind freezes, I become too anxious to do anything and I bail without a word

the easy fix would to simply be more confident, and I'm still working on that, but only half-heartedly. It's been so long but so little has changed and my anguishes still feel completely warranted.

I love football (soccer) and even though the timezones are horribly aligned with the Premier League, I still manage to watch all of my team’s games and go to school and stuff fine.

21F doing online college. Transfered schools three times in two years. I met some aquaintences and hung out with some people here and there but I was also religious at the time, and I'm not anymore. I moved back home last year, me and my ex broke up and I got a job working retail. I make everyone laugh and I'm a great friend to everyone, but no one ever like reaches out or anything. I left the church I was attending due to losing faith and I tried to make friends elsewhere. Work out classes, coffee shops, BumbleBFF, friends of friends.

Dating in these conditions is a nightmare. So I stopped trying for the time being. I was talking to a guy who lives in another state, but he's so incredibly flaky and absent that I can't date him. 

It's so lonely at this age. I feel like I've tried everything. I'm having unhealthy* thoughts and it's getting really bad.",2022-12-28 15:22:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1657061425,15,/r/lonely/comments/zxc88k/ive_tried_to_make_friends_for_the_last_two_years/,,0,6,I've tried to make friends for the last two years and have failed miserably.
6288,zxcoz1,Low-Reference6919,"So I’m currently at my in laws for Xmas. My husband is out visiting a friend. My bro in law and his gf are in the living room on their phones / laptops. And my mother and father in law are working in their office. 

I never thought I could be so bad with socialising or approaching someone about socialising. I’m literally overthinking this to the point where my anxiety is attacking me and making me think all sorts of nonsense about my lack of confidence, how nobody likes me, how I will never make friends, how even my husband will eventually find me socially weird and leave me etc etc. these Instruive thoughts are getting worse by the minute. 

I’m in the bedroom where we’ve been put up for this week just on my phone in silence typing this out. I don’t know if I should go down and ask about watching a film together in case of rejection.  we are close but not that close. 

The annoying this is I was getting annoyed at my husband because he said “I might find time to meet my friend” so it wasn’t an official plan. So when he dropped it on me 2 days ago, I was panicking thinking “what am I gonna do for half the day then?!” Mainly cuz I’m currently in the country, it’s raining a bit and I don’t have my laptop or anything. Even if I did, I don’t have anything amusing that I like doing on there. My mother in law heard me get annoyed and said she can organise to do something with me … but then she took it back because she didn’t want to drive 40mins into town in the rain to go to the cinema. Which I found out last night. 

So I’m a little peeved right now. Obviously I’m not gonna tell my husband not to go and see his friend cuz that would be mean. However now my husband gets to go out and have fun and I’m left here alone basically. My siblings are recovering from covid so they’re not in the mood to be on FT for hours otherwise they would definitely. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I think it’s cuz since I met my husband who has a lot of friends or at least a reason to socialise, it’s made me feel bad cuz since covid all my friends just left. And it’s been very hard to make friends (didn’t realise it was so hard for adults to make friends in their late 20s). Especially as I don’t go out that much cuz I’m anxious about covid spikes. 

Has anyone else been in the same boat? Can anyone relate? 

Thanks. Merry Christmas!",2022-12-28 15:40:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608669061,5,/r/lonely/comments/zxcoz1/just_realised_im_out_of_touch_with_myself/,,0,3,Just realised I’m out of touch with myself

I talk to myself everyday and multiple times a day. I also talk to myself even when their is my family in the room.

When i have thoughts i have the feeling to say it out loud to myself. I realise I repeat the same time multiple times a day. For example, i will repeat my plans multiple times a day.

6309,zxgrqt,[deleted],"Full disclosure I have OCD and Paranoia but I still have some semblance of logical consistency. I believe the society is becoming more alienated and lonely not necessarily there is a government agenda to make people lonley but the culture of consumerism and atomization is what's causing lonliness. I am tired of idiots who say just be comfortable being alone like bro I have been alone my entire life, I lost friends, my parents are neglectful and emotionally distant, I was bullied by entire school at one point and didn't have anyone to support me. I visit these toxic subs on reddit and read articles online about dating culture it seems like there is move towards lonliness or being alone. Recently someone posted about trend of couples living apart and I feel like their pushing this trend and another post saying can women. There is culture trend of pushing single positivity (nothing wrong with being single it's just feels like toxic positivity bullshit to me like people are allowed to feel lonely being single), the idea we need to be hyper independent and do everything ourselves and no one is allowed to help anyone. It's almost as if seeking help or helping others is a sin. There is no empathy or compassion for others, friendship has become just this entertainment machine forgoing any meaningful support or love. To me it feels like something is forcing us to be alone and believe that there is nothing we can do about it. But I believe we can, I believe we can redefine friendship and heal the relationship between men and women and I do want to do something with my life to help create more empathetic and compassionate people and instill healthy optimism into others.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ This platform sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all. It would be ideal if we can move to a different one since it's hard to tell if ppl ghost me or not lmao.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-12-28 19:29:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,2,/r/lonely/comments/zxiizf/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,7,18M Hi everyone!

6333,zxjkf9,[deleted],"Some days I'm okay with being alone and some days are much harder. These past several weeks have been some of the worst I've had. I'm sitting here by myself on the verge of having a panic attack because the complete and utter lack of affection, or any attention at all really, is absolutely crushing. I don't mean in a sexual sense either. I want to be held. I want to love and be loved, and I am completely alone. I have not touched another person in over a year. I haven't had an actual, honest, heart to heart conversation with another person in the same amount of time. I talk to coworkers but it's just surface level small talk. I easily go months without really ""talking"" to people, and at times it is crushing. Smoking weed is the only thing that helps, but even that comes with its own set of problems (laziness, increased isolation, lack of motivation to do anything at all). Over the past several years, I've slowly found myself approaching my breaking point. Being a man makes it all the worse, as men are often looked down upon for feeling this way. I don't want to come off as desperate, which is difficult because in all honesty, I am. I desperately want to care for and love another person. I desperately want to be cared for and loved. My love language is touch, which makes it all the more painful. I'm going to stop here before I start repeating myself more than I probably already have.

6369,zxq0kq,LoveIsNPHard,"By all factors I am built to be chronically lonely.

I have depression. If it wasn't good enough that I have very few close friends, my depression never fails to remind me that for legitimate reasons I am not only incapable but also undeserving of the care network I need. Always the professional care network is brought up to me; I can think little except for how I have to pay for therapy, pay for a listening ear that must be scheduled a month in advance. Good thing my natural waking hours keep me up in the dead of night, when nobody is around in physical or virtual proximity to keep me company.

I value physical proximity and touch. So it's absolutely wonderful to be constantly touch-starved when any relationship with touch is seen as the undesirable ""FWB"" and my life situation instability along with only niche hobbies scatter around the country the friends I feel most emotionally close to. All I can do is text in times of crisis and wait for a reply the next business day.

And text I do. So easily I run out of people to dump my lonely thoughts to. And so I reach out to random Facebook friends from years ago, random internet chats, in hopes of anything that could be meaningful. But my diseased self always finds a way to turn those chats into romantic advances, uncomfortable ones. My unprompted chats are creepy and unwanted.

Those chats aren't the only way I've made others uncomfortable. I've had notable issues with burning eye-contact with those I find attractive and a history of non-consensual physical touch, especially when alcohol is involved. The moment of physical contact never outweighs the lifelong consequences I rightfully face in response. It is justice and karma well-done that keeps people away from befriending me, lest I try to incorporate physicality. It is for their safety.

So what's the point of enjoying food and drink, having hobbies, living life, if I don't have anyone to share it with? So much advice is to get out and do activities, either with the friends I don't have or alone and hoping for interaction. But hope is despair soon enough when interaction doesn't happen. The few interactions I do have are good but fleeting. Very few people are open to catalyzing a lifelong relationship on the street, in the cafe. Perhaps they have the friends, the care they need, unlike me.

Ending life would be unfair and terrible to those that know me. But when the hurt of loneliness has no end and the hurt I've done to others outweighs the momentary joys in my day-to-day, it's hard to justify being around. It's not enough to say that I'll die alone; I'll die *because* I'm alone.",2022-12-29 00:21:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622082883,1,/r/lonely/comments/zxq0kq/dying_alone_or_dying_because_of_being_alone/,,0,0,Dying alone or Dying Because of being alone?

6379,zxrhse,Willing_Category1331,"I can't enjoy myself at all. Videogames feel soulless and different from when I played them before, just cold numbers. I can't bring myself to do anything, can hardly even bring myself to play videogames, I just sit and passively scroll mindless content or listen to song that I've already listened to and which sound..... like flat, one dimensional, like it's just a constant droning noise with no pitch variation. I have went out with friends once in my life ever. I try to do it again but a plan never comes through. Other than that I have no friends and I rarely speak to those guys even. Never talked to a girl and probably never will. See every other motherfucker out here enjoying themselves with friends, and it just feels like they are a completely different species living in a separate yet parallel dimension, like these people all intrinsically know something, have some sort of knowledge, that I don't. Every time I try to join a group or discussion I feel like an outcast, like they obviously don't want to talk to me. I seem to get treated like an NPC in a game that you speak to once for like 5 seconds to get a quest and then never speak to again. Talking to me, people are obviously not happy about/want to do it. They look heartless and without emotion. Only time I'm talked to is to acquire something. After that, they return to the people they actually want to be around who I fail to see how they are so much different than men and it's all smiles and laughs and jokes. I don't get it. Life is flying by, I recently looked back on something that felt like I did just recently, and saw that it was 2 fucking years ago. Where did my time go? I'm in the exact same position. I've never had friends all my life and never realized this wasn't normal until recently. Looking back on all my life, I never went out with friends after school. I talked to people in school, of whom showed no further effort to make contact with me than feigning happiness during a brief interaction, and then went home and played videogames or stared at another screen. I feel like I've had my life robbed by these fucking electronics yet thy have given me good times, but then I think what the fuck, this isn't normal others were out having fun with their friends. And I feel no sort of emotion typing this, it's just blank and it kills me. I struggle to even think straight for a second, my mind is so scrambled. I have to think about something over and over to visualize it. Even now in this post, since I feel nothing writing it, I feel like I'm not doing a good job explaining this, like the words are leaving my mind, I know there are more descriptive and profound words yet I cannot pull them from my brain, even as I type this sentence. It's not some sort of feeling of great emotion where you cry and are happy for periods of time, it's just cold calculated laziness and hopelessness and utter shittiness. My face feels hot right now and I have been thinking about how I'm going to open the window which is right next to me for the past 30 minutes and I still haven't, it's like I'm paralyzed.

I've got 200+ games, equipped with now the same option paralysis I have with Hulu, Netflix, all streaming services which make just selecting something to enjoy somehow extremely difficult to do. Anyone else ever experienced this and how have you gotten out of the groove? 

NOTE: when the tl;dr is too long, yo, obviously the length will run most off immediately; genuine thank you to those compassionate enough to stick around and kind enough to want to posit your own perspective here.

I'm used to being lambasted on here, any sub, for posting anything because I can't seem to type without saying Over 9,000 things more than I need to to explain the same thing, it's because I'm often taken directly out of context to what my intentions are, I can manage but I don't mean to be annoying, offensive, encroaching, bothersome. Ever. 

---

This is all over the place, so, if you only read the TL;DR, I understand. SORRY for the length everyone. Just been putting this off for weeks feeling like I'd get undermined like I have on many other subs, but I'd rather try to get some kind of assistance, advice here. Apologies in advance, I have come to understand that lengthy posts are like, frowned upon. D: This is gonna start specific to a few games then branch out into the larger problem I'm ultimately faced with. This'll be all over the place, Asperger's is real, no I'm not kidding lol being legit here. So. BRACE YOURSELF. TEST. YOUR MIGHT. 

Today, I'm playing Stranger of Paradise, I actually dig the combat so I was looking into the DLC and it's reviews on store were bad but the ones in YouTube comments were almost glowing. So I got to asking if they were worth it since the reviews on the store are all like 2/3 stars of 5. (Really put me off to it but I decided to get the game over Crisis Core Reunion because I've beaten CC in 08 and remember the whole game, I don't often replay story games because it's like a sense of well I've been there done it and yes, it's annoying but I have trouble forcing myself to enjoy something just because it's available. I wanted CC then I heard Zack's voice was ruined and the game looks still like a PSP update, if the game play is that updated I'll get it but it looks kinda like the fake game you know?) Was looking at World of Maxima, FF Type-0, dunno how those are and they're hard to really guage from the reviews I've seen. Never got into any MMOs, tried to with several. I decided on SOP because I wasted my money on Elden Ring's clunk fest mccumbersome Dark Souls: the Lord of the Rings even though wait wasn't it already kinda LotR, aiyiyi lost on me hey it's probably got a great plot, I just can't get past how kinda cumbersome, non dynamic the game play is for the 4 classes I tried xD NOTE IF YOU LIKE IT, I'm actually stoked for you, you deserve to, you're dope at a very difficult game heck yeah. I just had never played a Soulsborne game and never wanted to, TO ME PERSONALLY they're like worse than Rogue-lite's in terms of FUN factor (and rogues are fun to play, just with sooo many of them and they're all largely the same GAME, can't put anything past Dead Cells). Games have seemingly gotten eh so much CHALLENGING but HARD just for the sake, difficulty for the sake of being difficult. I look at Celeste that game is rage inducing to me no end. I can see how one would dig it if they got very good with the mechanics and movement, for sure, but I didn't have the wherewithal to play a game for hours just to get decent enough to play the early stages, that's a downhill battle for me. I get the appeal for sure. I make my way in Dead Cells but that's the only 2D game I have been incredible at that's supposed to be difficult since like the SNES lol. So, anyone else seem to collect games more than play them? Is this just me? I'd buy a new one then start to play it and it wouldn't...feel... fulfilling, or it feels unpolished, not quite shovel ware but AC Valhalla is a people example of something I was eager to play because Odyssey was good for what I played of it, and yeesh that game looks so choppy that it's hard to even enjoy. If you do, again, glad that you got your money's worth, just speaking from anecdotal experience here. Heck, the markers disappear when I get close to them so I can't even see where my objective is when I'm nearby it, just doesn't play very well. Immortals Fenyx Rising was awesome then I got the like the second statue, after Aphrodite twice, then the game started to seem like ah okay this whole game is like the exact same thing throughout it, it's puzzle, the vaults so more aggressive puzzle and combat. I even bought all the season pass and one of the cosmetics, after I did that, I went to play it again and I felt like, less inspired to finish the damn thing. I could still go back to that one I at least remember all my progress and build and whatnot but whenever I start to get going in that game I just think agh I'm gonna fall into a vault I find, do like the same puzzle different permutation, idek how to explain it, maybe that all of the quests feel so like disjointed? The puzzles aren't so much fun as they are kind of in the way? Maybe they get better as the game goes on, I want to enjoy how the DLC is. Reviews told me it was crappy and more and more kept saying how bad they were the month after I got them and now it's 3/5 stars on the store and DLC is less, and the DLC isn't something I ought to start until I beat the main story since they take place after it and the character seems fully upgraded so I'd miss all the progression and feel OP then have no point to go back to the main game to unlock those for Fenyx when the eastern expansion has them all just almost reskinned in a way. See what I mean aiyiyi how do I get here. Then I got Persona 5, can't figure out what to do in the second metaverse thing where you have to jump into the painting SM64 style, it's like, a dead end that leads nowhere and I've watched tutorials. Note, I have Asperger's Syndrome, that actually may have something to do with explaining away some aspects of this or my loquaciousness; it makes certain things really difficult to understand. I enjoy difficulty in games, I would enjoy playing on hard mode fresh out of the gate for almost every PS2-PS3 era title I ever had, lesser with games borrowing more and more Soulsborne elements all the time.

Bringing it back around, hm I LOVE Ninja Gaiden, so I figured hey I'll love a Team Ninja game set in the FF universe, a retelling if you will of FF1, and so far SOP is the one game I keep coming back to in recent weeks. It's grindy but the combat makes it engaging. I literally ended up on this whole shebang just because I was wondering if he DLC is worth the money because I dig the game play and the new jobs look dope, yet the reviews were of two opposite minds so it's hard to get a good read on whether or not to. Then I started thinking damn it you're gonna spend money on the DLC and look at how many times you've done that and how many games you have in your collection that you've never played, tried to but they didn't grip you. It's absolutely brutal, maybe I'm sabotaging myself unintentionally? It is harrowing to have 250+ owned games on my external and have option paralysis when I turn on my console because there's too many of them to pick one. Game Pass I thought would help so I but less games and play more, but it's the same thing lol I'll download one, start it, even start to like it, then lose interest. This happens with almost every game. Tales is Arise is the last game I beat. Well, Dead Cells 3 times but that's not all that much of a feat anymore it seems lol. I got kinda far, side quests like crazy, in Kingdom of Amalur then it became icon fatigue side quest galore that mostly fell low fetch quests or fast travel here to talk to someone and bring an item there, it's not engrossing after a while and I'm always trying diff builds so I stopped playing almost right after Rathir, didn't get on the boat even. I wanna play it thru but when I turn it on I get this sense of boredom. This happens with really great games too, I did it with Dragon Quest XI, I did it with Okami when it came out in 08 and then when it re-released, got decently far into it then, went to the store because I had money to spend and liked to have games on reserve. Then I got game pass and started installing bunches of games to have them a la the point of game pass in many ways, then I would experience that option paralysis that makes it very hard to enjoy streaming services on the whole, can never pick something to dedicate to watch and then I just want to interact when I start watching others do it on a TV screen or I want someone to talk about the show with. So then I said alright baths if I spend my hard earned money on the games I'll be more inclined to play them. Went on a big black Friday spree three years back, had tons of games, only beat Dragon Quest Inquisition and The Witcher 3, which now is like hard for me to go back and play (dunno what changed either, I did I guess, it's less enjoyable to play than it used to be, sensing a theme here). Tried The Witcher 2, no go, it's unreasonably clunky and back pedaling from 3 which makes sense but is almost unplayable after 3. I used to like seeing the large number of games but now I resent it because there's so many that I have a lot of trouble even sitting down with one to even get through it. If the DLC for this is worth it I will certainly pick it up. The reviews as I said made me extremely iffy, seems MOST reviews in the store are kinda crummy for just about every game lol. Then Elden Ring has like 5 stars and it's like, Dark Souls 4 so I get why but for someone who hasn't been into that model of game, it's not that awesome or groundbreaking, it's good for those who like the type of thing but, what I've gleaned is that the genre is essentially play until you make a bit of progress, die to get sent back a bit farther than you likely wanted to, backtrack through what you've already done again but better. It's like, wat where is the fun in this. xD It's nuts how I love Ninja Gaiden, Dead Cells but don't like say Hades very much &amp; haven't found another Rogue-lite/like that I've really dug, Foregone was cool but again, stopped playing it a ways through... 

Now to pick up and restart thru the games I've played like half of to reexperience the story I have already gotten through feels like such a drag, a slog, like I'm waiting to get to the newness so it's far less endearing to play thru what I've already seen and of course it's my own fault eek lol. Final Fantasy Type-0 looked cool too but again the PSP retreads are not all that appealing. I don't know why they just feel more barebones you know, same reason I couldn't quite justify getting Crisis Core Reunion, am willing to change mind here? Sorry for the length, this is me stone cold sober dawg. I gave up the addictions cold turkey well over a month ago including prescription esketamine twice a week, amphetamine IR 30mg 2x daily, klonopin daily, not to mention the blood pressure and antidepressant. BINGO RYAN, this is probably the red flag right here, huh? To perceive those as addictions when they were prescribed to me and I utilized them less than prescribed so as not to fuck myself getting too used to or into them, and they're supposed to be looked at as therapeutic medication, they put me on I never suggested the shit. The longer one is at a psychiatrist, the more likely they are to be put onto SOME antipsychotic, Depakote, Abilify, Rexulti, these should not be taken for anything besides psychosis, it's a serious ass symptom and serious ass drugs that seriously overhaul your entire emotional experience of life into less of an experience, less bad at the expense of all the same less good. I say this because they tried gaslighting my ass and my mother towards antipsychotics, along with several people I know who go to the same place, it's fucked. Kept trying to CONVINCE me to take it lest they cut my other medications, very shady shit, I've only ever been kind, compassionate, gentle understanding to the people there - prescribing Abilify for depression or anxiety disorders is like taking an ambien for anxiety, except your whole emotional center goes to sleep not your physical body, it's ambien for the soul, I digress, if it does work for some you know or you, I'm absolutely glad, I'm simply saying that antipsychotics, root word psychosis, not THAT MANY MF are going through psychosis especially when they're being told to try low dose antipsychotic, I doubt the administrator has ill intent, it's just going by the book they were taught, which ought to be redrafted but I will digress). To be honest they probably didn't stop taking my specific insurance they likely used that as the excuse to drop me from services because I was being defiant in an objective way about antipsychotics questioning exactly their what their motivation was in deciding willy nilly hey what you've been on has been working fine let's throw a spanner into the mix just because. It's a low low dose no need to worry. PS: do not be a pharmacology student and have your doctor know, even unintentionally, as it very well could be used against you. It's a miracle I'm as unscathed as I am, it's been a rough month. Knock on wood. Really gotta move past the panic attack and get into a different place but I dunno where to begin bc I had the same doctor for 7 years, one I had before him no longer practices he retired. I dunno if it'll be as simple as just, calling any place and getting in and saying yeah uh I really want to be put back on what I was on, perhaps in smaller dosages to be safer as ever, because these things WORKED, my life has come apart the past month from the inside. 

So I'm just writing an essay on reddit trying to vent out how I'm trying my ass off to enjoy new games or games that I get and no matter which one besides Dead Cells which is fun to see what you get every time and where you make it to... beating the Lighthouse on the very first try with rather shitty equipment blew my fuckin mind and made me think damn maybe I should try that whole Twitch thing but then I almost defeat myself thinking ehh I don't want to be just another person in a saturated market who doesn't really know how to get people to even listen to his music since that's viewed by those who hear a guy is a musician nowadays as oh just some wannabe's dream yeah right scoff laugh when, given the chance, one may see hokay man does DO the damn thing across multiple genres, we fux wit it, we here for it. Trying hard to build an audience with zero business acumen (hey I admit it, I have to own it, I'm trying; being diagnosed autistic at 26, man, shit has hindered my life, has made me feel a little more alienated and less understood), so getting a whole new audience to want to watch me play the games I'm decent at without having any like, people in my life that already share and support or even take a few minutes from their day to give a guy who wants the best possible outcome for all possible peoples one chance who may actually be on his way to carving that niche. So sorry to foist this off to anyone. Idk where exactly to post this, it's game related so... Pardon me. Sorry if a bit unwieldy, my social foundation is, well, autistic, literally, so that may explain some things. Not trying to say excuses, tryna mind finding a way to build a bridge in the event that I'm coming across in ways I'm really not meaning to, because I'm used to that increasingly over the past decade and it's gotten worse and worse, I just have to explain things in like 4 different ways to show that no I mean 4, 2+2=4, 3+1=4, 0+4=4, 16/4=4, 2*2=4, there are still an objective total of 4, note various ways to arrive there 🤔 Inb4 go do other shit, I'll expand on that if anyone is seriously willing to halp out so as not to make this even longer ffs.

I feel like I have had many 'deep'/personal conversations with my closest friends, and I have also had many open/vulnerable/deep conversations with my parents and sister. On paper, it seems like I shouldn't feel lonely, but I do, and I'm not sure why. 

I have a few theories as to why I feel this way,, but I would love to hear some other people's theories or experiences.

One of my theories is that I don't show my emotions much with anyone apart from my family. What I mean by this is that I can tell my friends that I am sad/upset/angry about something etc. but I will say this in a casual upbeat way, I won't show them the emotion i.e crying Infront of them or being visibly sad. I will always chirp myself up before I see friends/chat because often times I will be sad/tired but I don't want to bring them down with my mood or for them to notice. I have realised that I wear a social mask. I have had various mental health difficulties, and for years I was pretty bad at regulating my emotions. I could put on a face when in public, and suppress the emotion enough until I was at home but then I would have long crying sessions/meltdowns. I have casually told some friends about this, but they have never seen this side of me. I don't know if this makes any sense/is relevant to why I feel so lonely.

Another theory is that I just can't haven't found many people who I click with/who are actually like me. I have talked to so many people, and in great depth, and often people have said they never have these kinds of conversation with anyone else apart from me, but then I don't understand what they do talk about with other people. I crave real connection so I always try to really get to know the other person, and understand how they see the world.

Perhaps I am just insecure? I am the friend who generally makes the most effort in my friendships, I'm the one who messages, suggests meet ups, listens to other people's problems. If I didn't make this effort I would talk a lot less to my friend's/see them less often. Maybe I just want to feel like the other person makes as much effort as me? I think I am ashamed of showing my full self and perhaps deep down I feel unlovable/unworthy. My true unregulated self is very obsessive/emotional and I just think that people wouldn't really want to be around that person because it is annoying, so I suppress that side of me. 

I just feel this deep emotional pain, which I have felt on and off for over a decade, and I don't know how to overcome it. I think this pain is loneliness, a kind of longing for a deep connection that I've never really had.

If you got this far, thank you for listening to my rambles. Sorry if it doesn't really make sense.",2022-12-29 02:44:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1625228466,7,/r/lonely/comments/zxtdrg/i_dont_know_why_i_feel_so_lonelyi_have_friends/,,0,32,"I don't know why I feel so lonely...I have friends, close friends, and a family who care, but I often feel cripplingly lonely.

6421,zxvo48,kozekyto,"I don’t feel and have never felt connected to anyone. I have no issue making professional relationships work (eg coworkers, colleagues, or randoms). The moment a relationship hints at becoming deeper or more involved it quickly becomes overwhelming (yes, I have trust issues). When I have made “friends” in the past, I just feel like I am their friend, but they aren’t my friend, if that makes sense? I’ll be there for them, let them open up to me and be a source of comfort and confidentiality but I have never opened up to anyone before (no im being serious. Not even my parents).It’s never felt real. I’ve never in my life had a truly genuine friendship or connection with anyone around me, especially my family. Even my best friend of almost 10 years.

I haven’t spoken with or had a real conversation (apart from work) in months, and I didn’t think it would have such an effect on me. I am a pretty major introvert, but I still strive for genuine connections with people; as im sure many people do. Im at a loss of what to do. My parents have drilled it into my head that it’s my own fault and that I just need to get out more. Sure, that makes sense but it just makes me angry. They don’t understand and I haven’t made it clear to them why it’s so hard for me to just “get out there”. I’m not even nervous meeting new people, I actually really enjoy it, I’ve just never ever made it past “name, hobby, favorite color” type of shit. I’m by no means an outcast, but I just feel excluded whenever I go out, try to meet with friends, talk with my family, etc. Haven’t even dated before, I think the closest I got was the single high school dance I went to with a friend my junior year. Never held hands, never kissed, never done anything remotely romantic or sexual. Not a bad thing by any means, but it makes me feel like I’ve missed out in a sense. I’m curious what it’s like to be loved or admired in that kind of way.

I get that I’m rambling, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to, I just needed somewhere to vent for a second and atm can’t think of a the best place for that than reddit lol. 

I don’t need advice or sympathy, I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. I’m to the point that it physically hurts to be lonely, but I don’t know how else to live. I’ve been this way since I was a kid, and it’s only gotten worse. I’m too scared to let people get to know me because they’ll just abandon me or I’ll abandon them out of irrational fear.

6457,zxwvtu,improvement-throwawa,"So I suppose I’ll start with an autobiographical section before getting to where I am today. Hopefully this won’t be too long. I’ve been in a pretty bad depressive state for the past few months, and it stems from my loneliness, as well as a fear that I will be unable to change it. I haven’t had any irl friends (I have online friends) since 9th grade (late 2016), and that’s obviously extremely abnormal, and the length of time is one of the things that makes it feel impossible for me. I used to be of the belief that it was just social anxiety that caused this, but upon closer examination I think that that’s only one aspect of it.The main thing that’s been on my mind lately is that I don’t share anything in common with anybody anymore. Back when I did have friends, we would take about typical 13 year old boy things like video games, youtubers, just whatever right. Well since 9th grade I’ve only had 2 real interests that I’ve spent almost all of my free time on, music and later on politics. I know that these aren’t exactly obscure things, but nobody wants to talk about politics all day, and when I say music I mean listening to multiple albums a day every day. I’m completely out of the loop on things like sports, movies, tv, books, video games, etc. I feel as if I’ve been living in a different world to normal people, and don’t know how to converse with them because we just operate completely differently.These years of isolation have impacted my social skills pretty badly too. I go silent in groups because I never have anything to add, I never start conversations (only ever responding, I just can’t think of something to say), I feel like I’m too short and blunt in conversations, and obviously my anxiety is quite bad. I can’t keep a conversation going without losing steam after 5 minutes or less. I think my problem is that I've become a one-dimensional person. I also suspect I may have undiagnosed autism, and I don't know how much that will complicate things.

So I don't know what to do now. I'm willing to expand my horizons and interests (and not just out of a perceived necessity, but out of genuine interest as well) in a way that will help me relate to people, but I still have questions and concerns with that. For instance, where would I go to find people I clicked with? I've been dabbling in some things like video games, anime, film etc and that leads me to questions like which games/anime/film should I consume to relate to people, how long will it take to get to a point where I'm conversational, how much do I need to have in common with someone to forge a friendship, etc. There's just a lot that I don't know, and I feel that I'm ready to change but don't know what to do or where to go.

I also worry that this is all in vain, and it may be futile to even try to change things. I feel as if I've ruined my life. How do I deal with those feelings?

In any case I'm slightly hesitant about posting this because I'm sure there will have been some thought or detail that I forgot to mention, but this is the bulk of it so whatever.",2022-12-29 05:27:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655244168,1,/r/lonely/comments/zxwvtu/i_20m_havent_had_friends_since_9th_grade_and_i/,,0,0,I (20m) haven’t had friends since 9th grade and i don’t know what to do

For those who didn't see the last post my life is bad because my dad made me have a shit view on everything since he was an abusive acholic who drank 100+ beers a day for over a month basically making me traumatized of relationships seeing how bad they could go, on the side of that dish my mom has; limes disease, rocky mount and a shit ton more issues that me and her have to struggle through since I help her out throughout the night feeding the animals which weren't ran over.  


For why the post's name is this. I can't tell my mom how I'm truly dealing, to make it short I can't find people attractive because I feel like I would be sold out at a moments notice, making me feel like people only want me because of; OHHH HES BLUE EYED BLONDEY OOOOOOO, HES TALL LOOK, Glasses???, ""smart"", ""nice looking"" and honestly I hate how I'm traditionally attractive even if I say I'm not.   


Why are you an artist? oh because I can draw a character which feels like my ideal relationship  
Isn't that cringey? Yes I know it is and I embrace it.  
Having a character for me to look up to as a 14 year old other than my mom is great especially because I can draw my character and feel the euphoria enter my head thinking of what I can draw yet not having ideas to draw I become sad and sit all day until night where I help my mom and feel confrontable drawing somewhat lewdish drawings since wow I want to go the fuck away from my past and that starts with drawing anthropomorphic girls- and he's attracted to a character he made great. and how am I supposed to tell my mom simple I don't and wait to get a therapist to help me when I'm older making me feel sad and lonely since I have no friends since I talk ""smart"" or did I just watch informational things as a kid HMMMMMM. And I only appease them not talking about how life sucks because they run away from me thinking I'm a horrible person and that I abused them or some shit. so I feel hated as a result since everyone runs away from me except adults- never fucking mind everyone hates me. I can't post my art because its way too fucking nsfw for a 14 year old to draw so nobody can see my art but me. Its not even porn just wow he just drew a character naked not like art and sculptures do that aswell. I can't express how much I like the characters because how am I supposed to tell my mom ""I'm in love with an anthropomorphic slime cat thing who is smug and overly sexual"" like I would be laughed at or beat for not loving a real girl but a slime. A FUCKING SLIME. but I don't give a shit like I'm happy with that but I can't tell if its normal is it or is it not?  


I feel isolated since nobody wants to be my friend so I feel isolated I can't tell my mom or I would be digging my grave now and I just feel like having a mental breakdown since I can't get help since I don't want anyone to know this and I am waiting until I'm 18 to get my own therapist to have full privacy and make sure no info gets shared making this agenizing stuck with wondering if I'm mentally okay or not.

6507,zy1x7q,Markipt,"CW: slight mentions of abuse, suicidal type thoughts, transphobia

I think if it were based on things I could change, my chronic loneliness wouldn't be so bad. But in every scenario my very self was the fatal flaw. A lot of the time it was because of my gender-queerness, something that people somehow never believed in yet also abused me with solely that being the reason. Other times it was my mind, people were scared of me and my questions and thoughts, and the way I would think, well, apparently differently. I couldn't help the fact I was born with a mind that craved to understand, and so many people ended up being intimidated by it or just finding me weird or annoying for things like getting too deep into discussions. But for me I don't fit in regardless of if I go with the flow and pretend to enjoy striving for popularity. No matter what I do my gender alone is enough to be completely outcasted. My mind is never engaged by surface level discussions. Attractiveness is measured on a very binary scale, and androgyny is seen as childish, especially when you're short and of an Asian background like I am. 

I think the biggest factor to why I feel lonely isn't really me being alone, but more so just the fact I've never once been understood in any significant way by anyone. No one's ever been able to just get me the way others say they feel I get them, or the way I see people relating to each other. I'm just different apparently; and different really doesn't mean as much of a positive thing as people make it out to be. Being genuinely different means people are scared of you or at the very least think you're something worth ridiculing. Being different on a fundamental level means never being able to rely on anyone to guide you, and being forced to navigate life completely on your own. It means having no family, no one who understands you and no one who genuinely wants to. It means trying desperately to prove to yourself you matter despite everything in society displaying that it never considered you, what with how nothing ""general"" ever seems to work for you the way it does for others. It means going to suicide hotlines and getting advice that doesn't apply to someone like you. It means you have to question if you're even really human when you've never seemed to be able to experience any humanity.

A little nsfw but:

Honestly that's probably why I started becoming hypersexual, probably the exact opposite of how everyone who thinks they know me perceive me. Sexual feelings are my connection to feeling valued for something undeniably human. I think that's particularly why I like bdsm, because in it I get to voluntarily feel pain and dehumanization instead of trying desperately to stop it for once. It also makes me feel like I'm not as alone. No one cares about my brain when they're focused on my body. I get to feel normal for a few moments. Sometimes I don't know if it's worth living a life where the only thing that feels good is overwhelming pain. I'm tired of being so undesirable in every other way. I wish someone could love me, even just for a moment.

I'm tired of never feeling connected to people.",2022-12-29 10:15:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594622748,0,/r/lonely/comments/zy1x7q/everyone_i_think_i_love_eventually_leaves_me_one/,,0,1,"Everyone I think I love eventually leaves me one way or the other, and my only fault was being myself"

I have just parents to call ""mine"" who are not close to me and I borderline hate them. No friends in real life.

i don’t know if this is all in my head or if there’s something severely wrong. 

i am pretty lonely when it comes to friends and feeling included. i gave up some years ago when i started noticing a pattern of people going to social events together (let’s say, classmates for example) and during the event or after they go like “oh yeah! you should’ve went. it was so fun!!!” (when they didn’t even invite me) or “oh i would invite you but i thought you would be busy” (busy doing what? being in my room rotting?)

after many years of enduring this and letting it hit my self esteem, i asked a new group of friends this year why they do that. i wanted answers. i specifically asked the most direct person if i’ve done something uncomfortable or something along those lines. i kept toasting my brain trying to find the reason. she said “nope! not at all! you’re amazing. i just thought you were busy”.. that excuse again. i don’t think i come off as busy.

i’m in college, and i’ve been to another college before. it was the same during school, high school and until now. am i just fucked? especially during high school and now i usually go the whole day without talking to anyone. maybe a teacher. but i go home, no one notices me, and then i get inside and watch people around me have fun.

i feel like this could all be in my head and i’m at fault, but i don’t know how i can fix that either. these days i found out that i can for sure relate to the girl from watamote (i think that’s the anime name?)

i’m sick of self-pity, i’m sick of hating myself, i’m sick of feeling like everyone hates me, i’m sick of feeling invisible.",2022-12-29 12:24:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664012128,7,/r/lonely/comments/zy46iy/doomedf22/,,0,14,doomedF22

Some of them I've cried, some of them I've drank and cried, I at least expressed some kind of passion even if it was negative.  
The last several years I've just been feeling more and more detached from the world around me, like I'm starting to accept my lot in life and all I can do is grieve over the lost time and what could have been.

I wonder if I'm alone in this tradition, how many other people's eyes are going to be on their computers calander watching that 2022 in the corner change to 2023 with similar thoughts or feelings.",2022-12-29 13:17:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1447431626,2,/r/lonely/comments/zy5730/another_year_continuing_the_tradition_of_watching/,,0,1,Another year continuing the tradition of watching my computers' calander change at midnight

6595,zyfnrt,electrical_ocean,"it's crazy to think we're approaching three years since covid first locked the world down. now I won't say I was some sort of social butterfly pre-covid, but things definitely felt different and I was a bit more engaged with life, at least enough to feel content.

I had the misfortune of graduating university in 2020 (for further context, I was 28 at the time) right when covid hit. I had already spent two years away from home to finish my degree and felt detached from the few friendships I did have, but then I was faced with lockdowns once I moved back. I also lost a job offer I accepted earlier in the year that I was supposed to start once I graduated. I felt isolated and defeated, and struggled with anxiety and depression as a result. 

I did eventually find work, but I work from home which don't get me wrong, has its benefits, but also simultaneously enables my isolative (is that a word?) lifestyle. I've been feeling lonely and unfulfilled reflecting on the past few years, and I do worry about the future in regards to if and when I will feel better.

I guess it's not a bad opportunity to try and focus on taking care of myself first. I've done some good, like quitting nicotine a few months ago. I've been exercising daily recently, and I'm trying to make healthier diet choices. perhaps feeling better physically and building my confidence back up will help me get out of this hole.

6598,zyg2s4,Magnificent-howl,"i had a hard time sleeping last night. too much on my mind, i suppose. it's embarrassing even remembering what i was thinking about, though. yesterday, i was hanging out with some friends, and we were all sitting on the couch playing mario party or something. then, one of my friends started resting her feet up against my leg. she didn't say anything, and i didn't either. it just felt really nice being close to someone like that for a little bit. we stayed like that (plus some variations thereof) pretty much until she left. when i got home i realized i had fallen for her pretty hard, which i guess is to be expected when it's essentially the first instance of physical contact ive had in four years. but i really had no good way of determining if our interaction meant she felt similarly. see, the problem with being attracted to more or less everyone is that i have no idea if the intentions im ascribing to people in this regard are just projection or not.

similarly, another one of my friends called me cute while i was talking with him. my brain didn't even register what he had said until after i had already responded. the intentions of this seem pretty clear-cut, but there's more going on here that makes me think otherwise. first, it's entirely possible that he was saying it for the sake of my own self image, especially since i had been saying some pretty self-depracating stuff about my body that night. additionally, he's straight, and im a pre-transition trans woman, so i look more or less like a man. and lastly, something that applies to both of the scenarios ive detailed is bias in memory. my brain may have only recorded events that affirmed my own emotional desires in those moments. there could be extra context that i am missing, especially since the process of committing memories to long term storage takes place during sleep, and the feelings that these events gave me in isolation were all i could think about during that time. 

so yeah, i can't really draw any conclusions from any of these events, and directly asking someone if they're attracted to you is a great way to permanently alter how someone interacts with you, for better or worse. all i know is that being lightly touched in an inconspicuous place feels really nice, and id like to experience it again. however, there's really no consistent setup for that which doesn't require doing something really risky and directly stating my feelings as such. oh well.",2022-12-29 20:51:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1583374615,3,/r/lonely/comments/zyg2s4/not_really_sure_where_else_to_put_this/,,0,0,not really sure where else to put this

6627,zyk0ar,jzbd,"I don't like the people around me. It's not a ""them"" issue, I can respect them and they respect me, but I genuinely just don't consider them good company. This is the issue. It's easy to see that I'm liked by people, that I'm someone they don't hate, but me being there or not wouldn't really make much of a difference to the room.

To some extent, I know it's wrong for me to want their company when I don't even like being around them, but I also have no one else to be around if it's not them. There's no clubs or sports after school. I live in the suburbs, where the only way I can tell if my neighbors are alive is if they put up decorations for whatever generic holiday it is at the time. I know that getting a driving license might help to some extent because I'd ""have somewhere to go"" and ""more freedom"", but I'm still trying to figure out how to get the time to have my dad teach me. I'm not really sure what I'd do with a license, if I'm being honest. I hardly have a reason to leave the house beyond school. It's not like it was in the past, is what I mean. A lot of people like to think that I haven't tried, that I haven't gone out and tried to find people to talk to. I have. It's hard. While it's easy to catch people's attention, to be funny and interesting to them, the catch is that it's only for a moment. They're busy. We have nothing in common. We're just in the same place, and eventually we have to go. A momentary connection is all my conversations really add up to. Everyone wants to have a friend, to not be alone, but it's really just a matter of lowering your standards of what a ""friend"" is. I could easily say that I'm friends with my classmates, I'd just need to leave out the fact we can never hold a conversation outside of school. I could say that I have a family that cares about me, I'd just need to leave out the fact we only talk to each other if we need to.

6644,zym2rt,blackfireadversary,"Being a trans woman is hard enough as I literally feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time. But even in boy mode, and even before I knew I was trans, I've never been the kind of person that others would want to talk to, much less date. I try to be friendly and talk to people but I largely just get ignored or ghosted, even in person. I don't think I'm necessarily ugly, but there's something about me that makes people take one look at me and decide I'm not worth their time. 

I've been excluded from so much when I was part of friend groups, so those friend groups never lasted very long. They eventually got bored of me and dropped me completely. My friend that I've known for almost a decade stopped talking to me a few months ago and now he's moving to another state so I'll have absolutely no one to talk to. I've always been the outcast, no matter who I was with. Even in my own family. I was even given the nickname ""Black Sheep"" by my cousin, who always pretended to be my friend but never really acted like it, because even he knew that I didn't really belong anywhere.

I've tried therapy, meditation, finding hobbies that make me happy, finding others with similar interests, exercising and changing my diet. But no matter what I did, I just can't seem to hold anyone's attention for very long and I don't know why. Maybe I'm not hot enough, or funny enough, or extroverted enough. I admit I could be pretty annoying in middle and high school, but I've changed a lot as a young adult and it's still not enough for anyone. Even when I talk to someone with similar interests or hobbies, it's like they'd rather talk to anyone else but me. I didn't have my first real girlfriend until I was 23, and even she eventually decided I wasn't worth it. So why should I believe I am? Why should I keep trying only to be disappointed every time?

I was in a LDR for around 1 and a half years in 2017 - 2019 and have been single since. The relatinship itself was perfect at the start but devolved into a complete mess, she emotionally abused me, caused me to isolate from my friends and eventually ended with her essentially cheating on me with someone else while I was studying at university.The few weeks that followed were probably the hardest and loneliest weeks of my entire life.

Since then ive worked on bettering myself. Finished my degree, got a stable job, started going to the gym and mended relationships with old friends. Looking back on the past 3 years it seems that everything went right.

Every now and again I have dreams about my ex, reminiscing about all of the good times we had. And every time I wake up, i find that I am missing her and I'm feeling exactly the same as when we broke up almost 4 years ago. 

I am constantly trying to convince myself that I am fantasising about the relationship itself and not about her, but that does not seem to help at all.

This in addition to working from home and other family issues has caused me to constantly feel empty, like a part of me is missing.

I was looking forward to the time off over Christmas, but now i don't know what to do. I am surrounded by family and friends, but yet I've never felt more alone.

It's gotten to the point that I don't feel like doing anything after work and just want the day to end so I can sleep my loneliness away.  
To make things worse,  I have never been in a relationship with anyone and about to turn 30 next year. I try to be the kindest person in the world, as my mom told me to do, to see if that would win someone's heart. Unfortunately, I think me being overweight for a good portion of my teens and 20s probably did not help. Though, when I did lose that weight after college, there was no change.

To top it off, I am a gay guy and have lived in states and cities where being so is no help. There has been hope recently though. I started talking with someone at my company in a different city. I find it very easy chatting with him, and it has definitely turned flirtatious at times. We even want to meet up soon. My only hesitation is that he is definitely married and has a family. I always told myself that I would never be a homewrecker.

I wonder if he is in an open relationship/marriage. Not that anything is wrong with that, but I'm not sure if I want my first relationship (if it gets to that) to be quite that complicated.

Didn’t think much of it at first, then we started texting, to where it was texting everyday, and she would throw like hints, she was interested in me. It wasn’t until out of no where she started leaving me on read and lagging, to where I was uninterested and stopped talking to her. Didn’t talk to her for a week and she hits me up out of the blue, and of course, I respond because I missed her. Life feels good again she’s in my life because it was a hard decision to stop talking to her bc of how much I started liking her and didn’t want to waste my time. She comes into my life again, we FaceTime and we started to every day to the point where we would fall asleep with each other on call, then we hung out and kissed, which felt like a special moment, what we did multiple times when we saw each other. I told her my feelings about all of this, and she said that FaceTiming, texting everyday, kissing, hanging with each other, none of this meant anything, she just saw it as friends hanging out, but it was just a shocker, that she did not once say she had feelings for me, and then finding out she would do this to other guys, knowing there’s a pattern, she uses people for her needs and at the end of the day, she will only care for herself. It just bums me out, that she made me think, she actually liked me, just to blame me for not telling her I liked her earlier.

6702,zyrfu9,InfamousDuck234,"I think I am going to die lonely. I don’t know what t o do anymore. In high school I was obese and ugly, I’ve managed to lose over a hundred pounds and although I know I am in the best shape of my life, I have somehow lost the openness of the personality I once had. I’ve worked the same job every day for almost three years now, delivering pizzas for a local restaurant and I make good enough money for a 21 year old but at the cost of finding what I want to do with my life and someone to love. 

I have many interests and like to think I’m active. I go to the gym regularly, go out on my boat and hunt/fish, go out to bars with a good group of friends occasionally and spend a good amount of time doing things I like. The lists of my interests could go on forever but after all this I go home and I think. I think with thoughts so loud I notice any sound in my room is silent.

These thoughts are what I mentioned before, finding what I want to do with my life and honestly to me, more importantly, finding someone to love. I have used tinder and hinge and bumble and have grossed a good amount of matches across all three over the course of maybe 5 months, they have all led to the same thing. Nothing. 

I’ve lost over a hundred pounds and while people tell me I look great, I know it’s not enough, which somewhat is more motivation but it REALLY sucks to have put in a lot of work for so long in hopes of attracting anyone and not having not one stroke of luck. When I get a match and have even the tiniest conversation I imagine a whole life with that person. It’s weird and it’s problem and I know that. I’ve never had a girlfriend, so when I get any attention from a girl even on something as insignificant as a dating app I literally fantasize. 

What am I doing wrong? Just recently I asked a girl out and she said she was down. We had a day and time and she flaked last minute. This isn’t the first time with this particular person. And I’ve talked to my buddies about the situation and they tell me she’s not worth the time of day, which I can understand but they don’t understand what it’s like to not have had any type of romantic relationship ever. Truly it’s all I want. 

I’ve always thought money was more important than happiness. I was wrong. I hate feeling this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

The thing is, my crush is here. We kinda had something going on for a short while, even went out on a date, which was honestly amazing, everything was perfect. We had great time, kissed a couple times and she kept complimenting me and the date afterwards. But even if it all went well, she decided to end things there already. That got me really confused. Also, she told me to keep that a secret from my friends

I tried to move on, but she was still flirty as hell and i got even more confused. Might say it even gave me a little bit of hope.

But that all ends today, in the worst way possible. As i speak, i am alone laying in a small sofa, trying to get some rest, while she is sleeping with one of my friends in the room under me.

I never had a girlfriend before, never got laid, never been in love, like -actually- in love. Therapist and parents often say its because i dont really accept who i am. But this year i am trying my best to accept myself as i am, but i still get to end up like this, this year's finale seems to be just the cherry on top.

Oh and by the way, im the only single right here. So... gotta wonder what everyone else is doing right now as well

I am beyond tired of hearing that kind of talk. Sure, I absolutely don't condone what happened to black people in history; but still this ain't it either.

6722,zytj57,BeauBellamy21,"24m USA. So I have a boyfriend but I feel very alone. I'm more of an introvert and he's certainly an extrovert, a scorpio and self described 'life of the party' which as you can imagine makes us polar opposites.  Anyway, we have been fighting alot recently because I work weekends most of the time and holidays and I'm working NYE...

He's known I have to work NYE since mid or the end of November. I tried to compromise. I work third shift at a hotel, so we could still go to dinner... When discussing this, he rejected the nicer restaurants I wanted to go to anyway in favor of a trendy restaurant. I also then planned for him to come with me to work til at least midnight. Its third shift, I just sit there/here. I got champagne coupes, vintage silver ones and a nice bottle of Veuve champagne already. He's hyper focused on weight though and said ""Id rather just have tequila with water or sprite"". So theres that. He's just ungrateful and childish. 

Now... he wants to go out of town with his friends to a club on NYE leaving me completely alone. I get it but at the same time I don't. This is definitely not the right relationship for me. I think this was my last attempt at saving it but I think I just don't wanna be alone. I'm not a social butterfly. I struggle with friendships because I can't play the game. After having dinner invites or coffee invites rejected more than a couple times, I peace out because nobody is that busy. If people want to spend time with you they will... so I feel very low tonight  :(  

I'm very sentimental though. I do try to make him happy but its just not working. Furthermore, I met a ballet dancer 6 months ago and have been talking to him on the side. Mostly innocent, no real lines have been crossed. (I know its bad but I met them both around the same time) and yeah IDK what to do.

6731,zyu6i3,Masabeakwa,"So a bit about me. I’m a 32 year old man. I suffered with anger issues for a lot of years. I also came from a very toxic and dysfunctional household. I was also an underachiever. I don’t know why really. I don’t know if it was a big fuck you to everyone or what. I don’t really know. Anyway, my anger pushed a lot of people away. 

Anyway, even those I haven’t pushed away - even those I haven’t been unkind toward - no one reaches out to me.

Meaning a check in text. If there is conversation it is because I am doing the texting. No one has expressed any desire not to talk to me. A friend even apologized and said that I was right and they were being a bad friend.

It’s more I think I simply am not thought of 

It’s kinda weird.

 It’s like the universe as a whole has just sort of collectively written me off. 

I’m not saying this for comfort or out of some place of self pity. It’s just interesting",2022-12-30 07:21:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669271611,10,/r/lonely/comments/zyu6i3/no_one_reaches_out_to_me/,,0,5,No one reaches out to me

6733,zyub0a,Danial-Butternut,"I'm 29-year-old, ever since I was a child I always felt nobody actually wanted me. In my earlier years I used to tell myself it's just a feeling, it's all in my head. My father always told me whenever we had a fight that he had better children from his first marriage, that it didn't matter I was replaceable. Of course, he would apologize after he comes down and tells me it's not true but it made me that didn't matter. 
Later on in my life, even my partner didn't want to marry me he wanted to marry someone else to make his mom happy. He wanted to keep me on the side as his mistress, I refused and broke up with him. I felt guilty I still don't feel guilty, he had cancer we thought he was getting better but in the end he passed away. 
A few years later, I met somebody new I was vulnerable because I just lost my father. This guy used me, abused me and manipulated me. He apologized for all his wrongdoings, I forgave him because I have no one else my friends don't text unless I text them first, my family doesn't call me unless I call them first. This guy is the only one who calls me texts me and wants to meet me and even wants to live with me. He says that he loves me, but he doesn't want a relationship since we're ready to try twice and break up. 

I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm not the best. I wish I could learn how to love myself, how to be self-sufficient not needing love or care from anyone.

6765,zyyuez,Icy_Example,Running. In the cold of night. Alone. A light drizzle. Foggy dim street lights. A story of a child now young adult. Running. Looking for something. Running away from their youth and into a call of some void. A good they believe that beckons “Come” “Let me hold you”. A void that in youth is heard light much of any void… something to fall into. Some dark engulfing mass to give up into. Fall to your knees like you’ve been drained and defeated. The call feels warmer the more you hear it. Like it’s the most sensible way for things to end right now. Running feels more like an impatient jog. Stumbles. Even with stumbling the aging youth steps forward. Shambled. The youth is… no longer a youth. If they held a mirror to their face they’d see one that surprises even themselves at the passed time. It is their own yet embodies the scars and lines of someone they’ve never seen day-to-day. But yet they move forward. Begrudgingly. At the lost time. The lost love. The lost warmth. That void that has been beckoning calls louder. In the loneliness. It beckons “Come… lay your self down… let me hold you. One last time”. The aged youth finally stops. Stops moving. And let’s the void wrap it’s heavy dark mass around. It’s arms crossed against the chest. Succumbing to the void. It’s voice is familiar yet unknown. It’s distortions speak in tones and keys of friends… family… strangers… It’s grasp doesn’t feel quite like the end but something that is quite comforting. It’s words suggest impartial ness to the thoughts of its host. Values and beliefs of one’s own accomplishments and downfalls irrelevant. And yet it still offers whatever comfort anyone could seek. A stop. Falling into the void. As afraid as you were running those years away. It beckoned anyways. Despite your disdain for it’s offered comfort. The youth shied it away as though it meant admittance of weakness and failure. What is the void? But a grasp and engulfing of reality. As it settles in there’s nothing left to do but fight and keep running no? Shoving it’s warm and pleasant hands away. The touch of friends. Family. Kind strangers. To run. Step by step. Picking up pace once again. “Go. Move on until the end. As many times as it’ll take.” The voids call ages too behind. Slowing down. It’s warmth grows colder. It’s reach grows shorter. It’s strength frails. Until it is no more. It’s comfort that was once offered is no longer an option. The runner must now move on its own. Maybe it’ll meet another who moves just like them one day. Maybe they’ll have their own void of comfort with some space to share. But as it stands. Your own. My own. Void has perished. For better or worse. For maturity or frailty.

I have so many memories with her that the smallest things make me think about her, wishing she was still here. She even guessed my birthday ( Christmas is my birthday) when everyone said it wouldn’t, shocking my whole family. I know I was her favorite grand child the bond we had was just bonding since day one and it was very apparent. She passed away in the hospital after she had gotten sick. The doctors told us she was getting better but I believe she had a stroke in her sleep. 
This event was and still is very traumatic for me I wasn’t able to do anything for weeks, in context of this my mom got me a toy poddle, which I loved dearly and so did my mom. My mom is not a animal person meanwhile my dad is one. Around 6 months into having my dog, my parents were arguing over about keeping my dog because my mom is currently pregnant ( they used the lab method). I ended up having to give her away to a lady with no kids and a small house, even though I was really really hurt..

Final thing I guess, my parents have been arguing non stop since my mom has been pregnant. I don’t admit it in front them but, im already hurting but I am just good at masking it. It hurts to see them argue because they are good parents but lately it’s been a train wreck..

Back in October my then girlfriend tried to cheat on me with my best friend, and later revealed to me that she never liked me that much and had no physical attraction to me. That destroyed me, for about a month I had no self confidence and basically wanted to kms everyday, until last month, where I had met who I had then thought would be the girl I would marry. I thought she was perfect, I told her every one of my dark secrets and insecurities and instead of freaking out or leaving she tried to help me, we fell asleep on ft every night and we were in love. Then things started to change, she would constantly switch up and take her frustrations out on me, but I still loved her, and tried everything to help her. At one point she got violently high and kissed another guy, and that tore me back down again, but I forgave her, because I was so afraid of losing her. Things spiraled down from there, she became distant and hateful, which only furthered my anxiety and overthinking, I tried so hard to make things better but I couldn't. Around 2 weeks ago we broke up, and now something snapped inside of her and she revealed that she started cutting herself again because I supposedly ""moved on"" even though I'm still in love with her, since then she has fallen in love with some else already, and I feel hopeless. She was my structure, and now shes gone, no matter how hard I tried I wasn't good enough, and she hates me because of it. I feel worthless, my mental state is declining worse than ever before. I want to end it, but I don't want to hurt anyone else. It's hard without her, and it's the worst feeling I've ever felt to see her in love like I didn't mean anything to her. It's hard to drag myself out of bed atp, and harder to look in the mirror.

6795,zz2fxh,alakazam007,"The start of 2022 began with a fight with a friend. Some stupid ego issues from both sides and hot headed fools going at it. You lose respect for friends and other people

And them comes the pouring medical issues in the entire family. Every new week you are in the OPD of a new specialist. Sometimes its a neurologist sometimes cardiologist sometimes nephrologist. Its like i have started calling the hospital my second home. And there is no time for anyone to even think what i am going through with it. Damn even i, have no time to look after myself.

Sacrificing your entire future for your family. I’m not trying to sound selfish but don’t I deserve to live it by my own means as well. But then if not me, who will look after my own family. Everyone is battling their own issues and i am in the middle of it trying to solve all of these 

A 23 year old kid had to grow up real fast and assume the role to keep his entire family from falling apart. Breaking into two parts. Relations were already running on a thin thread and the frustration built up inside just came blurting out. Accusing each other, gaslighting, bringing past issues again and again, trying to portray self as a victim. I don’t know who to side with and i am left trying to salvage all the bad that they said to each other.

Is this the fate that I deserve? Have i been so bad? Or is past karma coming to bite me in this life? I keep on wondering every day. 

Then comes the danger word ‘cancer’. Shakes up my entire life. Everyone is heartbroken and who should I first tend to. By gods grace things are not as rough as it initially was but everybody is scared of this word. 

No time to think about what i want in life. More like anyway I’m not gonna be able to do that so why bother. Barely sleeping for 4 hrs. Insomnia and waking up in the middle of the night again and again because of bad dreams. Heck i cant even sleep peacefully. Tired throughout the day, no energy for self. Friends leaving me sll of a sudden. Having 1-2 people to talk to and that too not bothering them with my issues. 

Every night i cry myself to sleep. I hope my lil sister hasn’t seen me crying yet or she will just be heartbroken again. I can’t bother her with this grief. I have to be there for her… now more than ever. She is the sweetest soul and i wont think even for a second sacrificing my life to give it for her. I love you sis. I may never show it. I am emotionally so depressed I don’t know how to show you how much i care about you. 

No relationships or companionship to ease me through this pain and things are not looking any better with the start of this new year. Maybe this is my fate. Maybe i am never meant to live for myself. Its not that I don’t like it…. My family is my single source of happiness. I see them happy and i am content inside.",2022-12-30 14:55:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1556073533,2,/r/lonely/comments/zz2fxh/2022_was_the_worst_year_of_my_life_yet_or_things/,,0,0,2022 was the worst year of my life….. yet or things will improve in the future?

Has happened multiple times that people I talk with that are considering themselves lonely just randomly ignore me.. And it's not that we argued or that I said something wrong. It could be mid conversation about something. And if I'm “ boring “ tell me. Honestly, I would appreciate it more if someone says “ sorry but I don't feel like talking anymore “ than taking the easy way out and straight up ignoring a message. I'm both angry and depressed. 

And it's even worse when the same people that are ignoring you put up a post saying that they are lonely and have no one to talk to... And it doesn't help that my dating apps are going shit too. Fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To summarize, there are 3 places where people hang out: the house, the workplace, and the third place where people can gather for free or cheap i.e. buying the cheapest thing on the menu so you &amp; your friends can socialize without being accused of loitering. The third place can be a bar, park, cafe, or church. As people move away from religion, the church falls out of favor but that still leaves bars, parks, clubs, and cafes-- at least if you live in a big city. I live in a small rural town with the nearest bar or club being an hour away(it's a dry county so no booze).

6874,zzb6mm,Jkeyro,"I'm a student at a university, and I am in kind of a place where I feel like I have the potential to meet new friends who share my interests. But it just feels like everyone is so distant. And to the extent that I can hardly find one person that I can really be good friends with, or even relate to.

I can try to make friends. But every time I do, it feels like all we can talk about are things that don't tell me anything. As in, stuff that gets superficial, shallow. And this happens even with the people I've known for months. All we talk about is what they need from me or I need from them. Or, stuff that's just about class. To me, it's stuff that I hardly learn about someone from. I can't even say I know what we have in common, aside from being in these classes. I just want to find meaning with these people to truly call them friends. But to even get a little bit closer seems like such a foreign concept. Talking about something else makes for short conversations. And there's no such thing as hanging out outside of class, even when I try. 

But there's a difference between being there and feeling like you are truly belonging. And when I am with with these people, I just feel like I never can talk to them to find that sense of belonging. I just feel like I am ""there"" to get work done. I can never know who they are, and know that I can really be friends with them. It's almost ""two-dimensional"", ""flat"".  A feeling like saying a word without knowing its meaning. You can have friendship, but you don't feel it like you had it. And it just sucks to the point that you never really actively think it sucks anymore. And that's because you've experienced it so much, you're used to it. 

Maybe I'm just in a position where it's my problem. I don't have anyone to really affirm what I think is right anymore, so I can't say I know for sure. I've thought about that a lot. So much that these days I really just give up on trying with others, and focus more on trying with myself.

Will she come?

Is there hope for me

After all is said and done

Anything at any price

All of this for you

All the spoils of a wasted life

All of this for you

All the world has closed her eyes

Tired faith all worn and thin

For all we could have done

And all that could have been

Ocean pulls me close

And whispers in my ear

The destiny I've chose

All becoming clear

The currents have their say

The time is drawing near

Washes me away

Makes me disappear

And I descend from grace

In arms of undertow

I will take my place

6878,zzbimc,gonnagogetgold,"He treated him differently than others. He was always treated differently compared to others . Of course , he rationalized , no one would be treated the same, since everyone IS different . How could he objectively judge and generalize something that would be different and ever changing in every instant, every day , dependent on mood, on circumstances , on traits, on so many things. The behavior of people could not be generalized , every rational part of his brain told him. However it was the same brain that concluded that he was being treated different than others in many circumstances. 

""Why would she not talk to me the same way she does to others? Always so cheerful , so talkative , except in front of me. Why would he be so cold when it's just the two of us? He's not like that usually . Why does he tell him things he never told me? Things of importance I would have liked to know , but only just overheard accidentally as he was enthusiastically conversing with him in a way he would never converse with me. Maybe I did something wrong. Maybe I am, somehow ... wrong. My whole existence , my whole life.""

He knew that he had past experiences causing him to think and feel a certain way , or at least biasing him , making him doubt , pushing him to think like that. So how, then, could he judge it? Every time his brain did the judging part for him, he tried to eradicate the thoughts somehow. It didn't make sense. It could be anything really . Maybe some people just don't fit together. (Maybe I don't fit with most people). Maybe bad mood. Maybe , maybe .

There were too many variables , so he did not dare allow his judgement to consolidate. How could he? He thought of his ability to ""think"" highly at least. It was the only thing he liked about himself really. Even that disappeared from time to time, as he was simultaneously all the time convinced that something was wrong, and after carefully assessing that there was nothing really wrong , he concluded that it must be his mind , his very foundation , that was inherently corrupted. 

However he still liked to hold on to that conviction . It was his safe haven. There was absolutely nothing else giving him any confidence. He hated his body . He hated his age. He hated the time he lived in, in this miserable world doomed to collapse . He hated feeling this way. And finally , he hated himself.

""Why is my life worth living if there is nothing worth living my life for ? I look like an actual fucking monkey with hair all over my place , I've been exercising a lot but I still fucking hate my body, I can't interact with others properly without feeling like crap, I can't do things I actually want to do without feeling too lazy to do it and then feel bad about myself. Can I be happy for once , just happy? Not this ambivalent shit all the time. Its no wonder people treat me differently . They notice it somehow , maybe not consciously , but on a subconscious level surely. How could anyone like this fucked up piece of shit?""

He knew that he was in this strange self fulfilling cycle, at least he thought he knew , but he could still not be sure . Maybe it wasn't a cycle leading downwards, maybe it was just life. Maybe it's just this day. Maybe he ate something bad. He could not be sure. He could not act.

So he sat there near him and kept quiet. He had tried to initiate conversation once , maybe twice . Now, he was quiet. He didn't want to disturb him. Maybe he didn't want to talk? He didn't know what to say. Maybe that was the problem ? If he said the right thing the right way, would it flow ? He did not know . He could not be sure . So he kept quiet , as he feared that every other failed attempt at solving what he perceived as a problem would hurt him so much more.

So he kept quiet. This feeling , he knew it so well his whole life. Not being worth someones attention . Not being worth a discussion . Not being worth talked to. Not being worth smiled at.

Worthless. A subhuman

Hey Reddit, it has been 2 months since my life decided to fall apart. Had to leave my country, leave my job at the “highest point in my career”, and “the love of my life” suddenly decided that she doesn’t love me anymore and abandoned me for… I don’t even know what. Tried to bring her back, convince her that she is important to me and that i need her, ended up just f@cking everything up even more, beyond repair now. So. Two months, and numerous sleepless nights , nervous breakdowns and attempts to bring at least some part of my life back, I’m done. I give up on that. Time to start from scratch, several levels below the ground I actually stood on in January of this year. But I don’t know where to begin, since due to my profesional background I’ve become downright useless overseas and I am pretty much alone now that my ex is gone. It even possible to find inner peace anymore? Should I even bother? I want to make the world see that I am not a floor rag to be dragged around, but as of right now I think that I am just about the most pathetic human in existence. Any advice on how to build a life out of sheer spite and 1000 bucks would be very appreciated!

6890,zzdkfr,Icy_Artichoke7301,"Well, it's been almost a year since my ex decided to break up with me and I am still attached to him, our moments are still fresh in my mind. 

I yearn for him very often. I yearn to hear his voice again. I want to listen to him talk about his plans and dreams again. I would never get tired of  listening to him. I love his ideas and how ambitious he is. 

I have this constant ache in my chest. I would give anything in this world to relive our dates and cute, little moments. Nothing would bring me as much joy as going for a walk or coffee with the person that I love. Why do I always have to deal with the  absence of the people that I love so much? I don't understand. 

I miss hanging out together with our friends. Laughing and telling stories with the people closest to us. Oh, how I want to know what he has been up to. I want to know if he is alright. If his family is alright, for I care about them as much as I care about him. 

He made my life better: more tolerable, less mundane. Life is so much easier when you are surrounded by the people who love you and you love in return. 

I can't move on. Physical and emotional intimacy doesn't feel the same with other people. They are lacking. His kisses had warmth, his hugs made me feel safe. It's rare for me to feel safe and comfortable with someone. But he was that person for me. He is my person. 

Some days I am tempted to pick up the phone and text him, but the last thing I want is to become the creepy ex or the other woman, in case he has a new girlfriend. 

My brain knows that he is not coming back. No one ever comes back for me. Yet, something inside of me keeps on insisting that he will be back.

and wanted to copy it to possibly post somewhere else. and instead accidently pasted. a link. to a air bnb in cuba i was looking at. even though i cant go anytime soon. and idk, i wish i had friends or a best friend or a partner to go with. to just go somewhere for a month or couple months, maybe work a bit or just as a vacation. but i dont have anyone like that.

I'm a 26, never had a bf or ltr. sometimes i wish i had a partner to share life with. sometimes i daydream what it would be like to marry someone and then adopt a kid.

i have some anxiety and mental health issues sometimes, and its been so long since i did anything social. i moved to a new place last year, and the few friends i had are far away, and we werent that close.

one of those friends was a guy i knew for awhile. he was cool, fun to hang out with, and we'd cuddle sometimes. he really, really wanted a gf. i didnt want a bf at the time, it was like 5 years ago and i was figuring out how asexual i was i guess, and i wasnt super attracted to him/ready for a relationship, that sort of stuff. maybe i was waiting for some kind of magical love feeling. so once he found a gf i felt like i lost one of my only friends, since we stopped hanging out, and 5 years later, I was feeling more desperate and lonely i guess, and i wished i said yes to being his gf. He seems happy in his poly relationships though. 

once, while i was working, i chatted and laughed with a coworker, after so long of not hanging out with anyone. after our conversation, it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. i hadnt realized how not having friends was making a sort of near constant cloud of sadness around me, the sadness would vary in intensity, yet never be fully gone, so it was like i was almost always down in the dumps. 

I feel like i lost a lot of easy going and carefree states i used to have. i have less to look forward to.

6962,zzkygn,bunn246,"For living in a world of people it's pretty lonely....growing up I had a mother that was every form of abusive minus sexually and even then my older sister made up for that and physical abuse. I couldn't talk to my dad about it because my mom manipulated me into not, this was from the time I was 6 years old to 12. There was no one to talk to because in school that makes you the odd kid out. My brother wasn't close to me so I couldn't tell him and my little sister was too young. You keep to yourself and hope it goes away, I started drowning in this empty void. When I got to my teens I started to date and like boys but their desire for me went further than their will to get in my pants, the friendship with females was a meticulously thought out plan so they could stab me in the back later. I went through the motions and made friends but not close friends, I couldn't talk to them about anything that required trust, I started college and turned 18 and a peer took advantage of me, my boyfriend decided to cause problems as well,and my school made me leave and let the dude stay....all in one weekend I lost my boyfriend,  my school, my sorority, and my job. Made me feel so worthless ans lonely. After countless promises from my ex he got with the girl that is known for cheating not even a month after we broke up, I can not express how lonely and useless I felt fast forward to now, December 2022, the terrible year is finally almost over and I still have that gnawing feeling of loneliness....I can't talk to anyone I can't trust anyone. Everyone leaves or doesn't care and I'm trapped in this void of me, stuck in my head, helping others and not knowing how to talk of how I feel or need....guess I just needed to rant....night times are tough when I'm stuck in my own head",2022-12-31 04:09:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1670556174,4,/r/lonely/comments/zzkygn/feeling_lonely_is_the_emptiest_feeling_imaginable/,,0,3,feeling lonely is the emptiest feeling imaginable

I’m thankful and appreciative for the people in my life, but I’m at the center of this black hole that’s been following me my whole life. Every kind thing that’s been said to me, all of the support I’ve been given gets sucked up and is lost forever. Some days the black hole is a thin ring where some things get through, and other days it’s like an ocean and everything around is just noise, and all of that support I was given, disappears like it never existed. I have people who understand me so well, but I still feel so utterly and despairingly alone. It’s like I’m on this whole other planet that feels untouchable by most. There are some who make the journey to this planet where I stay alienated, and often times they get there and find that everything associated with me, isn’t all that great like they imagined. And those who stay, I feel so bad for. They don’t deserve this, they don’t deserve to feel this isolation. I know there’s so much I can do to make myself not feel like this, but in reality.. can I? I’ve tried to be the sociable, approachable, outgoing, fun, a positive person so many people love to be around, but they’re just temporary. Why put in that extra effort if I’m going to feel so painfully alone whether I’m happy or sad, I might as well be myself and not this fake thing so many people want me to be. I try so hard to be the things people want me to be, but it’s so hard to please everyone. I just want to be good enough. It’s exhausting to feel so alienated in so many different ways.

Why am I here if my entire life no matter how close I’ve gotten to people, no matter how long my partner and I have been together, why do I feel so alone.

I’ve had to cut out a toxic fiend, one of my closest friend’s no longer likes hanging out with me, other don’t text me back or call me back. Many of them just live too far away. On top of that my girlfriend and I are doing long distance. I’ve been working at my current job for 5 months and I’ve tried making friends with my coworkers. No one has shown an interest in trying to get to know me and when I try to make conversations or get to know them better it’s very surface level.

I don’t know what to do to combat the loneliness of feel or how to speak to about it. As when I do try to talk about these things I believe that they’re so heavy that most people wouldn’t understand or that I would just be bothering them. 

It’s like I constantly crave some sort of connection or company. I don’t know how to describe it but when a person is near they filll the space which I feel on the inside of me. When no one is there and I’m left my thoughts, let’s just say that social media is your only thing I can really use to keep my mind from going to a really dark place.

My mental state is at an atl and I feel like utter shit

I’m f25 and have no close friends, or family, or partner.
I struggle so much with not only making friends but keeping them consistent. It seems like people have their inner circles already. The lack of connection makes me very susceptible to FOMO. Like friendship is this unicorn I’m chasing now. I almost overthink every interaction hoping it might turn into a real friendship. 

My family aren’t very present, and there’s a lot of trauma and baggage surrounding that.
I spent Christmas alone.

I’m not inherently unlikable. I make people laugh, I am very upfront and transparent. I’m kind, I think.
I’m neurodivergent so sometimes I’m a bit intense and too direct, but I think it might be humorous for others.

Everyone is so incredibly busy, and in different places in life. Some people are prioritizing partying, others, their partner/relationship. It’s very hard to find people that are on the same page as me. I spend a lot of time alone. I’m sober so I don’t go out often.

Note: I'm not talking about asking random strangers I don't know to meet up, I'm asking the so-called friends that I have chatted with for quite a while and we already know each other a bit.

Yes, I know they came here to have their celebrations and meet up with friends. I don't want to disturb or spoil their celebratory mood, but I did tell them maybe next time, we could meet up again, and they just answered: I'm not sure if we could, or they are busy so they couldn't meet me. Yet I saw many times that they hang out with their friends. Or even if they said we will meet up some time, they would end up meeting others instead. So much for their priorities???   

On top of that, they had the balls to ask me why I don't go out with my friends or tell me I should go out with my friends instead. They don't even bother to set up another date or time that they are free to meet, as obviously, they would rather meet their existing friends than a new one.    

Like, hello, you immediately assume that the other person has friends, so you can just disregard him/her when it comes to meeting new people? Then why are you in the friends/dating apps in the first place? Sure, you have friends, but you aren't interested in meeting new ones or getting that person along with your circle? I really wish I have never met you, man.     

I have been through so many encounters when even though they have friends to hang out with, they would invite me to join them (which many times, I did). But outright asking me to hang out with ""my"" friends when I am kinda lonely at times? That doesn't sound right at all.    

More people need to realize that even though people may have friends at times, they can be pretty lonely and in need of another person, which includes making new friends. It never hurts to tell that person (if they are not free at that time) that they are not available, but we can arrange for another certain date and time to meet again.   

I don't know if it's just me, but the way we communicate does affect or may exacerbate the loneliness of the other side further. We never know what's going thru for that person, we can't just make the assumption that they have close friends. It doesn't hurt if we put some gesture to them that we care, even just a bit.

My sister is a few years younger than I am (she's in high school and I'm basically a senior in college), and she has a girlfriend. It's so embarrassing to think about, and it almost makes me upset sometimes.

I love my sister and I genuinely try to be happy for her because we've been through a lot together and she's family, but it's too much sometimes. She'll tell me all about her gf, how great she is, and the thing that hits me the hardest is when they tell each other they love each other. Of course I am proud of her for being able to find happiness within herself and being able to find someone who can love her and be there for her, but I still have my own personal feelings and I can't help it but to get a little jealous at her success.

7011,zzp0i8,nodistanceleftorun,"I'm 21. I normally don't brag about my appearance, it's an annoying thing to do, but I've been put on a pedestal since I was young because of my appearance. When I was a child, I was the guys' crush at school and all the adults would compliment me. When I was in high school, I was popular because of my appearance. I receive a lot of stares in public places as well.

I'm not picky, I don't think I deserve the best of the best, I actually have a pretty high sex drive and I've had a decent amount of partners. What I'm tired of is how literally all men pretend to give a damn about me only to start treating me like an object once they get what they want. This is just the most recent example, but this is something that has already happened dozens of times: I made friends with this guy in January. He seemed to be a good guy, he would even say ''thanks for your friendship, I was going through a hard time in my life, your presence makes me feel better''

After couple of months later he stopped being a friend and he would literally only call me when he was horny and then started calling me a cum dump. I ain't even joking.

I'm not begging for attention like ''oH gUys BeInG pReTtY is HaRd'' 

I'm happy guys wanna fuck me, what I'm not happy with is that they never seem to care about me as a person and since a lot of women complain about just being used, I think it's fair to say a lot of men are like this.

Anyways, yesterday I spent my whole day out with our toddler, buying him gifts. We came home and because I was working all day for the past 3 days, I had to clean and organize the house. By the time I finished with everything my toddler created a mess on the floor from disassembling a game, I was so tired and I had to make her sleep, so I put everything on top of a table and took her to the room. I fell asleep also, and today I got up and did some more chores but completely forgot about this game pieces that were left on the table. When he woke up he got extremely pissed and and I think he just dumped me over that. I’ve asked him to come home for New Year’s Eve and he just left for work mocking me, so I doubt he’ll be back on time.

 We have problems with me forgetting stuff, because of my ADHD, but I feel like he could be more understanding, considering I do 90% of all chores and take care of our kid 80% of the time.

My husband and I have been together now for 20 years. I'm sentimental, so when a special day comes along,  a card will do it for me. I don't ask for much from him other than to keep a job.  

He spends most of his time,  outside of sleep and work,  online.  I encourage him to have friends. It's healthy.  I don't depend on him for my own happiness.  I just want to feel special sometimes.  

I was sitting outside on our porch, and his IPad was on the table in front of me.  He was standing right next to me, and I saw a post that I assumed was his,  along for ideas on what to draw their wife for her birthday.  My birthday was a week away, so I assumed it was about him wanting to draw something special for me.  My birthday came and went. My mom had to remind him to get me something,  some water color pens and paper.  It was nice.  
He has a habit of forgetting our anniversary,  my birthday,  Christmas.  I'll present him with lavish dinners and hifts, and he comes empty handed. I think everyone enjoys being celebrated. 
Anyhow,  Christmas rolls by, and he didn't get me anything.  Actually,  our kids, my mom, and him opened gifts while I took photos.
Then I go into my insta and see a drawing he made Christmas Eve for an artmoot, ""Happy Birthday,  (insert name)"" that burned.  I feel very neglected in this relationship.  It's strange to be so lonely in a marriage,  but not uncommon.

I am currently travelling alone, mostly walking in the national parks etc. I have had a lot of time thinking about my issues. I definitely feel as lonely as ever, but i am also grossed out by idea of a relationship. I have had relationships with 2 women in life of 30 years and I would say I wouldn’t really want any of them back. I kinda like sex but other parts of relationships never really worked for me. Always felt like either me or them are scamming each other for sex. I am really repulsed by idea of dating anymore, my motivation is at all time low. Earlier i used to think I am ugly or I am not great with women, but when I think back I was okay, may be not the best, but still I have been brave putting me in those situations(I have AvPD). Most of the time I put all my energy in asking out someone and they just straight reject me and its painful. I can understand women dont like me and I am figuring out I need to enjoy my life without them. I am not compatible with anyone I know and I am just hurting myself by trying too much. I am gonna chill out in 2023 and just enjoy food or reading.

But over the pass few months I cut out multiple people from my life who were toxic and now don’t have anyone to hang out with. I wasn’t able to make any good friendships at my uni cuz people were just so pretentious and weird. And now after graduation I literally have no one to hang out. I try keeping myself busy with work so that I don’t think about this but holidays become worse as I have nothing to keep myself distracted with. The fact that my family is in a different country aggravates the situation further 

It’s weird how easy it is for me to have conversations with anyone yet I have no good friends or just friends for that matter. People who meet me for the first time always have this impression of me that I’ll have a huge group of friends but it’s the contrary. It’s such an irritating feeling and makes me depressed. And as new year starts, seeing those insta stories and people hanging out with each other, families and people just having fun saddens me as I wish I could have that.

7141,1000cmb,littlepino34,"I just want some advice from people who have had similar circumstances.

I am 31 years old. I've never had a girlfriend. I am an introvert. When I was younger I was incredibly shy would barely speak unless it's with a few friends and it was never about deep feeling or anything like that.  In my teens and  20's I was incredibly depressed. I resorted to eating unhealthy and gained a lot of weight and distanced myself from any social life.

However, I managed to turn it around somewhat in the late 20's. I went to law school became a lawyer and have good well paying job. I have also become less shy and have a few friends. I also changed my food habits a bit and worked hard at the gym and now I would be characterised as fit. 

However I have no confidence to approach women romantically in real life. I have started going on dates thorough online dating but they usually end after a few. They always say that they don't feel a romantic connection. It was especially hard since I went on four dates with this awesome girl who is everything I want in a life partner. We had a fun time but I could never get myself to express how attracted I am to her or how pretty she is and she ended it after. It's been a month since then and I cannot get over her and I have regrets not being more open. 

It's also incredibly hard to date in Toronto like everyone says. I want to meet people in real life and not sure how to do it.

The break up was finally in December, due to their badmouthing I lost several closer acquaintances (who I thought were friends!), but also gained one new close friend, whom I couldn't be more thankful for.

I'm not trying to force myself on anyone or something like that.

7232,10062dd,AssCrackBandit12,"So for some context;

I've been dealing with things like self esteem issues, where i can sometimes feel like i'm a boring person and feel like i'm not important and people will eventually leave me. Sometimes i'll get anxiety attacks even thinking about previous events in my life. So i can sometimes self-sabotage things.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling increasingly lonely at the start of 2021, but then i met a little group of people gaming online. For the first time in a while i felt comfortable being myself and showing my vulnerability to others. This was a little group of around 7 people, and it was great for a few months, and afterwards i started developing feelings for one of the girls in the group.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't intend on that ofc, so i tried to kept it for myself for some time because i didn't want to ruin anything until others started noticing and i had to admit it to somebody. I knew things might not work anyway between us since she was dealing with a lot of things mentally which i won't go into. Things were going well anyway between everyone, until there was some big drama stuff and there was a rift in the group, we had to take sides especially the girl i really liked because she was hurt.  Afterwards there were 5 people in the group, and even tho i got closer to the girl that i really liked, others in the group started to appear less often, and eventually just leaving. In the end there was just 3, me, the girl i had feelings for, and another girl which was like a little sister to me. I considered them my best friends, and i got closer to them and i was able to talk about really personal things that i never told anyone. The 3 of us were close and we all played and talked everyday for hours and hours, it went on for months and everything was great, even if the group was only the 3 of us now. But then i ruined everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I started overthinking stuff, getting worried everytime i felt there was something different especially with the person i really liked. So whenever maybe she wasn't available or busy i kept overthinking to the point that my mind started to convince myself that she was gonna leave anyway and that she doesn't like me now, or that she finds me too boring and prefers to interact with others now. So i kept pushing things inside until one day being in a terrible headspace i stupidly ''confronted'' her about things, and started to accuse her of things she never did. I instantly regretted it, especially since shes already dealing with a lot mentally, and was in middle of exams being stressed all day. It was too much, the way i confronted her about it was too much. We both talked about it more after a long break and it was best to move on from each other, this wasn't the first time it happened, she always tried to console me but this time was too much and i understood.

&amp;#x200B;

My other friend learned about what happen and was upset at me for what i did, she knew i basically ruined everything and it wouldn't go back to normal. I tried to salvage this, but i knew its problably the end for us. I was unfriended everywhere afterwards and blocked because it was too much for them, i understand it, i'm not upset they did this. I'm trying to move on now, i worked on myself a bit because i dont want to repeat anything like this in the future. Its still hurts, i still get anxiety thinking about it everyday, and i lost the will a bit to continue playing games because of it but yeah i really just needed to get this out and just write about it here ig, even if i don't really know what to do now especially being alone in another country away from family. Thanks for reading and i hope everyone have a nice 2023!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : I lost my only 2 friends, someone i loved and somebody else which was like a sister to me because I self sabotaged everything for no reason while things were going great anyway.",2022-12-31 23:04:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1672523991,2,/r/lonely/comments/10062dd/ruined_everything_by_overthinking_now_i_lost_my_2/,,0,2,"Ruined everything by overthinking, now i lost my 2 online best friends.

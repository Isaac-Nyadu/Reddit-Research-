4,shh0gw,_erazore_,"I just love how there's so much art and media, movies and shows and whatever else, where the whole moral is basically ""being all alone is not good"" and ""you'll find your happiness once you find fulfilling relationships in your life"". Like just how much fiction aimed is there out there, specially aimed at teens and young adults, where there is a character who is the stereotypical weird outcast loser with no friends who then goes through some sort of magical experience along some of their peers who also have their own struggles and then by the end it they have all helped each other and now all have a deep connection and have a life and are happy?

I just think it's funny and ironic because the fake-positivity bullshit advice that people usually give regarding loneliness is the usual 'oh you have to be able to be happy and satisfied by yourself first before finding happiness in others!!!', or even more so in the romantic context, the classic 'how do you expect to love someone else when you don't love yourself?' or whatever, which I find to be completely invalidating, but just the fact that there is so much media out there like that validates me in itself, it makes me think that it's only natural for me to be sad over how completely alone I am and that, you know, NOT being alone would most likely be better and healthier lol, just because all of those artists and authors and writers decided to send that message so there must be some truth to it

9,shhhaf,fischl48,"The last time I felt this lonely was years ago and I forgot how much it sucked. I always had friends for the most part, I still do but I feel so alone. I had a friend group that fell apart because I got into a fight with two people from the group. I don‚Äôt regret it though, I don‚Äôt like them as people. My best friend is in college in another country, and my other two friends are in another class together so I basically see them like once in three weeks. Because of the fight I mentioned, I no longer have friends in my own class as I fought with one of them and the other friend took their side despite not being involved. I feel like they all know I‚Äôm lonely because I noticed they are unusually nice to me, like they‚Äôre pitying me. They know they‚Äôre shit friends so they‚Äôre trying to compensate. My online friend ghosted me so I haven‚Äôt been talking to her either. My other online friend I still talk to, but he has a gf now and we have a history so I feel like this friendship too is not going to last, even though he was one of the few people I genuinely trusted. I had to quit what I loved the most because of the fight as well so that sucks. I‚Äôm also finishing high school soon so the stress of final exams and college admissions is starting to kick in. I feel like I ignored my emotions for a while but now it‚Äôs all flooding out.. My only consolation is that in a few months time I‚Äôm going to hopefully be in college in another country, starting from zero. Otherwise I don‚Äôt know how I would cope..

24,shkert,Infinite-Dependent11,"
i had an online relationship which lasted just over a year, he recently blocked me and I have no idea why. Things weren‚Äôt too good over the past couple of months between us but he promised me he‚Äôd never do that to me. I‚Äôve become completely obsessed with him, I‚Äôm constantly fantasising about having a life with him and think about him every night before I sleep. I think the lack of male attention through all my life makes me become too easily attached to people- especially men. Him blocking me has put me in a constant state of sadness and loneliness. I see my friends having relationships with guys and it makes me feel so alone. I can‚Äôt help but think he‚Äôs found another girl which makes me extremely jealous. Idk I just want to kinda vent on here because I have no one to talk to about this.

64,shrek0,iTaco_Ninja,"I enjoy the silence at times, I‚Äôve spent so much time alone. Being a gamer has lead to so many nights of darkened rooms with screens and finding ways to entertain myself when my friends would go to sleep. 

I am pretty content spending time with myself most nights. I don‚Äôt really date, in fact I barely try with woman any more. I‚Äôll try to make a long story short I dated someone since high school on and off for years, she was the love of my life. I mean it; not just like how most people use those words. Claiming they‚Äôre in love, not understanding what that even really means to love another person completely: she was everything to me. 

One day she gave up on us; at the time I was so angry, thinking this was just another time we‚Äôd reconcile and find each other again like our love story had gone up to that moment. I knew better in the back of my mind and it sunk in so quickly; how I‚Äôd never speak to my best friend in the whole world again. The person who knew me best and had been through a journey with me. I‚Äôll never forget how I just laid there sobbing silently so my mother wouldn‚Äôt know how completely devastated I was. After that moment life felt so empty and pointless, I don‚Äôt have the words to describe to you what it‚Äôs like to live in a world without someone you can‚Äôt imagine a life without. I fell into a depression that took years to cope with, eventually I recognized we weren‚Äôt good together and found some solace in that. 

Back to the point: The thought of giving someone that much power again isn‚Äôt even my main thing. I just genuinely feel like I won‚Äôt love someone else like that. How could I? So I don‚Äôt. 

I have a friends, for a lot of reasons for each one though I still end up alone. Especially recently, I became good friends with someone the last few years who lives out of state and he ended up getting a new girl and a new job. Setting aside he‚Äôs a dad; adding the fact he over compensates time with his girl. The thing that irritates me is I know they‚Äôre wrong for each other and don‚Äôt see it yet because neither have been happy with someone else before. I keep my mouth shut because it‚Äôs not my place. 

Admittedly maybe I‚Äôm just jealous he has a lot going for him and I don‚Äôt; I also don‚Äôt think my assessment is wrong. I‚Äôm often right about these things. Clearly I‚Äôm just frustrated and I don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to so I‚Äôm just sitting here in my tub writing this on my phone hoping someone is listening. 

Tl;dr I‚Äôm lonely sometimes. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to these days I feel like. I just wish I had a homie to game with and chill. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do about it and I hate platitudes. That wasn‚Äôt in there, it‚Äôs just true.",2022-02-01 10:00:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1420172447,2,/r/lonely/comments/shrek0/sometimes/,,0,0,Sometimes

Anytime I try to do something good or be a bit more personal, it ends up getting lost or thrown away or trampled on. I got somebody a present recently. Something I put thought into and was excited to share with somebody else. It got lost very soon after I gave it away. I can't help but feel like this just reflects my place in the world.

It's hard for me to find true connection with another human being. And it's even harder for me to reveal myself to that person when they come along.

I am 22 years old and have never had a girlfriend. It is mostly my own fault because i havent been very social and i am a bit shy but i think that my disease contributed to it too. Because of it i was home schooled from the 3rd grade up, i also have not gone to kindergarden when i was little. Most of this time i spent at home with not really any friends or interactions because my mother would not let me for she was afraid i was gonna get sick. So when i started college i thought that was gonna change but at first i was a bit shy and then covid hit. I have really only tried to be romantic with one girl but that turned out to be a very bad situation for me where we tried being friends and i was just always feeling bad, this lasted for about 3 years(mostly during the summer), while i was in love with her (or i at least thought i was) i did try to talk to other girls( not that actively) when we were separated because i knew nothing was gonna happen between us and i wanted to meet someone i could feel good with. So i decided to stop my bullshit this november and really started trying to go out with girls i went out with 6 of them, which i realize isnt a whole lot but i am pretty occupied with my studies and taking care of my health.I never got a second date despite me thinking that we had a nice time, some blocked me after the date (which i really do not get because i wasnt being a pervert or anything), some just said they are sorry but they dont want a second date and the most recent one which is why i am writing this said we can go out but not as a date.

But i learned an important thing during that time: Its ok to be alone. It really is. I went solo traveling for the first time, got myself sometimes dinner in a restaurant and went even to some bars alone. And yes, i was feeling so uncomfortable sometimes doing that, and not always i went happy back home. I got depressed trough that way and sometimes still am. But other times i loved it beeing alone.

Went out with a connection group and couldn't continue due to personal reasons. Met old friends and none of them seemed interested in talking to me for more than a week since they got their own things to do.

Only few people I can talk to is 1 girl I have been talking to online for a while, a buddy on Reddit and random Instagram story replies.

It feels like some sort of sick cycle, reach out, be happy that someone said they are happy to talk, hope fizzes out after a week when they give late or no replies, sink into a state of loneliness, repeat.

A class full of toxic people, a club with decent people that I meet only once a week for 2 months, a school so big that classes don't mix, old friends all got new friends and don't need me, best friends went over seas or different schools.

¬†

Why is it that every time I thought they genuinely cared about me or had my back, it turned out that I was just a distraction and didn't mean all that much in the end?

I won't lie, I've developed abandonment issues because of this and other things in my past. I'm just terrified of even investing in people or opening up anymore because it hurts to be vulnerable just to find out it didn't matter at all. 

¬†

It just happened recently again, except this time I wasn't looking for people to meet. We just happened to find each other in a survival game and got along. Long story short, it was a one-sided dance... again.

I don't know how to accurately describe the feeling, but it feels like I'm so tired of being tired of being tired that I'm no longer tired and the silence is so loud. 

¬†

I just want to meet one genuine person. Why is that so damn difficult?

Didn't figure that out till a few years later. Like it was meant to be, but now she is gone and I'm left trying to continue but I feel I'm just existing and going through the motions.

193,sigysh,LuxCopperfox,"It‚Äôs my 32nd birthday today.
I‚Äôve made a lot of huge life changes this last year so I don‚Äôt have the same friends. I hardly have any friends at all. That‚Äôs a a good thing though in caparison, but in the meantime, I‚Äôm pretty lonely. Everything is better than it was but I‚Äôm in the transition and that‚Äôs rough. There has been a lot of unexpected shitty things too that have made it more difficult than it needs to be. Just a bad hand I suppose. But as for today,  it‚Äôs my birthday and no one had noticed. My significant other, or whatever he is, knows but he doesn‚Äôt care so that stings.
I‚Äôve done a lot of tough work and I want to feel like it‚Äôs for something - Today would have been a nice day to feel special.

197,sihic9,throwaway0183701,"Idrk why, just am. I mean, Pok√©mon legends: Arceus came out, I should not be this sad. But I‚Äôm just fucking overwhelmed by it. All I feel is a fucking whole in my soul, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not even a real person. I just want *one* person to know me and still love me, and to let me know them. And it sounds petty, but I‚Äôd also love to have *one* person who I can show my sexual side to and not feel hideous and disgusting for it. In a nutshell, I just want one truly intimate relationship, mentally and physically.

But I guess I‚Äôm not good enough for that. I never was. I did try when I was younger, I tried befriending girls and seeing if it could go anywhere. It never did. I just wasn‚Äôt good enough. And I‚Äôm still not, cuz I never grew out of that. I‚Äôm 22 now, and all my peers have so much more experience. I‚Äôm stunted, I don‚Äôt know anything, I could never even master simple stuff like expressing interest without being creepy.

Idk dude. It‚Äôs just... there‚Äôs only so many you nights you can fall asleep with your beloved Squishmallow in your arms trying desperately to fantasize about a life you‚Äôll never have so that you don‚Äôt have to be forced to think about the bleak future you‚Äôll have in reality. It gets to me. My imagination is having a hard time producing delusions strong enough to keep me satiated anymore, and those dark thoughts come creeping in every night. They‚Äôre seeping into the day too again.

It‚Äôs not fuckin fair, dude. There‚Äôs so much I could‚Äôve done if I wasn‚Äôt made lazy by this. I want to be a mathematician and a Japanese translator and a philosopher and a chemist and physicist. I could‚Äôve at least been a double major at a really good school, but I can barely even handle one major at a community college because of this fucking loneliness. Every time I try to really apply myself, the counterpart in my head interrogates me with questions like ‚ÄúWhy try? No one cares if you do. No one depends on you, no one even benefits from your success. You can‚Äôt share your joy, you can‚Äôt find solace in a warm hug. Why try?‚Äù . It‚Äôs a damn good thing I‚Äôm just naturally good at school, cuz if I wasn‚Äôt there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd still be in college. I‚Äôd be at a dead end factory job or something, giving me even more evidence that I‚Äôm worthless and even more idle time to dwell on it.

I really don‚Äôt think consciousness is worth it. I get to feel myself being alive for what, 100 years if I‚Äôm ‚Äúlucky‚Äù , but all it is is pain and tantalizing. Even if I wasn‚Äôt depressed and suicidally lonely, no way I could do everything I want to. I wanna learn so much, but I could never. I guess that‚Äôs why just having one relationship seems so good. You can‚Äôt do everything, but I know that over one lifetime you can at least have a perfect relationship. It‚Äôs a realistic goal, and it just so happens to be backed up by the strongest of our biological urges. It‚Äôs a perfect candidate for one‚Äôs reason for living, and it‚Äôs what is mine (at least emotionally, in a way I can‚Äôt change) . But I‚Äôll never see it done, because I suppose I‚Äôm just ugly and unlovable, inside and out. I‚Äôm at best a fixer upper, which definitionally means I‚Äôm never gonna be the best choice. There is no criterion by which I can be judged to be the best option for any potential partner.

Ok, I‚Äôm done now. I guess, having written that out, I‚Äôll try to sleep. Maybe the delusions will be stronger since I‚Äôm 2hrs20min past my bedtime",2022-02-02 06:21:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606960124,5,/r/lonely/comments/sihic9/really_feeling_it/,,0,1,Really feeling it

203,siiwbk,Inevitable-Roll-5030,"I had a dream where I met this girl that actually cared about me. Someone who loved me. We would talk and I felt that she was the one I could trust. I never remember loving someone as much as her. I could tell she really loved me. Then I woke up. I remember feeling like I lost someone even though She was never real.

Now I go back to my life where I'm told I'm attractive but I never have any girls chase me. I have people say we should hang out sometime but never get the text. I try to get some people to hang out with but never am invited anywhere. I wish I could have someone I could trust, or that I could actually talk to girls. Things aren't really that bad, but I feel stuck, like when I try to move forward I ended up going 10 feet backwards. Then when I don't move I end up getting yelled at by others to get moving with my life.

My high school life sucked. I was always so short and had a terrible time getting friends and the friends I had never really invited me anywhere. I felt alone a lot. I met a few girls but I was terrible at talking to them and they always left. Now that I just finished high school I don't know what to do. I get to watch my brothers go through high school where they are the same size as me right now after I finally grew, they have so many friends to hang out with and girls chasing them. I can't help but feel like crap. They are only in sophomore and they have had more friends and a better experience then I did with my whole high school experience.

I know that life will move on and I will get to college or something eventually but I really need to vent out these feelings. Maybe I will feel better or get moving soon. Hopefully.

205,sijldm,Standard_Glove_2528,"I almost didn‚Äôt post this but I know I need to get this off my chest and vent. I‚Äôm (19M) and right around this time of the year is when I feel the loneliest, partly because of Valentines but mostly because I hit my lowest point in life two years ago in my senior year of high school. 
The county fair happens every year during February and two years ago my cousin (3 months younger) and my little brother wanted to go but weren‚Äôt allowed to go unless I went for whatever reason. We get there and I let my brother go with his friends but to let me know if anything happens. I go with my cousin and he wants to go with his girlfriend and her friends, we meet up at a ride where you need a partner and I don‚Äôt have one but I‚Äôm too far up front to turn back. I see my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù at the time, further back in the line and text them to come be my partner but no one came and I walked back out of the line and just kept on walking. I spent the rest of the night walking by myself, got on a couple of rides alone, and avoided making contact with anyone else I knew. If I did see someone I just made some bs excuse like I was going to the restroom. At the end of the night while waiting to meet up with my brother and leave, I see my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù again, but they just walked right past me like I never existed. When I met them for lunch the next day it was as if none of that even happened but I was dying inside. Ever since I graduated I have heard a peep from any of them nor do I really want to. 
Still this month always reminds me that I‚Äôve gone another year without making a friend. I‚Äôve at least improved myself from past years. Dropped from 200lbs (my max weight) to 156lbs, my lowest since junior year. I also got braces on October that are helping me get rid of my gap and crooked teeth that are a major insecurity of mine and the main reason I have social anxiety and can‚Äôt have a proper conversation. Still I have no friends I can talk to about any of this with.

253,sitm1d,tiredpuri,"I‚Äôm a 3rd year student and I‚Äôve been lonely all my life. Most of my middle/high school experience can be summarized in one word: bullying. Mid 2019 I moved to the other side of the country to start a ‚Äúnew life‚Äù and IT WORKED. I started to gain confidence in myself, meet new people‚Ä¶until COVID started. I only had one semester offline during my cursus and then: lockdown, curfew etc. All my courses were online. I had a burdensome schedule and only studied+part time job for 1 year and a half.

Then I applied for a university exchange in Korea and I‚Äôve been accepted. So in last summer I moved in Seoul but I was announced that all the classes would be held online, and that the clubs activities would be cancelled too. So in all my degree I only had one semester offline (yikes)

I‚Äôve never felt that lonely since a long time. I want to cry because it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve laugh after chatting with friends in real life, going to nice places together, spending time with SOMEONE. I see so many beautiful landscapes, experience cool stuff‚Ä¶alone. It‚Äôs depressing. I literally want to cry myself to sleep because I SHOULD be happy but I‚Äôm not because i have no one to talk to. No one to go out with. I feel like I learnt foreign languages for nothing (English/Korean are not my first language btw) because I can‚Äôt even TALK to people. 

I talked about it to my sister tonight over the phone, she told me I shouldn‚Äôt complain because I have the chance to go to uni abroad (I‚Äôm a scholarship student) and that I focus too much on the negative stuff‚Ä¶idk, I‚Äôm sad and just wanted to vent because I‚Äôm EXHAUSTED.

257,siui77,lazyBert,"I've been feeling depressed for several years- I'm afraid didn't want to admit it but realized certain recurring negative thoughts I had weren't exactly healthy. At 24, I've been trying to make up for lost time since middle school, specifically my nonexistent social life back then and now. I've been trying to reinvent myself with a fresh start in June 2021, to force myself out of my comfort zone. I've had some progress since then with new things for me- going on my first date, getting in shape, eating healthier, starting jiujitsu, etc.

I moved to my own place near the city in June to try and meet new people and make friends (I'm naturally very introverted partly due to moving schools internationally a few times growing up and I lost touch with people that I had met, aside from a hundred or so I'm linked with on instagram). I work full-time but remotely, so that doesn't really help, but I've been taking small steps- reaching out to a few people I was linked to back in school, even though it had been a while. One person from my middle school even msg'd me saying she was moving to my area and would like to hang so I feel very fortunate for that as well.

I started my master's in comp sci in fall part time online (optimization, in particular) and I feel lost and I'm just questioning why I'm doing this in the first place, and what my priorities in life are at the moment, and it's definitely not my career or this. CS is just a stable job for me and I'm honestly not as passionate as some coworkers. Rather, my priority is relationships right now. I've never had a girlfriend and it's only recently I've gathered more confidence and self-appreciation to talk/connect with people (even if it's on dating apps) and even ask some of them out when I get the chance and risk rejection. 

I asked this girl out (who is out of my league) and surprisingly she seemed down to hang out possibly end of this week. To make matters somewhat worse in addition to my procrastinating and worrying about not failing this graduate class, I got an acne breakout the past weekend- just in time I guess :(. After only 3 dates, I've still learned to try and set my expectations low for dates and brace for rejection and to move on al though it's obviously hard.

I know I'm very lucky to have a relatively stable financial/employment status and I mistakenly take it for granted sometimes to be honest. But more often than not, money doesn't fulfill/satisfy me as much as I think friendship and relationship would, and knowing what it's like to appreciate   
someone as much as they appreciate you.

TLDR: I just wanted to tell someone where I'm at and what I've been feeling at present. These are similar to thoughts I've had for a while and I just needed someone to tell this to, or even get some general advice.

Why do we keep moving?
From the day we are born, we are thrown on a boat into a river. The boat starts off with two captains and a motor and the river begins calmly but slowly the river speeds up. It begins to roar and chant angrily and the boat becomes a kayak, then a canoe, and then a sailboat that is controlled by the wind that you will never know the direction of. You're told to keep going, to keep paddling, to keep rowing, to keep moving, but why? Every time we push through the suffering, what do we earn except the right to suffer more? We climb this mountain but at the peak will be another mountain. We row, we paddle, we push. But all that awaits us after the torture, after the torment, after the agony is more torture and more torment and more agony until we cannot row anymore, until we cannot paddle anymore and until we cannot push anymore. Why do we keep moving? Why do we keep moving when doing so is an utterly pointless endeavour? I want to be free, I want to soar without any worries but I shall forever be tied to the ground as my wings slowly wither away. I am doomed to keep rowing, to keep paddling, to keep pushing, until I give in. I want to lie in a meadow of flowers and smile at the sky but I am chained to this unrelenting desert where the only place I can lie on is a meadow of thorns where the sky is red and terrifying. Where is that meadow and where is that that clear cerulean sky? Where are those white pillowy clouds when all I can see are blankets of thunder enveloping everything? I don't want to row and I don't want to paddle and I don't want to push through this unforgiving crashing river. Help. Help me. Tell me it's going to be okay. Tell me I'm not alone. We both know it's not true but please make it true for me.¬†",2022-02-02 18:34:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643826163,7,/r/lonely/comments/siw3cu/kind_of_embarrassingly_edgy_thing_i_wrote_in_my/,,0,5,Kind of embarrassingly edgy thing I wrote in my notes app

When you are hungry I will feed your mind, body, and soul. If you forget your intelligence or beauty, I will compliment you in a way that makes you feel attractive and brilliant. If you feel stuck, lost, or confused, I will offer to help you find new teachers and influences to guide you towards the highest aspirations for your life. If you stumble in any way, I will catch you, and should you require space I will respect your boundaries.  And when you're succeeding I can both congratulate you and motivate you even further.

But as college rapidly approaches, I realize how typical this scenario is‚Äîthis is the exact same thing I said to myself when I moved school districts, graduated to middle school, graduated to high school, etc. I‚Äôve given myself no evidence to believe that college will be any different.

As if I don't talk enough about the girl I fell in love with literally *years* ago. Last night I had a dream of her again, completely unprovoked -- wasn't even thinking of her before I went to bed prior. I remember a lot of the dreams I have... As sad as it is, the best memories of my life were from dreams. I don't get out a lot. 



Jokes aside though, **a lot** of the dreams I had involved this singular girl. I never thought about someone as much as I did her. Shit, sometimes I even base *other* events in my life on if they happened before or after I met this girl. Entire nights were spent with her on my mind as the inner mechanisms of my mind churned out image after image. Whole movies were in vivid color as I recall spending time with her that never actually got to happen. There were plots, even. I laughed, I cried -- it became a part of me 



No it didn't, but seriously : I can't even tell if I miss her anymore. There was a time in my life where I felt comfortable enough to say I got over her, but then again if I do that -- look what I have to look forward to. Normal people, they'll say things like ""look to the future, it's bright and waiting for you"" or some clich√© like that. While I'd ALMOST be tempted to believe that, I gotta remember that *that's* not the future for people like me. I've spent every day after losing her alone- which has been **YEARS**. I tried to get out of this Hell too, believe me I tried. Not a lot, but damnit I made an attempt. I could go down a whole grocery list of all the things I've done up till the point of losing her to try and somehow compel myself to move on and not single fucking thing mattered in the end. What good did it do me? I get contacts -- girls tell me ""I liked you better with glasses"" despite never getting any compliments to fuckin begin with.  



I get a new hairstyle... And zero matches on Tinder. 



I get new hobbies to make myself seem more interesting. Nah, didn't work. Wanna know why? Because girls haven't given me so much as the time of day because I'm too short. I think that's the reason why, because if it's not then it's because I'm ugly -- but I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility for **two** things to exist at once, right? 





I lost weight -- then gained it again because I left the job that gave me daily exercise.



Then I get hit with the old ""girLs lIkE paSsIONAte GUYs, dUDE bRO! sHow THEm whAt yoU'RE PASSioNatE aBout And TheY'Ll COme ArouNd!"" Not gonna lie, I genuinely thought this was good advice at the time. Nope... Turns out no matter how passionate you are about being an instructor, girls still hate you. Surprise! 




... So what the fuck do I do? Just sit here and shit post on reddit till I either get rid of the internet or expire? That's no life to live... Then again, I don't think there'll be any real meaning to this life if I gotta live it alone anyway.",2022-02-03 03:21:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,3,/r/lonely/comments/sj8hx1/nothing_works/,,0,0,Nothing works

She likes analog horror, so I thought we'd watch chapter 2 of Mandella Catalog together. She said she was free yesterday, and we worked out a time. I waited for her to reply, and nothing. I messaged her several times, for absolutely no response. I'd spent 2 weeks looking forward to it, only to spend another night alone and depressed at 3 AM.

483,sk3ko4,spankyourkopita, I think most people believe loneliness is associated with withdrawing and disconnecting from everything. What I think gets overlooked is how messed up in the head it can make you feel. I don't know how to describe it but you're just on edge about a lot of things and get worked up easily. Maybe nobody loves you or you have little social support. We all need that and if you're not getting it that can be traumatic and turn you into a monster. I don't know about this exact case but I'm just saying.,2022-02-04 03:59:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618293933,1,/r/lonely/comments/sk3ko4/does_anyone_feel_your_life_is_more_chaotic_and/,,0,1,Does anyone feel your life is more chaotic and full of drama if you're lonely?

541,skhb0y,[deleted],"I have a very good career that I love, I have a few hobbies, I work closely with a charity my father started, I write about things that I'm passionate about and try to spread awareness about certain issues I'm passionate about, etc etc. You'd look at my life and think I'm living a fulfilling and healthy life. 

But still, at night... there's this strong desire to be held, to be smothered with love, to be cared for and to have companionship. That feeling just doesn't go away, no matter what I do. The aforementioned things are great, but it reaches that stage where they are nothing more than distractions. Most of us crave romantic affection, companionship and intimacy and I honestly wish this wasn't the case.

I tried meditation, I tried yoga,

I tried everything that these online gurus tell me,

But I ended up not sticking to it for long,

I feel miserable.

I don't know what to do.

I sleep very late at night and wake up with regrets

Each morning I promise I will sleep earlier

I brock the promise every night

I don't know what to do.

I scroll countless hours through social media

I tried to stop it but

I failed each time

I make a promise to the client that I will complete the work

But still, I'm feeling the same

I don't know what to do.

4. I learned that procrastination is the source of all my worries and i learned how to overcome it.

It makes me feel like why wouldn‚Äôt someone lose feelings for me? I‚Äôm strange and embarrassing. Why wouldn‚Äôt someone use and manipulate me? I‚Äôm insignificant and worthless. Why wouldn‚Äôt someone lie to and cheat on and betray me? I‚Äôm never going to be enough. I‚Äôm never going to be what they want.

593,sks6rv,Elaurin34,"I'm 21 now and I started feeling lonely when I left the elementary school because none of my friends went to the same school as me. At first I hadn't changed a lot but after I realized that my new classmates already had their groups of friends and I couldn't be part of that I became more and more introverted. I tried to contact my old friends a few times but it never really worked out again so I started sitting at home alone more and more often. I became addicted to video games but always played alone although there were a few class mates who played the same games... But never wanted to play with me because there never was room for an additional player.
I did a lot of sports at that time and it made me feel better temporarily, but as soon as I got home it always came back. And since I didn't live close by my school I never really had a chance to stay afterwards because someone had to pick me up after work or whatever since there were no buses I could drive home with. 
As I got older parties and drinking became the activity number 1 for people my age and it seems to be still. Neither do I like dancing, nor do I like drinking or smoking and especially I hate crowded places with drunk people and me standing all by myself because I don't know who to talk to or even how to talk to strangers... Usually they turned away after I tried... I hate parties. 
Holidays always made me feel down because everyone told everyone about their plans and activities and I sat in my room for 6 weeks straight because I technically would have had the time to do something but I was too afraid to do them alone.
Apparently even my twin brother seems to turn his back to me more and more... Suddenly he had friends after he had to repeat a year of school. And he never wanted me to be part of that. Now he always plays video games with them and I somehow spend my time by watching YouTube or whatever.
For my 18th birthday I somehow thought it would be a great idea to throw a big party so my dad organized a really large property at a lake where we would have a barbecue and a buffet for everyone and I also inveted everyone I liked... They even showed up but only to drink a few beer, eat and leave immediately for another 18th birthday party of a better friend it seemed.
After school I forced myself to do something where I had to engage with a lot of people so I am a fitness coach now... I am close to the end of the apprenticeship now but it hasn't changed much... I'm still unable to approach people, I am still really insecure about myself and even though my colleagues seemed to give me a chance they never tried to get to know me better.
There's only one girl who writes with me since the beginning of the apprenticeship every now and then and she even met up a few times where I got to know a friend of hers... So we met up a few times but then her friend suddenly blocks me saying ""we can't be friends anymore"" for whatever reason and makes it look like she commited suicide. The girl from the apprenticeship still writes with me every now and then but whenever I try to meet up with her she comes up with excuses. And that's pretty much how all of my few ""friendships"" went.
Meanwhile I always see my colleagues greeting each other with hugs and kisses and when they see me they only wave their hands from a distance shouting a fading ""what up"" and immediately turn away again.
I feel like I am always too boring to make friends because I don't have any stories to talk about. And my hobbies and interests change every 3 weeks so I'm not good at anything neither.. I can't keep a conversation going for more than 2 minutes but I also can't practice because - obviously - there's noone who listens to my stuttering nonsense.
I even go to see a therapist for over a year now but it hasn't changed a thing. I fcking hate my life... all I do is working, lifting (let's see how long I can keep up with that) and sitting home alone wasting my time because I have noone to spend it with.
There's probably a lot of things I could write here but thats enough self-pity for one Reddit post.",2022-02-04 23:47:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624088944,4,/r/lonely/comments/sks6rv/lonely_for_over_a_decade_now/,,0,3,lonely for over a decade now

616,skw00b,Fun_Store9452,"Hi I'm mostly a lurker in this sub, but I really needed some advice from a community who understands what it's like dealing with anxiety.

I got invited to a party (whohoo!), which is really rare for me. Normally I sit alone all the time and just do schoolwork (college) or play videogames. A coworker of mine invited me to a party at his apartment yesterday for Saturday.

In theory this sounds awesome, but there will be a lot of drinking, which I don't do, and the apartment is small with what will be 50 people stacked shoulder to shoulder I don't know. This type of environment is really not my thing and my social anxiety is through the roof just thinking about going. But at the same time I feel like this is what is normal for social people to do and how I'm supposed to meet people while I'm in school, so I feel like I should go. The only two people I will know there will probably be wasted an hour or 2 in, so I'll just awkwardly be standing there.

Anyone here have crippling anxiety and been to a party where you know you're gonna be basically on your own to interact with people? Is there any chance I'll find it enjoyable? How can I calm my anxiety about this?

The one girl I dated was constantly fighting with me and the other girl was cheating on me behind my back.I go out and do things but just about every girl I see in social places has a boyfriend. People always say go out and talk to girls, okay I get it but you can‚Äôt expect me to talk to girls when literally every girl at the bar, bowling alley etc has a boyfriend. I could try flirting with the bartender but that‚Äôs also just asking for trouble. Sure there are times where I see a group of girls hanging out at a table but I don‚Äôt want to be a creep and go up to them and just start talking to them they most likely will find it uncomfortable. There was this one time where these girls were sitting at a table and they invited me to hangout with them. I ended up buying them beer and shots etc and we exchanged numbers. I text them a couple days later but never heard from them again, looking back I think they were just looking for some guy to give them free alcohol. I was kinda sad after that but it‚Äôs whatever. I thought about going to a swinger club and hooking up with a girl but I don‚Äôt know. Anyways I just don‚Äôt see how people make getting a girlfriend look so easy, it just feels like one of those things were you have to have a friend who knows a single girl and it gets harder with age as most girls are having kids and getting married now. I don‚Äôt even want to know what the dating life is going to be like when I hit 30. I go on Facebook Dating and most girls on there just ignore messages, constantly won‚Äôt stop messaging me or they live 2 hours away. I did hangout with one girl on there but we just remained friends because I wasn‚Äôt into her like that. I will admit I am a little picky but I‚Äôve just been feeling like shit lately and don‚Äôt understand how people make relationships or even hookups look so easy. It pisses me off too because most people are single because they choose to be, are too nervous to do anything about it or are single for religious reasons when with me it‚Äôs like I never have the opportunity to and in the rare chance I do get the opportunity to, nothing happens. People say your a good looking guy, things will workout and that I look like Tom Brady, I kinda do lol but things just never go anywhere and I never get an opportunity to get a girl because their all taken. My best friend also had a kid recently and we never hangout anymore, I‚Äôm happy for him but it just sucks how we never hangout anymore. It‚Äôs like all life is now is work, bar and bed.

645,sl03e0,imsickofbeingstalked,"so, i figured out what my deal was. as it turns out, i have schizoid personality disorder. basically, it's the urge to make friends, but not really wanting/caring if i actually do end up making a friend or not. which, actually works out, thank the gods. 
i should have figured out though, given the title of the sub, that this one in particular is, in fact, more used as a type of dating spot. i legit thought it was for people who were lonely, and either wanted to vent on it, or perhaps try and make real friendship connections.
i have had i don't know how many ppl privately hit me up to *talk and chill,* but have only been interested if it could lead into something sexual or dating wise. i am legit looking for a real person i can talk to and shit like that. 
I'm sick of dudes wasting my time bc they tryna get their dick sucked/jacked. 
believe it or not, I'm actually a pretty cool chick that absolutely adores inappropriate, off color memes, rock music, gore videos/pics, and decent convo. I'm pretty clever and can carry a conversation. not much on starting one though. I'm 38/f, but tbh, I'm more gender fluid then anything.

669,sl48bq,idkjustanon,"I am a graduate student studying in the Netherlands. I'm 5 years deep into my higher education, and god damn is this uni life lonely. I started my undergrad in the states, where freshman year I wasn't invited out, I never went to frat parties, I never went to house parties. Drinking age is 21 in the States so bars were out of the question until the last few months of my final undergrad year (I graduated a semester early so I never experienced legal drinking in college). FOUR YEARS. Not one party. Th only party I was ever invited to was the one in my own apartment thrown by a housemate. I studied abroad in 2 countries in my undergrad and went to a third for my grad career. Every single time its the same: I get along well with the people I meet in the beginning, become part of some sort of group, but am always the lowest member of the group, rarely contacted outside of the group setting and never invite to the big group activities (ex: my friends just took a trip to a different country and I found out from Instagram). I think they assume I have tons of other friends since I'm not a core participant of their group, but here I am, sitting alone in my room every single day. I'm so god damn lonely. It looks like its so easy or everyone else to just fall in step with people, find groups and friends and make strong connections. How??? I'm absolutely drowning. 4 countries 5 years and all I have to show for it is one somewhat solid friendship (I speak to them twice a year). I know I should start losing my alone time, but 5 years of alone time is a lot to love, and the more I hang out with me, the less I like me (so I guess its understandable why people don't stick around lol). I've wasted away my early 20s locked up in my room with no one to go out with, never getting invited to outings. I neer thought I'd turn out to be the pathetic type, as I was an absolute firework in highschool and earlier years (very energetic, easily making friends with the people I went to school with). Now, if I saw a movie of my life without knowing its me, I'd feel so bad for the girl in the screen.

724,sleybe,[deleted],"I am one of those shy and awkward guys and girls irl some times talk to me like I am a child. 

Saying things like ""Awwwww"" and they will imitate my body language. But here on reddit I've been told women are ""scared"" and ""have to be careful"" around shy men, because they are ""dangerous"". 

Ive been told being shy is in itself, ""creepy"". Im thinking this is reddit overdramatic garbage tbh. 

IRL I've had girls say its even ""cute"" that I get nervous. But on reddit, I swear I've had girls go ""If you get nervous it means you're up to no good and should be ashamed!"" 

I just never go out or anything. So its hard, but I have a job where I have to do a lot of communication and stuff.

747,slie69,henker220,"I'm  a 23 year old guy on the spectrum and I've never even been on a date  before. I've tried meeting women IRL when I was in community college,  online dating, etc. At this point, I lean on online dating because it  seems like every woman I try to talk to IRL is either taken or not  interested. Plus, I also had a girl in college accuse me of harassing  her for trying to talk to her and got me sent to the dean's office  (another reason I only do online dating). Predictably, online dating  isn't working either no matter what advice I follow or how much money I  invest in subscriptions or extra features. The little self-esteem I had  has been beaten out of me by constant rejection.

Since  I am on the spectrum, I don't do bars or clubs because I get sensory  overload. I live in a very red town in Florida and I'm a minority,  atheist, and politically left-wing (demographically speaking, the cards  are stacked against me...). The only meeting place for people my age in  my town is the community college and I just graduated. Moving is also  not an option for practical reasons. I feel like I'm just not meant to  have what I want (an intimate connection with a woman).

I  have hobbies apart from trying to pursue women. I like to read books,  play video games, learn different languages, watch documentaries,  distance running, things like that. The people of [r/amiugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/)  apparently think I'm not ugly, but evidently there is still something  wrong with me that's causing me to not be attractive to women. Everyone  around me is partnering up and losing their virginity and I still  haven't come close to doing any of that. The closest I've come to a  relationship was an online ""relationship"" with a girl I met on a pen pal  website who was studying in Europe. She then emotionally manipulated me  and ghosted me because I didn't have money (she told me this in so many  words).

751,slis8d,QueenOfEgg4657,"Sorry I've never done anything like this before, I just need to get it off my chest. I've never posted anything online before really, but I'm just feeling overwhelmed right now.

I feel like no one cares what I have to say. I don't have any friends, and although I'm friendly with my colleagues at work, we don't hang out outside of work. They'll often come to me for a chat, and tell me all about themselves and their lives and all the good and bad, but no one asks about me. Even when I try to tell them, they just nod politely and then carry on. 

I've been told multiple times recently that I'm such a good listener, but I feel like it's just because I've realised there's no point trying to join the conversation. It makes me feel so lonely, like I'm just a dumping ground for their troubles, and I have to have their burdens and mine. 

I can't tell them to stop either, as they're the closest to friends that I have, and I don't want that friendly interaction to go away, because if I tell them to stop, they might realise I'm just not worth talking to, full stop.

I also feel I can't hang out with them outside of work, even though I've been invited by one of them a couple of times to go to the pub. I've never been the best at holding a basic conversation and I don't drink so I find it so so hard to let loose at all. I feel like if I went, I'd just drag the mood down and they'd realise there's no point being around me.

I've also been thinking about how people ignore me, and it made me notice how no one has ever even called me pretty. It seems insignificant, and I know I'm really not the nicest person to look at, but just the fact that no one has even just said I'm 'pretty' even in passing has honestly taken such a toll on me recently. My love life has been non existent this far into my life, and that realisation makes it seem like I'm destined to never be loved.

People would probably say it's never too late and they're right, but what really gets me down is I could've started that stuff right after college (since I already dicked around in college and almost flunked but I digress).

Hello everyone,

I recently got an Asperger‚Äôs/high functioning ASD diagnosis from a provider at a residential mental health program and I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out where to go from here.
Ever since high school I have never been able to truly become close friends with anyone. I always have severe social anxiety which prevents me from making any first moves, and I realize now at 23 years old that I don‚Äôt have any close friends in my life. Sure I have people online I sometimes talk to, but nobody else considers me a good friend, and it‚Äôs an awful feeling. 
Is there any way I can begin to be like other people and have a real friend group? Or am I just destined to be lonely for the rest of my life. What‚Äôs weird is I have been in a 3 year relationship now, but I‚Äôm still unable to make any real friends.

796,slosbc,SufferinSuccotash2,"This is my first ever reddit post.

A few years ago both my sister and mom got cancer at the same time. I pretty much lost myself in depression to this news and as a result lost my job and my husband of 10 years left and remarried.. I moved out of the country solo and thought I got my shit together with exotic new perspectives, but I still struggled with anxiety.
I finally found a job and moved to south florida a year ago. Two weeks after starting my big new role,  I was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, which makes me highly likely to get certain cancers. I did a colonoscopy due to the diagnosis and they found a 30 cm tumor in my colon.  I had no idea it was there. No symptoms.  Soon I had (almost) my entire colon removed (no bag). It was stage 2 but they appeared to have gotten the cancer, but now I have to have a hysterectomy and double mastectomy over the next 2 years.
 I'm turning 40 years old in a few days.
I have never been so lonely and fearful for the future. For the first time in my life I don't have many friends and a non existent love life. I spent most nights and weekends in my apartment alone and unable to motivate myseIf to be the productive i know i can be. I am scared that I will never find someone who will love me despite all of these organ removals. I'd really just like to love and care for someone and to be loved in return.
Sorry for venting. I just needed to tell someone. Thank you for listening üíô",2022-02-06 03:39:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632097565,28,/r/lonely/comments/slosbc/divorcecanceralone_and_almost_40/,,1,22,Divorce/cancer/alone and almost 40

Hi

Some introverts suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety.

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

You can find the Zoom link here:

905,sm5uo3,NoNameZone,"This is probably exacerbated by social media, but everyone always seems like they're making plans to meet up or are doing something already, and beyond that, everyone seems to have so many life experiences and I feel like I have nearly none. It feels truly like I'm just a side character in someone else's story, in everyone else's story, I'm just in the background. People always say ""you don't talk enough"" or ""you're so quiet"" but I can't say anything that isn't already being said or hasn't already been said. Sometimes I'll have something funny to add but it never seems like I'm engaging in conversation as much as others. I work at a bakery so I see people every day coming in to live their lives together, and I'm doing best to get out of me comfort zone and do stuff like karaoke but it just feels like I'm not doing enough or something. Maybe I'm shy, so I wish I was better at being willing to embarrass myself and have fun and not think everyone has something negative to think about me and others. It feels a little hollow if that makes sense. This weekend is the same as last weekend which was the same as the one before and the one before.

912,sm6nzc,DemonSlayerV7,"I posted this on the healthy gamer gg subreddit, but I believe that this is the best sub for this, especially because that post didnt get much attention.

I went to the mall with my friend, but then he left me alone claiming that I should talk to people and warm up.


But I am desperated, I dont know what to do, I dont even know exactly where I am, I have no money, and I dont want to force a conversation.


I am here alone as I am typing this post, my battery is 10%, and I dont know what I will do when it ceazes.


I am Lost here at the mall, I cant find him.


The place here looks so nice, the ambient is cool, but I am so fucked up that I cant enjoy this.


My friend was also shaming me for my fear of height and for ""walking weird"", that I must ""be a man"", or that ""people in the stores will know I have no money Just by seeing me"", ""that the way I am dressing is weird"".

He also complained for taking to long to awnser him when he texted me from home, but he never called me. He also Said that the next time, he wouldnt comply, denying any possibility of calling me, for NO REASON.


It was supposed to be a pleasant experience, but he basically left me alone to rot.

I thought he got better, but he is acting like the same dick he acted before.


EDIT: I just got home and I am not well, a little after I made my post, he found me, he said we would be in a social show, kinda like a ballad, but for the entire night, I said no because of my parents, I wasnt prepared mentally, he then came into a restaurant show, but changed his idea, he said that I didnt want after claiming that it would be for a few hours and I deciding  that I wanted it. I was sad, because I felt guilty that it was my fault that I messed up a potentially great experience. Then we came to another mall, we randomly went to many places, ate, there were some provocations to me and superficial dumb stuff, and I got lost from them twice, then his dad took us from our homes.




I am sad, I feel fucked up, I can barely function in social situations, I barely get the oportunity, and when I get, I aways feel ashamed and disconnected from the world, many times I feel like I am stopped floating in the space time, I feel like a ghost, a wraith, I dont feel like I am there.


My wish is to actually find my social circle, but I am too eccentric, I speak too loud, make too many gestures, and I am too fixed into deep stuff, especially philosophy.



In a month, my first year of college will begin, psychology, I am excited that there will be many girls, but I am so detached from reality that I am almost sure that I will be avoided, seen as a weirdo.

I feel like a loser, a dammed person, a cursed person, I am convinced that I was born in the wrong world. When I think about the path I am going in life, I feel like I will end alone, a incomprehensive genius, a fucked up person with no hope.




Btw I am 20, I wanna be hopeful about college next month, but my performance will suck, I feel that is already too late, but I am such a asshole that I will ending bothering everyone trying to connect, and they will see my true self, but I wont give up, I will continue to be an asshole, because that is what assholes are, they bother everyone with their selfish desires.",2022-02-06 20:30:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1538853220,5,/r/lonely/comments/sm6nzc/i_am_so_ashamed_for_being_the_way_i_am/,,0,16,I am so ashamed for being the way I am

You let yourself get down and upset over the most little things, and they aren't even that important. Do you seriously think that the world revolves around you?

I am a 23m  have somehow put a facade about hiding my true feelings (It makes me cringe just about writing that sentence) to cope with the loneliness. The true me is someone who is very depressed and was addicted to weed,LSD and Xanax and had suicidal thought for a long time. The other me is a funny guy who tries to be funny and caring about others and helps in any ways i could. Everytime i exposed the true me i get ignored or vent off or i am a pussy. Every time i wake up i am in a ''i don't care about anything mood'' until i go to work.

As for friends, I have a group of friends. One group is guys i went to high school (*I wasn't someone very popular in hs nor a bully target i just didn't care about it*).i was close with the group at the beginning but my brother came and now i live in his shadow(i never get calls from them about me every time i got a call from them it is about my brother) I also got left behind for a move because i had to search my vest and they didn't care nor answered my calls , Second time was my birthday we had a move with all the squad to go to the arena but i got ghosted and celebrated it alone. They also created a fake profile on tinder with my face and acted like i was a creep. I know I have like two or three real friends who never did me wrong. I know it is a VERY VERY toxic relation and i am aware but it is far better than total darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my romantic relationship since i am very shy and have a lot of difficulty about being the center  of attention plus mixing some social anxiety is a bad disaster.I dont see myself as ugly (*I am 1.83 meters tall,Not overweight but not skinny* ) . I recently realized that there were girls who were flirting with me i just didnt realize it and it makes me angry about me but i have to accept it. And for now i am still in love with my hs crush i am just to scared to talk to her again but i want to try i am just scared about making a fool of myself so i do nothing. I wouldn't call it an obsession but i think it is too long gone to try to make a move

&amp;#x200B;

I have also lobbies to help me cope like walking for 2 hours on the weekends and 30 mins on working days which is a very good way to be in serenity. Since i work in a shop i also love working on my car project to flip them later (If anyone is curious currently it is a lancer evolution VI which is very gorgeous) and i am currently debating trying to do motorcycle license.I promised myself no more drugs i want the real me to feel the pain and not hide from it, maybe i will gain a tolerance to it

&amp;#x200B;

Usually im alone today but i thought maybe she would be there. I guess maybe I do deserve to be alone after all this time. I feel like ive been stuck in this lonely hole for years and it is not getting any better. I've always cried on my birthday and apparently this year is just all the same. 

In all honesty I just want someone to hug me and say happy birthday to me. Anyone would be nice, even a stranger in all honesty.

I just joined this sub cause I needed somewhere to vent.

But if anyone has any good ideas on what to do alone to cheer me up, I would greatly appreciate that. (Besides getting high since I already plan on doing that and drinking cause I can't on my anxiety meds)

1023,smjgwo,Dee_Dubya_IV,"I‚Äôm so fucking lonely I can physically feel the pits of my stomach churn and my chest ache from a longing feeling of wanting to be connected to someone. I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend. I‚Äôve gone through two friend groups in 8 years and they both ended similarly. I just couldn‚Äôt change with the groups. I didn‚Äôt want to be the guy they were asking me to be. It‚Äôs always about fucking drugs or sex. And so when I try to watch shows or read books and there‚Äôs always a friend group involved and doing stuff together I just start to bawl my eyes out. How did I get like this? I don‚Äôt have people to talk to. I have no one I can confide in. ‚ÄúGo to therapy.‚Äù I tried. They said I‚Äôm just ‚Äúin a lull‚Äù and to ‚Äútry reaching out to different groups that align with your interests.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried that too. It just didn‚Äôt work out. 

God it fucking sucks. And really, there‚Äôs nothing to cry over with my love life cause there‚Äôs literally *nothing* to cry over. I feel like a damn wallflower just screaming to be let into the garden.

Ultimately, I know this feeling will pass. But it gets harder every time I‚Äôm reminded of my own deafening loneliness.",2022-02-07 06:36:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1548627073,21,/r/lonely/comments/smjgwo/the_silence_is_deafening/,,1,13,The silence is deafening

1031,smk1mg,backwardsgirafarig,"So I \[F25\] was hanging out with some friends the other day and one of my friends just entered a relationship and was all happy-happy. I was too, she deserves it. Well, in the midst of that euphoria, she told me about how she used to be like me, she used to not believe that there's someone out there for her, she thought she was going to be alone forever until that guy came to her life.

I was cool with that. I understand the high of a new relationship, that is I have heard of how it is. Then she told me that I should just open my heart. And not close it off. 

And I went all 'huh' because no, I never did mention that I was closing my heart. It's just that no guy has ever wanted me *that* way. Yes, they flirt. But they flirt and go and I am exhausted. I have been ghosted about so many times in the past five years yet some people still expect me to have an intact mindset when it comes to dating? I don't. I have been hurt so many times. My self-esteem is gone. 

I just wanted to vent somewhere. I just don't think some people would ever understand the struggle of being unwanted.

1033,smk4t4,CrazyWharf625,"For the past couple years, I‚Äôve been absolutely terrified of the future and how I‚Äôll most likely be by myself for the rest of my life. So much so that I‚Äôve purposefully distanced myself from people just so I don‚Äôt get attached/get used to the feeling of aloneness. Can‚Äôt count on having family there because if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôd rather distance myself from them. In recent times, they‚Äôve been very demeaning, verbally abusive, and have no regard for my mental health. Yes, they‚Äôve still provided so much for me and I‚Äôm very appreciative of it, they have no right to belittle me so much. They‚Äôll get pissed at the slightest screw up or if one tiny thing is out of place, then go on a rant about how I‚Äôm useless, lazy, and can‚Äôt do anything. I would say that I‚Äôd have a few friends, but once high school is over, I seriously doubt that. In the 5th grade, I had a group of friends, and we were all inseparable. Then once middle school started, we pretty much just drifted apart and haven‚Äôt talked since. I have a great group of friends at the moment, but I have a deep gut feeling that the same thing will happen once high school ends next year, and it‚Äôs terrifying to me. Even if that goes south, I still have some online friends too, but I‚Äôve been talking to them less and less (mainly because I‚Äôm just not active in group chats as of lately), which is on me, but still, I feel that I‚Äôm becoming more and more distant from them as a result, and the same thing will happen to them as what happened in 5th grade. And of course, as is so common in this sub (from the half hour I‚Äôve browsed it), I‚Äôm 100% convinced I‚Äôll never have a girlfriend (which, let‚Äôs be honest, I‚Äôm right). It sounds dumb coming from a 17 year old in high school, but I‚Äôm seriously convinced that it‚Äôs just impossible. I can‚Äôt talk to girls at all (let alone new people), I‚Äôm terrified of getting into a relationship (it ending badly, blackmail, girl could be crazy, could just be being used, could be as a joke, etc.), and I just can‚Äôt stand seeing couples in school. Even in some of my classes, all my tablemates will be talking about their relationships, and I‚Äôm just sitting there having to listen to it and feel bad for myself. I know most high school relationships are shallow and almost never work out, but I just want to see ONE HINT of a girl at least somewhat liking me, which as far as I‚Äôm concerned, has never happened. I‚Äôm also extremely tired of everyone in my family asking shit like ‚Äúdo/when are you getting a gf‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat happens if you go out with a girl‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if your wife‚Ä¶.‚Äù. It sounds like I‚Äôm bitching, but it‚Äôs seriously annoying to have to hear questions like that every single day to every single thing I do. It just makes me feel even worse and makes me want to distance myself more from family. I‚Äôm probably bitching right now, and I know this post will become irrelevant/lost in a couple hours, but I thought I‚Äôd leave my stupid rant here. I‚Äôm done.

I'm not even sure when the last time I cried was. I just wish there was someone who would hold me and caress my hair and tell me everything will be okay as I fall asleep. I hardly ever have these feelings because most of the day I spend writing or playing games, keeping myself occupied  so a mask of happiness looms over me.

I do have female friends but i havent found anyone that would be a potential ""soulmate"". Im not facing any peer pressure issues although almost my entire friend group is attached and have a SO.
Ive never dated anyone ever and at this rate im afraid that ill never find love. And im now 23 and in about 2-3 years time if i dont find anyone i will be forced to be in a arranged marriage which i dont have interest in.

I do have a crush on this girl for awhile now but ive barely talked to her and i like meeting ppl organically instead of online. Idk what to do.

1093,smvas1,Sudden-Sand-Storm,"For context. I‚Äôm a 35 year old man, from the UK. The town where I lived and grew up is a little odd. It‚Äôs too big to be a village, but too small to be a town. As such, everyone seems to know everyone and their business, there‚Äôs no resemblance of privacy. 

Myself and my now ex girlfriend were together since middle school. As such, 99% of our friends were shared. She was short, petite, very sweet to all and just had that personality that made her seem that she could do no wrong. This becomes important later.

We were together for 20 years and all was fine, I was totally loyal to her, but this is where the fun starts. 

A few years ago, I found out that she was cheating on me. For 7 years. The initial revelation came when I found condom wrappers and a second mobile while I was doing a spring clean of our apartment.

I confronted and she admitted it, even had it in messages. When my Nan was dying and I was caring for her during her last days, she was out getting laid. When I was working away to make money for us to buy our first owned home, she slept with her ex. She left a trail of dirty messages to one of her best friends husband too, all so horrendous.

I wish I was kidding.

However, she was clearly interested in protecting her reputation, so she blamed me to our wide group of friends and others, I don‚Äôt know the specifics as very quickly I because unwelcome, but denied she had cheated but I was the cheater, who invented this story to make her out to be the bad guy. She also threw a bunch of other accusations. Fast forward a few months, she then became a bit stalker-ish. Asking for me back, shaming me for ‚Äúbeing totally alone‚Äù because of her. She dangled the carrot that I‚Äôd have my friends back if I took her back. I declined. She smashed my car up, broke my kitchen window, put superglue in my door lock, very petty and very expensive. Her dad is a local charity worker, political counsellor and a overall loved guy, so there was no legal route I could take to deal with it, without there being a total cluster**** of crap coming my way for trying to correct the issue. He also believed his sweet daughter implicitly.

Suddenly the whole group turned on me. I was totally isolated. Even my best friend turned and was convinced by her that I was the B******. I was alone in a town surrounded by people that hated me. I took it on the chin for years, and tried to just carry on with my life. I did this for 2 years, but the rumours, ostracisation and loneliness got to me, so I upped and left.  

I started over 100 miles away in a new city. Found a amazing job, went back to uni, generally tried to build back up. Found a wonderful woman who I care about. 

However, I‚Äôm lonely. Since then, I‚Äôve struggled to make new friends. I‚Äôve been told by some at work that I come off a little cold until I know them, then people don‚Äôt really want to get to know me. They don‚Äôt invite me to functions, work social events or anything else. So I stopped trying.

I go to work, come home, stay in until bed. Start over. Unless I‚Äôm with my partner, I‚Äôm on my own. I‚Äôm so grateful for her, and she‚Äôs my rock, but she‚Äôs a very social animal who makes friends without trying while I‚Äôm awkward and feel like a utter goof. 

Really I needed to vent, to ask for advice and to clear my head. How do you make friends when you don‚Äôt know how, and you got burned so badly that you don‚Äôt know what to do?

1137,sn27bs,Big-Collection-4440,"I‚Äôm (23f) so lonely. Almost all my close friends have fallen away and for most of them I‚Äôm not sure why. For most of them I just feel like I was filler for them and I never meant as much to them as they meant to me. For some of them we drifted apart and I left it too long to get back in touch (although if I hadn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt have bothered I presume) and when we do see each other now there‚Äôs a distance there that there wasn‚Äôt before and I feel like I‚Äôm playing catch up when I used to know everything about them. The person I regarded as my best friend moved 3 years ago and we had a disagreement and apart from a few texts when we eventually made it up we‚Äôve not spoken since and she seems happy and unbothered by the fact she‚Äôs lost me, whereas I mourn the loss of her still constantly. 
I live at my parents house with my boyfriend (been together 4 years) but he‚Äôs just gotten a job for a few months that is hours away and doesn‚Äôt seem to be all that concerned about what a massive change it will be in a few weeks when he moves away. I only found out how soon it would be today and there‚Äôs nothing I can do except say I‚Äôm happy for him as I know it‚Äôs what he wants and I don‚Äôt want to move away with him and be somewhere jobless and completely alone without even my family. I love him but I feel like this might be the beginning of the end and he will get bored of the long distance or find someone else. Or he‚Äôll never come back (it could become a permanent position and I think he‚Äôs hoping it will be). 

I work alone 3 days a week and when I‚Äôm not working I stay at home alone all day mostly unless my boyfriends not working then we both just stay in. He‚Äôs got lots of friends and he doesn‚Äôt really get what I‚Äôve been going through the past 3 years. 

I‚Äôve always struggled with friendships since I was about 11 as I was always bullied (psychologically) in my friend groups both by girl friends when I was younger and then my male friends when I was older. 

The one friend I had left that I saw on a semi regular basis moved a way a few months ago and has since made 0 effort to catch up with me. I try to speak to her through Instagram at least once a week but she has been short and distant with me. I genuinely have no idea why. There is absolutely no chance I‚Äôve done anything to offend or upset her and it‚Äôs triggered such low feelings inside of me that this has happened again. I feel like there must be something strange or wrong with me. 

I did some courses last year which I made some friends that I could have seen becoming close with but the course we were meant to carry on with was cancelled for this year and so I‚Äôm back to square one again. 
Im trying to find jobs in my desired career (not what I‚Äôm doing now) which might present more opportunities to make friends but I keep getting rejected on the basis of lack of experience. 

I feel so low and hopeless and just keep thinking that even if I can make a friend it won‚Äôt be the same as what Ive had with my old friends that I met in my early to late teens and have had so much shared history with. And on the flip side, most people at this age already have established friend groups of their own and wouldn‚Äôt be looking for the same kind of closeness I am yearning for. 
I also admit I probably have some issues with trust and with closeness at this point. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do and I worry I‚Äôll be sad and lonely forever.",2022-02-07 21:56:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605907422,12,/r/lonely/comments/sn27bs/im_so_lonely/,,0,5,I‚Äôm so lonely

1139,sn2fiz,[deleted],"I feel like I embraced being lonely. It feels weird. I used to be very emotional about it. I used to be desperate for women (kind of am at times - I feel hypersexual).

I feel like I objectify women too much. I realise I don't love actually. I only crush on people or feel romantic, but I never feel that ""love"". 

I've met lots of women. It happened that they were kinda crazy, so I started feeling okay not running so much after women. Not to say that women are generally mad. Throughout my life I had encounters mostly with mentally ill women (depressed, Asperger's, suicidal, revengeful). I apologized to them before we would go separate ways that I cannot bear them emotionally.

It got to the point where I kind of got scared to try to get into a relationship. I don't try anymore. I would really like to have a girl with which I can share my life with: all my thoughts and passions ever really. But I don't feel that romanticism constantly... I feel also as though I am too unconfident that when a girl encourages me to si something, it feels ""cringe"", but only after some time I realize how pure one's heart can be. And now I'm not so sure about sexual desire either. I am such an objectifier (maybe I am hypersexual) that I feel that I will never ever have a functional relationship.

Am I too greedy? Am I a psycho? Or am I afraid? Or too comfortable? Am I weird with girls? What's wrong with me?

1145,sn305n,Dipesh1990," Hi guys,

I just wanted to talk about how our own perspective is created by our mind. And how to reframe that perspective that perspective to work for our benefit. We are not lying to ourselves, just changing the angle from which we look at things.

For example, ""I have no one to talk to"" this can be reframed to ""I have to reach out to someone"", in actuality there is any number of people online and in real life to reach out to and talk to. Over time these people can also become friends. The way you know which thought is bringing you down is because when you have it, your mood suddenly goes down. The new perspective should come with a sense of joy. When you actively generate that thought, you should also create a sense of joy, as if you were have a cup of coffee.

The simplest way to overcome loneliness that is created by a lack of friends is to make them. There's another type of loneliness that exists where we feel lonely, even if we are surrounded by friends, and for that I think the person should just spend time alone and introspect. But if we just need some more friends then we should start reaching out to people. We can't expect a friendship to magically get create, it requires some effort on our part. Today is a result of my actions of yesterday, and tomorrow will be a result of my actions of today, If I want to change tomorrow, I have to change today.

One of the biggest things that might cause problem is just the simple fear of reaching out, or talking to someone. I think that it's important to understand that we can always let go of the person we are talking to, and the fear of what might happen doesn't actually exists, what is needed for this kind of anxiety is immediate action. Whether or not the other person likes us, shouldn't hold us back from trying. If they don't like us, we can move on the next person, even if 1 in 100 people like us, that still a lot of people.

Many people will want something from you and you will always be able to sense that in your body. If someone is doing something wrong you will still feel it, it will just make you a little sick. So you should always listen to your intuition, and follow what feels joyful. I can understand this is not for everyone, but if it helps, it helps.

For those of you who are willing, I advise you to write down 3 or more mindsets that you feel might be preventing you from reaching out, and then write a new perspective for each one. You can do it in a comment here, and I'll try to help you or you can do it alone.",2022-02-07 22:28:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1472449163,6,/r/lonely/comments/sn305n/loneliness_mindset/,,0,35,Loneliness mindset

1152,sn4wuq,Dipesh1990,"Hi everyone,

This is my second post today to follow up from the first.

Creating closeness with another person is about opening your heart. It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are with at this point, it‚Äôs about how close you can get to your own self.

When I‚Äôm in touch with who I am , I feel this aura of silence around me, there‚Äôs a lot of space in between my thoughts, and there no doubt or hesitation in my action.

Opening the heart can mean doing stretches that open the back and shoulders or aligning the upper chest area. It makes more sense to work on the root if we aren‚Äôt stable and allowing that groundedness to slowly open the heart, otherwise if we are unstable and try to open our heart we will get really hurt. But if you need a quick way to feel that openness, then working on the chest area might work.

You can also meditate on the location at the point in which your rib cages meet, this is known as the anahata chakra. However, it‚Äôs still best to work on grounding and going about this slowly. I don‚Äôt know where you are in life, and I‚Äôm just sharing what I know.

1165,sn7159,[deleted],"I've been out of college a good decade and change now and have no friends. I've never had a best friend, I never had a group of friends to hang out with, and I guess I couldn't when I was young. The house was like something on Hoarders, without the filth but all the junk and we couldn't dare let anyone in the house, so the most I got out of friendship was just what there was at school.

As a young adult, I saw others planning to hang out with friends after work, but I was never invited. But I didn't try too hard, I felt ashamed at the thought of anyone knowing exactly how desperate I was for a friend, afraid they might discover they were the only one. 

But as I'm getting older in my 30s, I can't help but wonder if I was just too weird, if I'd been marked somehow that was visible to others and not to me. Im unapologetic about being myself, have been told I'm a scream, but that never factored into the formula for friendship enough to seriously interest anyone. Why change things now, anyway? I wonder if time with myself is really all that bad. I know what things I enjoy, I never complain, I'm always conveniently in town, and I often treat myself to dinner. 

On the other hand, I don't plan on having children and am the last of my kind, so to speak. I'm horrified of dying in the night and my corpse found by my landlord when the time comes.

I noticed she tried to talk to all of the other people there except me. It's like we both waited for the other to talk, and nothing ever happened.

I remember when I ran into her a year after that at an event, she didn't even smile at me or looked happy to see me. She also never invited me ever again to her parties or to anything. We never met again except for when we ran into each other.

I've never talked about myself outside of maybe if i hear a common thing i have by somebody. to seem relatable. i never talk on what we got in common, but i let you know I'm there, i get it. never real friendships. every ex (outside of ONE) i tell them from jump I'm here for fun, don't expect me long, and enjoy it while we in it. never anything past maybe 4 months. i can only handle being diluted for so long. i start getting restless, resentful. i hate it. I'm shallow pool only. not one person in this entire world knows me. not anything meaningful by me anyways. I'm upset by it a bit, cause i see ppl i know for years get really close to ppl they've only known a moment. hurts a bit, cause damn i wish i had somebody solid, but then again, my name is Superficiality.",2022-02-08 02:58:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604895847,5,/r/lonely/comments/sn943e/my_name_is_superficiality/,,0,0,My Name is Superficiality

1189,sn9rnt,Low_Stick9056,"(17M) I honestly feel so fucked and embarrassed letting this stuff out online, but ive held it in so long and painfully i really cant take it anymore. My mental state is fucked, and i dont even know whats wrong. 

I feel so lonely, ive always lived under the idea that i had tons of friends and ppl who care - but counting it now and reflecting - i have only 5-6 proper friends, none if which i can emotionally connect with. If anything it feels forced and im always the one initiating any contact or conversation. I dont get it - i dont deserve it - im a good person - i always help ppl out, im always there to emotionally support anyone and help anyone anytime they need. After that its all just surface level friends and ive got no one. 

Going through an insanely rough patch rn and i cant talk to anyone because i dont know if my feelings are valid because i just simply cant understans them. Ive just put it down to loneliness. I cant talk to my parents about it, i dont wanna burden any of my friends who are busy as it is and prolly dont care too much and im way too embarrassed to talk to anyone and open up to someone i dont even know. 

Ive lost track of school work and im jeopardising my future. Im honestly just embarrased of who i am, and thw stuff i do. I cant help but get insanely strong waves of self hate, overwhelmness, and anxiety. Cant do anything but tear up as i panic and inflict any sorta harmless pain that overpowers those sensations. 

Ive always considered myself as strong minded and ive always felt that feelings like these are stupid but its hit me hard now and i hate the fact that im weak, friendless, stupid, boring and irresponsible. A self pitying loser. I havent been hugged in years and even been slightly complimented in months. I just crave a proper emotional connection with someone who i can talk to freely. Im so fucking embarrassed.

Id prolly end up deleting this post later anyway out of shame :(",2022-02-08 03:28:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644289592,24,/r/lonely/comments/sn9rnt/lonely_and_overwhelmed/,,0,11,Lonely and overwhelmed

1229,sndw52,AnExactEstimate,"I recently lost an online fwb because he finally saw my picture. 

We uh...*interacted* voice only. He was enthusiastic,  highly interested, texted all the time, always wanted to call and talk. Then he saw me. It was immediately all over, he was out. 

The depressive in me thought, *Doesn't matter how sexy your brain is, I guess ugly is just ugly.*

The one before him checked so many of my boxes for a fwb. He seemed to like what he saw when I showed him. He disclosed that he was in a relationship, but that it was poly and they were pretty long distance. I was absurdly attracted to him,  I couldn't get enough of his mind. We touched on the idea of meeting because it turned out that we're about 3 hours away from each other. He had a lot of very flowery and charming things to say. We talked a lot about how lonely and touch-starved we each were and often checked in with each other a few times a day. 

He gave me his entire week's work schedule so that we could make time to talk. 

Then, suddenly...short, cold responses. No more checking in. No more flowery language. But also nothing to indicate what any of this meant so I assumed he was tired because he works a stressful job. 

A flirty text was met with the news that he and his partner had very recently decided to become exclusive, and an offer of friendship. Everything we had been talking about not even two days prior had suddenly become a no-no. 

""It's because you're not enough,"" said depression.

1247,sng5oc,PrimateDroppings,"It's been literally decades since I've had any sort of actual contact with a woman. I know i'm ugly and awkward and boring but I'm also afraid women just find me creepy. It's to the point now that just seeing or hearing women at all depresses me because all I can think of is how disgusting I must look to them. If I see a couple or even just girls and guys talking or hanging out, I can't help but become filled with jealousy. And a lot of times, hatred.

I dont know any effective way to get women to talk to me but even if I did, I just am not anything that any woman is intetested in. I have no life and can't motivate myself to change things because being *this* lonely and knowing just how gross and ugly I am, absolutely kills any good feelings I may be capable of having about myself.

I have no friends, never had any flings, no exes I can call up to try and to rekindle or at least a booty call. Ive got no one at all. No one has touched me since my twenties, not even a hug. Not even a fistbump. And I'm not young anymore, there's no more time to figure things out. I'm just unlovable, unfuckable and unwanted. Whats worse is how everyone seems to hate me even more when I talk about it. But wtf else is a person like me going to talk about? It's too much for anyone to have to live with, it's not fair. I know no one owes me anything but it's just fucked up that some of us are predestined to be completely alone and miserable. Everyone should get to know what it feels like to be sexy and desired. I've been told by more than one person that this makes me an incel.

1260,snllhy,CAWvid333,"I moved recently and have been staying with two friends and their three flat mates, while I try to find my own place. One flat mate decided to move out. Since I got along well with the other two flat mates I was getting excited that I would be able to take that room. Well I started getting the feeling that one of them actually didn't like me much and no one offered me the room. Mind you, I had made it clear to my friends I would love to take that room. I was pretty upset but understood that the other guy doesn't click with me so have been keeping a brave face and holding back the tears. Not only am I upset that I'm not wanted here but also that I have to find a new place, part of me is excited to meet new people but I'm also afraid.


Anyway, just now, the guy who doesn't seem to like me had gone to bed and I was sitting with the others. Then one of them brought up how many applications they have for the room that they have to through. They were just siting there discussing how to choose and what criteria the person would have. I didn't want to show that I was up set so I sat through as long as I could and quietly got up to leave after a bit. But I don't see how they could not see how hurtful that would be. I kind of think I should point it out but also don't like ruffling feathers. I'm not going to fucking sleep well tonight because I'll be fighting a thought spiral about how people don't like me and I'm unwelcome. I feel so down for the past week because I feel unwanted. I don't know anyone in this place. 

Should I tell them how hurtful I found that or will it just make things worse?",2022-02-08 14:30:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1549174348,8,/r/lonely/comments/snllhy/my_friends_were_discussing_the_search_for_someone/,,0,7,My friends were discussing the search for someone to take the room in their house right in front of me.

So i‚Äôm currently a freshman in college with no friends whatsoever. And no, this is not an exaggeration. When i say i have no friends i really don‚Äôt have a single friend. Sure, i have a couple people i talk to in class but it‚Äôs not going anywhere, there people you usually talk to in class that sit close to you so it‚Äôs not awkward the semester. My day consists of waking up, going to class, coming back to my apartment, studying, and going to sleep. I also live alone which can be hard sometimes. Sometimes it just gets so damn lonely. I literally lose my voice when my parents come over for a weekend because I‚Äôm not used to talking anymore. 

I use to have a lot of friends in high school. I was the talkative and outgoing type who just talked to any and everybody. I had friends from different types of school and etc. Since I came to college I‚Äôve just lost my social spirit that makes me who i am. Now i find it hard to talk to people and before talking to people was what gave me energy! I did come to university with my child hood best friend, but he showed his true colors when we got here. He joined a frat and just brushed me off like i was nothing. If i‚Äôm being honest it did hurt a lot knowing somebody I had so close just ditched me when he had the chance. But i‚Äôm over it now so it‚Äôs not a big deal, i‚Äôm just venting ig lmao. 

I just find myself depressed all the time now and i don‚Äôt know why. I feel so empty now and i feel like i‚Äôll never make friends who are really friends again. I mean i figured it‚Äôs gonna be impossible to have friends when i join the work force. Is this just how life is and i have to get used to it?

1389,so9um7,[deleted],"I've been through a brutal little lifetime so far of a lot of abuse and neglect, then consequent trauma, from multiple corners. I've found that a consistent theme is that no matter what I say, do or experience with somebody, whether it be for a few months or multiple years, people will project whatever they want onto me, no matter how terrifyingly inaccurate and degrading it is. I know everyone has this happen to them but for me it's been just about everybody and often to extreme degrees. I'm alone a lot, which is both wonderful and terrible, and every time I think about any significant past connection of any sort with someone or start getting too on edge about being alone for much longer, it always comes down to this core issue. I can't describe how it makes me feel. I've never been an actual person to anybody and nothing I do or don't do seems to change it enough for it to actually help me properly or give me a good enough reason to truly cherish them. So I'm left with a lot of fragmented and awful memories, confusion, grief and regret. The best medicine is to just do me, but there's no cure. I just don't understand it and I want to scream until my voice is hoarse. I've meant so little to people- the REAL me. The REAL me has meant fuck all to people. I'm determined to focus on my own goals and I can at least say that I have a good scope of my own worth and I can even laugh at them in pity for having no idea what they missed out on. But at the end of the day this is a horrifying thing and I'm seriously scarred from it. No matter how ""close"" I seem with another person or how intense our dynamic is, there's always a key ingredient missing. Like very large and important chunks of me are missing in their eyes and replaced with their icky subconscious. I'm so shaken up. It never stops.

1406,soexqb,SpiritualPants,"I am tired of all this meaningless surface level interaction. I am tired of all this one sided interest and I'm fed up with being boring.

You see, whether it's coworkers, friends or family members, I'm usually curious about them. I like it when people open up and tell me about their hobbies/passions, work, health and general life. I feel appreciated as a listener. It doesn't have to be something I am familiar with, you can talk about dancing and I still want to know more. 

But I wish the feeling would be mutual. At best, I get asked how I am today and what I did for the weekend. Problem is, people don't want an honest answer. They want to hear that I'm fine and that I did the usual. If I tell them that I have been lonely and sad and I wish that somebody cared for me, they'd back off really quick.

I had the opportunity to talk about myself in the past but it was usually just met with an ""uh-huh"" or an ""okay, well anyway..."". I wish somebody would share my interests. I wish somebody would want to get to know me. I wish I would be more approachable. I wish I knew how to be not boring or how to change my personality. It has to be my personality, right?

1422,sohvtk,kera_236,"My husband just shared that my social skills could use some work.


The 'problem' is I don't think there is a problem not being in contact with friends all of the time. I can go months, years, without contact and not feel awkward about it. Then I'll have a good memory and try to get in touch to see what they've been up to. Eventually, communication dies out, and I rinse and repeat.


I always try to be open to communication from old friends, but they never seem to be the ones to reach out. If what my husband says is true, ouch. I've hurt a lot of feelings unknowingly.


Military life  isn't very stable. You learn to make new friends fast. The friend list gets pretty long, and if I were to make consistent conversation with everyone, I would get no time for myself.


Is it normal to always be chatting with all your friends? Has anyone who grew up with military parents experience this?

1425,soi935,mastermml,"I made a post here before. I physically can't walk because my hip pops out of socket. I have been stuck staring at the same 4 walls for over 2 years now. I haven't seen my friends or gone out unless it is for Dr. appointment or pt or testing. Every day is a struggle just to even walk to the bathroom. Today after my shower I fell 2 times and needed my father's help. I landed on my bad hip and smashed my head against a hard tile.  Right now, my head is ringing, and I am having trouble concentrating. Also, the new medication the Dr  prescribed to me over a week and a 1/2 ago needs prior authorization. Great insurance in America.. I sometimes think about who will miss me.

EDIT: This is the post from before for those who can't see it

2 and 1/2 years ago, I had major back surgery, but I was falling horrible because of my messed-up spine. I now am suffering from a horrible hip injury when the hip locks and pops out of socket. When this happens, I end up falling to pop it back in. I need to swing leg backward and fast forward to pop it back in..  extremely painful..  I am taking 600mg gabapentin and 5 my Oxycodone and my pain 7.5 after taking my meds normally. It's a 9, depending on how many times I have fallen. I have seen 20 plus Dr's ,had 25-30 mri/xray , CT scan, 2 injection in to the hip socket both left me in wheelchair for days, injection into the spine, 10 trigger point injection to hip/butt, 2 months of land pt and month of pool pt. I have not gone out unless it is for Dr. appointment or pt or testing for over 2 years now.  I am unable to walk with my cane or walker. I have not seen my friends in ages. Today, the pool pt told me that I was not getting any better and canceled my other appointment because I am just hurting myself. I have been stuck staring at the same 4 walls for 2 plus years. I thought the pool pt was going to help, but I just got any hope I had completely crushed today. The other day, I fell so bad on my hip and head that it caused me to get sick and also mild concussion. I am stuck in a really bad dark place.
A couple of days ago pt canceled saying I made no progress, 
I spoke with my pcp and she ordered me a wheelchair and upping pain meds and changing to something I had never heard of before

I remember me and a friend at the time were talking for hours about where to take our women. We were both completely head over heels in love. Fuck. I can't explain how much we loved them. We both wanted them by our side forever. All we'd talk about was....them.

It was February and we wanted to treat them to a nice meal in the centre of the city, in a well-known Chinese buffet which had a great reputation. And, we did. We surprised them. We were going to do a double date but decided to go separately to be more intimate/romantic.

Long story short: after 7 years and being engaged to her, my ex cheated on me. 2 years later, my friends' girlfriend left him for another man she met at her workplace.

Valentines 2022 will be spent alone. I'm out of shape. It's a total polar opposite to how my life used to be. I spent Christmas and New Year alone too.

The people around me thinks I am uninteresting. Even, my roommates don't share about their little secrets like their crush, if they are in relationship or not, something like that. So, when I am open to them I feel like I am a fool. My problem is I don't talk to girls, I can't even chat with them. It's just I didn't felt any need to do so, but now I feel like I want to be in a relationship. I wanna share my feelings. I have one or two friends and my parents but I can't share everything with them right? Thats why I need a girlfriend. I wanna cuddle. I wanna talk to her daily. I wanna believe that someone is there who needs me. I want her to guide me. Unfortunately, I can't do those stuff, because I never approached a girl even with a thought of making friendship. Girls won't talk to me too. I am not good looking, I don't have flashy talents, I don't even have a good physique. I lack social skills, I can't even do simple things properly. So, how can I get a girl. I don't even know what to do, when I am surrounded by friends I feel alone. I feel like I am being left out. My whole life is very embarassing.

1471,soshvf,joeywinter_,"I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since september. Before that, I was diagnosed with emotional regulation problems, adhd and I showed a lot of symptoms of a personality disorder, but I didnt get officially diagnosed with that since there isn't a clear cause for it.

My best friend of 18 years (she's also my cousin) was perfectly aware of the shit I was going through. I told her everything about what happened in september, to which she and another friend of ours responded with the fact that they were there for me. 

However, around december I noticed that we weren't in contact with each other as much as we used to be, even though we are in the same class. Probably because I don't go to school as much anymore. But then they started hanging out without me. Our other friend got her drivers license so they were constantly going to things without me. Not asking me to go out in the weekends which we used to do all the time. I was at peace with it at first, but now it is starting to eat me up on the inside. 

They started being less understanding and sympathetic to me. Haven't asked how I'm actually doing or if therapy is helping me. And whenever I try to tell them what's up, the subject gets changed. Now I only talk to them if it's about school.

I just feel lonely. I don't think I have healthy friendships anymore. Another friend of mine who I'm really close with has been starting to suck the energy out of me. He's also struggling with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while now, but he says he isn't ready to look for help. I feel responsible for his well-being all the time, but it's so draining to be his friend when you're also struggling mentally.

I guess I just wanted to vent. Thank you if you read all of this.",2022-02-10 00:28:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608899206,7,/r/lonely/comments/soshvf/they_havent_even_asked_how_im_doing/,,0,4,they havent even asked how im doing.

1475,sot6eb,Willing_Swordfish_76,"Am I the only one that ever just feels as though no one really cares about me? Cares being the word. I will go out if my way to talk to people, to send a text once a day, to try and start a conversation. All to be left on read, or have it be Days before a response is give. 

Today, I just wanted someone to talk to me. To initiate a conversation. It never happened. I messaged multiple people and only one responded back to me. I consider them a good friend. However, out of the 6 others no one responded to me. A couple people saw it but didn't care to even send an emoji or a haha, anything. 

On top of it the only person that I ever recieve a hug from is my wife and child. Though it's not often, cause family. I'm not even sure what emotion I would have if someone just gave me a genuine hug. 

I've also realized in the last few weeks that I'm not even good at anything, I have no special hobby. Mainly because I'm never asked about things I do or want to do. I thought about going into Astrophotography thinking ""maybe when I produce an amazing Pic"" someone will want to talk to me or hangout with me and watch the process. 

Just last week I went and saw a movie with my two guy friends. But I had to initiate the offer, and coordinate, and put in the effort to ensure we could go. 

I dunno. Life just sucks sometimes. I so badly long for a best friend that can be there for absolutely anything, surprise me with a message, give me a bro high five or hug when they see me. Just as I do with some people. However, the act is never reciprocated.

I work all day, from home for the last decade. I can't just go out and make new friends. It's not that easy. On top of it I am introverted but I try regardless just to make friends. 

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to, not be popular, but desired enough to be asked to do things, be apart of events, etc. I have my own hobbies but no one is interested. I like cars, computers, programming, swimming, hiking, fishing, and the list goes on.

To that friend that says ‚Äústay single‚Äù and sees it as freedom.

You do not see the chains it wraps me in.

To be lonely with nobody to love you is a constant suffering with no comfort possible.

It is a constant pain of only being half a person. An Incomplete soul.

It‚Äôs searching in darkness for a part of your broken heart that isn‚Äôt there. 

It‚Äôs crying yourself to sleep every night, and awake every morning.

It‚Äôs a constant mocking torment of never being able to share your deepest thoughts and heart with anyone.

It‚Äôs a starvation of love that cannot show mercy and kill you.

It‚Äôs a miserable anguish of existence in a cruel world with nobody to give you escape.

It‚Äôs deep wounds punctured into your chest by spikes of self hatred, with no way to heal. 

It‚Äôs a desire for death that never comes, and never ends.

It‚Äôs the unceasing and taunting torture of despair you feel when you see others kissing, hugging, cuddling, and nestling.

It‚Äôs a life without love, without happiness, without affection, and without hope.

It‚Äôs distant life in which you are wandering alone in a grey mist, with nobody able to see you are lost.

It‚Äôs a cold life without warmth.

It‚Äôs a desire to have a genuine and loving hug or embrace, but only ever receiving fake or loveless ones.

I've spent so long working on myself and investing time into my hobbies and trying to put myself first but I feel like it's all pointless. It's like I'm investing in nothing because nobody has or will care. Even in prior relationships it seems like they're interested in me until a few months in then it's like talking to a robot. 

I know that's just life and everyone should put themselves first but I get so jealous when the people around me all seem to have someone, whether that be a best friend or an s.o. 

I feel myself turning angry and bitter and spiteful of the fact that I can't be happy in the long term on my own. Or that nobody stays around for more than a few years. I hate that no matter how much effort I feel I'm giving, I get scraps in return. 

The worst part is I know I shouldn't give up on bettering myself or pursuing new friendships and relationships, or being happy by myself. It's just gotten so difficult to keep doing that over and over. 

Sorry if it seems like I might be overlooking my own flaws or fault in why I feel like this. I don't think I'm perfect by any means,  but doing all the ""good"" advice has yielded nothing in the end besides some good memories.

I still live with my parents, ended up quitting a job that while it paid well I hated so I could help my family (grandparents need almost constant care) and have no friends to speak of besides my mother who I have become more of a confidant to than anything. Listening to her vent and feeling like the only time that I can actually *feel* anything of substance, is when I'm nearly stumbling drunk.  
I became addicted to masturbating a long while ago and have been trying to kick the habit, for myself and own mind if nothing else, only to keep falling back into it. The very temporary feeling of happiness quickly turning to dread and disgust moments after. This partially stemming from having never succeeded in *anything* with a woman. Strike that, I've been on *one* date right after high school. With who at the time was my best friend, and she had been pressured into it by her Mom.  
My successes feel like little more than events that happen rather than something worth remembering and at least personally celebrating. As stupid as it sounds I'm fairly personable, make stupid jokes and sometimes have people laughing and can make 'friends'. Those 'friends' though are fleeting at best when even my rather interesting hobby of HEMA (sword fighting) or even simply trying to be a good friend doesn't do anything to retain them.  
For a lack of a better term, I feel like that guy at the bar everyone knows, that people don't mind talking to, but never gets invited to hang out. That never gets remembered past an interesting story or acting silly. Who's red hair and beard are a more defining characteristic than his personality. ""You're such a nice guy!"" ""You're so real man!"" Could you do me a favor and tell me who I am then?

Right now i live in my hometown, that i left for 4 last years and realised that i have no friends anymore here too, im just too different from all the fellas i used to be friends with and we have nothing to talk about anymore.

1533,sp1if5,MinimalCollector,"I've never been in a ""healthy"" relationship. I've been in ones that somehow sustained for years, but not without this underlying issue. I've noticed partners have never been able to be there for me, I assume because they were too busy struggling with themselves. I've never had a confidant for my emotions. I don't require them to be a therapist, but something more than ""That sucks I'm sorry to hear that"" is something I've always provided but never got back.

I don't know if I'm ever going to find a partner capable of genuine emotional labor. I've put too much in with too little return. Not entirely their fault (I don't think they do it maliciously) but knowing that never made it any easier. I still felt alone while in their company because I couldn't confide in them. It would be talking to a brick wall.

When single at least it's a constant level of this feeling. It doesn't get better nor worse, but constant is predictable and more manageable than the throws of a one-sided relationship, of the rejection that a non-listening ear does to someone. 

It feels strange. I'm deeply saddened by it, but I think I'd take this over how low it feels to have your partner not understand your concerns or feelings. Or respect them. That's more isolating than anything. I simply want to feel understood and acknowledged. More than I want a hug or to be held by a lover. I want that emotional release of feeling safe with my emotions in their hands. That's the type of love I've wanted but somehow escapes me each time.

1552,sp6pjs,cozIfailed,"
These days I can‚Äôt help but think of a good place to die. I grew up developing a pretty good amount of pride so I think of suicide as a really shameful activity where u let others see how much of a failure u are. It‚Äôs shameful but I had to bear with it if I want myself gone in this world. 

The thing is, I just don‚Äôt want to die at home, where my family will mourn for me, question the reason behind my decision, and possibly think they are the reason behind it. I especially don‚Äôt want my mom to be like that. She did everything possible to give me a better future despite raising three children on her own with a meager salary and making sure all of them could go to college. My mom is the kindest and I don‚Äôt want her to think she failed in anyway.  

Another reason I don‚Äôt want to die at home or in any nearby place is to spare my family of shame especially my grandmother because I know it would be really shameful for her to face her neighbors if her granddaughter killed herself  which they thought to be ‚Äúintelligent and has a bright future ahead‚Äù. My grandma used to brag to our neighbors every achievement I had in school like being a consistent achiever and etc. I know she will be like that because she care so much about what our neighbors will think of her.

Lastly, I don‚Äôt want to die to this place where I grew up, to this place where a lot of people know me, talked to me, hang out with me or just simply shared a conversation with me because I used to mock those who killed themselves, for wasting their lives over a simple problem. Yet, here I am now, on the way to give up my life. I just didn‚Äôt ate my words, I swalled it whole and took seconds. 

For these reasons, I just wanted to die in the middle of nowhere, or in a place where no one knows me, in another country. I prefer dying in a less painful and quick way but who am I to choose? As long as no one I know can discover my death I‚Äôd gladly accept it immediately. If someone could help me go there NOW  I‚Äôd take it right away even if it involves taking my organs for the black market.

I know this is silly because upon death I will no longer have to worry about shame and other people but I can‚Äôt help it. Without it, I know its going to be easier for me to let go. 

I‚Äôm not that religious even though I was born catholic but I don‚Äôt believe with heaven and hell 100%. I want to do a lot of things, go to a lot of place but also a lot that keeps me from achieving it. I want to cling to a chance that if ever there is no such thing as heaven and hell and we get to be reincarnated right away after dying, I might be able to live a new life but if there is in deed heaven and hell, I‚Äôll just accept my terrible fate in hell (because I know I‚Äôm guaranteed a spot in there)

But, once my usefulness has expired, I just sit there, watching everyone else carry on without me. I tentatively wait to see if anyone wants to spend time with me or talk to me, but it doesn‚Äôt happen, not really.

I‚Äôve become a worse person because I envy my friends talking to each other and everyone else except me. Doing things, without me. Making no effort to acknowledge I exist until they need something again.

I don‚Äôt want to just be a tool to be used. And yet every time they ask I will comply because the alternative is that I never hear from them again anyway.

- My envy has turned into resentment

- I wish I could tell them how much I hate how little they don‚Äôt even try to talk to me it feels like they‚Äôre avoiding me

- At a loss what to do to make things different

- Not suicidal but feeling detached and empty

- Wanting things to change, but unable to motivate myself to do anything or think about what to do.

- All I will ever be is a machine that performs functions and is eventually forgotten forever.

1572,spbwep,Available_Clue_5639,"I have been feeling lonely for quite some time now. Not quite sure when my loneliness really began and that's not really important.

But what's most important is that I'm feeling more and more lonely the older i get which can honestly suck

Of course my ideal life is to have many friends and to have the ""perfect lifestyle"" and also have a healthy social life but to be honest, i don't really know what a social life is because i don't believe I've ever had one. 

I don't go out or have friends. I don't meet people in real life or go on dates or any of those things that we've been conditioned to believe that we should do all those things to become ""more human"" 

I get horny multiple times during the day. I blow my load like a few times in a day. I do it to forget my loneliness for a while because i get a lot happier after ejaculating. It's self-love in every sense of the word...

All i can ever think about is my future boyfriend and how we would be with each other once we're under the sheets. I get a lot of those naughty scenes in my head. It happens a lot of the time. I can't help it. All it takes is some lube and my imagination to get me going.

I know that being lonely isn't ideal but sometimes it can be once you think about how much effort you have to put in into a relationship. All the amounts of blood, sweat and tears and just a lot of time to get things right. And once you get into a relationship you have to at least be good at commitment or otherwise the relationship won't exactly work out but then i remembered that I've never been that great at committing to anything before.

I used to do all those courses and study and all that. But I've never really been able to finish anything properly in my life. Not really sure why. Maybe I'm just lazy. Maybe I'm not the type of person to be motivated or whatever. Not everyone can be that way. It's cool if others are though. Good for them!

I could blame the way I've been feeling on anxiety but then again that won't really do me any good. All it will do is cause more issues for myself in the long run

It's also sad having to always only have yourself and yourself only to rely on. I do have a family but to be fully honest, they've never really supported me that much in terms of actual emotional support. They've never really been available for me at all. And throughout my life it just felt like I've been truly abandoned. Not to sound too dramatic but this is exactly how i have been feeling for so long.

Even when i was a lot younger. I never felt like my family were really there for me. And it just feels like we're constantly having arguments with each other all the time which is why I've recently decided to not speak to me. This has been going on back and forth so many times. I'll not talk one day and then the week after i will talking to them all over again like it was nothing but i don't think it will be that way this time around. 

This time around I'll take a bit longer. I've decided to only communicate with people who are helpful and who will actually talk to me with decency and not with arguments and non-stop fights because i deserve much better than that and i know it.

I can't keep on going to war with my family all the time. Because this is getting a bit exhausting nowadays. It's too much. 

Obviously in an ideal world, things wouldn't have been going this way but since we're living in the ""real world"" of course things has to be more shit. 

Over the years I've noticed how my mother would just not reply to me at all when i would talk. I've always found that to me extremely fucking weird. Just the fact that i would actually try to have a ""conversation"" with her and she would completely act like i wasn't in the room. And whenever i confront her about it ask her about it. She's always like ""I'm listening to you"" her way of listening is just so fucking weird and it just feels like I'm wasting my time on my own fucking family. 

It's been like this for way too long. And i know that things won't really change and i have to just give up. I should just stop trying so hard. Things will always be the way they are and i just have to accept that finally. 

I haven't been talking to them in a while now and i have honestly felt so much better. Way better than when i actually do talk. I feel like it'll be a whole lot better if i didn't have to actually talk to anyone ever again. Being all by myself and silent sounds like a great fucking plan to be honest. Talking can be terrifying. The idea that you can mess up at any point while you're interacting with someone is so FREAKY to me. I can't stand talking to people. But then again it all depends on the right person too. The right people are always amazing to talk to.

I also have to accept that my parents are from a different culture and they think differently from me. I have a different way of talking and thinking. My thought process aren't the same as them and it will NEVER be the same as them. Sometimes i do wonder if i was adopted because of how different from everyone i am. I've never fit in my whole life. Not even in my own family which might sound weird but that's how it feels   like.

My parents talk in their own language and i don't really enjoy that at all. I just don't see the whole point of them coming to a brand new country and them still acting like they're fucking living in their old country. 

I've made my decision once i came here. But i remember it took me a long ass time to commit though. But i still did it which is super nice but whatever though

I'm referring to the time when i came back from school one day and basically decide right then that i would speak english only. And i haven't gone back since. I have spoken english ever since that very day. It's great to see me actually committing to something there üëÄ 

I get where the connection thing between us and them went wrong. But at the same time i don't live just to fucking please everyone. FUCK THAT. I please myself first and foremost and I'm not really here to fucking play any games with anyone üíÖ 

It was the right decision at the time. Even when i was still in my country at the time, i was never a big fan of how people talked there. I was just always so damn irritated by that. I just never saw that as me being ""lucky"" just because i was born in a place where they have lots of beaches or whatever. That doesn't really mean shit and people shouldn't let those beautiful views fool you.

Just because it's a masterpiece doesn't mean that it's flawless. 

Same for that old country. It has lots of beautiful beaches but still doesn't make it a beautiful country just because there are a few good beaches in that country. It doesn't really work that way.

And also let's talk about how i do feel ashamed of being from there and I'll give you some reasons as to why i do feel that way exactly. Because it seems to me that some people don't quite get it.

Because i get that people always say shit like ""you should be proud of where you're from"" and of course i wish that it could be that easy but it's really not. It's a whole lot of work. So much, actually. 

I'd be proud of my roots if it was a decent country to begin with. I definitely would have been a great representative of the country if that country was the greatest. But the thing is I've never really felt that way. I've never really had that pride in me. I wish i had though. I remember i was trying way too hard to embrace more of my culture and it just didn't work at all. Computer didn't compute. 

It's not my fault though because i have nothing to do with the fact that the country itself is a fucking massive dogshit hell-hole of motherfucking placeüòÄüî™

I want to be nice and lie to people and say that this is one of THE most beautiful country ever but that wouldn't really work, would it?

Because what if one day they decide to go on vacation there and then they get hugely disappointed by everything there like we did when we went back there.

My own dad was super disappointed by it. Probably more than i was, actually. Just some of the road on the street looked like a mess and apparently it was meant to be ""under construction"" and yet it's been looking that way for so dsmn long and basically no one's thought about actually being productive and re-construct those roads but yeah this is how things are there.

People you meet can be super rude and mean towards you. You just have to really be careful about literally everything. It's not really all that fun and crazy there. It can be such a pain in the ass to just see it all in real time. 

And also the fact one day we went on the beach just to walk but then there was this pavement place and it was kinda close to the beach so anyway we basically saw a used baby diaper. It was one of THE most grossest thing I've ever had the pleasure to see. It was just so fucking vile, man. It was A LOT of crap. Literally and probably non literally.

It's hard to keep seeing this country as a good country after seeing that used baby diaper basically on the fucking beach. It was just super weird. I don't really know how things are that bad there but somehow they are. 

I have no clue if i enjoyed my time there at all or if i was literally forced to go back there. But I've promised myself that it will be a nice trip and we can talk as well",2022-02-10 17:28:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613103540,2,/r/lonely/comments/spbwep/not_sure_why_i_feel_this_way/,,0,0,Not sure why i feel this way....

1578,spcwty,Dipesh1990,"The thing about the mind is that if you stop playing with it, it will stop on its own. The way to stop it is to let it run without resistance, once the intense mental turmoil is over, there is peace on the other side. It's hard to not engage with the mind unless we create some distance from it, and to do that we should practice meditation. 

Here is a simple guided meditation if you need it, you can't go wrong with this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHnl\_XugJyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHnl_XugJyE)

Just note that to make peace a permanent happening in life, one should practice daily. But doing it once should convince you of the benefits. The mind is very agile and long term momentum can be broken in just 5 minutes of proper practice. If the pain is physical, its a different story, and it might take a longer time and other things, like yoga or breathwork.

Obviously there's gonna be some people that will say this is nonsense, but to those people I would say, have you tried it? These are the people that don't want to help anyone and will just drag others down with them.

1607,sphfrm,Throwaway23465765,"I've been through my fair share of shitty 'friends' over the years, generally feeling like no one cares about my existence outside of my family and online friends, and have dealt with it alright up until now, but this was the straw that broke the camels back for me.

A decent friend of mine seemingly invited everyone I know to a massive party of her's, where it looks like I was the only one not invited. Hell, people from other towns who I had never heard of were invited. I've never been the most social type, which doesn't help much, but we got along quite well and I'm not a complete introvert. As a result, never really been invited to a party, which isn't something I'm particularly remorseful about, but the fact that I wasn't even considered in the first place just makes me really sad. After repeatedly excluding me from friend meetups, ignoring my messages and straight up leaving me by myself on a day out we were meant to have, instead going to another friend's on a last minute notice, I want to completely ghost her and never speak to her again, but we go to the same college, she still talks to me as if everything's fine and is indifferent/ignorant about everything which somehow makes it worse.

I can't wait to ditch the many people like her in my social groups and leave their messages unread when they want to catch up on my life in the future after they forget about me for a while, and cut toxic assholes like that out altogether. However, for now I just have to deal with it.

The college I go to is incredibly tightly knit and all of the people there aren't really who I'd prefer to be friends with, but there are some alright people who I talk to fairly frequently. Many of my closest friends have changed completely and have become lethargic, self-centred pricks. It's also a very remote area, and I'm not in walking distance of any buses, so I can't go out by myself. The only people who really give a shit about me are my family and one friend, but I just feel lost. At the end of the day, I just feel like there's really no one like me in the local area who I can feel very comfortable around. I really do hope there aren't many people like me in this situation, although that isn't true at all.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I work in produce which is literally 10 feet away from floral so all day I hear about people getting flowers for he her and them and getting all the candies And everyone‚Äôs buying fresh fruit and veg to make an impressive dinner for there significant other and like I‚Äôm like what do they got that I don‚Äôt and for the record I don‚Äôt believe in the ‚Äúwoman only like jocks that treat them like Shit stuff‚Äù that mentality is fucking stupid it‚Äôs like a gateway to red pulled black pilled incel mentality rabbit holes.


But the worst is the balloons and I‚Äôll tell you why


In 2020 my ex  confessed she had feelings for me but it was pretty much long distance cause we had went to different schools. We also kinda kept it secret.

But Valentine‚Äôs Day 2021 we decided to meet up at her house for the first time since middle school.


I had a big box of her favorite chocolates and a card with money in it.


She gave me this balloon 

That day was probably the best day ever in my 18 year old life.

We had lunch and dinner and she cuddled me and for once in my critical thinking life I felt normal I felt like I was close with someone that wasn‚Äôt in my family.  I felt companionship and wanted
That day honestly made up for all the parties and homecomings and dances and proms I didn‚Äôt go to. Or at least it felt like it.

But the balloon I kept for as long as I could and what‚Äôs ironically tragic and funny was that was that the balloon stayed afloat for as long as the relationship was on. And for a year it floated even if low to the ground

The day before what would have been our first anniversary she told me and was honest she wasn‚Äôt as invested in the relationship as I was and she broke up with me.

That same day the fucking balloon fully deflated.

And I‚Äôm over her like 99.9 percent but I dunno the day still hurts reminds me of how for most of my middle and highschool years I spent chasing people and putting girls on pedestals that I wasn‚Äôt good enough for or didn‚Äôt want me. 

I often wonder if highschool the people I knew and my ex were my one shot at feeling companionship and wanted and I blew it.

1641,spmlq5,dogstatic,"I've been alone for a long time now. I was alone since the beginning of secondary school, when a gap opened between me and my former friends and I spent most of my years there alone. I sat by myself most of the time and often read to pass the time. I made no friends and over the years I built up a lot of frustration.

I've used the internet a lot to cope with it as well. Been on a few different apps and tried talking with a lot of strangers. Not a lot of those conversations have succeeded but they've worked out occasionally. I'd like to talk about that a little more. Once, I was using an app called ""Yubo"" and I met this girl from Brazil whom I won't name. We got along well and hit it off (not romantically but we became friends quite quickly). We talked for quite a while and got along well but it didn't last forever.

I'm gonna admit, here, that that's my fault entirely.

i live on the edge of a huge major city, yet i dont know how to meet or interact with people well and im the lonest ive ever been. 
i have a lot of intresting hobbies and i love concerts, yet im so used to doing everything by myself i can turn these social things into solitery things.

1692,sptq2h,alexan5566,"Hello all, 

I was hoping to write this just so it can fall on some eyes of people who don‚Äôt know me and can give me some advice. I‚Äôm in college at a state school practically in the middle of nowhere. I have never felt this lonely and depressed before in my life. I have cried more than I ever have and I have gotten to a point where I feel exhausted with my life. There are other personal things happening in my life to contribute to this but with me being at school most of the time, being reminded that I have no friends is what hurts me the most. I have a roommate who I consider a friend but they hate our school more than I do and they are fairly negative about everything. Being around that constantly has also made me very sad and wonder if they (freshman) feels that way early on there‚Äôs no hope for me it that makes sense. I have tried tinder, bumble to find friends no luck. I joined 2 clubs last semester but both came up short with one not holding meetings anymore and the other people stopped going. I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I like this school, it‚Äôs not bad I just don‚Äôt have any friends here and am tired of having repetitive days everyday with nothing to look forward to. At my school, most juniors leave the dorms and move into apartments but I can‚Äôt really financially So I‚Äôll have to be one of the few juniors living on campus which I feel embarrassed about. I guess I‚Äôm searching for any advice on what to do? I should mention I have social anxiety so I will admit that has probably hindered my progress here. I compare my experiences of being lonely with nothing to do while my friends from home are thriving and enjoying their college years. It hurts and I want my life to be different but I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time because I‚Äôm about to be a junior and it seems like people here already have cliques and are friends. Where do I fit in? Am I too late? I‚Äôm mad at myself that it has taken me this long.",2022-02-11 07:39:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605500353,3,/r/lonely/comments/sptq2h/lonely_sophmore_in_college/,,0,1,Lonely Sophmore in college

1697,spusqu,sweetoon01,"I'm mostly ok in my lonliness? I've not had any quality relationships in my life for so long now, I've kind of accepted that I'll never find any solid friends or a partner maybe. I just try to stay occupied and busy with hobbies and stuff. 

Recently got back on Instagram, and followed like 50 people, classmates, family, etc. and ngl been feeling pretty shitty everytime I look at their posts and stories and how much fun they seem to be having with their friends all the time. 

I'm feeling a lot of fomo rn. Though I was OK before, instagram made me feel like maybe I shouldn't be. But not in a positive way that'll give me the motivation to put myself out there and seek people out but in a ""you're pathetic and a loser for having come this far without being able to hold down even a single quality relationship in life. Shame on you."" 

Social media has a weird way of making you feel this intense obligation to post and let people know what's up with your life. And that made me realise even more than I already did, how I have absolutely nothing going on in life at the moment, and that's been keeping me really upset for sometime now. And even if there was, it's not like that'll make me any friends. Besides I value my privacy and simply don't want to be more fodder for the entertainment of people I've only barely known at some point in life. 

Should I delete my account? Its deactivated at the moment. I'm feeling pretty horrible rn and want to go back to my life of lonliness and not know about what anyone else is upto. But idk maybe that's wrong? Maybe I should find a way to fight how I feel and let this motivate me to meet people, like everytime I've done before, only to find out no one wants to really be my friend?

1725,sq1oa6,uncle-thirty,"I had a dream of all my friends a few weeks ago. Everyone got back together, we were venturing to places we didn‚Äôt know, and just being us. There was one guy in the dream that I didn‚Äôt recognize. All I know was that I liked him a lot, and he stayed behind when I told him to tag along back to my house. I frantically texted and called him, but there was nothing, no response. I felt like I failed him, for some reason, all because he wanted to stay put. Usually when everyone is hanging out and someone departs, we all gather and look for them and convince them to tag along. But in the dream, it was just me looking. No one did anything to help me look, or anything for that matter. The reason this dream still haunts me to this day is because I was around all my friends, and I tried gathering the last piece of the puzzle, but it kept falling apart. When I woke up I cried for an hour in an empty house. I want to cry right now thinking about it, because I love my friends dearly. And if someone I know is hurting, or uncomfortable, or feeling lonely, I will do anything I can to help. I‚Äôm alone, though. I don‚Äôt have friends anymore. The group split because everyone got busy. I find myself crying for someone‚Äôs presence, someone‚Äôs touch, someone‚Äôs beautiful, wholesome laughter. I try to socialize, but everyone I‚Äôve met just does small talk, and they are nothing like me. Hell, they‚Äôre not even fun; they‚Äôre the most boring people I‚Äôve talked to, and it makes me miss my old friends.

1765,sq87p0,ScreamWitch,"As an average young guy I didn't know what being ""lonely"" truly means until my depression phase. It felt heavier each year as I was stuck in my mental prison and forced to watch every single one of my friends disappear as they move towards their own future. At the end no one was aware of me and no one had any expectations from me except my mother. I was somehow the main villain of the story even though I tried to be nothing but nice to others. The last basket I put all my eggs in (a girl that I hope was different than others) was now judging me with foolish assumptions. I couldn't take it anymore and left social media completely. I don't want to get into details since this post is meant to be somehow motivational but it took me well over 5 years to get out of this sink. It was full of ups and downs, despair and most importantly a lonely road. I've tried to socialize mainly on discord and with that I also understand that no one gives a f. about you unless you stand out. None of my interactions lasted longer than couple hours. I was either ghosted or totally ignored. Failing at each and every interactions in your life is a hard pill to swallow. But I didn't want to give up. I forced myself out of my room and tried to run in nature for couple minutes everyday. No matter how disgusted I felt of this life or how appealing it was to shut myself in, I've never turned back. As a result I attend to my uni. exam one last time and get into one of my dream schools with %50 scholarship. After all of my mental wars, I'm able to control my emotions, analyze personalities of other people to protect myself and most importantly feel happy about my life. Time really is the best medicine. Something you consider as impossible today may become one of your achievements in the future. I took my Final exams a week ago and study my as\* off to have full scholarship for the next year. Almost all of them went amazing except Calculus lol If there is anyone reading my story, please do not give up. It's okay to cry and become angry sometimes. It's okay to sit down and think about your future, just hold on and let time carry you through new adventures.",2022-02-11 20:03:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644606343,7,/r/lonely/comments/sq87p0/positive_impacts_of_being_ignored_and_pushed_out/,,0,8,Positive impacts of being ignored and pushed out by society

1771,sq9lge,god_with_a_trolley,"What it says in the title, really. I quit smoking 2,5 years ago, which used to enable me to socialize outside of pubs or in the youth center, but because of the sudden lack of reason to actually be near other people at these places, I started drinking more heavily, which gradually evolved into full-fledged alcoholism when I started going to university and had a place of my own (student dorm room). However, since the drinking affected both my financial stability and made me fail two important exams, I went teetotal. I've been clean for 20 days now, and I have never felt more helpless in dealing with the loneliness.

I've made the conscious decision to try and focus on my university duties, to study harder and properly complete my experimental project (I study experimental neuropsychology and I'm developing a visual and auditory perception experiment in a VR environment), but I've noticed in the past that overloading myself with work doesn't actually distract me from the incessant feelings of loneliness - this observation was in fact what led me to smoke and drink in the first place. I don't know what will happen during the coming months, and I don't look forward to finding out. This conscious decision to try and focus on my work, essentially to try and become a workaholic, will not help me. It will not ease the loneliness, but I'll do it anyway because it's the only thing I can do to avoid encountering other people. This seems contradictory, since meeting other people would presumably help me in defeating this loneliness, but merely seeing other people has actually become enough to get me to feel downtrodden, hopeless, in constant jealousy-infused agony, because merely seeing other people in public, where their friendships and love lives are ostentatiously showcased, already causes a near-involuntary chain reaction of sadness, ruminative thoughts on experiencing this constant lack of true, human connection, let alone meeting a potential significant other, and actual, physical malaise, all of which I'm sick and tired of having to go through on a daily basis.

I don't know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this here. I assume it's to be able to get this off my chest, since I have no one close to me who could perhaps comfort me and assure me it will all be okay. At least I still have my cats and dogs, who are always happy to see me and who I can cuddle with whenever the touch starvation becomes too unbearable (at least when I'm home, not when I'm in my dorm room - which is 80% of the time).",2022-02-11 21:05:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642931342,3,/r/lonely/comments/sq9lge/i_got_all_of_my_addictions_under_control_and_now/,,0,1,"I got all of my addictions under control, and now I have nothing left to battle the loneliness"

at this point im in a bad emotional state from failure but here goes
What I‚Äôve learned from approaching 700 girls‚Ä¶it‚Äôs really looks or popularity at the end of the day. There‚Äôs nothing else to it. I‚Äôve approached women through Snapchat, Instagram, highschool, work, and public approaches.

Through Snapchat I‚Äôd text a chick and everything would go smooth until asking me what I look like, and this is the point the interest fell off. Either shed tell me I‚Äôm not her type, say I‚Äôm ugly, say she has a bf, or give smokescreen excuses as to why she doesn‚Äôt want to go on a date with me. With Instagram no matter how smooth and witty i tried to be nomatter how normal and fun i tried to appear, it was always the same. I‚Äôd be ghossted, left on seen, it never went anywhere. In highschool I was bold enough to talk to and constantly ask out chicks because i had no fear, I would be rejectedd because they‚Äôre interetsed in another guy or they aren‚Äôt looking for anything or they‚Äôd call me ugly. Like my tall goood looking friend   tried to set me up with his ex and she just called me ulgy, and said that‚Äôs the reason. At work i‚Äôd be upfront and get the snapchat and id get flaked on or reject3d, i never caught a break. And I was a lifeguard were there were no shortage of chicks. In public like mall and target I had a high rate of getting the information except they‚Äôd not respond or give smokescreen excuses why they don ‚Äôt want to hangout. The common denominator was always my fa ce. At the end of the day I understood I didn‚Äôt have the looks or popularity to makeup for my looks which made me doomed to fail.

1808,sqdsuv,Danial__zh,"Hi, I would like to share something with you!
Some of us always trying to find a GF or BF because we may think this would fix our loneliness and our feelings.

Well I've had this thoughts at least, was alone for 21 years and for 1 year I was trying to find a girlfriend to talk to (I tried in social media)

And after trying for that, I unexpectedly became close friends with a girl in PlayStation and we were spending so much time everyday in games and talking about everything in life, laughing, sometimes saying love you in messages. (Nothing special)

After awhile it got better and better until we couldn't spend a day without each other, I doubt engaged people would spend as much time as us together, it became a very lovely friendship.

But all of this ruined after a few months because I was still feeling lonely even we loved each other and spending 6+ hours talking together daily!
Sometimes 11 hours in a day.

I won't make it longer but here's what I found:

As long as I'm not happy and okay in life if I'm alone, going in friendships won't fix that for me. 

If I wanna be happy and okay in a relationship, I should be like that before engaging. 

And there's something else...

However I'm alone now, but my loneliness was better before this friendship, because as long as I didn't experienced love, I was only sad Because of that, but once I felt it, now my loneliness hurts more.

Took months until I recovered myself

And if you are wondering, all of that friendship ruined since she didn't want it to be in real life, she said:


""I love you so much more than anyone I've ever had in my life and I never wanna lose you, that's why I don't want ever meet you in real life, ever, you can find another girl and marry and we stay friends in social and not real life""


That was when I realized something else as well, if you're going to have a friendship or relationship, try to ask and understand what's your point of having that friendship, because you may cry someday because your friend had different sight! 


Let me know about your experience?",2022-02-12 00:12:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602335447,1,/r/lonely/comments/sqdsuv/before_you_try_to_fix_loneliness_by_relationship/,,0,0,Before you try to fix loneliness by relationship...

Hey. I‚Äôve been reading posts entitled, ‚ÄúI just want a friend‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so lonely, please help.‚Äù But the creators don‚Äôt respond to messages.

I do believe that loneliness is a terrible debilitating problem. But so many here treat it like a cancer where you can complain that you‚Äôre going to die because you have it and you get to be mean and nasty to others who genuinely want to help because they don‚Äôt understand your pain.

Nope! Everyone who posts or lurks here understands what it‚Äôs like not to have friends show up at a birthday party for or not have a shoulder to cry on or to feel completely left out.

You‚Äôre not special in your loneliness. More than 40% ofUS citizens are suffering!

Once again, you‚Äôre not special but you are important.

Damn important.

We need each other to cure our own loneliness.

Stop being victims of your loneliness and do something to cure it‚Ä¶ like answer a chat message when you ask for connection. Don‚Äôt just talk about your pain but also listen.

1820,sqf17n,Ok_Understanding36,"Sat by myself. Just feeling so lonely and depressed. Listening to this guitar melody, it sounds really loving but depressing and it made me feel a certain way, heartbroken. 

A couple of things that might make sense or not:

\- 18(M)

\- Got broken up with in July 2020, still bitter and trying to move on.

\- Getting myself back into gym routine after having it disturbed with driving test (theory) stuff.

\- Feel like my belly has gotten slightly bigger, I just see it as though I'm going back rather than progressing

\- I am working 3 days of the week to try make myself more outgoing? Hasn't really worked, I feel like I'm still as quiet and awkward 

\- I produce music

I don't like how awkward I am, I can barely hold conversations, most I usually do is say' Yeah' , 'mhm' and nod. I think I'm just stupid socially and in general, my common sense isn't too great. After being broken up with, I'm scared of being in a relationship yet so desperate to be in one:

People my age, I believe a lot of them like to party and just mess people around. That and also myself, seeing how co- dependant I became with my ex, my exams almost got impacted by it but luckily wasn't, I was anxious 24/7 without talking to them, I was really unhealthy. I don't know if I can ever be loved by anyone. 

Part of my reason going to the gym was competition with my friend, seeing how close I got to his deadlift PR, I'm probably 10 kg away. The other reason was to try turn things around, more healthy physically and mentally, maybe even socially. I'm still stupidly antisocial. The saddest reason of all, I wanted to look better so that I can attract someone. I don't think I look to good.

I admit that I am pathetic, I want to die because I can't get a girlfriend.

I sometimes want to scream for help and be loved but I'm just sat with a poker face

I don't like my personality, tbh I am jealous of other people, I have a negative attitude to a lot of things, my only redeeming thing is that with most stuff, despite having a negative frowning attitude, I still get some things done. I give dirty looks to my other friend in my head when he says positive things about himself, things like, 'oh I see some more definition on my arms'. I'm just a douche bag inside, I don't like it.

1822,sqf6ok,[deleted],"I‚Äôm 16, my name is Richard. I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend but I‚Äôve wanted one as long as I can remember. 

I work out everyday, and eat well. I have a somewhat crafted body but I‚Äôm not satisfied yet. I sleep at 8pm and wake up at 4am to hit the weights because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit it in my schedule otherwise and it gives me the extra time to get ready for school. I also have the fucking Patrick Bateman face routine (it‚Äôs pretty different though) because I look up to him for his self preservation. I have a good family, though I am not close to them, they still provide me with food, shelter and luxuries.

My grades are a work in progress and I plan on retaking a few classes next year. I fall behind because I go to school hella late if I‚Äôm late with my routine simply because I value my health more than my education. 

I have many friends at school but nobody I can truly connect with. They are just there for company and most of them seem to like me. I really have nothing in common with these washed up pot heads. I don‚Äôt even smoke weed anymore, only nicotine but that‚Äôs a typical high school thing where I live and I mostly do it to fit in.

I left my actual closet friend of 7 years because he crossed me multiple times. This is a major reason as to why I‚Äôm not close with people anymore.

Now that you know enough about me, let‚Äôs get back to the I need a girlfriend part. I can‚Äôt seem to find one and I hate seeing dudes uglier than me pull. I‚Äôm a pretty decent looking guy. Nice jawline, decent facial structure overall, I got the middle part and dress like a typical skater dude (I don‚Äôt skate). I have a good physique from all the hours I‚Äôve put into dieting and working out. My major flaw is my nose. It‚Äôs pretty fucking big and I get it from my middle eastern side  (I‚Äôm have Italian half middle eastern). I hate my nose and I would go from a 6 or 7 to an 8 or 9 without it. It‚Äôs my biggest insecurity. 

I desperately need a girlfriend and I suck at flirting and talking to girls. Some girls I would date liked me for a bit but I didn‚Äôt act soon enough and I think most of them moved on.

I tried getting with a goth looking chick a while ago but her rejecting my balls made me even more insane. Probably even more insane than her schizophrenic ass. She isn‚Äôt even that pretty but I guess I was in the mood for a goth gf cuz they bad asf.

I‚Äôm feel so lonely and I just want a meaningful relationship with someone special.",2022-02-12 01:20:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/sqf6ok/i_need_a_girlfriend/,,0,0,I need a girlfriend

I wanted to come home to someone and see their face, talk to them, hold them, ask about their day or plan a fun day together. 
But it doesn't matter If you are smart, pretty, funny, fit, normal.

But I realized, love doesn't exist anymore like it use to. People so easily dispose other people, they go on apps and find someone new for causual dating or hooks ups now. People don't want simple  cute dates or just to spend time anymore. 
People want accessible, easy, convenient to help their needs and urges. 
No love involved anymore. People don't value or want kind, warm hearted People anymore it's outdated now. 
Relationships are meaningless and no longer needed. No one doesn't do that anymore.

I learned that love is pain, people just want to physically/mentally abuse others or scam them and waste your time by exploiting your vulnerabilities. 
There's nothing to love anymore, people just settle for anything, it's mostly lust and friendship, nuy no actually love. It's been an illusion to believe you are wanted and make more kids to bring in the world.

And people say ""you'll find someone,"" or 
""There's plenty of fish,"" 
Is like saying, ""there's food in the fridge, but nothing to eat,"" or telling a homeless person, ""there's plenty of houses,"" they don't understand, dating was easy to them.

I will be alone, even surrounded with people I'm still alone and should just accept my loneliness, be a hermit I was destined to be.

It crushes my heart everytime I think about.
Like a painful ache just squeezing it. My heart just doesn't  want to accept that reality. My heart wants to connect, feel loved and care for, but it doesn't understand  that people don't do that anymore. People want to abuse or hurt us
No one wants us

No other heart beat to lay next to or listen too. That warmth we crave so much, doesn't exist anymore in this cold world. There's no other fire to be next too. 

I wish I was loved by someone, get married one day, build a family, been patient, but those values are no longer wanted and old to think that way.
No one can be kind. It's all hard as rocks that breaks windows.

1856,sqj6et,Careless_Jaguar8008,"17m here on a throwaway account. I posted this on r/self a while ago but I been feeling sad again recently and want opinions on this


I was born premature and was diagnosed with autism from a young age. Didn't have much friends during childhood. During my pre-teen years when I first had access to the internet I decided that people irl sucked and met people online who I can call friends. Because of this I rarely made effort to make friends irl. This wasn't really a problem for me though, I spent almost all my teenage years with no irl friends, until a few months ago. 


At the first day of this year I had a long distance relationships of 8 months end. From then until now I had a number of friendships, i think I can count with 7 people, some were platonic, that didn't last long due to them being fake friends. 2 of which hurt me the most. The first person sent a message saying that we can't be friends anymore for some reason I'm still baffled about to this day and blocked me. The second (I'm still not over this one) started to become less active in our relationship and in the end didn't want me around anymore. Because of these bad experiences it's hard for me to trust anyone and I believed that even if I do get another relationship they would just dump me again for whatever reason. I also have clinical depression lasting almost 6 years and these people made me happy for a bit. I have been really sad lately because of how lonely I am, I do have (online) friends but they aren't close friends like those people were. I have no one to call best friend, to talk to everyday, etc. I feel so pathetic.

1911,sqq4cs,coffee-cactus,"Some days have been easier than others and some days have been really hard. That‚Äôs what anyone says. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm becoming emotionally numb or just becoming the hyper-independent girl I was before you. The girl who kept everything to herself, didn‚Äôt allow herself to be vulnerable and express herself to anyone, and just accepted being alone. 

It becomes numbing when you don‚Äôt really have anyone you want to talk to and do stuff with. To look forward to talking to and cherish their good morning messages or that they took the time to leave a voice mail because you fell asleep before they could call. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair when so many people take that for granted, when I‚Äôve been here for going on two years and only have myself. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel fair, but so many things in my life hasn‚Äôt been fair and just feels like another part of the shitty hand I‚Äôve been dealt. A hand that I just have to deal with it because it‚Äôs my life. How many twenty year olds get up go to work, come home, don‚Äôt talk to anyone, maybe eat, maybe try to do something they kinda enjoy, but mainly just sleep or consider drinking because then they don‚Äôt have to feel anything or try to feel something? How many don‚Äôt even want to try making friends anymore because all you have been is sexualized, heartbroken, abused, and traumatized? When it doesn‚Äôt feel like living anymore and just like trying to be an adult losing all the things you looked forward to and hoped of. When your life has become trying to exist instead of thinking about places you want to go, things you want to do, goals you have, wanting to be happy. But instead trying to ignore the thoughts of wondering if I‚Äôll ever genuinely be happy again or am I just trying my best to exist. To fight away the thoughts of if I‚Äôm meant to be completely alone. Without a family. Without friends. Without love. To fight away the thoughts of wondering if it would make a difference if I was here or not, that any of my effort is actually changing anything, or if my existence is more pain than it‚Äôs worth. 

Being told your young and have time, but your entire life has felt like you never had youth and already feel like you‚Äôve lost so much. Feeling naive because at one point you were happy and your smiles were genuine and not a coverup of all the pain you held inside. Once hopeful eyes that took pain as strength and thought better days would be along the line. That moving out would finally let you start to heal from the abuse you‚Äôve known your whole life. Feeling that you were naive to think that things would actually get better for you. Feeling you are at fault for ruining that one thing that gave you hope that gave you lightness instead of the black void you feel inside everyday. I‚Äôm logical. I know there is nothing I can say or even offer the world to you that would change your mind. I know that yet this suffocating feeling of wanting that happiness, that love, that care you once felt for one person that they felt for you. 

No matter how you try to distract yourself, it‚Äôs crawls in the crevices of your mind always shadowing your thoughts until those nights were the little grey cloud you‚Äôve been shewing away starts pouring. Filling your mind till you‚Äôre drowning and no amounts of self care and therapy can silence the voice of wanting to sink under the bath water. To succumb to the seductive voice in your head telling you to let your lungs let out your final breathe as the once warm bath water turns cold. To tongue kiss death as the fear of it sheds each day as a succubus flirts with its fresh prey. 

The looming reminder of them and the fact that it feels like they have forgotten about you and that all that was invested meant nothing. That they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth to a degree which you understand. You know you shouldn‚Äôt, but you still love them. You still care and wondering if they are eating, and sleeping okay. Wonder if they are happy and doing well and hopefully less stressed out. Wonder if they think about how you felt under their finger tips. The way you fell asleep in their arms. The way that you were so vulnerable and trusting. And no matter how stupid you know it is and the facts can prove yourself wrong. Yet you wonder if they still love you. . .

I tried writing down what I‚Äôve been feeling and thinking I‚Äôm hope of possibly feeling better, but I just feel more empty and broken. I‚Äôve been going to therapy and trying my best to get better, but each day I feel more numb to the world. I‚Äôm tired of hearing that things will get better in time, but with how much I‚Äôve been through it doesn‚Äôt feel like it. Am I just bound to this reality? 

PS: I know the grammar and flow of this is probably shit, but that wasn‚Äôt the focus as stated previously. I apologize if that caused any frustration or irritation. Also, those who might be confused, the ‚ÄúYou‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to is my ex-boyfriend. I‚Äôm sorry this is super long, but again trying to put words to my thoughts and feelings. . .

I‚Äôve written a paragraph to introduce myself and 85% of the time no one answers out of the probably 150 people I‚Äôve tried to start a friendship with. 

I could go on a rant, but life is so short. My family has dealt with sicknesses since Christmas, my family then after getting the flu got COVID and I have been taking care of them since together. 

Recently my dog passed away,  and I just don‚Äôt know. He was my baby boy and he had the best life he could have ever had, and I‚Äôll see him in heaven with much of my family when it‚Äôs time. It will take time but I know I will get through this. 


I‚Äôm just tired and want someone to talk to. I‚Äôm tired of trying to reach out so often- I just want some good and mature friends. No games or bots or stuff, just realistic people. If I don‚Äôt reply I am sorry as this has been a very difficult year, but I will try my best. 

Here is a post from last time as I just can‚Äôt type this all over again- thank you and love you all. 

‚Äî-
M23, Currently beginning my legal education! 

I‚Äôm looking for some friends to talk to, I have had some success but I wanted to try more to see if that works out. 

Notes: 
Please be 18+, have a bit of a seasoned account(as in you didn‚Äôt make it in the last week), and be ready for any intellectual conversations. Please know I don‚Äôt flirt, nor do I want a relationship right now. The most I got, and enjoy, and my dumb jokes lol. 


Extra: 
I‚Äôm dry at first, until I find a topic I know rather well. Nonetheless, I will do my best, and celebrate your own interests as well, as that‚Äôs what friends are for.

Concerning my hobbies, I have 5 garden beds I take care of, I used to do historical research (Roman, US, US Feminism, US Racial History, some East Asian) and I enjoy it a lot. I‚Äôm pretty glad to have book recommendations as well, since I tend to ready about these topics. If you want to LEARN, I am more than happy to help you and provide books to recommend. 

I play trumpet, sing, and a little piano and guitar. I‚Äôm wanting to get a new guitar though for Christmas since it always sounds out of tune haha. Then I also do hiking when I can, camping, and cooking/baking. If you wanna learn trumpet I can do that too for fun. 


If that sounds good, feel free to message me!",2022-02-12 19:55:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1492605518,2,/r/lonely/comments/sqzqkw/making_friends_after_a_rough_year/,,0,0,Making friends after a rough year
1967,sr03lz,ladylavenderrrr,"So, I'm a mom. I raise my almost 4 year old son alone and his little brother lives with their dad. I'm in college trying to get a degree so I'm not working at the moment and barely have time to myself in between raising a kid alone and being in school. I have all A's. Not that it means much, but I'm proud of it.

I had this weekend to myself because both boys are with their dad. I saw a party being advertised on Instagram all week so I decided to go, but couldn't find anyone to go with. It was a costume party, so I tried to dress up with whatever I had in my closet and ended up looking really cute/cool! I thought for sure I look cool enough for these people. The party was in New Orleans and it was basically like a rave/costume party. I ended up going alone, which I didn't want, but I really didn't wanna sit inside alone doing algebra lmao.

I was super nervous and had almost a panic attack in my car before getting out to go in to the party. Idk why. I physically fit in with these people but still felt so out of place. I just don't really socialize with many people anymore and mainly hang out with just my kid. I don't even talk to people at school. Anyway, so I go in, the party was just starting so there wasn't many people there yet. I got a drink, smoked a cigarette or two cuz I was so nervous, and tried to dance a lil bit. By myself lol. 

I did this basically all night, and ended up with a headache from all the cigarettes and liquor. I tried to start conversations with a couple groups of people and failed miserably. There were two dudes talking about old violins and I chimed in, respectively of course, saying ""oh yall talking about violins? I have a super old one too, it's from the 1920s"". They were just like ""oh cool"" and stopped talking to me. It's like I tried to relate, wasn't rude about cutting in to their convo, but still my energy wasn't reciprocated. Also, a friend, ""friend"", I've known since high school was there and didn't even acknowledge me when I said hey. I mean, they said hey but that was basically like it. Also another dude I traveled with years ago was there. Talked to me for 2 secs and dipped. I guess I'm just not understanding why people don't like me or want to talk to me. Also this dude, one of the ones talking about the violins, was staring at me when I first got there. I previously matched with him on tinder months ago but never talked to him. He would look at me throughout the night but not talk to me. Maybe I'm missing social cues/hints? The only time someone talked to me was to ask if I knew where to get blow. Lmao.

I spent the whole night alone, dancing with people but not really with people, yknow? Also basically everyone there was doing blow and im not interested in hard drugs anymore. I left around 4 am after giving up on meeting anyone interested in talking to me. Like I said, I fit in physically, I looked the part, but still wasn't ""cool"" enough for anyone to talk to me. I guess I should accept I'm just a mom now and don't fit in with anyone who isn't also a parent. I hate that tho, because I have a whole personality outside of being a mom. Anyway.

I don't sit on Apps/Discords to just meet people. Most of the time they can't even have a proper conversation that goes both ways.

this is maybe a very uncommon topic but since months and years I want to be hugged from beautiful girls. Also I have dreams where I have an accident and someone helps me and is there for me.. Also I cry a lot in my dreams then, I even think sometimes what is if I'm dead. These kind of dreams began I can remember when I was about 10 years old.

Anyway, do you have the same dreams or are yours more positive, is this normal what I dream or a sign of depression?
So the thing is that I would like to have a girlfriend and friends because I have no one, maybe it is a sign of loneliness?

I like to cry in my dreams and I like to play the victim but isn't it unprofitable when I want friends/a girlfriend because no one likes victims?
I feel like something is wrong with my wellbeing.

2029,sr6u4o,Dipesh1990,"I think the easiest way to overcome our problems is by focusing on something greater than ourselves, like helping others or taking care of the planet.

A lot of the time when we try to do this we get burnt out and start to suffer, and I feel like that is because we have this expectation from others. In my experience if there is no expectations from other people than there's not much suffering. If we keep helping others then that helpful energy will come back to us, and help us when we need it.

We are always caught up in our own problems and what we will get out of the situation. And I think that's the root cause of the problem. We shouldn't be focusing on ourselves all the time, there's a need to take care of our body and mind, but not to constantly worry about yesterday and tomorrow. There's a need for a long term plan to get ourselves out of the hole we have dug ourselves into.

2039,sr7z3d,LonleyUser,"This is me just venting cause i need to get it off my chest. Feel free to look at TLDR 

I used to be really close with someone when I was in high-school. Probably the only person I really felt myself with even though I only knew them for a short time. Their family moved quite a bit and they were gone by the end of the year. We kept in touch in the beginning. Things eventually got quiet.

It's been maybe 7ish years since then and I'm a pretty lonely dude. I'm not sure if I can be considered *truly* alone cause I have people I'm friendly with, but I still feel pretty insignificant to my peers. I'm the quintessential ""extra friend"". I'd always be the one to keep the conversation going and text first, etc. When I stopped doing that (as an experiment to see what would happen), things were quiet on all fronts. The only people who actively contact me is family and scammers. It's honestly painful.

The only reason I got a social media was see what people were up to cause I'd be totally in the dark if I didn't. Sometimes I get fed up and delete the app only to come crawling back to it. It's bittersweet seeing people make new friends and have new relationships. They make it seem *so easy*. I literally can't comprehend how people can make close friends and open up so easily. 

**Cutting to the chase:** I found the profile of the old friend who moved away. They look like they're having a great time with the crowd they've settled into. Old memories hit me and I tried reaching out to them. I only get one word answers or nothing in return. I tried reaching out a few more times before I recognized that I was rekindling ""extra friend"" habits I promised to stop for my own sanity and mental health. 

I've always thought the people featured on r/niceguys were super clueless for not taking a hint when people didn't want to speak with them. I nearly broke in half when I realized that my old friend didn't want to speak to me. Silence *was* their response. I realized that they didn't want *me* in their lives and that was that. I tell myself that if my peers cared about me, I wouldn't need to beg them to talk to me. I cried a good 30mins last night when I realized it applied to them too. I don't think I've ever felt so foolish and insignificant before...

And yet, we're still ""friendly"" on social media (and it makes me feel like an idiot). I get unreasonably excited whenever they post on instagram. I like their photos but don't comment because I don't want to seem too intrusive  (I understand they'd rather not speak to me). I only keep my snapchat because they actively look at my private stories. They wished me a happy birthday recently...something they haven't done in *years*. 

That's the extent of our contact, though. The worst part is that I pathetically look *forward to it* (like an idiot). It's like they're ""there"" but not really, I guess. I'm mentally aware that I need to stop and get some self-respect. I think that my emotions just need to catch up...

If you all read this far, thanks. I'm glad I got that all out.

TLDR: Tried reaching out to a friend and nearly broke when I realized that they didn't want me in their lives anymore. We're ""friendly"" on social media, but that's the extent of our contact.

2056,sr9w3l,TerminalCorrosion,"Hi there.

As the title states, I'm almost 30, without a single friend, and at this point, my family is completely exhausted from all of the bullshit I've caused.
I don't know what to do. I never learned how to act in social situations.. and even if I did know what to do, where would I go to meet people? Who would want to meet a person like me anyway?

I'm bipolar 1, so this state of mind will probably pass in a few days. I'll either go down deeper, or up to the highest high's again. And I'm just so goddamn tired of this endless roller coaster. I wish I was normal. I wish I was friendly. I wish I was nice, and kind, and generous with my heart... but I've beaten myself down so much over the years, I don't even know how to love anymore. I don't love myself. If not even I can love myself, why would anyone else? If I can't love myself, how could I ever love another? Romantic or no.

I feel trapped in this life. Trapped in this mind. This broken, garbage brain of mine. I wish I could restart, in a new body, with a better head on its shoulders. 

I've burned every bridge I've ever built. At this point, I'm unemployed, living at home with parents that rightfully want me gone.. I mean, I'm almost 30 for God's sake. As I said earlier, got no friends, no one to talk to, no health insurance, so no therapist or psychiatrist to go see. That being said, I've already tried therapy. I've already tried countless medications. Therapy may have helped, if I could have afforded to continue treatment... Medications never did, either made things worse, or completely dulled me, took what little of myself I actually kind of like away. 

I don't know.

Why the fuck am I even posting this? What will this solve? Other than a brief conversation with a complete stranger, in which they tell me *""Everything will be alright, just hang in there.""* This seems like just another in a long line of completely pointless efforts. 

I just want to lay my head down, close my eyes, and wake up a different man.

I am so, so very tired of this life I've made for myself.

Hope whoever reads this is in a much better spot than I am, and if not... *Everything will be alright, just hang in there.*",2022-02-13 04:18:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1528436081,2,/r/lonely/comments/sr9w3l/almost_30_completely_alone/,,0,4,"Almost 30, completely alone."

Now it‚Äôs sad pulling into my driveway seeing my house that I had all these beautiful dreams to be made and they are all gone.
And my financial situation plus ties to the family property has me stuck. Living in a place with so many bad memories.

Then I decided to turn to the internet I felt there is so many people that I should find someone to talk to. 
Well that has left me feeling worse than ever because after a year of reaching out in different ways I‚Äôve still found no friends or connection üòû

That all of a sudden hit me very sad because honestly I was just going to sleep all day not touch my phone or a single thing. And just avoid the day so I‚Äôm not feeling like I‚Äôm missing out or whatever that feeling is being alone on holiday.

2078,srcisz,[deleted],"A lot of people say that in order to love yourself, it must come from within. That is, you must learn to love yourself first before anyone.

Truthfully, I think that's a lie.

Instead, I think that if someone were to love me enough - like, sacrificing the most colorful, violent parts of life to stay close to me - I may just be convinced enough to love myself.

Maybe if I can see someone loving me first - holding me like I'm the most fragile object in the universe, loving me like they were hungry for it for a thousand years - I may be moved just enough to see myself painted in a new light.

Instead, I feel like a ghost. Ghost made flesh that floats around everyday with no purpose, no significance, empty, cold, and invisible. I feel unimportant.

If I died, I truly believe the event would go unnoticed: the world will keep moving forward; my existence will be like a silent whisper - went as fast as it came. Un-heard and forgotten. No one will try to trace me back to humanity. I was just a thing made and destroyed. Same as everything else.

This isn't to say I need my name in the index of a history textbook to feel *something*, but it is to say I wish someone would be able to know me better than my self.

That is, if I were to die, if they could, they'll take all the dust of my body and mold it back into the shape of me, breathe life back into something undone just because they understood the warmness of my body better than I did, remembered every curve and pore of my skin, and loved me so tightly I was something that could be rebuilt again and again - in memory and in soul.

I want to live in someone's head. Reality is haunted by my presence. They find me in the spine of a poetry book, the crackle when the egg hits the pan, or the smell of fresh rain after Spring.

I want to be made human - every part of me real and alive and pulsing in someone's head - my laughter that haunts them in their sleep, the shy glances they steal to look at me, and my smile forever made tarnished in the backrooms of their mind.

I want them to hurt for me. Feel their heart crunch when they see me cry. Rope moons and jump rivers, dry oceans and drown desserts, if it meant me being okay. If it meant I could pay them back another smile. I want them to catch the world in the bareness of their hands, skin their heart alive to say ""Here, here, this is what I have for you. Take all of me and run with it. ""

And I would do the same for them. I would unapologetically bleed myself if it meant I could feel their pulse again. Love them like their blood was something that could be spinned Gold. Wrestle Demons or Angels. Love them like it was the last thing I knew. Love them like it was obligated, sacred, a religion I devote myself to. Love them, love them, love them.

And so when the world ends and all bones are crushed powder, bodies left like empty sacks of swollen tissue - I am still alive. They are still alive. And we are both someone pulsing, human, and made important.",2022-02-13 06:53:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,,114,/r/lonely/comments/srcisz/i_wish_i_was_important_to_someone/,,0,18,I wish I was important to someone.

Yesterday, when I was at work, I got a message from friend from school, if I wanted to grab a beer that evening. I got excited because I haven't seen him in 3 years and he said there would be few other guys coming. I was extatic.

I got there and in short time there were all 5 of us, drinking, reminiscing about past. Telling each other what we've been up to, about girlfriends, achievements, stories. I mostly just sat there and listened, shared about my career, hobbies, you know, not much. Still, it was a great time.

But then arrived 6 shots. One for each of us. With one extra. Another friend lost... due to stupid accident just few days ago. We haven't seen each other in 3 years and didn't talk for 2 but it fucking broke me, especially because I lost another, close friend not month ago to a suicide. We then sat there in quiet. Talking about him, how ot happened, how he lived, but I had to leave, because I had to go to work.

2092,srdzhu,MispastedNose,"Around the time I turned twenty I joined the military. At the time I was glad to get away from my hometown.

The issue is, I don't fit in with the other guys at work. It's especially frustrating because I've spent so much time with them. We've even been deployed together. But, for whatever reason, they don't seem to include me as part of the group. It's partially my fault I know, because what was initially awkwardness and anxiety has become anger and spite. Sometimes I can fight it down to try to show a good face, but either way I'm always left sitting in my barracks on the weekends. I hope it will go away with time, but it's been over a year now.

I realize this is partially my fault. I could ask someone to spend time with me. Maybe part of my problem is that I'm afraid of rejection. But more than that, I don't believe I'm the sort of person people want to hangout with. I'm not funny or entertaining. Asking someone to spend time with me is taxing, I feel like I'm wasting their time. 

Perhaps my loneliness is created by my own low self esteem?

It hurts when new dudes show up, and they seem to fit in so quickly. They spend time with the guys, going out to bars, getting drunk, going on hikes, grilling. What do I need to do to get included?

You might ask- why don't I try to find friends outside the military? That's honestly a great idea. But I have no idea where to start. Due to my occupation, I'm in a place where I know nobody except for the people I work with. I'm feel trapped.

2098,srf128,ApexIsPain_TA,"Last week a coworker asked to take my Saturday shift so he could go on a date with his girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I knew I had nowhere better to be and I could use Saturday to get midterm prep done. Today I was called into work last minute because the manager had a family medical emergency (which is understandable) but when I asked to have V-day covered by someone else (I don‚Äôt work weekdays much, again I‚Äôm a college student) he said that everyone else at our brewery has plans and called Monday off, instead I‚Äôll be given extra time off in the following weeks. Later in the shift, a different coworker came by as a customer with his girlfriend for a Valentine‚Äôs date at a nearby restaurant, so even in terms of having to cover for the manager I was the only one who could because I am single.

I‚Äôm not a virgin, but I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, let alone a second date. All my sexual relations with other people (one of the women I‚Äôve hooked up with now identifies as non-binary so even though I‚Äôm straight I‚Äôm including them) have been one night stands. I heard through friends that a girl I hooked up with in the past was telling people I was good in bed, which was a nice confidence booster since my love life has been dry this pandemic, but still I‚Äôve accepted my position as a male butterface. Another friend compared my sex life to Little Caesar‚Äôs pizza: not at the top of anyone‚Äôs list but I‚Äôm cheap, easy and get the job done. And honestly at this point it‚Äôs not even about sex: the last time I cuddled with someone else is twice as long ago as the last time I‚Äôve had sex.

Being permanently single has always been a sore spot for me. While all my friends used the pandemic as an opportunity to get into relationships instead of hooking up, I haven‚Äôt had such luck. Whenever they were going on dates and claimed they were busy, I‚Äôd distract myself from the crushing loneliness by playing video games, watching TV, reading a book or lurk this subreddit. However, being singled out at work for being single has stung me harder than any of the FOMO I‚Äôve experienced this pandemic. I love my job and my coworkers, and we‚Äôre not expecting a busy V-Day because breweries aren‚Äôt the ideal Valentine‚Äôs date location. But now I‚Äôm working a night of the week I‚Äôm never scheduled, and I‚Äôm basically going to spend it getting drunk from the host stand watching couples pass by my work in favor of the hip wine bar and expensive Italian restaurant next door.

I know that some of the qualifications to my experience are far better experiences than the loneliness others experience on this subreddit. I‚Äôm just astonished by the consideration of ‚Äúrelationship status‚Äù in the scheduling of my job this week and I was wondering if anyone else was dealing with this, especially outside the service industry.",2022-02-13 09:37:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619114752,2,/r/lonely/comments/srf128/fairly_certain_i_was_asked_to_work_valentines_day/,,1,1,Fairly certain I was asked to work Valentine‚Äôs Day because I‚Äôm the only bartender at my work without a boyfriend/girlfriend.

I want to introduce myself. I‚Äôm 36 year old bloke from Finland. I have few short relationships behind me. Last one was 2009. Since 2010 I‚Äôve been living with my dog. My dog whose liver is now expanded and it might be liver cancer. I‚Äôve been crying since Tuesday when that came around. My dog  is 11 years and 10 months old so not a young dog anymore. 

I can feel the loneliness already. I‚Äôve been thinking how my life‚Äô will be when I don‚Äôt have that dog anymore. At the moment I can‚Äôt think about it. The empty house, the empty sleeping spots. Everything. 

I‚Äôve lost my sleep and my appetite. Even though my dog is still active and alive I‚Äôve been pre-grieving already. 

It‚Äôs been over 10 years since any relatives have died so I‚Äôve been blessed with constant and stable life for long time. 

It hurts like hell and worst is that he is my only real friend and after he‚Äôs gone, my apartment will be so empty and silent. I‚Äôm sure you understand. Just last weekend was joyful and we didn‚Äôt know nothing about his liver. This shows how quickly everything can turn around. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure writing to someone helps even though face to face might be better way to get help but it is what it is. 

Is there anyone who lived the same kind of situation like me? Have dog, is lonely and your dog is getting sick and is about to die sooner or later.

COVID has also played a role as its been hard to meet people. I have depression which tends to outweigh my logical side, though. Even with my therapist and others talking me down I can't help feeling like something is wrong with me and that mysterious something is why guys don't wanna be with me.

It doesn't help when people act shocked that I have yet to be in a relationship. It makes me feel immature or inadequate in a way. They ask why and it makes me want to burst into tears because it hasn't been by choice. I've always been rejected or led on or used for sex. It's so hard to want to put yourself out there when you have low self esteem, bad experiences, and just assume nothing is gonna work out. But nothing will change if I don't.

So I, 19 F, just moved to DE from South Jersey and I‚Äôve been here for a couple months now. I‚Äôve been trying to make friends around here because it‚Äôs felt pretty isolating moving and not really having a community to automatically find people in. I‚Äôve tried at work and at the gym, but honestly I‚Äôve never been very good at it because I never had to try. I moved a lot growing up and in school and everyone wanted to be the first friend of the new kid. I know DE is a pretty tight knit community, I‚Äôm familiar with the area (more so around Rehoboth) so I expected difficulty, but I don‚Äôt have many other options to be able to reach out to people. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm in the Middletown area (I don‚Äôt want to get too personal on here because creeps exist) and I would be cool to talk with anyone who reached out to me. I‚Äôm only looking for platonic friendships. My IG is k.at.la.v 

A little bit about me: I literally enjoy almost anything. I love all things psychology/neurology related and I‚Äôm also an aspiring writer. I read a lot, I like the outdoors and love to go on adventures. Whether that be road trips or just checking out random local places.

2196,srsip6,daydreamingoften,"(I will post this on every lonely/sad/in your feelings Reddit page until someone replies since no one replies to me anymore üòÖ) 

I just ended a 5 year friendship with my best friend, OVER A DAMN BOY. 
In the past i managed to get my ex friend a boyfriend. I felt bad for her because she was fresh out of a break up and whenever she isn't in a relationship she turns into a whore and has sex with any male available, I pitied her and was scared for her. I thought I was doing the right thing. 

I regret my decision of helping her so much. 
My friendship was a trio kind of thing, three best friends. No one was left out and it was a good strong bond. Then she stopped talking to us, we informed her multiple times, talking to her, coming over to talk and seeing what we can do about the situation to make it better. At times it worked and she apologised saying that she's in her honeymoon phase blah blah. 
We forgave. 
Recently she sent me a hostile message asking if I don't wanna be her friend anymore blah blah after she realised that I wasn't really talking to her anymore, I chilled when talking to her because she made empty promises and claiming that she was busy at work but then i would see her snap and tiktoks of her posting her and her bf. Why should i talk to someone which is just gonna lie? 
I tried explaining to her again why I'm not really talking to her and she got so defensive about it and i was thinking wth. 
Then when i said my side she just didn't reply to my message but read it, what a sneaky bitch. 
I find it crazy how a guy managed to change her just like that, she's had many boyfriends in the past but didn't act this weird. I've always told her that my old friends from secondary left me for their boyfriend's because they thought I was jealous because I didn't have one, no it's not even like that they barely spoke to me and when i brought it up it was viewed as me being jealous. 
She said that she would never be like that because ""bROs beForE hOeS"" üôÑ
Now she admits that she feels like she's pushing us away subconsciously but she doesn't know why she's doing that, probably because her relationship is going well so far but I wish the worst for her. 
She knows that in the 3 way friendship we only have each other and we've been fighting for the friendship but she doesn't care because she has her boyfriend and has actively shown that she doesn't give a f. 
I actually hate people like that, how could you just forget about you're friends, I find it so damn weird. 
Maybe because I've neve been in a relationship myself but she definitely doesn't deserve to be inthe perfect relationship after she's cheated and manipulated men, I regret helping her so much. Now I feel so lonely because I don't have many friends in general and most of them are in relationships anyway lol. 
I genuinely get that there will be changes once you get into a Relationship but I just don't get how someone could just change within a heartbeat.

No matter the amount of events I go to, the hobbies I pursue, the hundreds of different beautiful ( and sometimes not ) people I meet, the story always ends the same way. It is me crying myself to sleep alone in my bed. And I can tell that so many people around feel the same.

I've always considered myself quite the reasonable person, I try to be more logical than emotional where I can be, but sometimes its so overwhelming. No amount of logic can change the fundamental beliefs that I'm just worthless. To my core, I believe that I need putting down. I honestly believe that I have no place in this world and there is no hope in it either. I've seen therapists and I've had medication in the past, but all I've learned is that it's better for everyone else if I just repress, repress, repress, and act without emotion.

So I spend my days pretending to be happy for the sake of others, and people like the me that they get, whilst constantly thinking about how to kill myself. Even considering the idea of biting my tongue out so I can choke on it. Sometimes, it all just gets too much and I can't keep it in. I meltdown, so I stay at home and create new scars as the pain is a better thing to focus on. An endless loop, as I hate the scars too. I hate it all and I honestly just do not want to be here. And it's that feeling of loneliness that digs deeper than anything else. I don't even have a right to feel this way, but here I am. However, I've managed this far, this way. Just gotta chin up and keep it going, right?

I got out of a 6 year relationship because my ex girlfriend was emotionally abusive, controlling and horrible towards me. She made me give up friendships by planting twisted thoughts in my head etc.. Anyway I became friendless and my whole focus was her. 
I work security, so a lot of my time is sat in my car or a building/cabin at night so little human contact. 
I did however manage to meet this girl, and she came into my life hard, and changed everything for me. I was single but not ready for another relationship, or anything romantic, but she was beautiful, persistent, incredible and made me feel valued, wanted, respected and loved. 
I fell for her hard and we started ‚Äúseeing‚Äù. 
I have a beautiful son with my ex, so because of this, we both agreed not to jump into a full relationship straight away because things with my ex are bad and we didn‚Äôt want anything to fuel that fire. 
This girl made us swear to each other that even though we aren‚Äôt official, we were each others. 
Things started and we became closer and closer, spending as much time together as we could, booking hotels to spend the night together, she even dropped the ‚ÄúL bomb‚Äù. 
She would say everything that made me feel incredible, even stating that she wanted to be involved with my son when the time was right, planning out trips we could all do together etc. 
As we got closer, I started opening up about how I have no friends, my home life isn‚Äôt great and about my mental health issues (fully expecting her to her turn and run) but she stayed, and explained none of that mattered, she was there for me, to support me and love me, and would help me get friends too. 
More time passed and life was good, I made friends with her friends, I started being social and enjoying things and then it stopped. 
She told me she needed time to herself because of a loss in the family, which of course I agreed because of the situation. 
I spent the next two weeks not seeing her, but checking on her everyday.
Her replies got slower and slower until she eventually just didn‚Äôt reply.
It turned out she met someone else and was sleeping with him while I was sitting at home worried about her mental state. 
All of her friends supported her choice and now I‚Äôm alone again, but it‚Äôs worse this time.

2252,sryprp,LonleyUser,"I feel like I'm stuck outside of it. 

Everyone else can pop the bubble pretty easily, but whenever I try to do it, I can barely make a dent into the bubble. I've spent so much time outside of the bubble that I've convinced myself that I'm okay with being alone. I've given up on trying to penetrate the bubble.

But sometimes I get so desperate that I run head first into the bubble, only to find that it's not in the same spot it was before. It's hard to know when to enter into social relationships because they're always moving. It's another quality of the social bubble that I find overwhelming: not only is it hard to penetrate, but it's also hard to find. I feel stuck in time until I see the bubble again. 

Despite what *everyone* says (e.g. ""you'll find your people! It comes when you least expect it too!"" or ""there's someone for everyone!""), entering into the bubble, let alone finding it, is *not guaranteed.* I could very well end up never having penetrated the bubble in my lifetime. I could live and die without even knowing where the bubble was or who was inside of it...it's terrifying, but it's the truth....

I have a complicated relationship with the social bubble. I don't mind being stuck outside of it most times...I don't want to stay outside *forever*. I don't like being alone as much as I am. I don't want to feel like an ""extra friend"" who's expendable anymore. I don't want to live and die without being in the bubble long enough to develop meaningful relationships with people.

I cuddle with a stuffed animal/ pillow and listen to a recording of someone ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù when trying to fall asleep. I also watch videos of online personalities and kind of subconsciously pretend they‚Äôre my friends even though I know they are not, but it feels nice since I never talk to anyone most days. I also daydream a lot and make up fake scenarios and people to talk to. I also like to sometimes play video games with characters and a plot line for escapism. I‚Äôll live my life through the character, but recently I‚Äôve been a bit too exhausted for the emotional rollercoasters that would cause. I recently remembered a tik tok I saw a long time ago that said that if you cross your arms when holding the lower half of your head, it feels almost like someone else is holding your head. I also sometimes uses men‚Äôs cologne just to feel like someone else has been in my room (just for context, I didn‚Äôt buy the cologne lol, it was a gift and so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with it other than this).

I had a girlfriend in high school, someone I had fallen in love a year prior before asking her out, for a day. She broke up with me and I bawled my eyes out. The day when she said yes and that she loved me too was the happiest I've ever been and I felt motivated to do things. I have ADHD so its a bit of a struggle to be motivated and continue with things. The next day was the worst day of my life. She gave me an excuse saying her mother didn't want her to date. I tried to laugh it off, so badly. I was going to wait for her. Almost a month later my friend told me that the girl i loved was lesbian. I didn't believe him until i saw it for myself. There was no sorry from her i never really cared about that anyways. We are still best friends today and she is one of the few people i can really open up to have have understand me. However, it messed me up. I go through a cycle of emotion and apathy. Covid hasnt helped at all. Its getting worse every time even just by a bit. I know falling in love can help me break the cycle by experience, but one didn't want to date and one had a boyfriend already.

2373,ssdna7,PassiveVoidResident,"TL:DR - I have no problems with having no friends, however I get lonelier the more I try to make friends. Question at the end. 

I have no one in real life who I would call a 'friend' and this is because of my idea of friendships. I have 2 friends online who are both living in other countries.

I recently joined a discord group made by a club of sorts from our school, at first it was just to mess around and see how the place was, but recently I have liked how close everyone seems and I have been trying to get into conversations or just invite people to play games with me, however no one seems interested. - It seems like the more I try to make friends with people the lonelier I feel. 

Prior to this I felt neutral/happy, my problem has never been not having friends, but it has been not getting the feelings of a friendship from the people I have these relations with; I don't feel cared about as much as I care about them.

Obviously I feel lonely every now and then, but it mostly happens when I am trying to make friends as I have been doing recently, it seems like when I don't have any friends I feel completely okay.

I did an experiment of sorts and I deleted all my social media and cut contact with all online friends for  a couple months, and those were the most educational and healthy times of my past few years. I developed some healthy habits and self-care and self-love however I stopped those once I reconnected with the online friends.

- I lost the love of my life. We dated for 2 years and she was my only friends. Last month she decided she just didn't want me anymore.

I have no friends.
I have no family to speak to
I can't go out because I'm really poor
I don't feel good because I don't like my body
I overthink everything, everything
Im insecure. Very insecure.
I can't trust anyone. Everyone I got close to either left or cheated on me.
I have horrible anxiety.

I'm running out of options.
Today, I called anxiety and suicide hotlines just so I could speak to someone but no one picked up.

I miss my ex girlfriend alot. We spoke today but it was only because I wanted to know why she broke up with me - it was because I was insecure and she didn't want a future with someone like me.

How do I stop crying and overthinking. Why is she so happy without me. What's wrong with me. Why can't I be happy. Why did she leave me. Why am I so insecure. Why do I overthink and kill my happiness like that. 

Why can't I change.

I moved far away from home for college, so I feel far from friends from my home town and family and I have made friends here like close friends but honestly sometimes it feels like no one really cares 
about me. Which I know isn't the case but honestly that's how it feels sometimes. Like everyone will be out with friends and I'll be alone. Don't get me wrong I get invited places but you know when you just sense that your the third wheel... Yeah that's how I feel a lot of the time. Recently my best friend has been romantically talking to a girl and I'm happy for him but at the time I can't help but feel a little bit jealous of this girl because it feels like I'm being replaced or pushed aside. I forgot to mention I live with this guy and another girl I thought who I thought was my  friend. Anyway, if I don't go to that guy friend's room we won't see each other and when I called them out in it it's because ""I always go to their room because they live on the ground floor"" the amount of times I've cried myself to sleep just thinking if I disappeared right now would they are even notice and I hate how much it effects me because I known they have no idea what's going on. I'll bring things up and I'm always made to feel like I'm the crazy one and I'm overreacting or just dismissed. And don't get me wrong I know I'm sensitive, I know sometimes I overreact but I honestly feel so alone here. I literally attempted to kill myself and told them that and honestly there was concern for 5mins and then it was never spoken of again. I understand, that not everyone knows how to deal with stuff and but literally when someone says they feel alone and then tells you something like that to dismiss it (because that's how I felt) it honestly hurts so much and I hate that I let it get to me. 
I make them sound like awful people they're not, they are good but honestly I feel unimportant. Anyway, I digress, the really reason I posted was because I tested positive for covid and not one of them asked if I was ok. It was just stay in your room and such.

2455,ssmp53,BeatsProfessor," I posted this in another sub but I wanted to post it here as well. 

For context, I am a 26 M who currently works as a lawyer in a sizable city in the NY/NJ/CT tristate area. I work out daily, exercise self-care and have great relationships with everyone in my life. Overall, I'm very happy with my career and life overall.

However, I've never been able to find a partner. In fact, it's been a struggle finding someone. I've been single my entire life and have barely ever been on a date. Part of that is because the very first time I asked someone out, I was completely humiliated by them in front of my whole class. I took me years to realize how much that that event affected me and my ability to be intimate and close with others. I sought out therapy and am now happy to say I'm over the issue.

However, while the resolution of that issue has helped, I still feel incredibly lonely. I've never been anyone's Valentine. I know I will be someday, but I just feel so empty. Like there's this void that cannot be filled. I've tried so hard to be more social and to be on dating apps, but it just hasn't resulted in much of anything. I see all my friends planning their life with their spouses and while I obviously wish them the best and can't wait to see what their life holds, I want that so badly for myself. I just want someone to come home to at the end of my (usually) long workdays to hold me and comfort me, and it just breaks something inside me to come to an empty apartment time and time again. I truly long for someone who will make the pain go away.

And look, I get that Valentine's Day is a stupid corporate holiday, but it makes it impossible to escape the one thing that so deeply upsets me. It's not that I even care that others are in love and building their lives - great for them! - but it hurts being reminded of something that I've never had, and it feels like I've never have. I try not to cry or breakdown thinking about it but it just destroys me deep down. I really just want someone that deeply loves me and I pray to God every night asking for help finding that person.

Anyway, I really just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening. For the others on this sub that feel the same as me, I wish that you find your peace.

2457,ssn2cp,illuminate____," 

There's a girl I(F19) was her best friend's friend at college last year, though I spent little time with them cuz sometimes I was too shy to go talk to them. However I saw that girl a few times on private courses so we talked and I really liked her.

Now we all take different courses at college and I lost contact with them, until last semester I saw her by coincidence twice and I was so happy to see her and I think she was too, we talked for a bit and the second time she asked me if I was free at a certain time and told to come and spend time with her at college before her lecture starts, but that was still 5 days later so I was so nervous she might forget about it. When that day came I actually went to where she told me but she was sitting with many of her friends (who were mostly boys) so I got so nervous I couldn't even just say hi with all these people around so I just left and I felt terrible the whole day, I really wanted to see her and I was even worried if she thought I ghosted her so I eventually texted her to apologize and explain that I just got anxious, she replied that it's totally okay, she's not mad at me and she didn't even notice I came (that hurt).

I barely saw after that and it has become so awkward, I saw her once but she was with her friends so we just said hi and that's it she didn't talk further and didn't say anything, she probably got sick of me now.

I thought about texting her cuz I still want us to be friends but I am worried she doesn't like me anymore AND we almost never text, last time was three month ago so she might find it creepy, and I don't know anything to talk about instead of courses and grades which is totally boring and it's not something that would make us close.

I've never known what love is and I wish someone could show me. Without any friends and never having had a relationship, self-love has proven to be impossible. I know people say never give up, but I have. If it makes me a bad person or some other name, I guess so. I am not comfortable being lonely. I hate being lonely. I hate never knowing what love is but I can't bring myself to even begin to love myself because the hate is too much. Maybe if I had one person who loved me, things would be different. I don't get it. How are you supposed to find love if nobody has ever loved you? All I found is a broken person. There was a person filled with love, but that person was killed by the ass kickings in school, the rejections, the name calling like creep or weirdo, and all the other negativity I was exposed to without a single positive experience to cling on to.

2468,ssnyx7,_N_S_R_,"Most of the friends I had in high school are now mostly moved on from the past and have made a whole new set of friends at their new college that they decided to go to, effectively leaving me in the dust. I went to community college for about a year but never developed any lasting relationships with anyone despite making a lot of acquaintances along the way. Nobody really seemed to want to be friends with me

A couple days ago I found myself with a lot of free time and drove an hour and a half to see my best friend who I don‚Äôt see very often because he‚Äôs in college so I just see him during holidays. It was OK, but I just couldn‚Äôt have fun. It just wasn‚Äôt really my scene. Most of all though, I was honestly just way too depressed to try to bring the energy needed to socialize, which didn‚Äôt help either. Any time my friend introduced me to his friends I just felt dumb as fuck. I seemed pretty reserved and it showed. I could tell none of his friends really liked the energy I was bringing, but I couldn‚Äôt help it. I didn‚Äôt fit in at all, It was so embarrassing. 

It was also ojust so depressing for me to see him with a lot of new people and seeing that he‚Äôs got a pretty well rounded social circle, it helps that he‚Äôs involved in a frat as well I guess. Meanwhile in my life I literally don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or hang out with. I literally haven‚Äôt gone and hung out with anyone in nearly 2 years now, meanwhile he has a plethora of people to have fun with and talk to. It just felt like an alternate universe. I felt so left behind. Not by him, but just by life in general. To be clear, I‚Äôm not jealous of him making new friends, I just wish that I had my own set of friends that want to hang out with me or that share common interests like he does, but I don‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs very easy for me to make friends but very hard to create lasting relationships. Like I make friends with everyone at the place I‚Äôm working at or when I‚Äôm in class I meet and talk to a decent amount of people, but nobody ever wants to like, talk to me outside of those times or hang out with me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm socially awkward otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt make any friends at all. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Feeling this lonely is really affecting my life. I‚Äôm kind of losing hope for everything. I‚Äôm not even in college anymore, unemployed, and I just feel so unbelievably depressed. My life uo until this point I was ALWAYS either in school, working a job, or most of the time I was doing both. But I‚Äôm so fucking depressed now that I‚Äôve somehow ended up with neither. My restaurant that I had been working in closed down and I was so preoccupied with my depression that I didn‚Äôt even realize that it was time to sign up for classes again that I missed signing up and now ive missed a whole semester of community college. 

How does one get out of this situation? I‚Äôve truly never experienced something so shitty in my life. I just want to give up on everything honestly. I don‚Äôt see a point. And now im stuck having to vent to random people on Reddit who will more than likely skip this long ass, ridiculous, whiny post because I have so little people to talk about this kind of thing with that I‚Äôm just desperate for anyone to listen to me. If anyone has any advice on how to overcome this shit it‚Äôd be greatly appreciated if you dropped that advice in the comments.

2474,ssom3b,moodyhaaze,"a few days ago would have marked my one year with my long distance girlfriend, but now i‚Äôm single again. i was so excited to have someone for valentines and to have flowers and chocolates sent to her. (for context, i‚Äôm in the US and shes in the UK). we seemed so compatible at first, we have so much in common and have so many of the same interests and so we really hit it off. we started off as friends and i developed a crush pretty quickly but she ended up being the one to ask me out about 4 months into our friendship and i gleefully accepted. things were good, we were pretty mushy and lovey dovey (which was unusual for me as i‚Äôm not a super affectionate person). but after about the 6 month mark communication starts to slow, which is fine, as i‚Äôm well aware i‚Äôm not owed messages from her every second of every day, but it got to the point that i felt like i had to, like, pretty much ask for her to pay attention to me? if she needed something she didn‚Äôt hesitate to call me whenever, but i only got radio silence when i needed to talk to her. 

a few days ago, after days of leaving me on read, i sent her an (embarrassing and angry) text pretty much telling her off for being selfish and treating me like shit.

I try my best to be positive about things, but sometimes it just hits me like a tonne of bricks. I have nobody to confide in, at least in person. I live far away from family, I'm 31, and a student mostly around people 10 years younger. I have met some friends after I moved here, one of which I have hung out with a few times and had a good time, but he lives an hour away and is usually busy. I have a friend I speak to online but more and more I'm realising he can be quite a jerk and puts me down in subtle ways ""as a joke"" (I'm sure you know the type). I'm just so tired of this life. I'm sick of feeling like an alien and an outsider. Deep down i'm a naturally quite affectionate, positive person, but I have nobody to share my interests and life with, even platonically. It's always just me and me alone.

Even the mutual coworker who introduced us quit right after she did.

We don't have each other's numbers. We only talked at work and never hung out anywhere else. I think I tainted this relationship at work at possibly a friend by suddenly ignoring her out of the blue. One day she  saw me and asked me I was. I just said ""Good."" Then the conversation ended just like that. She tried again another day and told me hello. I did not respond. She tried another day again and I did not respond. I ignored her because I wanted to make her feel the pain I felt from people in my past who used me to get what they want and never liked me for who I was, then left. I wanted to get revenge, to hurt her. I am terrified of being hurt again and thought she would hurt me, so I hurt her first. There is nothing left in me to give anymore burned that bridge.

I think maybe I just need an outside perspective or validation or something like that. Just as the title says I guess. I have a great support system. I have friends that care about me and as dysfunctional as my family can be I know they care too. I'm super lucky to have the people in my life and I do not want that to go unnoticed. But, I'm lonely. There's a huge difference is what I've learned these past couple years. I feel like I can't really go to anybody. I can't share what's on my mind in fear of worrying someone I care about, them not understanding, or leaving feeling invalidated. It's really confusing because I know that I have people that care, that's a fact. But I *feel* like no one does sometimes. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I need something else. Not more than what I have or anything. I just wish I could go to someone and ask for a hug. I know I can I just don't want to worry anyone or seem needy. As someone who has struggled with mental health before (I am in the recovery process and am doing much better) I feel as if every time I express that I'm not doing okay it gets chalked up to a mental disorder and I get meds shoved down my throat or told to get more therapy. I know the people that tell me to do these things care and are trying their best and I'm so thankful but I also know that it's hard for them to understand.

2526,sssesd,Tall_Explorer_9691,"Hello everyone,

Pretty obvious why I'm here, just feeling extra depressed and shitty and want to vent since music, games, porn and all the other usual coping mechanisms aren't getting it done.

Anyway, I feel so fucking pathetic. I'm 27 now and have wanted to find ""the one"" pretty much since I first developed an interest in the opposite sex at all. My dating record is laughable, with the sole relationship of my life having ending over 5 years ago now (which... Holy shit do I feel old). Right off the bat I wanna distance myself from this sounding remotely like this is an anti-woman or hate thing. I've never blamed women or any woman for not loving me or being into me or anything. I think everyone has the right to be attracted to whoever they want, for whatever the reason. We can't help how we feel or who we feel attracted to. Besides, I know I'm not shit anyway. On top of that though, I'm just super shy, insecure, and awkward and I don't put myself out there. Dating has become such a mindfuck for me, I just feel broken. Even if I get a match on a dating site or whatever (pretty much the only avenue for dating that I have), I immediately tense up and freak out, and get super obsessive (you should've seen me when I was actually \*in\* a relationship). And I don't ever know what to say. I'm too impatient and just don't have it in me to strike up a conversation. Just wanna take someone out already. And I'm just so sick of feeling like some anxty high schooler or some shit. I'm so damn immature and I just feel like even if I did temporarily fool a lady into thinking I'm alright, I'd just ruin it anyway or chase her away by my awkward, and desperate behavior. I just have no experiences and it's so obvious.

Anyway, idk just really sucks. I tell everyone I know all the usual crap; that I just don't care and that I don't need to meet anyone. The older I get, the more it really does just feel like a joke. It really sucks cause I can tell my family just thinks I'm a freak. I just wish I could stop caring so much. I feel so fucking useless and nothing really makes me happy.

2527,ssshgx,SuperCabrito14,"...to find a girl to set me up with. I originally posted this on the antinatalism sub but it got deleted twice, I spent a lot of time writing this post so it has to be worth it and someone read it.


I think it started a few months ago when my cousin brought his two baby girls over. My parents doted over the girls of course and the topic of me having kids inevitably came up. My parents looked at me and said ""well we have to find him a girlfriend first!"" And they all laughed, not me. I just forced a small smile but I could see it in their eyes, the idea was planted. They don't wanna set me up for my happiness or whatever, they're just desperate to be grandparents.


My mom took me to a small gathering last year and another woman brought her daughter along and introduced us, this shit was obviously preplanned. The girl was clearly embarrassed and looked uncomfortable, and I also tried my best to be uninterested. Later that night I did some light cyberstalking and saw that the guy she recently broke up with was a budding real estate agent, had his own house and was a big outdoors guy. He was taller than me, clean cut and had facial hair. Oh lord, she would be downgrading massively with me.


Soon after that my mom made me bring wings to her and her coworkers. Sure why not. Little did I know it was a ploy for her to introduce me to a girl. She was bang average. A few days later she continued telling me all about her without me asking and mentioned that she was a single mom. Oh nice, if I wasn't interested before I'm DEFINITELY not interested now lol. Soon my mom invited the girl and her mom to our house for dinner, the mom came but not the girl. The mom's excuse was that the girl was embarrassed but I know the truth, she smelled the bullshit and wasn't interested in me. Oh it's mutual hon.


Now I suspect my dad wants to set me up with one of his coworkers daughter. He made me cyberstalk her and she's some average redhead. I'm not interested in her. In fact she could look like Jessica Chastain and I still wouldn't be interested. And just this weekend on Friday night I was watching a movie in my room when my mom interrupted me that I should've gone to The Village (highend outdoor shopping mall kind of place) theater instead, maybe I'll be there and meet the perfect girl for me. Then she said if I play video games all day I'll never get a girlfriend. So the next day after I got back from morning jiu jitsu, I took a shower and played Red Dead Redemption 2 all freaking afternoon. I went to the gym in the late afternoon and came back to continue playing until 2am.


The more they push me the more the idea turns me off. Not wanting to have kids is a direct result of me giving up on relationships.",2022-02-15 02:51:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1575053095,3,/r/lonely/comments/ssshgx/my_parents_are_working_overtime/,,0,0,My parents are working overtime

People say ""oh, you'll find someone"" and every time, I believe that lie.  I work, I try, I care, I sacrifice.  In return, I'm abandoned when I open up.  Every f****** time.

Friendship isn't much better.  At least in that, you don't have as many lies between you.  Often times it's kindred spirits who feel the same pain or share the same interests.  Give them a little fame and they'll forget you even existed, even after a decade of friendship when they decide to make your illness political as if you deserved it.

I'm so tired.  I'm tired of being as open and caring as I am.  I'm sick of never being the top of anybody list.  To matter to one person was my life's dream and now I can see that not one f****** person feels the need to check in on me, no matter how long I've been there for them.  The thanks I get fir everything is to be told ""it's okay to be wrong about things so long as you realize you're wrong and admit it"" as I'm struggling to breathe.

Forget them all.  People won't change.  People are not kind.  There is no redemption for us.  Live life for your own benefit and, above all else, trust nobody.",2022-02-15 06:55:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602905754,137,/r/lonely/comments/sswu76/screw_love_f_friendship_trust_nobody/,,0,26,Screw love.

2602,ssyuae,lyssierose,"but i‚Äôm up, trying to fight the depressing thoughts. i sobbed really badly early. it was fucking stupid really. i‚Äôve been so damn lonely and it‚Äôs only been worse because it feels like my closest friend has been deliberately ignoring me for whatever reason. just a few months ago, we agreed to take classes together so we could meet up in person and hang out. well we did that finally in january and started to hang out pretty frequently. he used to get so excited to talk to me, and we used to call like every day. well lately he‚Äôs just been radio silent to me. barely talked to me at all last week, even removed me as a friend on snapchat without explaining why. i‚Äôm too coward to ask tbh, but maybe i‚Äôll mention it if he plans on talking to me soon. when we had class last week, he walked by me (or rather i walked by him) and he didn‚Äôt say a word, and he usually would in the past. i asked him a question and all he did was nod, it looked a bit petty to me. and then he went somewhere else without saying anything. it was unlike him‚Ä¶

we had class yesterday and i sat behind him (i usually sit next to him but was a bit anxious to do that) and i know he saw me but didn‚Äôt acknowledge my existence. he didn‚Äôt even come greet me after class like usual, he just left. the previous day he texted me asking about an assignment and i replied, but he still hadn‚Äôt replied by then‚Ä¶ i thought it was strange. and after our class i texted him saying hi but received nothing back. today i‚Äôm supposed to see him again cuz we have class again but he‚Äôs been ignoring me. when we do talk, it feels like all we talk about is class now. idk what‚Äôs up with him but i‚Äôve been speculating it‚Äôs either cuz he‚Äôs trying to distance himself from me because of his gf or he thinks i‚Äôm boring or something. it has just made me feel like complete shit and it hurts like hell. does he even consider me a close friend anymore?  he‚Äôs done a complete 180 within the past few weeks. i just want an answer‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm dreading sharing more classes with him this week. he probably still won‚Äôt reply to my messages. and i don‚Äôt try saying anything else out of fear i‚Äôm bothering him. i just fucking hate playing these mind games with people. you say i‚Äôm one of your closest friends one day, then all of a sudden i don‚Äôt exist to you. feels like no one values my existence and i‚Äôm tired of it. this post is so dumb i shouldn‚Äôt be depressed because of this but it hurts because right when it feels like i made a good close friend, they leave me in the dust and ghost me. idc if this sounds dramatic, it happens every time",2022-02-15 09:09:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638767284,2,/r/lonely/comments/ssyuae/i_should_be_asleep/,,0,0,i should be asleep‚Ä¶

2606,sszccq,ben12a,"She left me 4 months ago, after 3.5 years. We graduated together, ended out athletic careers together, got our first jobs together, worked through the pandemic together, moved in together. She said that I made her ""happy, but maybe not as happy as she could possibly be"". Talked about some of the things she didn't like, such as me being less present due to stress/burnout, and not holding her hand or cuddling her as much, but didn't seem to have any interest at trying to work on those things. No interest in couples counseling. Spent 1.5 weeks in the guest room, and spent a lot of time avoiding me and hanging out with her friends and coworkers rather than talking about what was going on and how to make the relationship better and more fulfilling for both of us.

I've been going straight down since then. I was okayish the first month, but lately I've been getting 2-3 hours of sleep each night, and usually dream of her when I do. I'm sleeping on couch cushions in my closet cuz it's the only place I feel like I can escape the thoughts of her. I'm struggling to shower, brush my teeth, and eat more than 1 meal a day. My apartment is disgusting, I haven't done laundry in weeks, and I'm barely able to function at work. All I do now is work, sleep, and play basketball occasionally. My phone my silent all day today, while I know hers was probably lightening up with people and guys interested in her. I tried to text her a few days ago - just lay out everything - the memories of us I remembered, the pain, sadness, and anger I felt at the way things ended, and how that 1.5 weeks of limbo time fucked with me. I broke NC for the first time last week, and texted her how much I missed her, and how I was disappointed that after 3.5 years, we didn't get to see how much better our relationship could be with proper communication and support. She didn't reply at all. Most likely she saw them and just ignored them cuz she moved on like she was supposed to, or she blocked my number.

My parents have been trying to support me, but they keep trying to focus on helping me ""get over her"", when the reality is I don't see a point to life without her anymore. There's no ""better / more fulfilling"" person out there for me. I don't give a shit that I have a good apartment, good car, decent paying job, in-shape, whatever. Nothing gives me any happiness anymore without me. Everything reminds me about her - she was so ingrained in my life. Whenever I think of the future, where she can't be a part of it, I just want to cut things off here. Scrolling through dating apps or doing anything social to meet anyone new just makes me want to end it more - trying to find someone else to be with just feels like such a terrible thing to be doing, when my love for her is just increasing at time passes. I cant stop replaying our relationship in my head, wishing I had handled some things differently, said what I was thinking more, and really made sure that she was satisfied, rather than just assuming things were good.

There's just nothing out there for me now. I work a job I don't care about, so I have money to survive. When I'm off work, I don't enjoy anything I do, instead Im just miserable no matter what I'm doing, but I'm not doing it with her. The worst part is she most likely already started sleeping with someone from one of her volleyball teams, or one of her coworkers she spent a fair amount of time with. She probably hadn't thought about me in weeks, and if she did, it was probably just being happy she's free of me now",2022-02-15 09:44:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1517003845,6,/r/lonely/comments/sszccq/a_future_without_her_looks_darker_and_darker/,,0,4,A future without her looks darker and darker

2611,sszscr,ImStillAliveFuckers,"This is a really, Really, REALLY, looong post. Fair warning.

My longest relationship was almost 3 years. I have multiple ex's.

2 weeks before Valentine's Day, my most recent ex cheated on me.

We would've been together 2 years in March. I shouldn't have gotten a place with him after only 1 year, but I did.

3 months left living here with this asshole, who admitted he's been lying to me since February 2020.

He never accepted my mental issues, even though the night we met I talked about A LOT, including how crazy I am.

I thought he was self aware enough of his own head illnesses, but turns out he's not and he wouldn't listen to reason.

It's not just my romantic life that's shit, I've been in people-induced Hell for over 2 decades.

People keep hurting me, false accusers/creepy stalkers/bad perverts/fake ""nice"" people/etcetcetc.

Drama, mental health, social problems aside:

Wish someone would rub my ugly feet/make them prettier.

Wish someone would cuddle me without needing sex.

Wish someone would say ""I love you"" during sex and actually mean it.

Wish someone would care about how I'm doing more than they care about my pussy.

Wish someone would help me and not see me as a burden.

Wish someone would actually understand.

I've gotten SO MUCH UNHELPFUL ADVICE when I complain, instead of people knowing what I'm talking about.

I just don't fit, I'm too ""dark"" for people or not ""dark"" enough.

I know how I look/sound/seem to the majority of people.

Just wish somebody would make me feel better or take me to a good place.

I'd say I want the pain to stop, but I've gone through the ""I don't care about anything or anyone"" emotionless phase, never want to do it again.

I couldn't even get laid because I'm picky AND now have to get a new std card, because sir CheatsAlot had sex with me after he had unprotected sex with that woman.

Plus I have to wait to get an std card until there's enough ""material for testing""

I don't even have platonic friends, just 2 neighbors who keep inviting rapists/rape supporters over.

How can they say they love me when they invite over a man who tried to force himself into my home twice?

How could he say he loved me when he was lying about accepting me from the day we met?

How do people say ""I love you"", but continue to knowingly hurt us, for no necessary reason??

At least now I know how unregretful cheaters and abusers sleep.

I'm exhausted and quietly sobbing right now, while my ex is on the other mattress sleeping soundly.

I just want to go to a good place with a good person or people.

I want cuddles, honesty and loving intercourse.

Too much to ask for apparently.

P.S. Just because I'm a sad lonely person doesn't mean I want boring convos to keep up. No one's looking good in private messages so far.",2022-02-15 10:14:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606689033,5,/r/lonely/comments/sszscr/i_feel_fcking_cursed/,,0,2,I feel f*cking cursed.

2613,sszvde,bobapants,"[25/F] Virtually every post I scrolled past today, was someone showing off their loved one or ""valentine."" To me it seemed like more people had someone than the people that didn't, and it makes me feel so shitty that I don't have any significant other in my life.

Sure I've got friends with benefits here and there, but I'm growing very tired of just being used for sex. I want someone to actually WANT me for me and not just only want me sexually. I want someone to love me. To care about me. To actually desire me and find me attractive.

Speaking of attractiveness, I'm not conventionally attractive by any means. Social media had done it's damage here I think. I look nothing like the girls these boys are posting for their valentine's day posts. I don't think I look as feminine and girly as normal girls. Makeup does very little for me. If anything, it makes me look weird and it doesnt look right. It is like I don't have ""the right face for makeup."" Kinda looks like putting makeup on a toddler lmao.

I am 25 and I've been single since 2016. My sister, who is younger than me, is engaged. They dated for 5 years before the engagement. I love her and her fiancee, and they're truly great for one another, but it makes my loneliness feel even deeper. The fact that I'm 25 and not even close to starting a relationship with anyone makes me feel shitty especially seeing how many people my age (and younger) are getting married and finding their ""person."" My parents are in their late 60s and I don't want to be alone when they're gone. That would be my absolute worst nightmare.

2629,st2i95,drewbie11,"Hey. Just wanted to come on here so I could talk to some people about it. So I‚Äôm just going to tell the whole story. 

Met this girl over the summer and got her number and snap and whatever, we started taking over the summer and when we got to college in the fall we hooked up the first few nights. Then she asked to have sex and I said can we do another night (Idk why I said no could‚Äôve been from self confidence issues) After that she started to be hella distant and always said she was doing homework and shit. So I was pretty upset about it for a month and then got over it. Fast forward to the end of the semester when I‚Äôm at a party with one of her friends and her friend whispers to me that she still likes me. So over winter break we start talking again and when we come back we hook up again. I really really like this girl. I‚Äôve dated a few girls but no one has ever made me feel like this before. So after we hook up like 4 or 5 times I kept screwing up in tiny ways. Like one night we were both drunk and i kept her up and she had practice early in the morning so she left at like 3 am. Another night I was high and couldn‚Äôt get up or whatever. I could always tell she was a bit self conscious because I would always smile while we would make out and she kept asking if I was laughing at her. Anyway so after each time hooking up she would just leave me on delivered for hella long and not really talk to me much. Now it‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. Like she‚Äôll go a week without talking to me and then she will pop back up and I‚Äôm instantly drawn back in. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be going back to her but she just makes me so happy. I know I have to get over her but part of me is worried I won‚Äôt find anyone else. I‚Äôm a very anti social and self conscious person so it‚Äôs hard for me to get out and meet people. Part of me thinks she‚Äôs doing on accident and doesn‚Äôt realize what she‚Äôs doing but part of me thinks she‚Äôs doing it to be cruel.

2631,st3jg9,International_Bee303,"PS: THAT'S ""LONELY"", MY SILLY AUTOCORRECT. I joined a med school in another country a few months ago. It's a English international program so i thought there would be people from everywhere. 
But mostly it's just people from one country. So they have their own group, speak their own language. They know seniors very well as well because the seniors are from that country as well. 
I don't like going to parties and drinking exclusively. Also I am a introvert. All these things, combined with the fact that I don't know their language and there's so many of them, makes it impossible for me to make any friends. 

Usually I can ignore it but it gets very hard to study anatomy in labs on cadavers without any friends, and our professors don't teach so that's one more minus. 

Now these classmates of mine know seniors very well ( same country, big community of their own in our med school) so they know how to study and what to focus on for exams and what teachers like to ask. 

I am quite good at other subjects where I focus on lectures so they are usually very good to me during those subjects. But when it's anatomy and i am the one needing help and direction they all.. Basically behave like bitches. I think I should stop being so good.

2641,st5clf,jellybeanbea, I have realized this bitter truth about life and don't really want to try to love anyone anymore. Everything feels really temporary and fake. Why would you want love to be loved when you can be replaced by just anyone in a jiffy? I really don't understand why people place so much importance on things that only give us temporary happiness? Loving yourself and people around you is enough. That's a lot more than what most of us can handle. People do not know how to love someone truly. That's okay because we as humans can only do so much. Idk why so many people feel incomplete when they are single like stop it..no seriously stop. The very concept that we need someone else to feel complete is flawed. It's untrue. This thinking does more harm than good without us even realizing it.  We essentially undermine our own ability to be absolutely independent. Telling yourself that you need to be with someone to be happy is like mentally torturing yourself because you're constantly seeking out something without looking into yourself for your own needs. This puts undue pressure on the person you're with.  Relationships are only a temporary fix for emotionally wounded people nowadays. We should only be in a relationship when we want it not when we need it. Instead of being content with what you already have you tend to feel bitter because of the self created void you're so desperately trying to fill with what you think is love. If you feel like this it only means that you are in need of your own love. If you have read till here you'll realize that Valentine's Day is not only for couples. You can show yourself some love. Personally I think Valentine's Day is not really for showing people love because it actually just leaves people out also if you truly someone you can celebrate Valentine's Day with them everyday. The key to happiness is to realize that no one will love you the way you love yourself. You will never replace yourself but someone you met on Tinder last night definitely will.,2022-02-15 15:22:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643309622,10,/r/lonely/comments/st5clf/no_matter_how_goodfunnyinterestingattractive_you/,,0,7,"No matter how good,funny,interesting,attractive you are you will always be replaceable"

2646,st5h8v,KiwiDelicious," I just wanted to share my story, I don't know why I want to but maybe this will help someone else.   


So  I just wanted to get out of the red pill mindset, the black pill the  incel mindset. I am 31 years old and the last time I had a girlfriend  was in high school. It went on for 8 years and ended in 2014. First I'll  talk about the relationship a bit. I was the goth kid in my high  school. I was great with making friends and talking to people. I had a  don't care attitude about things. I just liked making friends and making  people happy. So at that time I was desperate for any female attention.  I would notice my friends girlfriends would leave them and gravitate  toward me. My friends didn't have as much confidence as me and I was  always the class clown and doing weird stuff to get attention. I loved  when their girlfriends hung around me and sometimes they would leave  them to hang with me. I was into watching porn a ton while I was  younger. I had huge collections of it on my computer (still do). But one  of the girls that left my friend she liked me and I didn't like her at  first, she felt troublesome but hey it was a female and I wanted that  attention. Before I met her I was friends with the popular kid in  highschool, we didn't have the same interests but we spoke often. He  always hung around girls and girls seemed to be all over him. He would  talk and show how much phone numbers he got and I would lie saying I got  a couple as well.   


So I was with this girl for a total of 8  years. It wasn't a good experience. I was so open-minded talking and  making friends with everyone around me and she never had that ability.  She was like a slave in her own house and had to do everything for her  family. She never made or had much friends. She would get upset if I  looked or even spoke to other people and even though I didn't like her  at first we hung out more and more and eventually I liked her. I started  skipping school with her. The female attention I was receiving was  amazing. I didn't get to have sex with her for the first 2 years, she  kept saying she didn't want to just give it up so easily. That I had to  earn it. So I did.. I ended up giving up most or all of my friendships  in those years. It was me and her and I liked her... I didn't love her. I  never did finish high school. My grades were so horrible. I tried to  make her happy so many times, it didn't always work. Trying to make her  happy felt like a full time job but I was happy when things did work  out. I grew up with a lot of anger issues from my own family and getting  angry at her felt like a double edge sword. I was stabbing my anger at  her but it also stabbed me. Getting angry at someone you like is  annoying. Throughout those 8 years we had sex 6 times. She hated that I  was bi-sexual. She always brought up stuff like being her knight and  shining armor and I dunno... at times I did find myself going to LGBT  Centers and meeting new people. This mostly happened on our breakups and  once again I found myself making friends in 3-6 months. Eh, I never got  into sex or anything but it sometimes almost happened. You see I was a  shy person until people cracked my shy bubble then I was the most  talkative open person you'd ever meet. I liked her because well I was  afraid of STD's (still am) so it felt nice to be with someone who I  could share things with and be with someone that didn't have any  diseases. But I knew she didn't accept me fully for me and I didn't want  to leave the relationship.   


I kept telling myself that being in a  bad relationship was better then being alone. But there would be so  much times when I got home from hanging out with her telling myself that  I'm just sad and frustrated. I didn't believe in love and sex was  something I felt like I was begging for. I did want a family, I always  wanted to create the family I never had. At 2014 when I was 24 I  convinced myself that this was it. This relationship had gotten to me so  badly that I tried to k\*ll myself. There is so much details that this  would end up becoming a book. After it was over, in about a week I  contacted her back asking if we could be friends. Being alone felt like  death. Me and my family didn't get along at all. I wasn't the favorite  child. I realized that maybe I didn't want love, maybe I just wanted  sex. But clearly I didn't know how to get it. I found videos in 2015  about PUA and RedPill. I loved those videos because I felt like I was  that blue pill nice guy. I grew up watching Disney movies and always  tried to be nice to people even giving up food to others if it meant I  would go hungry. I loved making people happy because it meant I had  purpose in this world. It meant that I wasn't a waste of space. In  middle school I attempted to get run over by a car, since then I figured  I'd help people anyway I can to give my life meaning.   


The thing  with PUA is that I always felt like ""Aren't you still simping for these  women?"" same with MGTOW. All this bitterness and some of it I felt like  I understood. The whole divorce r\*pe thing. That the court is in favor  of females. It all scared me to know that my life could be ruined by  interacting with females. I tried following MGTOW because it felt the  easiest. I mean PUA was okay and I read many books about it but it  didn't feel like me, it felt like I was taking advantage of females. I'm  not a mean person or I try not to be. I figured I just work on being by  myself, a lone wolf. I figured I'd forget about women but over the  years I started to hate them. The fact that women can get a guy just by  being alive. Even ugly women had a better chance then most men. It felt  unfair and I wished to be bornin the 80s or something. I never said  things like, ""Women Belong in the Kitchen."" I felt if I had a woman I  would treat them well. I wanted to love but didn't believe in it. I  looked into prostution to get rid of my needs but I live in NYC and well  I hear nothing but how cops arrest guys like that. It angered me that  prostitution was illegal. What the hell are lonely guys to do? I felt  screwed. Like women had this advantage that I never knew about. That a  girl can easily pick and choose who she wanted but a man could go years  without even a single hug.   


Like I said I looked up a lot of  things and I told myself I'd work on myself and forget women. Don't pay  attention to them. Now... problem was I still liked women. At least how  they looked. Even though I was Bi-sexual I liked men who's body was more  feminine. I never liked big giant muscles or hairy guys. So in a way it  felt like I liked the personality of a guy with the body of a female.  But I haven't dated either. Hell dating feels weird on its own. I like  gaming, I like p\*rn, I stayed home a lot to save money because I don't  spend it a lot. I also lived with my parents and they would never accept  a female coming inside. Not like I knew how to get their attention.  Talking to random people who didn't first break my shy bubble was...  unheard of. Even to guys, I didn't want to pester or bother people. But  as I said I can be very talkative and try to make jokes. Either way it's  2022 and while playing a visual novel dating game.... yeah... I kept  telling myself I would like to be around or be with a decent down to  earth girl. Maybe not marriage but to at least laugh and joke around  with. I don't even know where to start. I just know that I hate this  red-pill crap. I hate thinking I'm some beta male when I'm somewhat  intelligent with technology, I love helping people, I love being there  for people, I'm very good with kids and a great motivator for other  people. I don't want to hate anyone and I feel like at 31 I'm too old. I  know deep down I'm a basement dwelling loser who hated women for all  the wrong reasons. This year I got my GED, I lost 70lbs and I got into  calisthenics. I just know I don't want to hate people anymore. I don't  want to hate women because if a woman gave me attention I wouldn't throw  it away. I know I should treat women like people and not think of whats  between their legs. I know I should get better at socializing and maybe  I should spend money to just go out and find where fun where tons of  people are... it still doesn't mean I'd talk. I lost weight but it means  nothing to me. I can gain tons of hobbies but.. I dunno.

2649,st5vhe,Mountain-Collar2747,"I'm sure a lot of people here can relate... You start chatting with someone and seem to be hitting it off, everything going great! Similar opinions, hobbies, the person seems attracted to you and you are attracted to them. 

But somehow It kinda doesn't seem that the person likes you as much as you do them. They say nice things and all, but sometimes doesn't answer, other times says something that makes it seem that they are not that into you.

You are constantly walking on eggshells hoping that you don't bore the person and they walk away from your life, or say something wrong that can ruin everything.

I am in this situation with a girl... She says a lot about dating, says how lucky she is to have found me... But if I don't come to talk, she wouldn't start a conversation. Last night she seemed for some reason like she is upset with me somehow, and I don't know if she is just tired of me or if I said something to make her uninterested in me. Today she is a lot colder with me and I fear that my chance with her is lost, even before a first date.

Well... That feeling sucks. 

And it's gonna take a while before I heal from that, but for what? To find someone else in the future who's gonna reject me the same way or even worse?

2660,st8680,Unlikely_Tourist3303,"Tl;dr Although we are very lonely people, maybe we should try our best to understand what matters most to others so they too may not feel as lonely.

I feel like I can never be my genuine self around others. I am one man with a million different faces depending on what situation I‚Äôm in, however, I rarely ever express who I am on the inside. When I am at school, I am a student. At home I am a brother or son. With buddies, an amigo. But I never talk about what means most to me unless I am doing something creative like writing or painting. This to me is loneliness, when people care about the behaviors of others and not what matters most to that person. If a robot replaced me and mimicked my behaviors and speech, would anyone care?

I wonder if everyone is like this. Is everyone like uninhabited islands surrounded by a vast ocean. We may see each others surfaces but never truly explore who that person is. Maybe everyone has something very unique about them, but no one will ever know because no one stops to try to truly understand that person. 

I can never get to know everyone I meet, but if everyone has a few people that truly understand them, that may be good for us. But I don‚Äôt know any person who have this kind of relationship with someone else. Although we are very lonely people, maybe we should try our best to understand what matters most to others so they may no feel as lonely.",2022-02-15 17:24:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638990373,4,/r/lonely/comments/st8680/is_everyone_lonely/,,0,1,Is everyone lonely?

But eventually what the heart wants is a partner. And mind you I'm not saying this just cause i saw some couple out on valentine day and hence started craving it. I feel it's a fundamental need.

I realize my life is far from sorted, pretty messed up in most ways, not settled in career. But it makes me question ""can't poor people find dates"". And although i may not be professional successful, i can support myself. Im not broke or poor.

As for looks, again I'm somewhere in middle, there are people genetically less privileged than me. I'm thankful i have been blessed with a decent height.

If there's something that gives me happiness, that is doing things for others. Sure, the other feeling is fulfilling as well. When someone is ready to do anything for me.

Not sure what we were talking about just remember her smile and laugh before waking up around 3am. Felt like shit after. So tired of this. Its been a decade things are over yet I get to be reminded of what I will never have again. So tired of being told theres some one for everyone and to put yourself out there when time and time again I'm isolated I'm alone no one wants to put in effort when you're just someone people talk to only when they need something otherwise you're nothing but an inconvenience to them. So tired of this small talk I have to keep doing when ever I meet someone and then it just ends and that's it so gotta repeat the whole fucking process again.

2695,stdgeq,Berserker-Hamster,"So, I finished How I Met Your Mother the other day for - I think - the fourth time. And despite the fact that I love the show I can't help but wonder about the view society has on dating and romance.

Because the story of HIMYM is the story that is everywhere: you go on dates and you meet someone special and maybe you'll find that this person is not the one for you and you break up. But finally - just when you're about to give up - you'll find that special person. The one who makes you happy for the rest of your life. The end.

That is the only way it goes, right? There is no other possible ending. Everyone finds someone, right?

Except for the few who don't. A percentage of people that is too small to even think about. The ones who don't go on dates, who don't know how it feels like to hear the words ""I love you"", who don't know what it feels like to wake up next to someone they love and who loves them back, who come home to an empty apartment night after night after night.

The whole shabang of dating, kissing, cuddling, having fun together, laughing together, making memories together - the stuff that is as natural as breathing for 99.999% of people - we will never get to know that.

I am now 35 years old and I've never even been on a first date. No woman I've ever met has shown any romantic interest in me because I'm unattractive, boring and have zero confidence. I already have gray hairs in my beard before I even know what a first kiss feels like and at this point I probably have a higher chance to get hit by lightning than to ever find a girlfriend. Some days, like today, I have a hard time accepting this but all in all there is nothing I can do about it anymore. No woman in the world would date a 35yo ugly uninteresting loser like me. And I don't blame them for it. I'm just not boyfriend material.

Life feels pretty hollow and gray when you have no one to share it with. My only purpose left is to make the world a little better, a little brighter - for the people who actually have a chance of finding happiness on it. Because despite of it all I still love this beautiful world and the people on it. And I need to leave it better than I found it. That is why I'm still here and why I won't take an early exit although there is no silver lining for me. I'm gonna plant the tree even though I will never sit in it's shadow.

If anyone has read so far, my hat goes off to you. This was more of a public journal entry for me and I don't really expect anyone to read it all. But if anyone did I wish you a nice rest of your day and all the best.

Take care and don't give up.",2022-02-15 21:10:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1509627798,5,/r/lonely/comments/stdgeq/happily_ever_after/,,0,2,Happily ever after

2697,stdlu8,throwaway_61602,"My parents are on a completely different level of strictness as I've seen other strict parents. I know, I sound like any other teenager, but it's true. My parents see things in a very extreme way most of the time. 

When I started highschool, I was moved to a virtual homeschooling program to 'protect me from bad influences'. The year between the start of ninth grade and the start of the pandemic was alright, mostly. My only friends were from church, and even then they were just the 'friends during the good times' type of friends. I'm not religious but have to fake it to keep my life from becoming a living hell. So, with these 'friends' I was never my true self, just a fictional version of me that had almost no interests because I couldn't actually aay what I was interested in without getting reprimanded. 

Then the pandemic started, and my parents decided this was worse than the bubonic plague(not literally, but they just treat it as if). I have not had any physical contact with my church 'friends'. I have no phone nor am I allowed socials, so no way of communicating with them. When I say I have no social interaction in real life, I mean it. It's 100% the truth, unless you count my parents. I avoid my parents because they always make me feel bad about whatever it is I'm doing. 

So long story short, I have friends now. Online friends. A best friend. A crush. All online. I see pictures of them hanging out with their friends, going out, actually enjoying what should be the carefree teen years, while I can't do any of that. I feel envious, then feel bad for feeling jealous, and this loop of hatred for my life starts. I spend all day imagining what it'd be like to have a normal life, but when I get snapped back to reality and remember I will never have the life I should I feel a terrible pain. I'm depressed all the time, emotionally numb unless it's a negative feeling.

Now, I feel terrible just talking to any of my online friends. I feel annoying, like I'm stealing their time, and like it's all pointless. But when I push people away and they leave I feel worse. I've become obsessive with my friends, and that unintentionally pushes some away. I feel jealous of them for having a life, and I hate it. I am just so lonely all the time. In real life I am completely expressionless and plain because I guess I've gotten used to letters and not physical presence. I feel like everyone hates me, or will eventually. I try not to bother anyone, but it gets to the point where I can't handle it and practically explode with emotions. 

I need help. I want to learn to handle the loneliness. How to handle the fact I'll never have my teen years. That the best days of my life will be worse than everyone elses. I've tried begging my parents to let me go places with my church 'friends', but even without the pandemic I wouldn't be allowed, not without parent supervision. I've always been the sore thumb in the church friend group, the guy that shows up with his parents everywhere and that never has anything to say. I'm so sick of my life and wish I could start over with a different story. I've never found anyone as isolated as me, and that makes me feel even more lonely.

But last night when she called, she told me had to prioritize her family and didn't care enough to prioritize this relationship. This friendship was not worthy of her upkeep and her emotional energy. I let her say what she needed to say. I didn't fight it. Part of me knew this was coming since her husband and I don't get along. 
We haven't spoken since October until yesterday. I had drove by her place to drop off her Galentines day gift. She told me she was too busy for dinner or even a lunch with me so I figured driving by was good enough. 

I hadn't realized that she was ghosting me. Or at least trying too.

2702,stfaek,Miserable-Neat3318,"I'm scared of a lot of things, the most significant being loss.

The thought of losing those around me has prevented me from maintaining meaningful connections, I keep everyone at an arms length. The few times my vulnerability is shown, I simply break down. 

I think this stems from loosing my cousin, who was like my older brother growing up. He died about a year ago-I was so busy, I never had the chance to see him before he passed. He was only 25 and died from an opioid overdose, I had no idea he even used drugs like that. My aunt, uncle, mother, other cousins, and boyfriend are addicts. Meanwhile, I can't even have more than one drink and have never even touched drugs/ nicotine. 

Most days, I can get by with the facade of being present. I got dragged to a club by a friend and she brought along her ""poser"" NYC friends (daddy's money types). I was playing along with this unbearable situation, acting like I was having fun because I should be right? 21 and in NYC? 

That's not what happened. My friend began to see right through me and I could tell she was analyzing my demeanor, trying to understand what was off about me. I couldn't act anymore, so I shut down and fled the situation the earliest opportunity I could with a half-assed explanation of why I needed to leave early. 

Since then, I feel broken. Like I can't manage to keep this act up, but if I crumble, my whole ""life"" will fall apart. 

My significant other has been gone for about a month and a half and gets back next week, he is the only person who has seen me really vulnerable, and I regret that. He does not understand the extent of my situation, I don't expect him or anyone to. I told him I feel awful and kept it simple, it's lonelier saying I need someone and having nobody there. 

I can't muster up acting like I'm okay, I almost find it easier to cut him and everyone else off completely. 

Is that even a good idea? Not sure. I just know I am feeling deeply broken, I want to be alone with no distractions but this might only push me further into this depression.",2022-02-15 22:29:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644962435,2,/r/lonely/comments/stfaek/what_are_you_scared_of/,,0,16,What are you scared of?

2704,stfuh2,Lspnrodsgwp,"Not sure how I ever became lonely, but I have. 

I go to college and see others there, although 80% of the classes are still on zoom. I know a couple people there and think they're cool, although I don't spend time outside of class with any of them and due to the limited interaction it would probably be weird to ask to hang out and stuff. I am at school twice a week for 3 hours at a time, different classmates for each time. 

I have had a girlfriend for over 2 years at this point, although for a long time now she is literally at work 6 days a week from 8-9 AM til 8-9:15 PM and I only usually get 30 minutes or less of actual interaction with her a day. 

I have had many friends over the years, but have lost touch with all of them and had some relationships go bad for one reason or another. Many have moved away because I went to boarding high school. 

All that's left are my parents. Although they live over an hour away and are both full-time high-producing professionals who rarely have a minute to chat. Although they are the closest things I have to friends as i talk to each 1-3 times a week on the phone. 

I work at my desk on my computer at home, whether on schoolwork or individual projects, literally all day every day. Every once in a while I'll go to the gym and swim, and sometimes I'll go grocery shopping or run other errands. But that's it. I eat the same food for more or less every meal, I sit in the same desk all day with few exceptions, and there is only one person who I see more than once a week. I interact with people face-to-face perhaps 5 times a week. I recently watched a documentary on solitary confinement, and I was depressed to see that even those prisoners get more social stimulation than I do. 

So I just sit here, cold and lonely, trying to find motivation to keep working but I can't when nothing feels exciting. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm just whining, and if it does sound like that then it's because I am I guess; I just don't have anyone to express my feelings to and I feel immeasurably lonely every day. 

How can I meet people and develop a deep relationship with them? I've done it very many times in the past, but it just seems my current life circumstance is different and I don't have anyone to spend time with, and I don't know how to meet others when it is not done for my by school, work, or some other thing.

First of all, sorry for my English. In case you encounter any mistakes in my grammar, please ignore it, because my English isn‚Äôt perfect as my native language is Hungarian.
To begin my story, I am a hungarian guy, 21 years old, and I reached to a point in my life, where I require a big help. Since 16 I am working, tried to have a job to get money. As long as I was in a High School everything was OK. I had a girlfriend (2.5 year long relationship) I had friends, and I had a lot of planned free time activities. As I finished school for a period of time I had my friends around from the school but we drifted apart. I started to work hard, like 16-18 hours per day, and I did this 7/7 a week. I got tired, and my colleagues introduced me metamphetamine. I used that for a bit but as you expected, I got TOTALLY exhausted and I started to not arrive to work in time. I Was always late, and now for the result I got fired. After 2-3 days of sleep, I realized that I am in a huge trouble. I dealt with the drug problem, I havent used meth since I was fired (2 month) and I am not addicted to it. But the real problem, is I haven‚Äôt got any friends, no communities etc.. I know myself that I am a ‚Äúcommunity centered‚Äù person, I love to make people laugh, arrange meetings, and back in the times, I used to have a medium sized community, as a secomd family. I really loved it, thats where I met my girlfriend, and i Have really really good memories from these times.  But now, I have nothing. I feel empty and I feel that I am dying inside because of that. I need a girlfriend, I need a community, a group of friends, I need to socialize. But I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know where to start, how can I make friends, or how can I reach to the point to have a girlfriend, or a stable group of friends, I feel that I am lost. How would you solve this situation?

2718,stj2q6,throwaway0183701,"By a cute girl, no less. Idk how it made me feel. So confused is how it made me feel, I guess. Like I mean on one hand, less fuckin go. Maybe if shit like that happened more often I wouldn‚Äôt feel so fucking alone and unfit for society.

But all I could think was she must‚Äôve been lying. Idk why, maybe she took pity on the kid in all black who looked like a scared drowned rat in the checkout aisle. Maybe she‚Äôs trying to get over social anxiety herself and saw me as an easy person to talk at cuz she knew I wouldn‚Äôt respond with anything more than ‚Äúthanks‚Äù . But I know I didn‚Äôt smell nice, I have to walk a kilometer to school and anxiety makes sure I sweat unless it‚Äôs below like 5C. Plus I badly needed a shower. My one guess for *what* she could‚Äôve honestly smelled was my dry shampoo, it‚Äôs pretty fragrant on the way out at least. But I still don‚Äôt have a goddamn clue why she‚Äôs comment on it.

And as narcissistic as it feels, whenever something like this happens I inevitably end up imaging they like me. I can‚Äôt fucking stop it, it just happens. I know they can‚Äôt, they can‚Äôt. No one ever did when I was giving a shit about looking likable, why would anyone like me now that I‚Äôve stopped caring? I don‚Äôt even have a personality in public, I‚Äôm just a scared but polite NPC reacting to other people. There‚Äôs nothing there for anyone to like. But I still think it and it gets me terrified because being loved is all I‚Äôve really wanted from life since I was 13, but I know I‚Äôm shit and anyone can do better than me and I just hurt people and mess up and I don‚Äôt even have enough energy for friendships let alone a relationship. So if someone actually liked me, I‚Äôd either take the opportunity and fail and hurt them and hate myself for that, or I‚Äôd skip the opportunity and never forget it and hate myself for that. Hedonism would say to take the chance, but humanism says to not, and I don‚Äôt know which is the lesser evil.

All moot, she couldn‚Äôt possibly have even thought of me after I was out of her sight. I just needed to get this out of my head.

2765,stoo8a,bruisedbrains,"((EDIT: guys after you read this post, PLEASE re-read the last paragraph. This IS NOT an invitation to dm me. I love being able to post about my mental health anonymously and I love that I discovered this subreddit, but it seems like almost every time I post on here people see it as an invitation to dm me, especially if I mention my struggles with love and relationships. This was literally just posted and I already have several people trying to message me. I feel the need to reply to them even though I explicitly said to not dm me because I have a really hard time setting boundaries and saying no. I know it seems really rude that I‚Äôm on the lonely subreddit and I don‚Äôt want to make online friends, but please understand that I‚Äôm trying to PROTECT myself. I‚Äôm in a very fragile state of mind right now and I know I‚Äôm incredibly susceptible to emotional manipulation. It‚Äôs difficult to distinguish whether or not a stranger is messaging me because they actually are concerned or if they are just trying to get attention and affection from me. It especially puts a lot of stress on me when I think I finally found someone who cares about me and then they try to turn the chat sexual and guilt me into responding to them. When I post about feeling hopeless in my love life, I‚Äôm looking for people to relate. I‚Äôm NOT posting on here for someone to date me. There are better subreddits for me to do that if I wanted to. If you read this post that‚Äôs about a woman who‚Äôs clearly not alright in the head and think you should try to dm her after she said not to, that‚Äòs not ok. You could have just commented to show your concern, but now I‚Äôm really anxious because you dmed me and now I feel like I‚Äôm obligated to talk to you which can put me in a possibly dangerous situation. It‚Äôs the people with ulterior motives that prevent me from actually pursuing genuine friendships online because I‚Äôm terrified of being emotionally manipulated again. And i KNOW that not everyone who dms me is trying to manipulate me, but i HAVE to protect myself. I‚Äôm aware that a lot of people might just dm me without considering these things and that‚Äôs OK, just please keep this in mind for the future. If there is something you want to respond to but you don‚Äôt feel comfortable saying your response publicly, please ask first and then you can dm me your response and I will reply. But that‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt try to continue to talk to me because people have tried to guilt me into continuing to talk to them whenever I would try to set boundaries and end the conversation. I was considering deleting my posts, but I think I won‚Äôt cave in and I‚Äôll keep them up because I still think there could be people who relate to them. Thank you to everyone that might have been GENUINELY trying to show your concern for me, I appreciate it. But to the people that DO have ulterior motives, please let me connect with people online over things I can‚Äôt tell anyone IRL. I don‚Äôt want to have to stop myself from posting certain thoughts that I have just because I‚Äôm scared of this type of thing happening. If you feel attacked by this edit, consider if you would feel the urge to dm me if I were a man writing this post. Also, I just want to be clear that it‚Äôs ok if you find some aspect of one of my posts attractive or whatnot, that doesn‚Äôt inherently make you a bad person. If dming me is your idea of ‚Äúshooting your shot‚Äù, you could‚Äôve at least been upfront about it. But for now, I‚Äôm not looking for any friends. Please respect my boundaries and do not dm me. Thank you ))


Ok here‚Äôs the actual post:

I know that this type of behavior can easily become toxic, but I kind of want a relationship where we‚Äôre both obsessed with each other. I hate that if a dude I liked told me he stalked all my social media and had photos of me that he took without me knowing, I would find it really endearing. I would probably do the same, and I hate that about myself because I think it‚Äôs weird and probably not healthy? I would love for us to both have a small world, where we spend most of our time together and we do pretty much everything together. I want to be dependent on them and for them to be dependent on me. Of course trust is important and stuff, and I don‚Äôt want a relationship where we‚Äôre jealous over every little thing the other person does. I just feel comfortable being a ‚Äúcreep‚Äù in a relationship and for the other person to kinda be the same. Like I would legit record them sleeping and note pretty much every thing they say that they‚Äôre interested in, and make several sketches of them from photos I‚Äôve pulled from stalking them on the internet. Man, he could even cum in my food and I‚Äôd think that it was funny and endearing. 

Maybe this is just my brain going haywire from being lonely and having social anxiety for so long and if I was in a relationship like this, I actually wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it, idk. Maybe this type of thing is normal and I just don‚Äôt know anyone who likes this type of relationship dynamic.

Btw this isn‚Äôt an invitation to stalk me or dm me expecting anything. I just wanted to express this because I feel like if I were to say this to someone IRL, they would think I was insane.

TL;DR: Long Text Story. 

I‚Äôll tell you my story. 

I‚Äôve always felt disconnected with people growing up. Even my own parents nearly always felt alien to me. No matter how hard I tried to make friends or talk to people and understand them I could never shake the gut feeling of not getting anywhere. Everything I did outside felt fake and irrelevant. Like it was really all completely pointless. 

Then came the depression. At the worst time of all, in the years leading to my finals in secondary school. I never struggled in education up until that point because I essentially had no distractions. I was a pretty smart kid. The last few years felt like the biggest challenge of my life even without what I had going on at the time. 3 years of trying to stay on-top of 8 subjects while fighting your own mind was the worst experience ever, I wouldn‚Äôt even wish it on people I despise. 

I stopped studying, stopped eating properly, got picked on at school, slept 14-ish hours a day, grades fell, skipped school more and more often, even attempted suicide several times because I was failing at the most important time of my life. 

I suffered all that time until exams came. And I got what I needed, just not what I wanted. Even now, after all that, I feel I lost more of myself than what it was worth. 

Then I managed turn it around, somehow. Now I have a great job in Healthcare, saving and healing as best I can. Not the best job for someone who doesn‚Äôt talk much but it‚Äôs I guess it‚Äôs a small price to pay. 

I may be forever alone and feel forever disconnected and on the outside, but we take what small wins we can get elsewhere.",2022-02-16 09:33:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1547436219,6,/r/lonely/comments/strvy0/tell_me_about_your_recent_wins_big_or_small/,,0,18,"Tell me about your recent wins, big or small."

11 years ago I was convinced to take care of a puppy dog. We was in a provisional home and (if there was no other choice) he would end up in a family where the humans had full-time jobs and he wouldn‚Äôt have had a very good life. Back then I was squatting. I adopted that dog as a brother. He was my best friend. I have always been quite alone, but he was always there for me. They say loved children have lots of names. I would call my brother by a dozen different names.

He would always listen to me. I talked to him about everything. I talked so much to him the whole time that he thought everything going on with me was about him. For example, if I‚Äôd get angry, he would think I was angry with him. Then I would feel very guilty ‚Äúno brother, it‚Äôs not about you. I‚Äôm not angry with you‚Äù

I got in a lot of troubles because I refused to have him on a leash. I finally got a letter from the company owning my apartment and we had to be tied to each other when outside. I like bushcraft and primitive skills and there‚Äôs some forest near where I live. There was less trouble to get into by having him loose in the forest, so we were there a lot. We spent days and nights in the forest. Sometimes he would stay by my side and sometimes he would wander off a bit.

My brother died in April. I can‚Äôt go alone to the forest anymore. I can‚Äôt without my brother.",2022-02-16 11:21:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629736208,58,/r/lonely/comments/sttk90/my_friend_died/,,0,7,my friend died

I was so excited that he would be my first boyfriend. So I waited for the day he would make it official. One day, I told him that I was missing him and then he announced me that he had a girlfriend since a couple of days and that I shouldn't say that.

I can't express what I felt when I read that. I was angry and he blocked me. He made it sound like I was the only one interested when in fact, he was the one who approached me, asked for a date with me and told me that I was beautiful and that he was probably starting to fall in love with me.

For the next days, I felt a mix between anger and sadness. I just wanted to kick him in the balls. I told my story to some people and they advised me to take time for myself and to forget him because he was a piece of trash. So I tried. I tried to convince myself that I wasn't ugly, that I was worthy of love and that it was his loss. But it's been so hard. I've never felt so alone in my life.

2880,suc2gp,PotatoesJamison,"Hi yall, 

Just wanted to make a post to express to everyone some insights I have had recently.

In October of last year I lost my cell phone, and since then have made the decision to not get purchase one. Not having a phone has been a blessing in many ways, but the change in my social life has been profoundly terrible. 

The friends that I did have, started inviting me to less and less events and eventually stopped inviting me altogether. Now they don't even want to be around me because ""I'm just too out of the loop.""

 I also was going out with a girl and she broke up with me in December. She said that ""I just can't date someone who can't text."" I honestly can't blame her because it probably felt terrible to not be able to reach out.

And honestly, who doesn't have a phone in todays age??? 

I don't think I ever want to own a phone again, but it's just made me realize how much people care about the ability to socialize through text.",2022-02-17 01:20:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645059368,5,/r/lonely/comments/suc2gp/cell_phones_in_todays_society/,,0,5,Cell phones in today's society

2896,sudzyv,skyskelton97," 

I'm a 24 year old guy, and for my entire life, ive never fealt like i really fit in anywhere, with anyone. ive had girlfriends, and lots of friends, but like... i just feel like nobody really cares about me. ever. if i dont actively mantain a relationship with somebody, it just dies. i cant recall a single time a friend or even girlfriend has hit me up just to say hi, ask whats up, or invite me anywhere. i have always initiated practically every interaction with people.

sure, people tell me im cool, they like me, even love me, people seemingly enjoy my company. but if i just disappeared one day, nobody would care. nobody would ever think about me again.

friend groups ive been a part of regularly get together without me. and they tell me about it like its no big deal that everyone was there but me. why wasnt i invited? this is not a one off occurance or even something specific to one friend group. its been my whole life.

ive been in group chats where one person will ask who wants to hangout, or hatever and a billion people are like yeah ill be right over no questions asked. but ever time ive ever tried to get the group together, or throw a party or anything like that, i get radio silence. lame excuses. or worse, they do say yes, but then nobody shows up. every. fucking. time.

am i cursed? do i smell bad? am i annoying? or am i just so deeply uninteresting that im invisible and forgettable?

i see people get texts n shit from their friends, unprompted. calls from their mom, random selfies from whoever, people getting invited out to shit all the time. but not me. i have to do the inviting, or nothing. 

and of course, when i do text someone, and by some miracle they text back, its always hours later. this goes for litteraly everyone ive ever interacted with. they text me, i look at it and reply... hour/ days go by before i get a response. 

is this normal? does anyone else feel like they just werent meant to get close to anyone? i just want to feel wanted.",2022-02-17 02:53:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1335677918,5,/r/lonely/comments/sudzyv/is_this_just_normal_to_feel_like_youve_never_fit/,,0,3,"Is this just normal? to feel like youve never fit in anywhere, or ever gotten close to anyone?"
2897,sue726,Crepedeole,"
So their is this friend of mine that is starting to give off a vibe that it is a one sided relationship. This sucks because in a way she was the one who helped me find a friend group when I just transferred to uni since we go to the same one. She was one of the few too that reached out to me when I was dealing with grief. I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

She‚Äôs a high school friend of mine. We got pretty close in high school although there was a period in time where she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me or hang out with me just because but eventually she apologized for acting that way. Now I have a bad feeling that it‚Äôs happening again. Like when I began my school semester, she would check on me and ask how my classes are or my mental well-being and I also do the same back. Now she doesn‚Äôt even ask anymore and I‚Äôm the one asking. Now I‚Äôm the one always initiating the conversation (but they don‚Äôt last for long) or I‚Äôm always the one to greet her when there‚Äôs a holiday. She even leaves me on read when I say ‚ÄúStay safe‚Äù or ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù. Just yesterday, I saw her sharing posts of her hanging out with the friends she introduced me to without inviting me. I know it sounds very petty but the thing is, she would tell me about these outings before. Now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being seen as nothing. This pained me because she won‚Äôt at least acknowledge words of affirmation yet would do these things.

Tl:dr idk if there is some miscommunication going on or there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing out on that makes this friendship feel one sided but I just want to know if I should confront her about this? And if I should, how should I do it? Please send any advice

(Also, if this will supplement in giving advice, I know this persons work/school schedule since she posted it on a class Discord.)

2910,suffe2,slugsquad0007,"20M, compsci major, just got into a four year after two years of community college. Community college was hard because of the loneliness. I paid tuition out of pocket. All I did was school as there were no events. Average age of a community college student is 28, but I was 17 when i started.  The loneliness messed me up really bad. Now I started at a four year and I‚Äôm overloaded with things I can do. People I can talk too. Clubs I can be apart of. 

And I‚Äôm angry.  Because I know deep down, I know I need to focus more on my industry. The way my major is set up, we all want  the high  paying jobs. You only get those by studying in your free time. So I have no real ‚Äúfree time.‚Äù

I spent so many years wishing I had money for a four year so I can do all the cool college stuff I see on tv. I wanted to be a jock on the football team. I wanted to join every club, and hit the gym all day every day. I wanted to be invited to every party. But that‚Äôs just not realistic. Truth is, if I‚Äôm not focusing on class, I‚Äôm studying for technical interviews to land a high paying job. And I‚Äôm dealing with the same loneliness. Nothings changed. 

Why? Why charge thousands in tuition to help run rec centers and sports teams and clubs and e-sports game rooms, knowing that we will never have time to appreciate these things? Why sell me a dream?

Hey everyone. I enjoy computers, science, and engineering. My best friend (who is also into CS) moved away three years ago and can‚Äôt visit more than once or twice a year.

I live in a relatively small town where everyone is obsessed with football and joyriding. I have a small friend group that I hang out with, but I‚Äôve been too busy with work and school for anything more than a passing ‚Äòhello‚Äô.

School is a pain. I‚Äôm taking Calc and Trig at the same time (I‚Äôm only supposed to take one, but I demonstrated an ability to take more), and the college *just* informed me that RS won‚Äôt cover the tuition despite being halfway through the quarter. I now owe a bunch of money in school debt, and it‚Äôs too late to drop the class for a refund.

Work is a joke. My manager is stupid and not qualified for the job. She‚Äôs constantly turning off the open signs and shutting off the lights in the restaurant so that customers won‚Äôt come in, and then getting after my co workers saying that we are the reason that the company is losing money. She is pulling rotten food out of garbage cans and selling it to customers, and she vapes in camera blind spots.

My home life is a joke. My parents constantly yell at us for stupid reasons when they get home from the bar every night, and they force us to follow rules that they read in an article on facebook. They are overall some of the most bi-polar toxic people I have ever met, and they get offended whenever we avoid being with them.

I planned a stress relief get-together with my closest friend for today after work, but he tells me that he can‚Äôt make it after I had already been waiting nearly 45 minutes to hear back from him at our usual meet-up spot. It wasn‚Äôt his fault that he couldn‚Äôt make it, but he doesn‚Äôt know how important this get-together was to me.

While I do have a small group of friends I hang out with, no one that I have ever met in person seems to share my interests. I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôll change soon, I‚Äôve started to get into Amateur radios, and I‚Äôm meeting with a local club in a few weeks.",2022-02-17 07:26:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603742350,5,/r/lonely/comments/suiz5h/small_redneck_town/,,0,0,Small redneck town

I wish I wasn't so weak and easily damaged, I wish I could be amused by the small things that make most people happy, but I'm not, because I'm missing what means most to me; Eboni, Morgan, Jake, Kodie, Jadon, Bartek, and Kirsten, and Alicja. But why do I even talk about it anymore? It's done, they won't come back, and I don't deserve for them to either, I dragged them down and nearly burnt them out, I didn't mean to, but hindsight is a bitch.

When you can appreciate the small things, when you can enjoy the comfort of loving someone or a group of people, it makes the small things feel like everything, it gives you a reason to want to live even if it is meaningless in the end.

I've come to the conclusion that, I'm not meant to be loved or cared for, I'm merely a stone that people trip up on and move on from, whereas my problems are mountain ranges I simply cannot surpass.

So moving on from here, after countless suicide attempts, therapy, hospital treatment, medication, what do I do?

2960,sulvb6,Chairbottletooth,"I (male 41yo)just felt like I needed to write this down somewhere. I've done that before a few times, but then when I find it a year or so later in a saved text file on my computer, I get kind of sad that it's just been sitting there and no one will ever open it. 

I want to start out by saying I'm not fishing for sympathy, I'm quite tired of that. I always get the sad ""oh I'm so sorry for you"" look whenever I tell someone about my life. 

A bit over 8 years ago I my body gave up suddenly when out inspecting a nature preserve, luckily my highly pregnant wife was with me so I got home ok. What followed was 2-3 years of not knowing and fighting with doctors until I got my diagnosis, ME (formerly chronic fatigue syndrome). Which doesn't really say anything since it's just a diagnosis for everyone presenting a certain amount of symptoms, you still can't test for it.

Anyway, one year before me and my now wife had moved away from the city I grew up in, Stockholm(Sweden), to √ñrebro, a smaller town. And two months before I fell ill we bought a house, around 30 mins outside √ñrebro(Fjugesta). Needless to say I didn't have that many friends and mostly at work. After I became sick I couldn't work anymore so any social connections I had started, fizzled out. I was also quite a lot worse in the first 3 years of being ill. 

Around six months later my son was born and it was a hard period trying to get my body to work when it didn't anymore. And after that my wife spent around 1,5 years at home (yeah that's a great part of living in Sweden). Then she went back to work and my son started preschool, and I was alone again. Since then we've had our daughter (she's 4 now) so my wife spent yet another year and a half at home. Now I've been alone at home for a few years again. I guess that's the very short backstory of the last 9 years.

Now I'm getting to the part of why I'm writing, I'm lonely. I have no friends anymore and I didn't have time to form any new friendships when we moved and now it's almost impossible since I spent almost all days at home. At most I go shopping sometimes, maybe once a week when I'm well enough. Sometimes we go to the open preschool to meet other parents and kids but it's mostly quite young moms (&lt;25yo). And while I'm not ageist or care if your a man or a woman or anything in-between, we don't have anything in common.

I joined a Facebook group for finding friends in my area, but that feels, in short, mostly like a semi dating group. I feel it's hard enough finding friends at my age, but with my illness(that makes me quite tired and fatigued) it feel completely impossible. I've tried reaching out to other people(and groups) with the same problems I have, but that just ends in me listening to a wall of self pity, just the opposite of what I want and need. Since I fell ill I can't drink anything alcoholic, and that (and having kids) seems to the the go to pastime out here where I live.

I'm not writing this because I think it will change anything, I just needed to vent. My wife is awesome in every way, but it's apparent that she is buckling under the strain of handling so much (even if I do as much as I can). As a side note my son has just been diagnosed with autism and he's having a hard time with everything social, much aggression at home among other things. My daughter was born allergic to just about everything edible, including breast milk... We(90% my wife) have had to fight for every little step for help with both my son and daughter, having just fought for every inch getting my diagnosis. 

Some times I just want to be with someone and not talk about everything crappy in my life. Have someone or someone's to just spend time with, maybe fishing or gaming or whatever.

I've made friends up here and some days feel genuinely ok but I'm falling behind on my work and my fitness, relying more and more on drinking and smoking just to fall asleep or have something to do. I wake up a little bit worse every day and idk what to do anymore. Anything even resembling a relationship in my past was toxic and really changed who I am. I'm so desperately alone even when with people I just want someone to hold and tell me it's going to be ok. I've been trying therapy but it's results are very varied and I feel that I'm only kidding myself that a relationship would fix my problems. I'm so exhausted all the time and I do nothing. This is supposed to be the best years I'll get and I haven't felt good about myself in about 5 years. This whole vent is probably a mess to read it's just more for myself to write some things down.

Idk why but that hurt me, he then told me that if anything we could split a bottle and hope I get ""birthday puss"".

3050,sv16xy,smorganie,"I guess there are a lot of things contributing to this feeling. Last year I left my job as a research associate for a university. STEM fields can be very lonely too. Found out I have complex PTSD and became obsessed with trying to heal myself. Found out adult children of alcoholics seek out ‚Äúfixer-upper relationships‚Äù and realized almost all my friendships require one-sided emotional labor from me. I just can‚Äôt help myself trying to delve into people and really understand what makes them tick. It‚Äôs always bothered me that the same interest isn‚Äôt really returned and that my mental health status is a taboo in conversation. 

Told my best friend all the way from elementary school that our friendship wasn‚Äôt working out and I‚Äôd be ready to talk when she was willing to offer reciprocity in the friendship. No response. She has almost always treated me as the backup friend and only really engaged when she needed someone to talk to. Sticking up for myself resulted in a fleeting sense of self worth. I feel even more like a loser now than I did while I was anxiously hoping she‚Äôd just respond to anything I had to say. 

Went skiing this weekend for the first time ever with some friends. Got in over my head not listening to my comfort level because I didn‚Äôt want to seem lame. Completely ate shit twice down a hill, activated my fear response and was unable to get out of my head for the rest of the time we were there. 

I feel like a loser. Like I have nothing to offer in a friendship but an ear for others. I‚Äôm nervous to initiate conversation with others and don‚Äôt want to be ignored by ‚Äúfriends‚Äù anymore. Most my day i spend fantasizing conversations, conflict, affirmations from people that I‚Äôll never receive. I can‚Äôt think straight. I can‚Äôt have a train of thought without trying to frame it as an actual line of dialogue that I won‚Äôt ever have. I just want peace from this communication obsession.

Yet lately the one thing that put me even further in my hole was getting isolated from everyone. My family only really consists of my mother and father, my two sisters are half sisters and never were apart of my adult life only my younger years. They only came around for money and ditched me any chance they got. My uncles, aunts etc never said happy birthday or ever check in. My grandparents are mostly all dead and the two I have on my mothers side have never had a connection with me so it‚Äôs almost fabricated anytime we talk. When it comes to friends I had a small group of 3 close friends that we‚Äôre practically brothers to me. But lately no one has talked to me, I‚Äôve reached out and even just wanted to hop on discord to talk but no one responds, it‚Äôs gotten to the point I‚Äôve spent a week now just kind of getting deeper into my head and no one has reached out to just say ( hey ). Something so simple that I did frequently just to check in on them or call them. I‚Äôm not upset I‚Äôm just hurt that I have no one in my life anymore, I can‚Äôt tell my parents because we‚Äôve never had an intimate connection where I cry about a topic or share my mental state.

3061,sv2rxp,No-New-Dawn,"The title says it all... S.O. (F28) is slowly leaving me (M34) I can tell. I see the signs and I've tried talking about it, hashing things out so to speak. She isn't having any of it and soon she will be gone. The hardest part is that she still has me thinking there's hope. That she isn't doing these things behind my back or lying to me. I've caught her in several lies already, but she just doesn't realize it... Why haven't I confronted her about these things? I've certainly tried, but every single time she gaslights me into feeling like a shitty terrible person for even daring to bring up such things and I always back down and apologize...   


It's my own fault I suppose. I enable this kind of thing. I'm weak. Pathetic. Desperate. Lonely. I stay around despite how she hurts me emotionally. She hardly considers my feelings... she ignores my messages and in the last few months, she's started talking to multiple guys. ""Friends"" of hers, yet, she doesn't want us to interact, talk or even know about each other. She's distant and keeps her feelings to herself and all I want to do is be there for her...  


I've worked so hard to better myself as a person and a lover and a friend and anything else I can think of. I've come a long way honestly and it's all in part because of her. I love her more than life itself yet... Here I am, despite everything... contemplating how I'll end it all once she's gone.   


I've tried for so long to find my place in this world. I've fought long and hard to achieve what little I have but it's all falling apart. I'm completely numb and the tears won't even come. I feel worthless, burnt-out, and tired... so very very tired.   


It's easy to give up, I know that. Ending it all... taking the coward's way out... its weakness I know that but I don't know if I can do this anymore without her in my life. I have no job. No place of my own. My car is broken down and these days I hardly get to even eat.   


I've truly tried everything I can think of to keep pushing forward in this life but I truly feel like I've reached the end of my rope. No friends. No family. And soon... I won't even have someone I can pretend loves me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at this point I'm shamelessly looking for someone to give a shit about me. Someone to actually care. I know most people who see this post won't make it past the first few paragraphs so I don't even know why I'm bothering with this at all.   


I guess it's because I just want someone to know? Someone to hear me and see me in these final days. I have a dog. So I'll wait for her to reach the end of her days but after that, there's literally no reason for me to continue on.   


I guess despite everything I'm still clinging on to hope.   


Hope that things will change for the better. That my hard work will finally pay off. That I can truly do something with my life. There is still time, I guess, a few years at least but I can't see anything beyond that handful of years except darkness. I can't afford to seek professional help with these issues, I can barely afford to stay alive as it is.   


Sorry, I suppose I'll end the rant here... It hasn't helped much but it does feel better to imagine that somebody out there hears me and gives a shit.

Where do i begin?...is right where i begin.
I can't even promise i will ever reply if i get any comment on this, so please don't be offended.
Maby i delete it tomorrow, maby never.

Im mostly alone these days.
Been like this for a looong time.
Why?
I have a very difficult/complex past.
I experienced a series of traumatic events, spread out through the last 15 years or so...maby even longer.
Some of them are even unexplainable.
Now, im in my mid thirties.

I avoid people and conversations as much as possible, though i easily speak with both known and strangers..
Im kind of introverted, but i surely can be more extrovert than most people, in some occations.

Why do i avoid people?
Because, lets say i meet an old aquatintanence or friend, most of them ask ;
""How are you?""
Or;
""What have you being up to lately?""
Or;
""Do you remember...blah blah blah""
...or other things related to ""the"" or their past.
They tell a story from their past.
I tell a story.
They tell a story...
Mine goes deeper..and deeper..and deeper.

It triggers my mind in a weird way i can't explain..
Its kind of annoying.
Draining.

A friend might start mention something from his past, then suddenly Pandora's box is fully opened, and my difficult past presents itself like pearls on a string, little by little like a red cord of stories that i usually have buried not to be seen or heard, because it is to heavy for most people, makes them uncomfortable in some way, makes me uncomfortable, and it might even go into more existential and spiritual subjects, even to the point of questions about ""the reality"", or experiences in the universe.

Deep down, i litterary didn't wish to talk about it, thats one of the reasons i usually prefer to be alone... but the person next to me more or less initiated the conversation about the past, and...here we are, in the future of uncomfortable feelings.
..and im to blame.

Suddenly it becomes to heavy for them.
I tried to restrain it, but...
They litterary asked for it; ""who are you?""
""What have you being up to?""
..but then i have to put myself into a tiny box..
""Viewer discretion is adviced""
It is heavy for me as well, and in the conversation i have barely scratched the surface.

That's why im where im at this very moment.

They might even judge me, because i prefer to be alone, see me as weird or a loner.

Sometimes i feel less alone when im alone, than when other people are present.
""You need to open up""
""You need to this, that or the other""

(Opens up)
""Please don't talk about this or that.""
""Please keep that to yourself""

Why do some people repeatedly seek contact with me, when they clearly see that we are not compatible?
...When they litterary demand me to be someone else than who i really am in their presence?
...they demand that I become who THEY are.

The times im most lonely, is right after a visit of a ""friend"" or ""aquatintanence"", after a conversation about subjects i most likely wouldnt have thought of if iv just had stayed by my self.

I didn't mean to ""occupy"" the conversation in any way shape or form.
I even got the notion that ""you"" where actually interested in what i was saying, if not i would have shut up long time ago.


After the conversation i might even feel i was somehow unconciously led into the subjects of my past, and when i somehow tell about it, im made to feel like i did something wrong by opening up.

Then im left by myself again, with something that feels like an open wound i didn't have earlier.
A feeling of hurt, lonelyness, sadness, anger...numbness.
Alone.
When i can be myself, without anyone's judgement, restrictions or demands.
When im allowed to reach a state of mind best described as ""comfortably numb"".
When im allowed to just flow, and forget.
When im allowed to just be.
After some time, might be hours, might be days, i slowly feel better again, though the iceberg is still floating in the sea, i can manuvere around it as i please.

They might see ""my story"" as complex and even dominating..
That I was the one who dominated the conversation, though they completly forget about all their empty words and stories  that led the way to the subjects in the first place.
I was listening as well.

I really don't know how to put it...
It all seems insufficient when i put it down ""on paper"", like this.
Like i can't express it in its fullness.
Lack of words and vocabulary.
Painting a colorful picture in black and white.

On the right; ""Please listen to me, Please understand""
On the left; ""Why don't you just leave me the hell alone?!""

Edit;
I'd like to add, it's not everyone this happens with.
Not every time or every conversation. 
But if the conversation goes more in depth, or about the past, politics, religion or philosophy. Booom.
Something triggers it out of the blue, and when the ball starts rolling, it keeps rolling.

Now i don't even know why i wrote all this, so yeah...

3068,sv3pby,Fraunken_Steen,"I recently met my friend ""S"" in October after being introduced by her sister--my co-worker. We really it it off the first night and had great conversation--we had dinner two nights after our first meeting, and were texting morning noon and night.

About two weeks after we met, she gives me a random ""I just want to be friends"". Ok, fine, I can always use more friends, and I do genuinely care about her and like being around her. 

But I would be lying if I didn't think or was hopeful that she was interested in me. 

I guess after a bad break up and being single for almost two years now, and not really having any romantic interests, I was feeling lonely, and maybe was overzealous that a cool, fun, beautiful girl was giving me attention.

Now me and S have gotten close since October and she tells me I'm her best friend, and how lucky she feels to have me in her life, and that I am really the only person outside her family that she trusts. 

I value her and I am not waiting on the sidelines in hopes that she will one day fall in love with me--fuck that noise! And i dont believe in that ""friendzone"" bullshit either, so please dont paint me as some nice guy.

But, i do feel the sting of rejection everytime she tells me about some guy she's going out with, or how hot some guy across the bar is when we go out. She talks about wanting confident, good looking, more successful guys and it makes me feel that I'm not any of those things.

The Friday before Valentine's day she went on a date with some guy--I know it went well because I didnt hear from her all weekend. If a date goes bad she calls me, or if shes just at home with no plans, she will call me over since we live close.

She said me and her should do something for Valentine's Day but she called me that day and said she was gonna hang out with that guy, not even mentioning or seeming to remember she said she wanted to hang out.

But I've been getting less texts from her, less calls, less invites over, and less interaction in general.

I truly hope S connects with this guy, and that she is happy, but I'm starting to feel lonelier than even before I met her.

Now the only texts I get are from my two friends in the group chat I'm in, and some other guy friends.

Its so hard meeting someone romantically, but this is even making me not want to open up to new people at all.

2) move out - covid has prevented this and due to inflation and cost of living (thanks UK Gov). Again, could do this alone but with someone - that could be awesome.

3) date someone fuckin incredible. I could just leave it there.

I would put a goal in here about mental health but it's a rollercoaster of emotions. I can be fine and have really blissful moments but other times I feel alone, sad and wanting the company of someone in my life.

Make a list of all the things you want to do, and everyday start working on those things.  Set small realistic goals.  Know that those feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety are coming and prepare yourself for them.  Know that only you can control how you feel.  Think about what triggered you to feel that way.  Realize that maybe your mind is making very broad generalizations.  Maybe you have conditioned yourself into flawed thinking that everything is black and white.

3109,sv85cj,skullyfaux,"Life has been a complete drag for me lately. I‚Äôm so incredibly lonely. I don‚Äôt have any friends or people really that check on me at all. I literally just go to work and come home. My mom died a couple of years ago and my dad is very distant. I don‚Äôt have any close family &amp; I maybe talk to them every couple of months. No siblings. No one even really knows if I‚Äôm alive or not. I need a social life, I need friends because it‚Äôs just making me very depressed and I don‚Äôt know if my life is going to be like this forever? 

I‚Äôve thought about doing hobbies but I don‚Äôt know what to join at this age. I like art,makeup,movies,fashion. I was thinking about maybe going back to school or college just to interact but I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs possible with work. I‚Äôve thought about taking a foreign language class or looking up a local classes or something I don‚Äôt know ! I‚Äôm trying anything at this point. I have joined some Facebook groups but I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm having luck there. My mom was sick during my teen years so I never went to college and in my early 20s my boyfriend at the time died too &amp; he was the closest thing to me. I didn‚Äôt have friends because he was toxic. Now I‚Äôm at a lost. I‚Äôm getting extremely unhappy and I feel super lost.

Can I build a social life at 27? What are women my age doing even everyday besides work? I don‚Äôt even know what a normal life looks like because I‚Äôm always alone.

3159,svgph0,HUZNAIN,"it's so hard, really hard. 

i (15amab), before (ages 11-13) i am at the phase that i am not that mature, that's why my hopes and motivations are high, but i am already done away from that phase. i am here in the phase that i would understand reality more. 

before, i totally really didn't have any emotional support and guidance, that's why i stood up for myself (which is Great and i am thankful or my past me's choice and courage, idk what am i right now without them), i am really motivated back then. No One is really close to me for two reasons: 1. have a toxic and emotionally absent household, 2. i don't fit-in because i am different. and those two reasons are the ones i am still suffering up until today. 

of course, this lead into isolation, but i was okay and i embraced solitudity, because like i said, i am still in that not much mature phase of high hopes and motivation, that's why i still felt okay. After all, I raised myself starting in my adolescence. 

i am done in that phase and after that, i really felt depressed and suicidal, and i attempted suicide once. i was really emotionally stable back to those days, and now i was really tired of the isolation. and i am just a human, and humans basically needs People Who Truly Really Care And Loves Them, but i didn't have that. and i just realised that all the ""You don't need anybody, being alone is Great"" is just not all true.

people be like ""there really ones who loves you, you just don't acknowledge it."" no. the people who claimed to ""love"" me are the same people who abused and hurt me the most. Also really back-handed. 

i am just also really irrelevant, i don't fit-in, of course there's nothing wrong with that and we're really just not everyone's cup of tea, but again, as a human, i basically just need people who truly wants and loves me. i am so irrelevant and weird. 

In this february i just cried, i really got so emotional that i also cried, i cried because i really don't have a true family, and convinced myself that i really don't deserve it and prayed to G-d about it. i don't know though, maybe if someone would show me care like, ""true care,"" maybe i would resent it because it doesn't feel right because i don't even deserve it, but i don't really deserve it, who am i to think that someone would really come to treat me as real family. 

i also just really tried a long time to find people who me will love me and me love them and to find ""my"" people and family, but nothing really successfully happened, i only got a lot of heart breaks, sadness, and being depressed. No One Really, No One Really. i wish i am dead.

3203,svoda9,XthrOwback185,"I've had a pretty bad day today, all I feel like I do is work and try to keep afloat. And when I finally have some free time, I have no idea what to do with myself. I end up just sitting in my flat, alone, with nobody to talk to.

I don't know what I'm working towards anymore. I'm so fucking lonely, I feel so disassociated from everything, so unattached. I can't remember the last time I met someone and felt something, yet I yearn to have someone to hold, to spend my time with, to even do the most mundane things with. 

Is this what adult life is like? I try to keep a positive outlook, think ""give it time, you'll be happy again"", but I've been saying that for almost two years now and I've never felt sadder. I feel like the more time goes on, the colder and less caring I get.

We exchanged a few messages, and then blocked me without giving any reason. I think it's because we didn't have much in common. But that's no excuse to cut the conversation short like that and straight up block me. I feel mad, but also sad because my anxiety makes me wonder if I did something wrong, although I know I didn't.

So I just wanted to say : when you talk to someone online, remember there's an actual human being with feelings behind the text.

3209,svoq9s,SomethingCleverest,"Just wanted to say... sending cyber hugs to everyone out there feeling lonely. I know there are so many of us. If you don't need someone to talk to, that's all.

If anyone does need someone to talk to... I'm in a good mood and online for the time being. I'm a 42 year old straight male if that matters to you... it doesn't make a difference to me what you are. We can talk about whatever you want. I won't veer the conversation toward myself or anything sexual unless that's something you want to talk about. Just felt like being here for anyone who was feeling lonely.

Topics that interest me include... travel, psychology, religion, mythology, honesty, human sexuality, history, politics, Marvel, gaming (though I'm not at all up-to-date when it comes to this), languages, relationships, love, movies, music (favorites include Nine Inch Nails, Fiona Apple, Beethoven, Eminem, A Perfect Circle, Weird Al Yankovic, Nobuo Uematsu (video game music), movie soundtracks, Billie Eilish, my tastes are literally all over the place), depression and treatments for it, the Middle East, education, animals &amp; pets, Asperger's, photography, art, humor, cars (used to love my '99 Dodge Viper), meaning (of life), philosophy, etc etc... but... we can talk about whatever you are thinking about or are interested in. I don't know much about... sports, fashion, TikTok, crypto, and quite a few other things, but happy to make the attempt to carry on a conversation on any topic.

P.S. this is not a veiled cry for help or attention.... I don't need to talk to anyone right now. I'm actually feeling better than usual at this moment. So... appreciate it... but no need to reach out if you yourself are not feeling lonely right now or like you need someone to talk to. (I mean, I'm open to it, but, not necessary)

And if we don't talk or exchange messages, just know that someone out there cares and hopes you are feeling better sometimes soon.

Together with the pandemic these past two years have been the most lonely and cruel in my life so far.

As I'm 36 I often feel like it will be really hard to find new friends (I'm single but have for the moment given up on the idea of 'finding' a partner). I try to reconnect to old friends but I just don't feel much of a connection anymore, so much has changed. I often feel like it's of no significance that I'm here. I mean, I actually still have dreams but I'm feeling like an alien. There is no one I can really share things with that mean something to me, I miss doing things together, making someone happy, loving someone, feeling like someone cares.

3230,svrorc,VikingTrader1987,"However, sometimes it doesn't really bother me. I don't have a lot of time consumed by social occasions, and I can just do whatever I want. I find it refreshing to do little trips by myself. Three years ago, I holidayed in Edinburgh solo and I had a blast! I didn't have to worry about anyone else but myself. I felt like an awesome lone wolf, and the world was my oyster. 

The one thing I don't miss about having a large social circle is the increased probability of drama and panenonium. From my experience the more people I interact with, the more drama I have to put up with. I'm a firm believer in quality over quantity. I'm happy with having just a handful of good friends rather than having a few good friends, and a lot of crappy ones. I had to learn it the hard way years ago and it was a real learning curve for me. I haven't looked back and safe to say I feel less stressed as a result. It helps that I rarely log into Facebook. That site has passed its prime anyway. 

Dating on the other hand...not all great. It's always been one stroke of bad luck after another. Instead of devoting time to trying to find someone, I decided to devote time to going to the gym and joining an archery club (turns out I'm good for a beginner). The way I see it, if no one wants me, it's their loss, and I'll just devote more time to myself and focus on myself. No point wasting time on people who are just going to screw you over. I'm feeling too old for this crap now...the arguments and the bloody mind games...it's just going to make my hair fall out.

3264,svxaje,merrickpunk,"It's tough to be in this position because I am finally putting into words, how unhappy I have been for awhile now.
After achieving large goals, I was so thankful and overjoyed by finally achieving things I have wanted for so long, and was so thankful. I had met someone and it seemed like icing on the cake.

But it was a facade because what once made me happy, someone close in my life, new friends, new apartment, new job, it slowly became clear that what I thought was making me happy was actually making me miserable.

The apartment was nice, but it made me realize that I am alone in it.

The job was great, but the ups and downs of the emotional rollercoaster at work, was making me miserable.

The new friends were bringing new experiences and fun times, but the deception was making me upset.

The new date was making me experience true moments of happiness and calm, but the abandoning was making feel hurt and alone.

And so what's was an amazing rush of great change in my life, brought me so many blessings and brought me to a place I never thought I would be, the veil of unhappiness is ruining it for me. Life is never perfect, but how can things I truly love and make me feel safe and successful, also make me unhappy.

So now I have to slowly, articulate the small things that crepped in with the blessings, and try and meticulously remove them. Do I do that by making rash decisions? Of course not because it would also remove the blessings in my life. 

So I have to try and find the small things that are making me unhappy and change those, while maintaining the things in my life that bring me joy.

3284,svzzal,llwizll,"

I know this is gonna be a long post so i apologize. I am a 19 year old male and my life has steadily went downhill for the last 4 years. It started when i was 16 and I lost my first ""love"" if you will. I was just so obsessed with this girl, but our relationship was forced to an end because of her parents disapproval of me. I am African American, and they were  an all white family, and they continuously told her how people ""like me"" were scum, how I was just gonna get her pregnant and leave her ""like  all  people like me do"",  how embarrasing it would be for her to have black babies, and many other racist things. Her father threatened to send her to boarding school if we stayed together ( I literally only met her family once and treated them with upmost respect, and I treated her the best I possibly could have) so I knew it was about my skin color. We tried to hide a secret relationship, but there was no point because we both knew it couldnt work after what happened. What makes it ironic is, her father is the Pastor at our local church, AND their family were missionaries in Africa for 15 years before they moved here. What her family said about me ruined me, and I couldnt convince myself for years to get into another relationship. She married last year to the Youth Pastor of her fathers church ( shes 2 years older than me), hurt pretty bad. Eventually last year, I tried again and began another relationship with a white girl, and it was the EXACT SAME SITUATION. Treated her and her family with much respect, but they overall did not want their daughter with a black man, so it ended quick. I have not considered dating since. I want to be in a relationship so bad just so I wont be lonely, but I dont have the courage to. I have no friends, as I went to a VERY small private school, and only had 8 people in my graduating class, and we all went our seperate ways after graduation. I hate going out, no parties, no bars, so I cant make friends that way. I try to message people on dating apps and so on just to make friends. I am not bad looking, Im 6 foot 8, was a division 1 college basketball player (before i got a career ending surgery) and I consider myself pretty funny. I know what youre thinking, how can a tall, funny, college athlete have no friends? I dont know myself, I just dont. I have also been diagnosed with POTS and Chronic fatigue Syndrome as of last year, which has basically made me a lazy bastard who does not have energy to do anything, and makes me feel like I am dying all the time, it is miserable. I am just so miserable I cant take it. I had the girl I loved, a promising career in basketball, good grades, and was happy. And now I am heartbroken, damn near bedridden, had to drop out of school ( scholarship was revoked due to my injury and I cannot afford it on my own), and miserable. I feel stuck, i feel like my life is over. Its so depressing just sitting around all day lonely, barely having the energy to stand up. I am not suicidal but I would not mind if one day I just never woke up. Im sorry this was so long, but I thought it might help to finally have some people to rant to about everything.

I stare at the blank ceiling with the distant sound of TV playing in the living room, I get lost in my thoughts. Most of the time these thoughts aren't good. Most of the time they bring me to tears. This was one of those times. Continuing staring at the ceiling I start to dream of all the terrible doings I had done over the years. As time went on the feeling of hot tears rolled down my face, my nose all stuffed up,¬† and my eyes all puffy and red. I cry and cry for hours on end usually forgetting the real reason for these tears. My eyes start to sting and become heavy, I'm falling asleep. I was not ready for slumber, I forced my sleep-deprived self to stay awake. Hoping for someone to reach out. An hour passes still no notification, another hour after another no notifications. I start to cry again feeling hopeless and useless. Those tears lasted till I fell asleep knowing this was going to repeat the next night.

So, yeah. One 4-mo relationship. Like, that‚Äôs it. All kinds of anxiety, CPTSD, you name it. Attractiveness fail, never been pursued in a non-abusive way. I keep myself busy or high enough (cannabis) to not seriously give in to wanting. 

I‚Äôm fucking lonely.

3299,sw28lb,Extreme_Funny9424,"[*the following are copied and pasted from posts on discord that I started posting on Wednesday when all this bullshit started*]

Wednesday:

I‚Äôve been having a pretty shitty day like non stop. And then I started getting insecure about being single again. Then I go to my art class. And a girl who I was mostly ignoring. Cause I didn‚Äôt want to give her any ideas. Out of no where(it‚Äôs just her and her friend and me in the room at this point). They‚Äôre talking about dating and stuff. And then like she brings up something about how it took her 2 seconds to know she wasn‚Äôt into someone. I thought nothing of it. But then she tells a story about a run in where she just saw the guy he didn‚Äôt do anything she just saw him on a walk and I knew at that moment that guy was me. And she said She looked at him and like ew. I remember that day and I was kinda hunched over cause I was constipated. So like yeah I get that my posture was weird but like. What the actual fuck. And the thing is I‚Äôm not even mad at her. I‚Äôm just so fucking tired of this shit. A. Girls shit talking me for no reason(usually because I end up ignoring them or not looking at them) and B today has just been absolute shit over all and like the consecutive bullshit that had been happening all day can‚Äôt be a coincidence. God hates me. And that‚Äôs that. Fuck

Yesterday:

Didn‚Äôt think it could get worse. But it did. Day four[four days that were bad but the second one where real shit was happening] of an escalating shit storm it seems. On top of constantly having my hope crushed and things pushing the idea that I‚Äôm going to die alone. Our theatre teacher had failed to put up any information on what we were doing today. Surprise surprise I‚Äôm unprepared for all of it. Not to mention an additional bombshell that was dropped regarding a play we have to watch this weekend which I can‚Äôt go see because I have work back home. So yeah. Fuck me. Tomorrow and Saturday are probably gonna get worse. And let me guess. On Sunday or Monday someone drowns and I‚Äôm unable to perform cpr or some other bullshit.

Today:

I ended up feeling lonely alone and fucking tired of being single again for hours. Got desperate and texted a girl who had begged to be fwb a while back. I said no because I wanted standards for myself. Fast forward to now. She‚Äôs even crazier than I remember. So not only that but also I think she completely forgot about our whole ordeal. And so my attempt to get with her failed. And I managed to get embarrassed in public cause we were together at the cafeteria for too long. Then when I‚Äôm finally back. I find out that my suite mate who I‚Äôve stopped being friends with for him being a dick. Well. He now has a girlfriend. FUKC MY FUCKING COCKSUCKING FUCKING FUCK LIFE. FUCK GOD FUCK ME FUCK ALL OF THIS SHIT",2022-02-19 05:14:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611945478,2,/r/lonely/comments/sw28lb/what_the_actual_fuck/,,0,0,What the actual Fuck
3300,sw2bjr,stayingstillwhenlost,"Losing all my friends was a slow process and I didn‚Äôt realize it happened until recently. 

First it was a big car accident that left me in rehabilitation for years, then it was having a surprise pregnancy and then it was becoming a parent during Covid and battling PPA. 

The cherry on top is that my claim for the accident settled last year, but during the process I found out a handful of friends (we were a tight group) all actively disclosed information about me to the lawyers of the insurance company (note: one of the members of this group was driving the car I was in during the accident). Even though I had nothing to hide. The insurance company ended up settling with me because their snooping was fruitless. But I feel so betrayed. I did everything right. I was honest, transparent, hardworking and eager. I climbed out of a hellish pit and found new success. Why would they do this? 

For perspective I was finding lots of success before my accident and was heading towards a great career. The accident derailed that and I spent years in full time therapies to get somewhat back to where I was. I had to walk with a walker, I gained a ton of weight and had to leave both my job and school. Throw pregnancy and a pandemic on top of that. But, by the time I settled I had gone back to school and graduated on the deans list. Got into a competitive graduate program. Lost all the weight I‚Äôd gained. And had finally come out of my depression. 

So now, here I am, with only a few friends that don‚Äôt live anywhere close to me. I want friends but don‚Äôt trust anyone. Despite being lonely I don‚Äôt want anyone in my life other than my family, husband and child.

Besides that, other day I started crying because I wanted a hug so much, and kept imagining how it would feel. Even my heart beat faster with the thought of being so close to someone.

3323,sw5i6r,Mizukage_4412,"Hi, I'm 26f and I don't have many friends.
I'm an introvert which is probably part of the problem, but I've often tried to make new friends or put in a lot of effort to keep the few friendships I had alive but I never got back much. 
People almost always told me they wanted to be friends and hang out with me but then never had time when I asked and never wrote me or called me again.
It really has been like that my whole life and I just can't figure out why. I often feel so lonely and disconnected..

Fortunately today I do have a sweet boyfriend who is there for me but we have a long distance relationship and will have one for at least 2 more years so we don't see each other often and even if we did, he is still my partner and is not supposed to replace a stable circle of friends. 
I also do have like 2 or 3 other friends I can talk to if I need to, but they also live quite far away so we rarely really meet. 
And again, usually I am the one who's checking up on them, rarely the other way around..

Sometimes I just feel like everybody already has enough friends and is well connected with others. Everybody, except for me. 
I just can't seem to find people who share my interests (which might be a little unusual for a girl I must admit) or want to get to know me anyway. And I just don't know why really.


How about you? 
Do you have any tips/suggestions what the problem might be?

*What then, at the end of all things, is there inside of me?*

*When my anger has melted into oblivion and the hurt that chains me dissipates by some strong wind, what then is left behind?*

*When all that I am is poured out upon the ground, and the very foundation of my being seems to collapse into the chasm of my heart, what then am I?*

*I am alone.*

*So indescribably...alone.*

*My soul is bound to a road of tormenting solitude, and I am stopped by some great force from enduring the suffering of my journey on the shoulder of another.*

*Is there nothing for me?*

*Nothing and no one?*

*Why then do I chance the perils of this mortal coil, when deep in my heart I accept that no other soul will bind to mine?*

*Am I of the chosen, who, being bound already to the endurance of this wretched existence, are cursed also with the sting of loneliness?*

*In lifting my gaze to the heavens, I receive no answer.*

*Nobody responds.*

*If beyond the farthest reaches of this reality there exists one or many who my journey set before me, why then do they not answer?*

*If forbidden is my bond to another, all then that I desire is to know.*

*Why am I so utterly alone?*

*Alone, and naked in the dark?*

*I am fearful.*

*I fear not the reduction of the body to dust and bone, but of the the prospect of wandering aimlessly through this living hell in silent solitude.*

There's a lot wrong with me and I think I know how to start making things better for myself (working out, eating healthy, trying to socialize more) but I just keep fucking giving up cuz I lose faith in myself and its been happening for years. So every bday is also a reminder that not much is changing in my life and makes me feel like a failure. Two of my older brothers are out being independent and living on their own making bank and then there's me still living with my mom and younger sister, going to college with no job or passion for anything. Doesn't help that one of my brothers come over to visit every Wednesday (but this time today for my bday) and makes me feel like garbage even more (not exactly his fault. he keeps talking about his sex life but isn't a condescending asshole to me about it or anything.

She is not perfect and maybe not even my type. But having her around is fun. And I'd like to believe I'm there for her. 

Today a friend walks up to me and says that I have to cut her off. Apparently I tend to overshare and me, being a senior, cannot do it to a junior, especially a girl. That I must do the right thing and cut her and everyone else who is a junior off. My batchmates and my seniors don't care about me and I have no friends, despite trying so much. 

I think I've lost the one thing I could hold on to. I have major depression and severe chronic anxiety disorder and I have nobody to talk to. My family doesn't allow me to see my psychologist anymore and I cannot afford to pay for therapy. I'm back to reddit because it's always been my last option to atleast have a one way conversation.

3375,swf0so,pockets2tight,"Oh wow, thanks. If only I‚Äôd known 8 years ago that I‚Äôd get out of this by just putting a particular pair of underwear on, it‚Äôd have changed so much.

I thought I was depressed because of my life long social and general anxiety that through the years eroded my life despite the fact that I‚Äôd wake up every morning saying ‚Äútoday is the day I change‚Äù and go to bed without having been able to overcome my fear and timidity.

So one day I realized I‚Äôd never change, and having that epiphany, and the implication that I then would never be able to live a life I enjoy and pursue what I want, I completely collapsed into a depressive state where daily I‚Äôd question the value in living.

I saw my friendships dissolve one by one until none remained. Every romantic prospect was in actuality never really one. My anxiety around women became even more severe and I‚Äôd go years without even a hug.

I thought maybe the chronic loneliness, deprivation of sex, lack of any intimacy, and growing, raging jealousy might have had something to do with it.

Watching every limited year of my life be ticked off without any good memories. Knowing each day I was closer to dying, and that my young adulthood was being robbed of me, every Normal human experience alien to me, every healthy life milestone not being met, whether it be a sex life, career, or even simply a healthy relationship with a female, I thought some of those might be the problem.

Every effort I made that was a failure, every time I tried to branch out, I strained to expand my comfort zone and was disappointed by the ensuing failure, every endless night, kept awake by thoughts conjured in the deepest recesses of a nefarious abyss, depriving me of a healthy sleep pattern, keeping me uncontrollably fixated on every failure, every unfulfilled primal desire I had.

I want nothing more than to share my life with another man and get married and be loyal to one person, but at the rate I'm going, i cant even get someone to watch a movie with me let alone anything further.   I recently lost my job working in a grocery store through a third party app due to covid, so the app says... Well now i cant get hired anywhere because i have an old dui on my record and i have an old conviction involving theft.  I mean NO ONE will hire me.  After the background check is run, the company usually just leaves it up to the background checking companies notification emails to take back the offer of employment.  So, im reduced to doing surveys online and allowing certain apps to have access to all of my personal and private data and also to watch everything that i do online on my phone in exchange for about 200$ a month in total, which pays my cable internet bill after whatever the emergency broadband govt program doesnt cover and my daily necessities for myself and my dog, which is my only friend, and i dont even think she is happy that i rescued her from the pound with how bored and miserable she acts all the time.  Im lucky i have HIV and get section 8 housing assistance from the federal government, otherwise i would just be another homeless statistic right now.  So my reason for going into all of this is to show you, the reader, that i have nothing to offer anyone, in a friendship or anything beyond that.  I just sit here in my apartment day in and day out with no visitors and no one texting on my phone anymore.  When i reach out to people i once was at least aquaintances with, they never have the time to bother to respond to me.  I vowed to never let myself get utterly friendless again after briefly being in this position 20 years ago when i was 20 years old, yet here i am again, faced with the fact that it takes friends to make friends, and no one wants to be friends with a really tall goofy looking white gay dude who has no interest in sports, cant drive thanks to the dui, has no money or job, has nothing to offer, except for AIDS.    And this city i live in, Tucson, has got to be the worst city as far as people and their personalities or lack there of goes.... I just dont know anymore.... I need a miracle right now to get me out of this rut that im stuck in.   I just wish i could earn regular money, then i could turn my life around no problem.  You would think with this labor shortage, i would have no problem finding a job, but it's next to impossible.  I just read an article today that says there are millions of men in this country from the ages of 28 to 40 who are in my position with a blemished record and are unhireable by these companies who wont budge on their hiring standards and would rather go out of business rather than get employees who want to work.

3398,swiziz,Serendipitytrees,"I never thought I would post on Reddit and here I am. I don't mean this in a condescending way. I'm 19 turning 20 this year and this terrifies me. I haven't done anything on this planet since my existence.  I'm immature for my age and dumb. One of my biggest insecurities is how dumb I am. I don't like talking to a lot of people because I sound dumb. I don't know anything and I'm terrible at everything. I'm not independent enough for my age and this concerns me. Time is going so fast that I can't keep up anymore. I am on the spectrum which makes socializing hard. I got my diagnosis at 15 and had a hard time accepting it. I wish I had a lot more energy than I currently have. I would also say I'm incredibly boring as a person. I have no humor I'm very serious by nature. I wish I could make more people laugh. English is also not my native language so I apologize in advance for my English. I was born to older parents and I am an only child. My cousins are like 16 years older than me so I couldn't connect with them either. Never met either of my grandad's. I'm too self-centered and I realized this.  I have always wanted a group of girlfriends and I know lots of females don't have a group of girlfriends but that would be my dream. I feel disgusting like I'm always dirty and fat. I have no romantic experience whatsoever. I know I should take responsibility for this and make a move I know. I have missed connections my whole life and felt lonely. I have never really hung out with friends. Got proper friends for the first time in high school but after school, they didn't want to hang out with me. I feel rejected and I have tried and tried to be active when it comes to making friends. People talk about hanging out with friends like it's just an everyday thing and for me, it's a huge privilege. Summer vacations were always the worst when I was younger. I saw a ""friend"" one time for 3 hours during a 2-month summer break. I know that these are first-world problems so I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful. It's just frustrating feeling like you're never worth anyone's time. What do they have that I don't? I also want to feel wanted at some point. Not just people being disappointed when it's you. The disappointment on their face when they see it's you. You just feel like this fat disappointment.

3431,swmr3e,Schmile13,"I thought I had experienced friendship when I was younger. They were supposed to be people you hung out with and did things together right?

But I could never feel comfortable. I could never feel okay enough to be myself. I always felt this extreme pressure to make sure I ""entertain"" and care for them, I could never bother them with my dumb shit. I had to be there for them, because that's what a good friend does.

Of course it just led to me suffering burnout because it eventually became exhausting to have to take on that role all the time, there was never an opportunity for me to be myself. I ended up experiencing panic attacks, because people wanted to hang out with me, and I just wanted to get away, to recharge, to not have to feel that constant pressure and anxiety.

But even when I isolated myself completely, and had literally nobody to talk with, I could still always feel that everburning desire for companionship, and the horrible dread of loneliness.

So during the lockdowns last year, when I realized that literally nothing in my life had changed at all with all the restrictions, I tried to reach out to people on friend-finding subs. To perhaps find someone I could talk to.

I stumbled upon this one post right here on r/lonely, which shocked me to my core. It was so extremely well written, it was so sensitive, and so open. They talked about how lonely they felt, how they just wanted to feel a connection with anyone, talk about whatever is on their mind, to show love and appreciation.

It felt like I was reading a post by a more eloquent and smarter version of myself. And talking even more with this person just kept on revealing more of their saintly understanding and compassion. I didn't know this persons name or gender. But their writing made me feel so fucking strongly. I literally fell in love with this person, just from their thoughts. As a presumed straight guy, I felt like the physical traits, had ceased to matter as much. I loved this person for their sensitivity and wisdom. I **needed** to be close to this amazing soul, no matter what.

Having shared hobbies and interests did not matter one bit to me, to me it felt a thousand times more important to know if they had a similar loving view on humanity and kindness.

After talking for days on end about tragedies and horrors that we had experienced and were experiencing, I asked what her name was. I revealed my name, and she admitted that she thought that I was woman as well, by my words and messages.

Having been so incredibly lonely for so long, my mind went into extreme overdrive. I apologized to her and admitted that I had never felt so connected to someone before, and that I was developing an extreme crush and infatuation with her. And she showed me nothing but acceptance and encouragement. She was happy that she could give me those feelings.

I apologized for appearing obsessed or too intense, because I knew how I was going to act. And again she told me that I should never apologize for being myself, and that any amount of intensity had would never scare her off. She told me I could reply as many times in a row as I wanted, she would appreciate each and every thing I told her.

I was so completely fucking overwhelmed, by this brilliant and loving soul. She made me feel valued. She made me feel appreciated. She made me feel like a human being for the first time in my life. She taught me to love myself. To not suppress and hide myself. I felt more comfortable in her presence than I had ever done previously. Talking with her was my favourite thing to do in the whole world.

Any time she had replied, all my fears and anxieties were just swept away, I felt happy, I felt energetic. I wanted nothing more than to spend every waking moment with her. It was a completely new thing to me, I actually **gained** energy and strength by talking with her. That was when I realized what it really meant to have a friend. For the first time in my life I wasn't afraid of scaring someone away. I wasn't afraid of bothering her with ""meaningless drivel"". The fact that she accepted me so much, meant that I learned to accept **myself**.

I was a depressed sad sack barely capable of doing anything. But thinking about her, and how much I cared for and wanted to be there for her. It revitalized me. I suddenly had untold energy and determination and motivation. I wanted to live my life, for her sake.

And the world around me changed. The sun started shining brighter, I could hear the birds chirping, I could literally appreciate flowers. I felt like I had to find beauty out in the world to share with her. I felt alive. I wanted to start decorating my apartment, because for so long, even since I was a small child, I had never cared for anything like that. I was fine with bare white walls. But something made me realize how empty it felt, how I wanted to take space and make it my own. She literally brought color into my life.

Everything I ever struggled with for almost 30 years, was worth it, because I got to connect with the most beautiful soul ever in my eyes. And I can be glad that I feel so intensely, so overwhelmingly. Because it is the greatest feeling in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

This is only a small part of a long story, and it's already extremely long, but I just wanted to share my experiences, of what it has meant to me, to find a kindred soul. To be accepted. It surpassed my wildest dreams and expectations. And I'm so grateful that I never stopped trying to find her, even after decades of failures. She saved me from a life of nothingness. My hero and my idol.

3447,swous2,Human_Operation8589,"Well to make I long story short I was talking to this girl for several weeks we both pretty much fell in love as it seemed but she moved a couple states away so we couldnt be actually together at the moment but we were fine woth that... We wanted to start a family right now even though we were apart and I was fine with that because she planned to move back in a few months... Well I knew she was extremely horny alot so I was fine if she went to find a fling once in awhile we both were ok to an open relationship to a point... Well yesterday she seemed off in the morning before she went to work amd when she messaged me she told me she took the day off because the job was stressful and she didnt feel good which I already knew, but she just seemed off in her replies and didnt message again until this morning... She was hesitant to say much but then she told me she went out and got drunk and went home with a guy which I was fine with but she kept saying she felt so bad because it wasnt me she was with and asked me how she could make up for it and all I said was I would like for us to do more sexy things over the phone which we have talked about alot but she was pretty shy on the phone she claimed... Well this girl woke up everyday and always sent me naked pics and vids playing in the shower every morning and was always initiating sexting everyday simce we could physically touch amd I thought we were happy as we could be for our situation... Well after I asked if we could do more on the phone she replied several minutes later saying that ahe hates sexting and would rather have hands on her body which i replied I know and we will be together soon.... I get busy with work for the day and checked in to see how her day was going and im blocked on snap so I txt her and no responce either... Now I know I shouldnt be broken up about it as much as I am but damn it hurts investing time like that to be ghosted again... I should have known better with her being way better looking than myself... Idk maybe it is better to be that asshole guy that just fucks and forgets and never worry about love again

3453,swplji,PlayfulBeyond9699,"I am being devoured by my loneliness. I have tried everything but no one seems to want me relationship wise, friendship wise. No one really wants to interact with me. I am so tired of the gaslighting I see and have experienced myself of not trying hard enough when I know I have tried. Even if I or others hadn't does that mean we deserve to be alone? There's plenty of horrible evil people who make no effort to keep their spouses or friends yet can with ease. 

I wake up alone, I spend all day anxious about one thing or another, I gorge on food or starve myself depending on how weak I feel, then I shift my focus to hobbies. Get bored, go to sleep. Repeat over and over again. After a while I'd just sleep for as long as possible to avoid dealing with the day because there's nothing for me in it. That doesn't help because then I face the night alone I can't escape it. 

I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like to have a loving family, a loving partner, loving friends. Someone that truly loves you as much as you love them. Never had it, I always loved more. I can't fucking take it anymore I am tired of being so lonely and in so much pain. 

I remember being on another subreddit and someone rather cruelly posted images of those that had committed suicide to deter suicidal people like me. It did nothing for me but make me feel nauseous for a little while. I felt like it was disrespectful to the deceased and just cruel to suicidal people who'll see it, plus I've reached the point of no return nothing will really stop me if I get a good chance to end my life.

3459,swqil8,[deleted],"I've been told by other men even that the only way ill ever be with a woman is if ""I have a lot of money"", and so on. 

I ask men who have tons of random hookups with very attractive women, they even share the women and get the sex offered to them for free, I asked how I can get a woman attracted to me, and get told, ""you.... uhhh you're gonna have to have a lot of money."" I was told by a woman the other day the only way a girl might see me as a potential partner is if and I quote ""am able to provide for her where she doesn't have to work and have my own house, a car just for her and am able to provide for her kids"". I am all fine with wanting to provide for MY kids, I'm trying to get a good job and am in technical school, but wow. 

The contradictions seem to also come, people saying ""oh you notice they get sex! that means you're objectifying women! they can sense it!"" me wanting sex doesn't mean I'm objectifying anyone, in fact, telling me I need to offer money and materials to be seen as a human being is objectifying ME as someone who ""provides and offers materials"" basically dehumanizing me into a walking-talking-ATM.

If you complain, you are silenced. ""We don't allow generalizations in this subreddit!"" it's a personal experience it's not a generalization... 

Although it may be anecdotal it is what I've gone through and to crush my feelings and my emotions and just say ""get over it"" or ""you're playing the victim"" and allowing others to say things that are bullying and borderline harassing and just sitting back about it shows that there is some pleasure in seeing men like me suffer. 

I am sick and tired of it.

3461,swqmma,AffectionateRepair7,"I went through a pretty awful breakup 10 months ago. We were living together when I discovered he had essentially been living a double life. He was paying rent for two different places, had another girlfriend, and was fucking multiple other women on top of everything. We had been looking at rings together and I really thought he was it. I was completely blindsided and devastated. I moved out into a single bedroom apartment and started a new job that I love. I‚Äôve healed a ton since then and I‚Äôm really happy with the life I‚Äôve created for myself. I dated a bit after the breakup but I think I‚Äôm still in a place where I‚Äôm too emotionally unavailable to be dating others.

Im not interested in hurting others or wasting their time. I‚Äôm actively involved with my community, have great friends, and many hobbies.

3469,swrmmh,i_got_your_nose420,"Why is this happening? I have no idea on whats actually happening, but I don't feel good at all anymore. Ive been having panic attacks every 3 days since the past month. Now, i can't seem to be able to stop it so I've come to terms with it. I really really hate this. It hurts. I wake up in a cold sweat almost everyday during the middle of the night. I can barely fall asleep. 
It takes me atleast an hour to get just a little bit sleepy. I cry during this time to let out my emotions, and so that my eyes get tired and i can fall asleep. Crying used to help alot before, as I felt way better the next day. But it seems to have taken the better of me and now I feel just as bad if not worse the next day. My eyes are tired everyday because i cant sleep, and because I can't stop crying every night. 
I have voices in my head that used to laugh at the terrible jokes i made up but now, they just laugh at me. At night they scream. Its like tinnitus but higher pitched, sounding more like real people, and they sound really desperate and long for something, but they never tell me. 
I feel left out. No, not of a friend group or something. My friends are fine as they are and i would change nothing about them. I just feel left out from life. I feel alive, just dissociated. Even though its actually nothing, I still feel left out. I don't know what it is, but i have a feeling it'll last my entire life and I'll never know what I wanted.
I can't say anything like this to my parents because they'll shrug it off as typical teen behaviour, and i cant say this shit to my friends either because i feel like it would ruin our friendship.
I get thoughts of suicide every few minutes, or just anytime something inconvenient happens. Nothing can stop them, not even me myself.
I have no one to say this to so i just type it out on a notepad lmao. Sometimes, doing this kinda helps because i can look at my trouble as a whole and maybe figure out a solution.

3506,sww1ml,michaelk528,"First post here. Hi yall.

Been going through a long depressive spell. Longest I‚Äôve ever been through. But something new this time is the pervasive feeling of isolation.

I work ridiculously long hours. I‚Äôm awake before everyone at home, I get home when everyone‚Äôs asleep. I typically don‚Äôt have any social energy after a long day of work and my friends all have daytime jobs. So I end up being skipped over a lot.

I find it hard to establish and maintain new relationships right now. I‚Äôm as single as one can be because I simply cannot create spare time. I try, but it never goes anywhere because of this.

And this is how I feel completely isolated even among people. It‚Äôs like I walk this earth with a bubble around me. I can see others, and even interact with them. But I can‚Äôt get close to them. I‚Äôm stuck just watching, by myself.

I‚Äôm tired of it. Tired of slaving away at work but I can‚Äôt just stop it on a dime. I know there‚Äôs others in this same boat, and it eases my mind a little because I know there‚Äôs at least one person out there that understands.

I just want to reconnect. Live. And be happy. But I guess I can‚Äôt do any of those things right now. But oh how I long for them. 

How I wish to just walk this path with someone, just to quell the loneliness. To know another presence is actually alongside me. 

And I wish I could do the things that used to make me happy with the same passion and vigor as before. But the isolation saps my energy for any of it.

I‚Äôm losing hope that things will ever get better.",2022-02-20 07:53:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585518533,2,/r/lonely/comments/sww1ml/isolation_even_among_others/,,0,4,"Isolation, even among others."

I‚Äôve had no significant relationships outside my parents nearing 3 years now. I dropped out of my previous high school in the middle of my sophomore year and am about to graduate at a different fully virtual school in a couple months. Having no in-person interaction with anyone at my current school allows me to get away with being a social hermit. While I appreciated it in the beginning‚Äîand it may have been good for me initially, since my old school left me absolutely destroyed mentally and emotionally‚ÄîI have been left with no one. I‚Äôve tried to rekindle some relationships from the past, but nothing stuck. My one friend, who I consider the only best friend I ever had, moved away from me physically and emotionally, as she found a partner that ultimately left no room for me. I‚Äôve tried to look outward for people; to go online and make some friendships there, but over the years I have developed a bunch of anxiety, intrusive thoughts, self doubt, etc. that it takes so much out of me to write something so simple in a public chat that I can‚Äôt make myself known again until a number of weeks. It‚Äôs to the point where the simple, but probably useful advice of ‚Äújust be yourself‚Äù only leaves me struggling to remember who I am.

Thanks to anyone if you read this. I wish you the best in finding some friends.

3532,sx0ir0,Efficient_Cheetah_61,"I'm 25m, I grew up never close to any of my family, I love my parents and little sister though. I feel like that is one of the reasons why I feel alone? Sometimes I think about finally meeting the person I would spend the rest of my life with. Them accepting me for everything that I am and for every mistake that I had made in life. For them, I would love them in their entirety and make sure I would never hurt them, to make them feel loved. Having a son, daughter or both. Making sure my family feels loved and cared about. I would never want my kids to feel like they don't matter.

Sometimes this vision of my future just feels so blurry and sometimes I just feel no hope. Even just a friend who cares for me would be nice.

3555,sx4ya0,CanadienNerd," Hi 25F here.

Kissless virgin and I'm tired. I'm just so fucking tired of it. I've been alone my whole life. Never went on a date, never had a guy interested in me, when I try to initiate things, the guys I'm texting only reply with short answers and one-word replies. If anything. no one ever wanted anything romantic or intimate with me. Nothing ever.

At this point, my body just feels wrong. I hate it. I know what I need but I cannot get it. I will never get it. and my body will just continue to feel wrong forever. and I cannot do anything about it. I'm just wrong. Something clearly is wrong with me.

Why you may ask?

Because toxic people that are ugly inside and out in my entourage can get partners anytime they want. They all have people running after them to get with them. They are wanted. While I cannot get one guy to look at me for more than 5 seconds. I'm not here to talk about if these people deserve it or not.

The point is that if these people get relationships while I don't. Then I am worst than all of them.in all the ways possible. It must mean that i am worth less than shit. Worthless, like trash. Why then has no one ever shown *any* interest in me? why then do i have to endure listening to these people shit and abuse their partners while i have to be alone? What could be so fucking wrong with me.

Something is. I know. There *has* to be something. But i don't know what it is.

And at this point, it's too late for me.

My body will just have to feel wrong forever.

You cannot salvage such useless trash.",2022-02-20 16:25:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1488506055,16,/r/lonely/comments/sx4ya0/what_is_wrong_with_me_then/,,0,28,What is wrong with me then ?

Yeah.. I know it seems pretty normal to everyone but I have never felt so crushed and heart broken. 

I was completely traumatized and since then developed a severe social anxiety and trust issues and couldn‚Äôt make any new friends . 

I have a boyfriend and he is my bestfriend but most nights i‚Äôm still overwhelmed with loneliness and cried my eyeballs out. I felt so pathetic and worthless. I tried to reach out and make friends on Bumble despite my anxiety but no one really clicked and were all unmatched a few sentences in. Even if I like someone I would later saw pictures of them with their besties on Instagram and that makes me feel really pity.

 1. I have no friends really. I was best friends with 2 sisters and our friendship ended a year ago because of petty stuff, and it ended pretty badly. They were really my only close friends.        

2. I‚Äôm 24 and never been in a relationship. Dating had never been easy or casual for me. I didn‚Äôt go on my first date until I was 21 and that was with the person that gave me my first kiss. He ended up ghosting me. I was recently talking to this guy for a few weeks and he was courting me properly. We really liked each other and I was starting to think he‚Äôd soon be my boyfriend. Then yesterday he told me he‚Äôs legally married bc he had to marry for immigration papers. He says that he and the girl barely talk and that they don‚Äôt even like each other. But I‚Äôm honestly not comfortable dating someone who is legally married regardless of the nature of the relationship.

3. My only friends are my Mom and cousins. I‚Äôm super grateful for them however they have their own friends and significant others . 
4. I‚Äôm jealous of my cousins. They‚Äôve been dating since high school. If they breakup with their boyfriends, I guarantee not even a year later they already had a new one. And they also have friends. They have social lives. 
 I‚Äôm ambitious. I‚Äôm studying to get into law school, and trying to build my portfolio because I want to be a model. But that‚Äôs all I look forward too. But those things are materialistic to me. I want to be loved romantically and have girls to hang with üòî. That would truly make me happy.

What is this place anyway ? Lonely people ? Do you know why you're lonely ? Well I know because I've been lonely for a very long time now and I think way too much about EVERYTHING. You are lonely because the way society is built WANTS YOU to be lonely. A high percentage of lonely people have thoughts that keeps everyone far from them. What are those ? Well what would you think if I say to you that everybody's thinking about suicide but people who are actually suicidal people are marginalized cuz everybody's afraid of them just because they are afraid of they own thoughts about that ? Fucking ''normal people'' are rejecting eccentric people because society is built in a way that executive orders doesn't want to be overrun so they tell people since they're kids how to think so they can crush us below their shoe without any sanctions. It is called MORAL GENOCIDE but noone seems to give a fuck because everyone already learned that ""We're the most advanced civilization of all times"" ""Terrorist are the true murderers"" (Don't talk about G.W.Bush) ""drug dealers are the real criminals"" ""You have to make a lot a money to be proud of yourself"" ""Oh you don't have any dreams ? No worries, we have brand new plastic smelling dreams for you"" ''You can't beat somebody more strong than you"", yea well you know what ? Strength is not having money or goods or knowledge, this is their own fucking definition.

3578,sx93do,PlayfulBeyond9699,"I made the mistake today of looking at an ex friends instagram. She was a horrible person, I hope she's gotten better but who knows. She dumped me for her new set of friends a few years back, made it very obvious and prior to that was racist to me. It stings because I still miss her, when you're as lonely as I have been and continue to be the few friends you do make you admire even when they've treated you like shit.

When I looked at her instagram I saw how she was in an amazing relationship, and was close friends with my old 'best' friend. They cut me out of the loop because of my poor mental health, but still remained best buds. I am bitter and furious about it. Why does she get access to such a good life while I have been working myself to the bone and got nothing to show for it. I want to say things will get better for me but it's been 6 solid years now of being alone, by myself day in day out and things haven't improved. I've done everything to try and form a connection with others nothing sticks. I can't form friendships, I can't form relationships no one wants anything to do with me. People are nice enough if needs be but basic civility is to be expected it doesn't really mean anything long term. 

I think in particular I resent how easy it is for her and others to enter relationships, I can't even get one guy to message me back. Every single guy has ghosted me, blocked me when they've seen what I look like or treated me as cheap entertainment when they're bored or lonely. I am sick of it.

Reflecting on a bigger scale, all the worst people from my school did the best in life. As is the case in life. No one wants to be around someone that even suffers slightly from mental health issues unless you keep it bottled up. Of course all the most horrid people prosper because they have some sort of privilege that helps them along the way whereas I have nothing.

People touch their hair and talk about how hot they are, and no ones ever even so much as batted an eyelash at me. It makes me feel so lame and alone.

Every time I try to plan something and send prices and stuff for vacation packages (as cheap as I can find) her response has always been ‚Äòooh, that sounds good‚Äô and she never gets back to me about it.

A few weeks ago, I had an idea to book a short trip to Disneyland straight after a concert to see a musician that we both mutually enjoy (I bought the tickets months ago) so I messaged her to ask her travel plans for the next few months in case she wanted to come with me. 

She responded, ‚Äòoh, Im going to France in a couple of weeks‚Äô. So I kinda just left it at that, since I figured she wouldn‚Äôt want to go a second time in such a short space of time.

So today, I‚Äôm scrolling through my a Instagram feed, and the first thing that comes up are photos of her at Disneyland Paris, with a friend of mine who I was very close to in high school who now lives in France. I felt sick to my stomach.

Am I being unreasonable for being really upset and annoyed that she went there without telling me or asking if I wanted to come with her? She knows how much I wanted to go on a trip with her there and how close this friend is to me. Would it have been too much to ask me if I wanted to tag along, especially when I‚Äôve tried to plan something for ages and she never took it seriously?

A couple of years ago, I met someone. At the time, we weren't the greatest of friends, but that slowly changed in recent years. She always made me laugh and make my day. Even if it was a shit one. She seemed to shine every day. We talked every day, even on snap. There were days when we just talked on the phone for hours. At the time, the doubt had already crept in. ""Why was she, my friend?""I don't provide anything in the friendship."" Or ""does she pity me for being alone all the time?"" Almost every time I was with her, I had those thoughts. Eventually, I thought maybe I should ""free her,"" but I never could muster the strength. Then, she changed schools. I thought she would just drop me, finally able to leave me behind. To my surprise, she didn't. Why? Again, I never added to the friendship. It's just my usual quiet self. We kept talking but slowly drifted. We still talk, but not like we used to. Now I miss her. I've never felt this way; I've never wanted to see someone again like this. But I don't like her like that, do I? To this day, I still don't know. Am I in love? Or just in denial? Is this loneliness? Wanting someone who you can't have? Not being with them? 

This is more nonsense, I wanted to get off my chest.

I genuinely cannot see why a bi man would choose to date me over a woman.

3749,sxw9re,Jibu_LaLaRoo,"Yesterday I really needed to cry because work was stressing me out making me question why did I fucking bother coming to this field.

Come lunchtime I smashed a whole pepperoni pizza with garlic butter just to quell any emotion I had. I wish I had a more secluded of a place to have eaten my meal because I would‚Äôve been crying my eyes out thinking about how lonely I am. Nobody to come home to. Nobody to make this worth it. Living for myself has never been an option.

It frustrates me even to see people in my life get along in life with nothing but sheer luck and attitude when they are perhaps one of the most insufferable people to talk to and how can they be the person to always piss off someone yet somehow come out on top?

‚ÄúThe grass is always greener they say.‚Äù

Look, fuck you. I haven‚Äôt had someone kiss, hug, or hold me or me hold someone in years. I want a reason to live. I don‚Äôt have a purpose and I certainly am not living for myself. My ambition is squat. I want to live FOR someone. Through them. I want to support them. I want to be there. I want affection. I want to feel like belong. 

I want to feel like I actually was made properly for this world. Im nobody‚Äôs option. 

They say nobody wants to be around someone who is depressed all the time. I crack jokes. I genuinely enjoy my time and myself. I do feel a sense of hating myself but that only stems from the fact that for as long as I‚Äôve lived nobody has ever loved me. Loved on me. Held me. I want some kind of affection. 

I‚Äôm so alone it hurts. 

I‚Äôm so scared of even trying dating again for a multitude of reasons. 

I always feel like I‚Äôll just be one of the many people cheated on. Thinking about of all the possible reasons someone would probably cheat on me for. 

Maybe I‚Äôm boring. Maybe I‚Äôm annoying because I talk too much. Maybe I‚Äôm too forgetful. Maybe I‚Äôll do something I don‚Äôt realize is an issue until it‚Äôs brought up. 

I feel so dejected by life and by women. I just want to fill this void that feels like a black hole gradually eating me from the inside out at times telling me to just end it all because you are not worth a damn. The proof being nobody acknowledges me. I‚Äôm just a background character despite how goofy I try to be just to get people to laugh. 

Not like being with someone would solve all my problems. It would just give me something other than myself to live for. Because doing what I do is not worth it. It‚Äôs a meaningless existence.

Relationships have their issues. They take work. It isn‚Äôt a fantasy. I know all of this. I want to come home to something to make life seem worth it. There is nothing for me and I want it so much so bad. I‚Äôm willing to put myself last and compromise so much even though I‚Äôm that‚Äôs not healthy because I don‚Äôt feel like even if I did find any modicum of love that I will question if I even deserve it.",2022-02-21 15:31:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1500857751,8,/r/lonely/comments/sxw9re/nothing_to_come_home_to/,,0,1,Nothing to come home to

I‚Äôm not a pastors kid. I‚Äôm the pastors one and only grandkid. I think something feels wrong whenever I step into that church. Like I literally feel like shit. I‚Äôve been in that church ever since birth and lately I‚Äôve been going to a different church during pandemic.

It‚Äôs so lonely in that church. No one in my age with all the adults 30+. All the kids of those people are now having their own lives except ME. I hate it. It‚Äôs like I have to set the standard of a model kid in that church.

I hate how I‚Äôm excluded just because I‚Äôm related to the pastor so I‚Äôm treated as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. Meaning that I‚Äôm almost always called out to do the prayers or do a role but do not let other kids in church do it. No wonder, these kids and young adults are leaving the church.

Today I had to drive my grandpa to church today since my mom had to work. There was no choice so I had to do it. And then the church members praise me for helping my grandpa out like ‚ÄúNO I didn‚Äôt do that from my heart!‚Äù They act as if I was willing to be his caregiver but NO!

I had to be a caregiver without choice since I was in high school. I had to give him shots and bring him to dialysis from time to time. And the church members with their big ass families are like ‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôm so proud of you for being a good caregiver.‚Äù

I want to respond to them and say ‚ÄúYou want to help me here?? We can switch places‚Äù /s

I‚Äôm so tired and exhausted. I want to break free from this model/ideal child. I want to be nice with a kind heart. But I feel like I made so much sacrifices in my life for my age already. I‚Äôve been used as a doormat so many times. I get too shy and nervous to speak out my thoughts It feels strange to feel like this as if I‚Äôm abnormal or something.

3783,sy1neh,Leirainwonderland,"Recently I connected with someone here on Reddit and it reminded me how nice it is to chat with someone back and forth. The conversation always came easily which is drastically different than my typical interactions with people. 
I did what I always do when becoming friends with someone. I built up our friendship in my head and imagined our friendship meant more than it did. I liked him enough that I would have enjoyed being best friends with him. It‚Äôs truly pathetic considering this is a person I met from Reddit. 
Anyways, I decided it was a good idea to call this person when I had been drinking a lot. I don‚Äôt even remember the majority of the conversation, but I remember doing something stupid and ultimately ruined the friendship.
Because I built this friendship up in my head, it hit me really hard and I‚Äôve spiraled into an episode of depression.

It's affected me but I didn't know how until now.

I am now 32 years old and I find human interaction such a difficult task. I'm not afraid of it, I'd rather just not do it. i developed trust issues and I feel like I never really grew up.

3795,sy3bnt,DGW7601,"This is my first post after a long time lurking - so that's my excuse for any poor grammar/spelling, I haven't done much writing recently.

I am 21/M, I've never had a significant other or been anywhere remotly close to it. I attribute this to my severe social anxiety and low self esteem. For the past 2 years or so, I have been kind of reluctantly resigned to the idea that I will never have anyone, because it just feels so unnattainable for someone like me.

I have a female friend who I first met at an old job back in December 2019. She is quite a bit older than me, however whilst working together we found that we got along really well and had a lot in common and I had an easier time interacting with her than with just about anyone else I knew. Naturally I grew attracted to her and started fantasizing about her as a romantic partner because I am lonely and crave attention and affection.

Last November, me and her hung out at her house for a few hours and had a long, intimate conversation. It was the closest I've ever felt to someone else. It seemed to me that night that she provided the kind of connection that I long for.

I didn't work up the nerve that night to express my interest to her, however I felt I may be getting close to it. A few weeks later I contacted her again asking if she'd like to meet up and talk and... she politely declined. Not a big deal. I asked her again about a week later and again she politely declined.

I decided after that that she might need some space, so I waited a few weeks before reaching out again asking if she'd like to meet up and talk and she left me on read.

At this point I was already feeling pretty shitty, however I held out some hope that perhaps she was just overwhelmed with work (she works a lot of hours) and didn't have time or energy to devote to socializing.

Unfortunately, last night I was walking home from work and I saw her walking about a block ahead of me. We made eye contact, and as soon as we did she turned and crossed the street. The second she saw me she ran the other way.

I just don't understand what happened between November and now that prompted her to avoid me this way. It is upsetting because with her I felt such a connection, and yet apparently the feeling isn't mutual.

I respect her right to associate with whoever she wants, but I feel like it would just be polite to at least tell me what's wrong rather than just start avoiding me. Last time we talked I discussed how I've had ""friends"" just ditch me for no apparent reason and it hurt really bad, so I would think she'd know how much it hurts me when she just avoids me with no explanation.

Part of me is tempted to just say fuck it, I don't want to associate with someone who acts this way towards me, but I have literally no one else in my life, she was the only person I felt any kind of strong connection with, so I'm just not sure what to do. Such is my life. Perhaps I should just re resign myself to the idea of never having anyone.

**TL;DR: Female friend in whom I was interested started avoiding me abruptly, fucking hurts because this person gave me a glimmer of hope that I might not be forever alone**",2022-02-21 20:20:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1467087443,5,/r/lonely/comments/sy3bnt/avoiding_me/,,0,2,Avoiding me

3804,sy4ndn,Low-Ad-3912,"I would say I have been blessed with my parents as they have never done anything wrong intentionally. Im going to visit my parents in april, im already crying thinking about it. I feel bad for feeling lonely in such a warming home, but I just cant connect with them properly. It may because they did neglect me a little bit I would dare to say for instance they didnt care when my grades were very bad, I never liked physical touch but especially my dad would get mad for me not wanting to hug him (I think he got hurt) (Note: I used neglect since I dont know any less ""dramatic"" words in english) But that is nothing compared to what others have experienced, and I dont have any rights to complain about my upbringing. In addion, I spend most of my days in middle school on the internet not being with friends, not haning out with anyone. And in 9th grade, I went to a therapist since I stopped talking for a year, but I dont remember why since I have blocked it out from my memory.  But in high school I was more social when I were in shcool, but not on my freetime. On the internet, I watched a lot of gore and different skin diseases. I still find it facinating, but I dont watch it anymore. 

I have two sisters who are very close, and I never felt like I got the same attention as my sisters got, but they were more ""active"" than I were in my childhood. Though I dont think I would like my sisters people if they werent my sisters, if that makes sense. All of my family members are very sensitive, I am too but I can control my feelings better. 

I remember my parents calling about regarding the declining health of my grandparents, but for some reason I didnt feel anything, not a single emotion. Even though I would say Im a sensitive person, this is a mystery to me.  But I like helping people. 

Notably, I find it difficult to connect to other people in daily life as well. All my relationship are on a superficial level I would say. When I talk to people, it feels like it is this glass infront of me. I can still ""experience"" other people, but Im always on the other side of the glass. I feel like im looking at them from a different room, not being able to come in to their room, if that makes sense. 

Im in first year of college, and I have never been more social than before. This is my first year of hanging out with friends in my freetime on an almost weekly basis. So you could also say that im still learning how to connect with other people, as im not used to it.  (Since I have spent a lot of time alone). For reference, Im 20 years old male in college. 

Im sure im not alone feeling this, so it would be nice to hear how you cope with it. I have it fine most of the time, but when I reflect on how to see other people I get sad and start crying as am now.

The little slice of happiness I had with someone was 'stolen.' She wasn't married but was seeing someone, in an abusive relationship, and I was there for her in a time of need. 

In the years following this experience, my view of the world got really dark. It was hard to see anything beyond tomorrow. I wasn't productive, and tried my best to not think about life. I was suicidal, without really acknowledging it.

Something tragic happened recently, and all of my family was upset and crying. It hit me after some thought. I can't feel it, the sadness, loss, I feel nothing. Nothing except for anger. I feel like who I show is how I think the world wants to see.

3807,sy4yl6,isitoveryet48,"I've (f48) been what most would consider an extrovert most of my adult life. I enjoyed being around people, socializing, and, as my grandma used to say, never meeting a stranger. I liked it so much that I embarked on a career as a cosmetologist and eventually owned my own salon. Friends and family alike knew my door was always open if they felt like visiting, no call ahead needed. Parties, cookouts, my childrens' sleepovers, and the holidays were my joy. Then in a span of 6 months between 2017 and 2018, my father was diagnosed and succumbed to cancer, my oldest child attempted suicide twice and spent the better part of 3 months in 3 different facilities for treatment, my business partner suffered a stroke, ending her career behind the chair, and I ended up having to close the salon. Then 3 weeks to the day after my dad passed, I had to undergo a complete hysterectomy due to an aggressively growing tumor in my uterus. The loss of my ovaries sent me into immediate menopause. There were other situations and upheavals in there as well, but those were the major stressors. Slowly I lost myself along the way. My marriage wasn't strong enough to withstand all of this, instead of helping me find my way, he became petulant and bitter because my attention was no longer focused so strongly on him. Looking at it now, I'm not even angry anymore, I'm just glad I got to see that he was not someone I can depend on for the long haul. 

And now it's 2022, my children have spread their wings and are no longer living at home. I live on the opposite side of the house from my now ex-husband, and all except 2 of the friends and the majority of our families have moved on to the next happy hostesses. There hasn't been a holiday celebration in my home in 3 years. What has been most surprising to me though is that I no longer care. I have grown to prefer being alone to the extent that after a short amount of time in the company of others I get antsy and start looking for an excuse to get back to my space. I go to visit my children in their homes, go out to eat, go shopping, and even visited friends out of town, I'm not agoraphobic, I simply don't have the desire to be in anyone's company for an extended length of time.

I'm not afraid of rejection. I'm not afraid to be direct and ask her out. Hell most of them have even commended me for being direct and not beating around the bush, like most men do.

But when every single time I ask, and get some variation of the above, it starts to get to you, eat at you, and break you.

I know dating is partly a game of luck and timing, but it feels like I'm the worst player.

21, never been on a date, never had sex, never kissed, never hugged, never even held hands, and it's starting to feel like I'll never experience any of those things.

I hate how I can‚Äôt be the one you want to hear every night. I hate not being put in the same throne you did back when I first met you. You treated me amazing, you were full of life and curious for us to continue. 

I set the boundaries however, these boundaries were weaved and even then you choose to stay in. Where you afraid of me? Can you not just do the same as you did with her? 

I hate how I‚Äôm jealous. Jealous how you talked of your past her so much and spoke nothing but everything you did to try to keep past her and make it last. When I feel like I‚Äôm worth it. Yes I made a mistake but I would never make you suffer as I am now for it. You are human, but how can a mere human put me in such hell like this. I‚Äôm so jealous that this past girl isn‚Äôt me. 

The girl you drove miles to see, the girl you want to make an effort so you do. The girl you went to get ice cream with. The girl you try to impress. Why can‚Äôt I be her again? I‚Äôm jealous of her because she did everything but yet even then it wasn‚Äôt enough. 

Nothing in the world would‚Äôve made you devote yourself to her like how she did with you and how she is willing to still today. The agreement to yourself is still apparent but the agreement to cherish her vanish. She now drowns in her own tears and regret all for one stupid phone call that she does not need to beg for. She does not need to beg for the simple decency of BASIC human needs. It just goes to show she is nothing more but a ghost. Still there but transparent, you don‚Äôt think they are there nor do you acknowledge it. You just avoid it, so she is just nothing more but the avoidable. 

She loves you, with every part of her being she loves you. The way you slick your hair back from when you furrow your brow. To simple phrases that make up your cogitation and body language. The presence of you in every setting is emphasized by the way you talk. Smoothly like honey and the flow of spells you intoxicate into my mind like a trance. But only those lips who speak such magic would only touch my skin. With his hands he uses me as his voodoo doll to bend me at his will, but I would do so for him anyway. For the script is carved in my mind and soul. Everything you do she is fascinated and the willingness to provide you everything and more is the only desire she contents. 

Please she just wants to be the same girl as before.  And a better one for our future

3885,syeaxf,LetsDiagreeToAgree,"I've been in r/lonely a while and feel like dropping my story here amongst the rest. I use female rather than girl / lady / woman because its all gotten so complicated I'd rather just be scientific :)

Me:
I'm 31M I sleep in a car in the woods. I've ran my own business with 4 or 5 employees depending on needs. I don't need money, I could get an apartment with a snap of my fingers. Credit score tickles the high 700's should be 800 soon. I don't need much, I have a small storage unit that I keep things I was told would matter to me one day, I never go to the storage unit to look at them. 

I'm naturally attractive also I go the gym everyday and maintain highly fit / decent muscle on me for my body type. I'm a virgin, I was raised with the understanding that if a male wants sex with a female then he is an awful person, justified by the claim that females don't actually enjoy sex. Lots of abuse because the person who raised me did not think females could mistreat males just the other way around. This lead to a life where I didn't know when I was being abused and when I wasn't because I was used to it. I was raised by one parent(F) who took me away from the other(M) for trivial matters, not a joke: the last straw was that he finished a bag of potato chips. 

Eventually I did lots of drugs and it was a blessing to lose every friend I had, because they were also abusive and took advantage of me trying to prove that I was a good boy. I met drug friends and stayed around through more abuse and abuse in altered states of consciousness. I got clean off drugs but having a new understanding of the world I didn't seek friends yet. I went back to family and spent another 8 years trying to figure out how I was supposed to be in the world. I was blessed by finally understanding that no family was better than the only family I could go to. I was never hugged, never kissed on the cheek, I was physically abused but I was lucky enough to not suffer any sexual abuse as a child. 

I finally have a group of people I do gigs with that after 5 weeks I finally consider friends, though my definition of friends has changed considerably. I talk to people at the gym I can hold pleasant conversations I never push for anything I want. I never hang out with anyone if it's not at a gig. 

I've been single since middle school, so my whole life basically right? I've dated 2 people in the last 10 years one for a month, one for two weeks. I can talk to females quite naturally, and can get to a relaxed conversation rather quickly. I am virgin, I can never bring myself to bring up having any sexual desire with females despite feeling in my gut that it would be well received. I fear that my whole world will crumble and I will be labeled as I don't even know what but something terrible beyond my wildest imagination. 

I suspect females expect me to know how to approach the topic of sex because I'm 31 and appear to have my shit together. I live in the woods yes, but everyone is surprised to hear it, I'm showered and well groomed with clean clothes everyday and a car that's less than 10 years old. I can only speculate though because no females have ever brought up any romantic interest in me. In a world where I'm mostly expected to make the first move I have never seen it done right. I was taught never to look down a females dress never look at their ass, and be interested in something other than sex. I feel guilty and like I have done a disservice to females when occasionally I do appreciate their bodys regardless of whether I get caught or not. I have asked out girls in the past and have always been met with rejection. I can only guess at why. I hear that females don't want to seem easy so they play hard to get, which I understand. There are imbalances in how society looks at females who get a healthy amount of sex vs males. I was also told to listen so I only ask once and so I don't push it because I hear all the trash talking of the guys who do. 

It feels so strange to try so hard to be accepting and encouraging of everyone and to have lived an entire life without a significant other(SO). I walk around and hear couples argue and fight about trivial things. I see guys be abusive to their partners, or just be a douchebag because they're more interested in something on their phone than their date or SO. I really think I could be great for a female. Loneliness has really honed my understanding of it and that I think I just want to be loving and affectionate to someone far more than receiving it. I've had girls kick me in the nuts so hard I collapsed, I've been slapped so hard I was knocked off balance, I've stood silent and still, being yelled at by females who knew I'd never lay a hand on them. I believe these occurances happened because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt they weren't interested in me and that it was my lack of action that provoked the situation. Again I don't know. 

Anyway, there's a slice of my life I don't know how to think of it other than a strange amusement and an acute sense of loneliness. I tried to kill myself when I was 11 years old, so there's nothing to worry about I know I'm more interested in where life takes me next than calling it quits. I can achieve a lot and reach high with my own devices in numerous different areas and fields but just not friends and romantic partners.

This is not fair. All of this, it‚Äôs not fair‚Ä¶

I tried to send him a message, but he didn‚Äôt respond.

It‚Äôs been two months and it does not get better. The pain is still the same. I‚Äôm not able to stand up again.

It‚Äôs not fair, I don‚Äôt deserve to go through that pain again, through that loneliness,‚Ä¶ I have suffer enough for a lifetime already, I just want to be happy. I don‚Äôt deserve to stay up all night wondering what did I do wrong, what is wrong with me, what did I do to deserve this ? I must be a terrible person to deserve all of this, right ? Maybe I‚Äôm cursed ? 
I‚Äôm so sick of being alone all the time while everybody move on with their life and I‚Äôm stuck here, with just myself. 

I cry myself to sleep every night, thinking tomorrow will be a better day, but it‚Äôs never the case.
I‚Äôm so tired. So tired.

3929,syld21,Freedom_Laughter,"I‚Äôm 25 and I ended my last relationship more than 3 years ago after 3 years together, the reason being me having mental health issues and her being interested in someone else. I‚Äôve worked a lot on my mental health through the years and I‚Äôm feeling a lot better now. Lately I‚Äôve been focusing a lot, if not only, on my job which is going really good and I am working a lot (I mean A LOT, 3 jobs, 7 days a week with not much time to eat or sleep as well) which has helped me keeping my mind busy. But. A couple of days ago a colleague came up to me and said: ‚ÄúYou know, sometimes it‚Äôs good to just slow down, take a break and take some time for yourself‚Äù. That broke me. Myself. My self? It was in that moment I realised that all I‚Äôve been doing lately has been just therapy and work and by doing those things only it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been identifying with my position of patient, co-worker, freelancer and so on and that was everything I felt like I was and I was fine with it. But that sentence made me rethink everything. In the midst of that came a text from one of my exes. She just needed some of her things we left in our old house back. After all this time and while I was dealing with those questions I started thinking back on my past relationships and the girls I once loved and how I feel like it was always my fault we broke up. I made 2+2 and I came to the conclusion the reason why I feel this way is that I have nothing except my work right now, not much time to spend on my interests, not many friends to spend time with and most of all nobody on my side to share life with. And I‚Äôm afraid I never will.

I won't lie I do kind of wish I could just take it pretend everything's okay so I can have a friend again they were not a good person and I treated me poorly but they made me feel alone even when I was with them and I feel like that's the worse any one can do two you..

I wish I was already gone and moved in with my online friends so I could feel less alone and maybe be able to move on from this all but I do feel like there's a little hole in my heart that won't go away it was 14 years of friendship just disappeared and I know it's affected on how I open up to people and maybe I'm a little scared about putting myself back out there to make more friends and the state I'm in I know it will get better I have to believe it will get better I hope until then I just have to work on myself and make sure I have everything in order that's the only thing I can control

The lonely feeling, just hitting like a train.
The forever suffering, just relentless pain.

Nobody to hug, nobody who cares.
My heart crumbling, simply into dispair. 

What has my life come to, it feels to pointless.

I've mostly lived with my family members because I'm physically disabled and not really capable of taking care of myself by myself. I've only been in one relationship, and it ended last year. I don't miss him, I just miss the moments of affection, cuddling, and actually feeling like for once I had my own life, not having to live with my parents. 

But one thing I struggle with is getting back into the dating world. I don't know when is too soon to start searching again. I don't know if I'm actually ready, or if I still need to improve myself. All I know is that I'm lonely. I'm living with my sibling, I've taken steps to ensure I get the care I need, such as home nurses and getting equipment for the house.

It was so damn hard trying to find anyone who wanted to be with me in the first place, like finding a needle in a haystack. I'm a great friend, but nothing more. That one and only relationship happened when I was 25yrs old... And let's face it, people generally don't want to date the severely disabled. And I don't blame them, I'm just sad that's how the world is. I need assistance with almost everything. People get intimidated by it, see my disability first, and not the person that I am. I have so much love to give, but would I really make a good partner? I feel like I'd be nothing more than a body who sits around all day. I struggle so much with these thoughts.

3970,syssw3,dontsayhiplease,"My past self would often run to social medias whenever I was lonely. Would post some stories in IG and wait for the replies to line up. Often, I wouldn't even reply to all the replies I get. I guess, the feeling of realising there are people to talk to was enough to satiate my ego...

I changed. 

Now, when I'm lonely, I let myself feel loneliness. When I'm lonely, I sit and think of what am I, and what to do. 
It's a recent change, and I'm still at it. It's very difficult, especially since it is so easy to reach out to people just with your finger tips. 

But the more accessible people are, the more inaccessible you are to yourself. There where two questions which prompted me, to do this. 

-What in the world am I doing with my life. 
(Involved some important people getting hurt, and them choosing to leave, which forced myself to introspect and retrospect)

-If I'm not happy with Myself, how can I wish someone else to be happy with me? 
(again, rooted in the recent breakup) 

My mind until recently was like a string of a bass guitarist. Heavy and beating constantly. I had to change that, I had to put myself to peace even if everyone else chose to leave me. At the end, you're all alone. 
You can make a Mirage of people around you, but relationships comes with an expiry date. 

I'm not there yet, but I can see the progress. I have to be happy, with or without people. 

I hope everyone here, get to be at a position, where they enjoy their own company.",2022-02-22 17:15:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619049635,1,/r/lonely/comments/syssw3/why_do_you_hate_being_lonely/,,0,1,Why do you hate being lonely?

But when I am lonely, fuck is so much harder than when I was younger.

I know more about myself now, and that has helped a ton.

Boredom spurs my loneliness. I have to stay busy. And it's by doing the work I love and connecting with the people who also love this work that the darkness recedes. I learned this by spending lots of time very active, then having a week or two of nothing to reflect. Trial and error. Perpetually.

College dam near killed me. For me, it was incredibly hollow. There is absolutely no point to it for me. It was always eating at the back of my mind that I was paying a crap ton of money to overload myself with work I hated for a useless piece of paper. The people I met in college who liked it were just as hollow. 

I'm not particularly smart nor attractive nor charming. My one saving grace is i dont feel embarrassment. Anxiety is a mystery to me, and that's leg up I seem to have on everyone else here. Talking to people is easy because I don't care. It turns out so does no one else. 

After I left college, I explored the world alot. Ended up in very strange corners in strange company. Most of this company I have hated and felt cripplingly alone. I also met two or three individuals and made a connection. It's the only thing that keeps me going.

I cannot connect with any of you. Save maybe the one. And that is enough for me.",2022-02-22 18:58:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1508136436,7,/r/lonely/comments/syvbgm/i_think_im_beating_the_lonely_heres_how/,,0,1,I think I'm beating the lonely. Here's how.

My SA has basically prevented me from making friends among other things and these days whatever desire I had to go out anywhere has basically disappeared. These days I literally only have friend who I who I sort of just tolerate but still consider a friend. The other friend is a friend since childhood but my happy times with him ended in our teens so for the last 30+ year since our friendship has been strained and stressful and even when I used to hang out with him it was always walking on eggshells. These days I avoid him like the plague and wish he would just stop communicating with me.

I'm seriously depressed, I am going through a divorce. This will be my second one. The first she cheated on me with my business partner because I was in an accident and was in a wheelchair for 2 years. Now I'm going through a divorce because my soon to be ex wife was abusive to my son. I moved 3 hours away to be with her and have been with her for 7 years. Everyone up here is either family or her friend. I have no one anymore. I have 2 friends. Both online. One I talk to regularly but idk it's not the same as having someone I can hold and hug. The issue I have is I'm a freak. If you go to my page you will see comments and post. I'm sex addicted and want fucked up shit because I masturbated with my cousin when I was teenager and then made it into a fantasy. In reality she molested me. No one irl knows and I can't just go around telling people irl that I'm a freak. So I came to Reddit. Where still among freaks I'm not wanted. No one ever messages me back. I message people everyday who say they want the things I want but they don't ever respond. It seems everyone on here is fake or I'm just that ugly or undesirable that they just don't want me either.

However, she never wanted to move past the parent barrier as they had already formed a negative opinion of me. Now I thought of it as temporary but then came to a point where we were distancing ourselves more and more and suddenly I felt like the love became draining and unauthentic the way it used to be. She attributes this to her parents but I think that if you really love someone you work through it and you don‚Äôt listen to anyone trying to stop you from having that love.

At that time i was also being groomed by a 25 male who thank god never assaulted me but he did a lot of emotional damage to me and no one cared or noticed. i came back to my country and started living with my grandparents and no, i don't have the typically warm and affectionate grandparents, so no i dind't stopped being lonely and they always work or have things to do so yeah, i'm always alone. Now i am 23, i tried to have connections with other people, they treated me like shit or betrayed me, and a couple months ago i started dating a man who lied to me and he was still married. still hurts because dating him was the first time i hugged someone in a very affectionate way, the first time i cuddled etc. but yeah.... then a couple weeks ago i dated another guy who same, we had cuddles and that stuff, he treated me great but the next day we had our second date he ghosted me.

No need to dig deeper.‚Äù Just because I‚Äôm not solitary doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have layers, secrets or parts of myself I keep intimate but want to share with close, trusted friends.

I want to travel and share experiences with friends. And everyone I‚Äôve thought I could travel with has let me down. My boyfriend‚Ä¶ I wanted to be with him specifically because he seemed to have a passion to travel but all he seems to want to do is stay home and play video games. My best friend said she wanted to travel a lot when we first met but after she got married, she suddenly no longer cared about going anywhere further than a 20 mile radius from her home. I had another friend but he showed his petty, true colors and turned on me in the fall when I confronted him for inviting someone to a Friendsgiving event I was hosting at my home without asking me first. I confronted HIM but HE got offended and cut ties. I just cut ties with my newest friend after they made plans with me two months ago to go on a trip to NYC to see a show on Broadway, took an impromptu trip on a cruise because her rich father offered to pay for it last-minute and then tried to change the trip from 4 days to 1 1/2 because she realized that she was suddenly out of PTO because of it. She left me on ‚Äúread‚Äù for a week and a half while she was on the cruise, then cancelled the trip and tried to sell the Broadway tickets to me (which her father ALSO paid for) but I declined because I was offended by the whole thing.
And now I just had another friend cancel on me who invited me on a trip to Disney because their friend who they‚Äôre traveling with is uncomfortable sharing a hotel room with someone out of state. She‚Äôll go to an airport, fly on a plane, stay in a hotel and walk around 4 theme parks with hundreds of strangers but won‚Äôt share a room with a vaccinated/boosted work-from-home hermit.

I am capable of love and it hurts. I love my significant other. I would do a great amount of things for him beyond words. I hold onto life mostly for his account. It's not a fair thing to land on his shoulders. He seems aware of what I would do on his behalf. I have a friend. I would do much for her. It would not be fair to her for me to rely my life on her. Especially when she has her own subset amount of mental issues. 

I'm so sick. I feel it in my chest. My bones ache. My heart hurts. My lungs feel heavy. I want to die. I want a sweet release. I cant have it so easy. I know better than most death doesn't come easy.

4074,szcol2,ABitingShrew,"Reading through wikipedia on public figures that have chosen to end their journey in this life has brought me back to a phrase that I thought was very harsh and unfeeling at the time.

When I was a younger man, about 15/16, I confided in my mother that I was depressed and considering s*suicide. She was obviously concerned and scheduled me for therapy but it was my father's reaction that has stuck with me for a variety of reasons. This man thought that the best thing to do was to angrily tell me that ""su*cide is the most selfish thing anyone can do."" 

I thought this was BS as a teen and young adult but as the start of this post alludes to I get it now. Doing the thing is the easy way out of suffering for sure but it makes everything harder for the people that are left behind. That is to say I dont begrudge anyone for making that decision at all. But I do know that the fallout afterwards has made life that much more terrible for the people that care.

And I know for a fact people care. It is easy when in the depths of depression to think that no one cares, believe me, I've been there. Everyone has people that care about them. Its easy to ignore when you're feeling down, again I know, I've been there.

All this drunken rambling to say loneliness is a phase. You'll find a partner or come to terms and satisfaction with solitude. If you think that's impossible message me and we can talk.

----- You don't need to read the whole thing


I'll be 30 in a few years. I heard it gets harder when you're older but it's not possible now and no one's ever liked me not even when I was a kid. I'd be fine with dying alone if I was toxic or a bad person or did something to deserve it but even those type of people have friends but I don't. I decided to put all my worth in work because my boss is nice and praises me and tells me good job when I do lots of work and finish in a little amount of time. I'd let her praise carry me forever but work only lasts so long and there's not always something to do.

It's not even a question of being worthy at this point. It seems my family and I are cursed to die alone and my family doesn't even acknowledge I exist. The media has destroyed my generation socially. It's either conform or die alone but I can't conform to everything my generation does. I don't smoke, drink, club, use drugs, absorb myself in texting and social media, sleep around just because I'm with someone and have needs and I'm not into memes which seems to define my generation.  I wish whoever says being different is good would stop lying because I've been lied to my entire life. I've heard it all ""you're funny"" ""you're sweet"" ""you're interesting"" ""you're entertaining"" ""you're adorable"" just lies, just stop it. Just more stuff to destroy me after I try to the pieces back together after being dropped and left by myself again after trying so hard to be good. It doesn't matter anymore, it doesn't matter if I'm a good person, it doesn't matter how I look, being good for a laugh, it doesn't matter what religion I follow or if I abandon religion, burn all the books and believe in nothing. I'd strip everything from who I am for a different outcome.


If I had the money I'd just hire someone to stay with me and be nice because that's all I really want. I  can't anymore.

4102,szj9u3,Key-Entrepreneur-274,"I dont know what this post will be about.Maybe just a rant or desperately in need for help. Sorry if the sentences are not structured correctly.So here it goes

I am an 18 yo guy who has finished highschool and will be starting college in a month.I have lost all the will to live. I dont have much friends and of the few i have dont give shit about me. Theres this one friend i talk daily with , maybe i can say he is my best friend. He basically sees me as a support system. He daily talks about his problems and i try to help him in all the way i can. But whenever i slightly open up about my problems they wouldn't even put the effort to understand that. This goes with all the "" friends "" i have . On introspecting a lot i realise that the need for an intimate partner is actually effecting my mental health in every possible way. I have never had a gf in highschool ( couldn't go to school in senior year due to the pandemic ) . I see most people around me being in relationships and it just kills me. I could be the kindest person these people would actually meet and no one gives a shit about me. My neighbourhood  friends rarely talk with me now. They don't usually include me whenever they hangout. I have pure ocd which literally put me through hell during the pandemic. I had no one to talk to for months and my parents wouldn't even accept that i have this issue. I am crying while writing this and i have no idea why i am carrying on like this. Ik my family will suffer like anything if i kill myself. I have zero hopes for the future. I also have bdd ,combined with my ocd, just makes me a wild animal at times.I haven't gone to therapy and i dont think i can ever explain to anyone what all went through. It just feels so tiresome. I feel i am so bad at articulating that i dont even bother talking about my problems to people nowadays ( i used to tho but no one cared). I actually wanted to write some more but i just can't even sense what i am thinking at the moment.

Im known to easily like a girl (apparently its more like infatuation). And given my sentimental mentality, i just remember all the good times being with such people.
but then idk when this started, i guess its when i was trying to learn to move on, i try to remember and be retrospective about memories with crushes, during tht i cry abit, adding on, another reason is how im abit distant with friends these days and feel lonely, and given how im soft spoken and feel awkward when talking or interacting in conversations id says those r why.  Its like self imploding so i can pick up my pieces, it‚Äôs unhealthy im aware, but im stuck in a cycle, lack of motivation, discouraging results from my planned actions, repeating, others factors like singleness, fasing friendships etc

Ik its messy but I guess its a vent, just overwhelmed and thought this would be a good way of fuming out emotions with no harm.

I also feel very single, i had a phase where id hate seeing couples around me coz they‚Äôre always so happy, but it‚Äôs clearly bcoz i was jealous.

I sometimes wish i can express thoughts better, be a great conversationalist, be less awkward, honestly still don‚Äôt understand how to stop tht, but in the root of all tht, im just being nice, and trying to not be awkward or wutvr

Emotionally sensitive to sad romantic music too, its like a mild vietnam flashback, its an expression but it‚Äôs similar lol

But yea, I just wish to meet someone who‚Äôll be there to stop me crying when im on an emotional hour coz a random memory be popping in.

4137,szp9ov,Zestyclose_Visit_569,"Guys, I think the reason why people are lonely is because they don't believe in themselves. Sometimes, we just need to be confident and believe in ourselves. Know that you have something to tell. Be funny, be yourself. Take risks, and be vulnerable. The only way you can have a relationship is by being vulnerable. Think for yourself: what and how much you are willing to tell someone about yourself so you can make them like you and connect to you. 

Sometimes, to be able to solve one problem, you just need to get more knowledge about that subject. Maybe we just need to read more books about how to make a friend? How do you make some to like you? How can you impress someone?

When you have more knowledge, you are more confident. Start to read a lot of books about how to socialize. 

There are a lot of books out there. Don't be afraid to make errors. Just be yourself, and you will attract people who like your kind. 

And we need to learn to take advantage of every opportunity we get to socialize. Go to places where you can get in touch with people and look for someone to talk to. There is always someone open to talk to you. Learn how to read people. Learn with who you can talk, and who won't reject you.

Even if you are rejected, don't give up. Keep trying. 

Be courage. I am lonely sometimes but not all the time. Because when I get my chance to speak with someone, that will be for hours for sure. Because I like to talk and I have a lot to tell. And I know what to ask so the conversation can keep going. 

In a conversation, someone needs to be open so the other will be open to open up.

Please start to read to improve yourself. Search on amazon for books that will help you to make friends.

Maybe you don't need friends; you just need to learn to take advantage of every opportunity you get. Opportunity to speak with people at parties, church, meetings, school, and so on.

Be optimistic that you will get someone to share your life with. 

I hope that someone will understand what I mean.",2022-02-23 19:10:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639721510,8,/r/lonely/comments/szp9ov/tips_to_start_to_eliminate_loneliness/,,0,16,Tips to start to eliminate loneliness.

Despite the fact that I got a talent and did studies, I think my negative traits brings down more than what I'm capable of. I'm full time student that doesnt work, which adds a bit more of uselessness on top

I constantly feel lonely even if I made friend, and people think I'm fishing for attention but really, I'm searching for people that I match with but it just doesn't work. 

I often self-sabotage to change, but I've been trying to get rid of the temptation to act based on my impulse. Hence people calls me childish even if I'm at age of 26, didn't grow and I am still not in my best self. 

But, typically speaking, I believe everyone at my age are mature some way or the other. On the other hand, I am really nothing compared to them. 

Reflecting from what my life has been, I have been running away, break things, and making myself hopeless because I wanted attention, but I don't entirely believe this is 100% true either. I had passion for choosing my major, I simply wasn't ready for friends, and deep down I really thought I don't deserve good people. Part of the reason why I did all that is because it was too much, but that really doesn't give an excuse that I'm trash human being. 

Which in fact it means I have imposter syndrome; But it has gotten to the point where I doubt if I'm the person who I want to be, and if I am doing good. But even if I am being a good person, is it for sake of others or sake of myself? 

I am starting to think that this is also useless and just attention seeking to even post, but on the other hand I'm trying to get things off the chest.

So yeah, I'm lonely, but seeing how trash of person I am I think no one would want to be my friend or even associate with me. I don't know what to do; I don't know where to even start.

4239,t06fer,Alive_Effective7651,"Since the day you left. Its still very vivid in my memory how broken I was the first time you told me those words. I thought similar to my first relationship it will be easy but its not and today after 1 year 11months 9 days I had the courage to delete all your pictures, messages, and videos that I kept for so long just to remember you. All this time I thought its okay to keep those as remembrance since you made me feel special and loved when those pictures and videos were taken. I didn't notice that whenever I'm sad, the only things you left to me are the only things that will make me feel okay as well. But looking and watching all the pictures and videos we had, now I know that I became very insensitive and didn't notice that with those last images I took from you also shows a different look in your eyes, the look that I wish you never had, the look that says it all, that love is no longer alive. I know I was never enough and wasn't able to give everything that you want that led you to betray and hurt me. Still I wanna thank you for all the good memories we had, the way you took care of me, the joy and happiness you temporarily brought into my life, the pain and heartbreak you gave me that made me even stronger. It might take me a long time to forgive you but I still wish you happiness and may all your dreams and goals come true. 

Today, I will start letting you go I believe its not too late and someday, somewhere, somehow I will love again. I will just need to learn to love myself and believe that I am always enough. One day I will meet someone that will treat me better. Someone who will love me at my worst. Someone who will give me the love that I deserve.

I know my ""friends"" are constantly texting people, snapping, etc. However, no one ever seems to message me or send me anything until they need something. Then I'm so desperate for friendship I gladly do it. For the most part I don't mind because it doesn't really take time for me to say watch a child for a couple hours, or help run an errand. I mean I work from home and rarely leave the house. But I digress, these are excuses. 

Like a few weeks ago I wanted to go see a new movie with a couple guy friends. They both wanted to see it but if I hadn't initiated the convo it would never have happened. 

Its just really frustrating to feel like your friends only ever use you. So many people say ""just find new ones"". Well, easier said than done. When you work from home and are an introvert it's really hard to do. I'm not a people person and I can't just ""get over it"" or change that.

Your feelings are justified, being lonely and unloved fucking sucks. Yes I‚Äôm not one of you now, I have a girlfriend, *but I was you, I felt your pain*

If you can work out do it, not to get a girlfriend but to unleash your pain, my body is attractive now but I didn‚Äôt go for that, I went because I needed to replace my drug abuse (cocaine) with something that would give my brain dopamine, and it worked.

4329,t0owjc,GlassesRPorn,"I see this everywhere.

Manipulated by our parents to love them unconditionally.

By friends into being people we simply aren't.

By our SOs to be who they want us to be.

By our jobs to be milked.

By our schools to think we need them to be happy.

By our churches into following a hollow faith.

By social media into believing a plethora of delusions.

There is so little loyalty to the self, and it kills.

Changing this starts with the question, 'How does this make me feel'? The end goal being avoiding draining forces like a disease. Because that's what they are. A mind contagion to control you with fear, guilt, and apathy.

Reaching mental freedom is a journey of many miles that starts with the one step, 'does this leech from me?'. Does your job tax your soul? Quit. Does your parent abuse you? Don't interact with them. Is your SO a narcissist? Leave them. 

Do any of these prospects terrify you? That's exactly their plan. Fear is the mind killer. 

And overcoming this fear starts with a single tiny rebellion. One step at a time. It's hard work, but it gets easier with every fucking step.

Finding love is often a critical component to reaching a critical escape velocity. 

To reach the light at the end of the tunnel is to be a god amongst men. The liberated are few, free, powerful, and often still lonely.

But they can forge their own company.",2022-02-24 23:41:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1508136436,0,/r/lonely/comments/t0owjc/denial_we_are_programmed/,,0,0,Denial. We are programmed.

4333,t0pr9s,surfmadpig,"Because my parents are older and I'm an only child, I'd always been terrified I'd eventually be alone, since childhood. 

As I grew older I feared that something terrible would happen out there and I'd have to be alone during it, especially in terms of lack of support, lack of a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, someone to share my worries with. I'd have nobody to coexist with and I'd go mad.

I was always very social but I was also egotistical, petty, and temperamental - not a conscious choice either. As I got older, I pushed away the best partners I ever had because I would focus on their flaws, take them for granted, and think there was someone even better out there - no matter how amazing and compatible we were together. 

Also, I pushed many friends away in many ways, including moving to a new country for no real reason but my own failure to face what my life had become. And despite meeting more and more people, I soon started being called out for being a shitty person. 

Adult responsibilities, incompatibility, my own shitty behaviour and bad luck all aligned right before the pandemic, and I ended up with literally just four friends in the country where I live. Then the pandemic came, and I was terrified to even spend time with them. I was managing at first but then I started going mad, more and more. 

I took up therapy. I was looking forward to normal times soon. The fact that i was alone during the pandemic I have come to terms with, though it has made me forever pessimistic and cynical and killed a huge part of my soul. 

But today, a war. A vile war. All war is vile but this one is especially vile. 

And the most shocking thing on a personal level is that nobody, not a single soul besides my mum, who's very old and very far away, nobody even messaged me on social media (let alone called or texted) to check in. I could have been one of several people they may have wanted to share their shock, emotion and anxiety with. Or asked them about their own.

There are **millions** of people who have it worse than me today. 

But it's terrifying to get solid confirmation that nobody, nobody at all has me on their mind enough to check in and tell me how they feel and ask how I feel on a day like today. 

I'm now 40 years old and if I died tomorrow, it would take weeks for everyone except mum to notice.

These last year have been hard. Like two years ago I was living a happy life, I was going to the school, having great moments with my friends. I played for my school team and became kinda ""known"" in my small town. But after we graduate (and COVID got here) I lost contact with almost everyone. I always sucked on digital interaction so that really screwed me up. 
My best friend got a job and a GF so we barely see each other now.
Since I've always been the ""expendable"" guy in the group nobody really cares if I'm in the party or not and I was OK with that, after all, I was never alone and had at least one person to talk. But not anymore. Now I can expend weeks without a single text and no one would notice. I feel like everyone is avoiding me and I have no idea why (I like to think I'm not a bad person). 

I know it's not the end of the world, but it's really hard and has impacted my life in a negative way. I can't even cry because my house is pretty small and my family would notice and get worry (or laugh at me). I stopped doing exercise because I felt so sad and went from an athletic guy to a chubby one (nothing wrong with being chubby btw). So I'm venting here now because my last text was received 4 days ago.

I‚Äôm lying down here, writing these thoughts on this subreddit. 

I have no one honest and sensible person to talk about the things that get me scared and worried, or things that keep me interested to live.

All I can say is, I‚Äôm not happy anymore.
I thought I‚Äôm getting used to live nowadays, but the truth is, I‚Äôm just living out here for the sake of being alive. I only exist just to get things done. I‚Äôm just a person who lives to exercise the art of getting by. 

I feel so numb and empty. 

I feel weird to even just thinking about these things. 

I just want to sleep, but even my vivid dreams are weird and sad.

I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm trying to do what‚Äôs best for me.

I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and keep myself motivated.

But there‚Äôs going to be hard times like today


today is the day that would make me realised, 

uncertainties would kill me
intrusive thoughts would kill me
sad thoughts would kill me

I killed off myself too many times before


but life stood still,

And I‚Äôm still alive but I feel like a ghost wandering, trying to fill in the void

the void that‚Äôs yet not filled

or maybe I‚Äôm just existing to see that there‚Äôs something worthwhile is heading to me.

Saying ‚Äòmaybes‚Äô and ‚ÄòOks‚Äô killed off my high hopes 

I just want to stop saying these things
because it‚Äôs getting exhausted

I just want silence but silence is too loud in my head

Like imagine what your day is and imagine what are other ppl day.

Someone is having the best moment in their life, people that just chillin , smoking , tired, and excited. 

Like think about it all emotion is being distributed , everyone is just exchange expression, emotion and experience. Some in a different place but in a same situation while some with same place but different emotion. 

This has been on my mind for i while but its so fascinating to think about it.

Someone could be making the biggest regret they will make. This is the past already. Every second , every word , every sentence, i make seconds gone by and all of it will be left in my memories and put in the past . The future is here and the past is here its all blending together. It gets really confusing but think about it.

So yeah, pretty much what the title says. I have known her for about 5 years now, and we‚Äôve been good friends, however I have confessed that I love her - and when I say that I love her, I really mean it. It‚Äôs not just some phase or crush that I had for a moment. It‚Äôs been 5 years now and my heart grows stronger for her every day. I just feel like there‚Äôs nothing I can do because I can‚Äôt just force her to like me in that kind of way. 

I am just left heartbroken and sad and alone. No matter how much I pray or how much I hang out with other people, I always feel that part of me missing. I feel a hungry emptiness in my heart that eats away at me from the inside. I feel my motivation and enthusiasm and energy and happiness fading quickly.

My job is also consuming my life. I've had to work 70+ hours every week for the last few years, and there's no end in sight, so I feel so unmotivated to go out and meet people.

My boss also intruded on my personal life and found out that I've never been in a relationship, and because I have a leadership job, he told me that nobody trusts leaders who aren't married or haven't had relationships, so I'm worried that my personal life will affect my job.

My anxiety just makes it impossible to engage others. I feel like everyone is as busy as I am, and if I talk to them then I'm encroaching on their time.

those friends were my only friends, and it hurts to see them always hanging out with their other friends and never initiating anything with me. it sucks not even being a choice LOL. 

what spurred me to write this was the fact that one of my friends (lets call her friend A), whom i thought would always remember me etc, totally forgot about me + my birthday. just today, friend B posted on her spam account (most ppl call it burner accounts i think) a video of some alcohol cocktail and captioned ""cant wait to try this when im legal!"". (we are technically 17 this year, since our birthdays havent passed) and i saw friend A comment ""yeah wait 2 more days and we'll try this together!!"". why did this hurt me? because all 3 of our birthdays are two days apart: mine is on the 11th, B's is on the 13th, and A's is on the 15th. if our birthdays are that close to each other, how can she forget about mine? this is pretty trivial, but it hurts a lot.

i graduated school in november 2021 and will be having holidays until mid-april. i can confidently tell yall that from november till now, i had NEVER once met up with my friends to hang out or go shopping. guess this shows how important i am to them :)

4470,t1exij,DatHistoryLad,"Alright, this will be a long one...

These 5 people are by no means ""bad"", I wish the best for them actually, but it still stung like a bitch.

I am at my second year of college, I grew up and still reside in a large village/ small town. We have a kindergarten, elementary, middle school and high school and I went to all of them before going to the aforementioned college in a nearby city.

Consequently, I knew all or the majority of my classmates from elementary onwards, and they knew me. Nevertheless, growing up I was always a shut in, a homebody, who suffered from high-anxiety even from a toddler age. I was terrible in having conversations or socializing, still am to a certain extent. Regardless, I was, more or less, happy up until 2014, or as I've been calling it ""the last year I was truly happy"". Teenage years kicked through the door and destroyed everything, and slowly, I lost everyone that I thought to be friends (which weren't many) from drifting away. I lacked the courage to properly socialize with any of my classmates (something I deeply regret and will for the rest of my life probably), and I lagged behind. They took titanic steps forward, while I sprinted towards the opposite direction like a blind fool. Towards the conclusion of high school, i started to learn some things regarding socialization but it was already too late, you can't make up 5 years of degradation in just 1.

This leads me to college. I had, more or less, come to realize my predicament and somehow became an extrovert in college for a short period, during which I met very wonderful people. I failed to properly interact with them beyond campus, as I lived 30 to 1 hour away (either by car or bus). I always maintained friendly relations but I was held back by this, although whenever I got an invitation (which was almost never, as I was almost always the one asking), I went no matter what (in contrast to the past, where i had received many for birthdays, but never, ever went, a decision that breaks my heart every time I think that). In time we formed a sort of loose group, and I was a part of it, although I wasn't actively messaging them or talking to them via social media, I didn't do that all that much mostly because it was something foreign to me, and I had social anxiety.

Which leads me to today, I sent a photo and a  message to one of those friends (hell, the first one i made, the most energetic and positive person who always laughs at my jokes), meant to be kinda comedic about me having to partake in 30 minute ""driving homework"" (I'm trying to take the license). Hours later, while having forced myself to go downstairs to keep my grandfather company because he's alone most of the time and I feel guilty for him, I was bored and looked in Instagram where I saw a story made by another friend of the group. I was annoyed it'd be some story about the war, I saw allot about that from the self-shaming Russians from my school. I only saw it for one second due to the terrible internet, but it was enough for it to instantly drop my heart to the deepest and most darkest of caverns and allow for those past feelings of regret, self-loathing, and loneliness to come pouring out. We always somewhat gathered following our classes at the cafeteria, and as of late I've been returning home early because I have to do ""driving homework"", as such never got the chance to meet up with all of them at once all throughout the week. But I did meet them individually, or just 4 of them, because we share two classes together in Tuesdays and Thursdays, but never did they bring up the meetup or ask me. I suppose they thought about it today after class, but they should have at least asked me, hell, I even told the guy, who laughs at my jokes, that I wouldn't mind at all joining them whenever they want to meet up the week before. I suppose I'm the fool for not taking more risks, or at least acting wrongly.

What haven't I done to try to make friends, I took so many risks, suffered and tolerated so many awkward moments... I guess it's pointless in the end....

4486,t1gld3,Revolver-Knight,"A thought occurred to me between last night at work and today what do people think when they see me.



It all started last night at work I was called to floral to blow balloons because I was the closer for produce and the only one there.

The customers were these pair of girls and they were my age 18/19  either seniors in highschool or just graduated.

I graduated way back in June of 2021 

Anyway as an a associate and as I‚Äôd like to think a decent person I said hey how are you doing.

They just handed me over the balloons they wanted and then I heard one of them say sarcastically ‚Äúoh wow he just said heeeey.‚Äù Then they just laughed 

And it clicked to me who these people where they had popular girl syndrome like it‚Äôs this weird thing I noticed when I was in school where the popular girls though the people who weren‚Äôt on there social ranking were just under them and any other guy that like they didn‚Äôt deem mediocre was just some how automatically liked them them.


Which is fucking stupid and like not to body shame but a lot of time these types of girls are like just skinny to the bone and look so just Barbie doll artificial 

Like there so skinny they look like they are malnourished Chihuahuas you see in animal cruelty commercials.

Like not my type at all but it‚Äôs like my main issue is they got a dog shit personally 



These people ushally will go up to the quiet kid or the special Ed kid and be like ‚Äúthis is my best friend! Hehe‚Äù like these people are there preforming monkeys 

It used to piss me off a lot like I had a guy I chilled out with at lunch nice guy he had what I think was cerebral palsy or some other developmental disorder and like these (excuse my language) little bitches would just come up to him make fun of him to his face and be like you wanna go on a date and just toy with him

I remember one day I asked why do you do that? And they were like ‚Äúwhy do you care?
I pretty much told them to go fuck themselves 

And I‚Äôm not the incel ish type I wanna make that clear like if your a person that blames all your problems on all men or all woman or something to that caliber your fucking stupid 


But I dunno I ushally let shit just slide but for whatever reason that interact just reopened a bunch of memories for me

Then like I got home took a shower looked im the mirror and I thought am I just ugly.

I usually don‚Äôt like mirrors or photos of myself in general 

But like the last let‚Äôs say between last night and as of this post my sense of self worth and self love is just horrible.



Like I genuinely want to know if I have any physical redeeming qualities at all am I just fuck ugly or something 


It‚Äôs like I dunno like I‚Äôm not gonna get a straight answer in my family my dad always says I‚Äôm lookin sharp 

My mom and Mema think I‚Äôm handsome


It‚Äôs like my ex used to call me her sweet prince a lot and it really meant a lot to me .

It made me feel less like a fuck ugly mess.

Like I look at other men both normal and valued

Like I looked at old photos of this singer Michael McDonald and I‚Äôm like I want that hair 

It‚Äôs like why don‚Äôt I ever feel handsome or beautiful 

And like when my family tells me oh  lookin sharp or hey my handsome son it‚Äôs like I appreciate that but I almost expect you to say that.


Or maybe not handsome or beautiful but like let me feel AT LEAST FEEL MEH!

Can I look into the mirror and feel neutral about my self feel meh instead of wanting to run away into my bed and lock myself away from the world.

Once in awhile I reach out to friends to vent, but only when I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself because I‚Äôm so upset (which is very rare nowadays) I tend to just keep to myself now. I‚Äôm scared of making new friends, I‚Äôve had friends that I‚Äôve grown up with stab me in the back (which still hurts to this day). 

There‚Äôs one friend I hangout with a lot, I think of him as a brother and he just asked me out on a date which makes me feel even lonelier if by chance he only hangs out with me for the occasion I say yes.

And when it comes to romantic relationships I am just terminally single, every guy I‚Äôve ever tried to be serious with pretty much love bombs me. And it hurts, I‚Äôm lonely. It just gets worse, and I need to vent, I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel like this but I also hope I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs also hard because of Covid, but at this point it‚Äôs hardly an excuse because I see my friends in the city doing stuff without me all the time.

I‚Äôve tried bumble bff, I‚Äôve tried all kinds of dating apps, I‚Äôve tried going to parties and meeting people, nothing has worked. I think I‚Äôm a smart, funny, talented, and attractive woman with a heart of gold. I‚Äôm constantly let down and when I cut people off I‚Äôm too afraid to try again.

4492,t1herz,zzyzzyva,"I spent the majority of my younger years as a sad little lad.

It wasn't until I hit my early twenties that I came to the decided to do something. Up to that point, I carried on with the mentality that my struggles were superficial compared to others. I reasoned that because of my fortunate circumstance, I had no acceptable reason to feel how I did. But man I was sad. No amount of repressed expression could change that fact.

Dont get me wrong, I had it good. I had a complete family around me, we never worried for food, and although we weren't rich, we lived comfortably above our means. But loneliness has no prejudice when it comes circumstance. I was born my mother's bastard, and despite not knowing for decades, I never felt my home was with my family.

In my own experience, I've found loneliness in the company of others to be among the worst. To watch as those around you freely wield a love that they subsequently deny you is taxing to the soul. You often hear how history is integral in shaping ones future, but seldom do we realize it as it is happening to us. 

I chose to cope with my sadness by denying it's existence entirely, and it took years until I could truly see how the repercussions of that choice seeped into my life. My relationships in school often embodied the loneliness I felt at home. I gave to those interested in taking, and closed myself from having meaningful connections. It was as though my mind sought comfort in the familiar feelings of sadness, leaving me doomed to repeat a vicious cycle. 

Coming through the other end of that, I am ultimately better for the pain. It taught me how to improve, it taught me how to live when other options seemed inviting, and above all else, it left me with a unique ability to connect with the similarly scarred. I certainly have a share of damage, but through the hell, I gained appreciation for heaven. I was never keen to the phrase ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". Instead I would say, ""what doesn't kill you shows that you can survive"". So I say survive until you thrive, and fuck anyone who doesn't support your strive.

It never fails to makes me feel a bit less isolated when I find souls who have undergone similar sorrows. I hope reading this can offer someone a strange sense of peace .",2022-02-25 23:13:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643006189,1,/r/lonely/comments/t1herz/the_loneliness_that_plagued_me/,,0,1,The loneliness that plagued me

4513,t1jnde,The_Big_Wazowski237,"TLDR I'm homeschooled and lonely my parents don't really care i try to talk to girls on the internet but they think I'm creepy. You should probably read it because I explain things more even though you can't read any of it








I'm a 16 year old boy about to turn 17 next week and i do school online I did homeschool for like 5 years but i used to go a like charter school type thing were i would go to a class once a week and I had friends there but it stopped in 2019. I still see a couple of my friends from there but we don't really have a lot in common. I've found a few other friends on an Instagram account I made there is this one girl Mary who used to go to that class with me she now goes to a public school but I really remembered her because she actually talked to me and she was really cool and she's really pretty. So i found her on Instagram and started talking to her but i guess I creeped her out because I wouldn't ever end a conversation i just kept wanting to text her but she had a boyfriend so she eventually blocked me but i kept trying to talk to her and she didn't want to talk to me. I told her i was sorry for being texting so much i explained that i was homeschooled and didn't have friends or know how to talk to people and she forgave me and i sometimes talk to her I'm really lonely but i don't think she'll let me follow her. I told her i liked her and wanted to talk to her but she told me she didn't remember me so that sucks. There's another girl I used to go to public school with named Claire and I found her account because someone i follow follows her so i talked to her and it she actually started talking to me and said she had an old year book and found me in it and told me she had a crush on me and i used to have a crush on her and again I remembered her name since we went to school and we texted each other for a few days until I made it weird and kept telling her how lonely I felt and kept texting her when she was busy and when she didn't respond I sent her a long text that sounded very desperate and she responded with something like woah dude and an emoji so i don't think I'm gonna make her want to talk to me again which sucks because i really wanted to talk to her but i always makes things awkward and uncomfortable i have high functioning autism so that might have something to do with it because i don't know. She still follows me and i still follow her she hasn't blocked me or anything but she's not responding to me i know i sound like a creep or something but i just don't have any friends to talk to because everyone is busy and I'm never busy i just want to feel normal. There's a few other girls that are also homeschooled I found on reddit that said they would talk to me but when I sent them a text i got no response.  A lot of times when i feel lonely I'll usually watch movies or play music but a lot of times when i get really lonely I'll watch porn or masterbait to celebrity women and stuff like that I don't like talking about this but I keep doing this and i always feel terrible after and i feel like a loser. I hate that i ever found porn because it makes me feel even more depressed and i wish i can have a more innocent brain that doesn't think about porn at all. I also watch YouTube pretty much all day and I  know that's also not healthy but I do it because I'm too lazy to do stuff I want to do that's productive like read. I used to read everyday for a few months and now I've stopped. Every time i try to my brain just thinks of a million other things and i can't focus on what im reading. Yesterday i read a book using an audiobook and that helped a lot actually so I'll probably start doing that. I also have been going to sleep very late at night usually at like 2 or 3 I'll be on my phone all night and wake up at 10 and don't want to wake up. I sometimes bang my headnon the wall when  i get mad or sad I do it really hard sometimes and don't know why i keep doing it. People tell to just do something about it like just put down the phone or try to get a job or go outside and makes some friends or tell my parents i want to go to school but it's not that easy it's hard to tell my parents anything because they think I'm doing fine and my mom even told me that I don't need friends and family is all that i need. I haven't talked much about my family so I'll just say I'm starting to hate my mom even tho i know she does a lot and I'm not saying she doesn't but she's not a very good person because she always takes my problems and tells me that she's gone through worse and that I'm just feeling sorry for myself. I've told them that I've feeling lonely and they don't really know what to do so I don't know anymore. I said I'm almost 17 in a week but it does not feel like that at all i still feel like I'm 14 there's kids that my little sister talks to that are younger than me that who are smarter than me. I'm not very smart as you can tell by my spelling that's why my parents don't want to put me in public school because they think online is easier which if probably is but I just want to feel normal and see people and make friends. I hate to say this but I almost went to school last year but i got scared because i was going to a summer school and i didn't want to do that so my mum just didn't put me in now I wish i did but i just got so used to being inside all day. Again i feel like such a loser because I can't do anything without somebody telling me what to do I'm so dumb. I don't know what I'm supposed to do i want to talk to some sort of therapist but my mom just ignores when i tell her that. Honestly all i want right now is a girl my age to talk to and hug . I know this sounds really weird but lately I've been fantasizing about like another timeline where I go to school and meet this pretty girl who likes the same stuff as me and we talk about movies and music we like and she's like my imaginary girlfriend who i bring to my house and we hang out all the time and she even helps with school work and helps me focus on reading and i won't go into more detail than that but yeah. I want to one day write or direct movies but I don't think I'll ever do that as soon as i want. Yeah that's all i had to say sorry it didn't make sense I'm just trying to get this out fast. I just want someone to talk to what should i do?",2022-02-26 00:59:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1631754084,2,/r/lonely/comments/t1jnde/im_homeschooled_lazy_have_nobody_to_talk_to_and_i/,,1,0,"I'm homeschooled, lazy, have nobody to talk to and I think about girls like all day.

4515,t1jpgo,[deleted],"I've only got three friends. I've only HAD three friends for years now. And they used to be my BEST friends, but now we're either drifting apart, fighting, or I feel pressured to the point of avoiding them until I get lonely enough to come back.

One is constantly passive-aggressive towards me, and I towards them ‚Äî we just argue constantly and I couldn't even tell you why anymore. The other found other, better friends and treats us all as an afterthought. The third I'm dating, but our relationship feels so lacking even as nice as she is ‚Äî I don't feel a connection anymore on any fronts, even as just friends. Conversations are awkward and suddenly I don't feel comfortable being myself, even when she's just as out there as I am.

But those are the only friendships I have, even if they don't feel like it anymore. Disappearing only ends in me coming back as soon as I can't stand the quiet anymore ‚Äî even if it feels cheap, it's all I have going for me. It's so miserable, especially when I think about how it USED to be.

I miss feeling connected with people, having friends that shared my interests and opened me up to new things, having people that acted genuinely happy with my presence instead of us just kinda awkwardly existing in the same space. I miss when we could be honest with each other about the good and bad, when you could be listened to and also have someone that wanted you to listen to them.

I don't even know what's holding our little group together anymore, everything feels so superficial.

And it just feels so rough on my end. Because these are the only people I have. They have other people. I don't. I'm not even really sure how to make friends anymore. Everyone I meet is so different from me that I feel obligated to hide a lot of aspects about myself for fear of judgement ‚Äî and that just sucks the fun out of spending time with anyone, y'know?

It's just so frustrating how hard it is to connect with people these days, or just find people with similar, dorky interests. Everyone's too serious, or too fragile, or just too superficial and it SUCKS.

The lies I've been fed my entire life they're hard to let go of. I won't deny that but in the end it's nothing but fantasy. I am alone, always and I'm going to die this way.

It always ends the same. So in a way I was already dead. Just pretending as long as I could but there was nothing there to hold on to but lies..I'm beyond stupid.

4538,t1na8p,[deleted],"So... It's the mental stories about ""myself"" that seem to cover this love and the sense of wellness. The ""me"" that the mental stories refer to is a mental appearance, an image, an idea. And what we actually are, what this love is, is not an idea or an image. This has to do with the silent, ever present, open awareness that is aware and open to all stories and feelings. Open even to hurt as it appears. At the same time there is the understanding that none of the stories have to do with this source of wellness that is ""prior"" to all stories, feelings, images that appear.

The feeling of this love is like being in love and in direct union with the most precious of friends, even though no separate body is being seen. In a way this is your own self but not the boring old self-image that you've confused yourself as. This is freshness, unknowable (or something more than merely anything ""knowable""), most intimate and loyal friend that there can be in a way. When this doesn't seem to be there it doesn't mean that it is not present. The experience of loneliness is due to turning the gaze away from the Beloved into imaginings. Into thoughts and mental images. And taking yourself to be a mentally made sense of separation that in reality you are not. The Beloved has not gone anywhere.

For this to be apparent, seeing the imagination and thought-activity for what it is and refusing to go with it is required. Staying still in the face of the apparent mind-movement of mental noise and images that seemingly tries to look like ""me"" and ""mine"". Staying still in the face of perceived vulnerability and perceived threat (a perceived threat can be something like a mere emotion or a feeling). Just witnessing from absolute stillness is enough. But it requires absolute stopping/withdrawal from the so-called mind-stream. And just witnessing how the so-called mind moves without linking with any kind of a self-definition that appears. Witnessing also the apparent forming of self-definitions.

If the post made any sense and if there is any interest in hearing more of these kinds of pointers to what is true and what is not, there are people/friends on youtube (for example) that talk about these things.

One of them being Mooji. Check him out if interested. No obligations of course.

Oh, forgot to mention. The loving does not require a specific object like another person but another apparent person, or even a pet, might be helpful in sparking the initial recognition/remembrance of this. ""Being"" itself is already just loving without a specific and an exclusive object though.",2022-02-26 03:51:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/t1na8p/i_live_alone_havent_had_any_real_friends_for_a/,,0,0,"I live alone, haven't had any real friends for a few years now, don't see anyone but I'm able to love nonetheless.

I remember being in the third grade sitting in class and imagine the principal opening the door, telling me my uncle was there to pick me up. I imagined myself packing up my stuff and going with him. The car ride, everything.

I remember taking a shower when I was 11 and pretending Harry, Ron and Hermione where behind the wall, talking to me.

I remember imagining Drake Bell (from Drake and Josh) ringing my door and telling my parents he was my biological brother, that I had to go with him. I remember thinking this as him ""saving me"".

I remember imagining James Franco (as Harry from Spiderman) being my best friend. I remember picturing us in class, joking around. I remember us getting a PS1.

I still do this. But it's only recently I realized I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. I think I started doing it as a kid to scape the real world. Every scenario was me going somewhere else, with different people.

I think this was my way of coping as a kid about having no friends. I remember the central point of my daydreams being about having friends. I also never grew out of it because I still do this.",2022-02-26 04:13:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1541300940,3,/r/lonely/comments/t1nqf8/daydreaming/,,0,1,Daydreaming

4550,t1oux4,GhostMagma,"I was a lonely kid, extremely lonely.

I have an overbearing mother and an absent father. With that being said, my mom raised me but was always scared of the outside world, so she kept me inside just so I'd be safe. Think of it as like Rapunzel, except mother Gothel actually wanted what was best for her daughter.

This caused me to develop severe depression and anxiety amongst other issues. It made it EXTREMELY difficult to talk with others and develop any type of connection. I don't interact with my family much because they can be quite aggravating and the conversation is far from stimulating, so it made me crave for a connection outside of my house. I've had no issues connecting with people on Tinder/Instagram other social medias, however it's not enough for me anymore. When the time comes to meet with others I feel this weight of dread and fear that my mother has instilled in me for so long. Ultimately my ""connections"" die off because I never meet anyone face to face. I really want to... I just can't. 

Unfortunately the times that I did push through and have met with ""friends"" or those interested in me, it has ended with me being \*ssaulted. It has made my loneliness so much worse that it's mindnumbingly painful.

In my entire life I never had a friend, who lasted longer than one year. Only a few who as I said came and went. Only a former best friend stayed with me for like 2 years but also left as he started getting less nerdy and more popular (going to parties, drinking, hanging out with the ""cool kids"" etc...)

Today is my 19th Birthday and things are all the same. No friends, no love life. At least I did a few things tho, I go to the gym now and I droped out of school to find a job (hopefully), because learning has become very hard for me with mental health issues.

4558,t1pa3m,dogstatic,"So I'm writing because I feel like I need someone. I could really use a therapist (couldn't we all?) but therapy is expensive and, besides, it's not a professional psychologist that I need, necessarily. It's just someone to air everything out with. Someone I can be honest with and share the darkest corners of my psyche with. I'm not saying I need someone to tell about the bodies in my basement, just someone I can *really* tell things to. It doesn't matter who (because let's be honest with ourselves here, just having the chance to talk like that is enough of an opportunity for revelations to start spilling out by themselves), what matters is just having someone.  


But the problem is, of course, that such a deep connection has to be formed naturally, I can't just force someone to bear my psychological baggage, and, from my experience, it doesn't happen very often. I've never really had it. Maybe the potential was there in some of the connections I've made but just having the right kind of soil isn't enough to cause a seed to become a tree; it requires sunlight, water, the right weather conditions, and, most importantly, time.

4576,t1ralr,[deleted],"Sitting here drinking whiskey on a Friday night by myself.

Feels like every girl I have every truly liked and tried to pursue has always ended up leaving me or absolutely wrecking me in the end. Every time it feels like the same effect, months of feeling like I have no energy, neglecting my friends to the point I stop getting invited to things, not enjoying my hobbies as much anymore. I've noticed in recent years I find myself getting a lot more pessimistic about my relationship failures and I just don't know what to do. Things get worse and worse each time and the last attempt at a relationship I had was bout a year and a half ago and I am still not out of the rut it put me in.

Its always been a shitty pattern of mine, getting too invested into relationships and romanticizing things only to get hurt in the end. But yeah I am pretty fucked up now. I sustained an injury and had to be hospitalized during this past ""relationship"", had to withdraw from my last semester of school and was basically unable to work out for several months, or keep a job, and couldn't even really play video games either it was hell. She left me for another guy who she told me was her friend when we first met but he lived in another country, she left me while I was in the hospital as soon as he got home from the airport.

Before all of this I pretty much just had petty heartbreaks, but they always felt so real and shitty, I guess I am just sensitive as much as I hate to admit it. Or maybe I am just a weird hopeless romantic. Like I said I have noticed the trend for a while, I guess this last chick leaving me just really put the nail in the coffin when it comes to me really accepting I am just doing shit wrong one way or another. With girls that I really felt like I loved I always knew it was because I was doing too much, I have been kind of obsessive in the past and I cringe when I think about certain things I've done in those regards. It just seems like I can keep a girls attention for 3 messages/conversations, or I end up getting completely played and used for 3 months, no in-between.

Now i have graduated school and I have an ok job. My hand is mostly better and I somewhat work out again, but I still do not live up to even half of my potential because I still feel so drained. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of getting so wrapped up and invested in whatever girl I meet that even remotely catches my eye because I am always recovering from being hurt by someone else. Its been this way since I was like 16 when I first got cheated on. It is to the point where now it is affecting me even when I meet a new girl, whether it is organically or through some dating app/social media. I find myself having shorter and shorter interactions with these girls because I just don't have the energy anymore I guess? I almost can feel that something is off with me and even though the conversations go well I usually end up getting ghosted.

I'm (M/24), about 6'4"", played sports in school growing up and still maintain a relatively athletic lifestyle although I do not have near enough energy to workout and stay ripped like I used to. Even though my self-esteem is completely shitbagged and wrecked, I know I am pretty good looking cause it seems like every girl I pursue or flirt with has to tell me a million times. Literally a girl that ghosted me a couple weeks ago would not stop telling me how sexy I was when she was drunk it was almost annoying. Id give myself about a 8/10 and if I could just fucking get over myself and work out/eat consistently I think I could damn near be a dime.

I haven't ever really been the player type, granted I had a phase or two during college where I hooked up with people. But I have never had an issue attracting women, it's always just been the problem of getting them to stay. In the past few months I have bagged two of the most fine girls I have probably ever talked to, both of them ghosted me. Now in the past, my primal male brain probably would have at least gotten a hookup out of one of these girls or something to at least numb the pain right? Not this time, not in a while actually, I have no energy, no effort, no drive, just feeling dead inside. Its not like if had I gotten laid it would have made it better anyway, just prob would have made it worse, but yeah that's a double-edged sword of insecurity and regret right there, it would have been shitty either way and I think that is the sad state of my mental health ATM lol.

I feel like so much stuff about me is off-putting, especially to women around my part of the country. I am from the south where I grew up with a good family and went to private school but played competitive basketball in the inner-city. I am country as hell and grew up riding fourwheelers and driving big trucks but also grew up smoking pot and blasting street music with my teammates. I was a ""jock"" athlete in highschool that was being recruited for college and although I partied a decent amount and had social interaction, a lot of my best time was spent staying at home playing video games with my ""nerdier"" friends (which few people knew about). Most girls think i would drive a truck, sit around all day and sports bet, go hunting, etc., and most of my knowledge would consist of college basketball. You would not believe the amount of girls I have met that have acted like it was the most surprising/cool thing that a guy like me was into the same kind of art/podcast/anime/etc as them only to see them talking to someone else a few months later who is holding a catfish in their pfp.

Idk I feel like I used to take pride in myself and have confidence. I used to like that some aspects about my character and my interests might seem conflicting to people. I used to think that someone might appreciate it one day. But ever since all these girls have come around to make me feel all special for it n' shit just to end up leaving me in the end, has me doubting myself like never before and has me completely drained of all my energy to do anything. Like I said it has gone beyond having the energy to pursue a relationship, I don't have the energy to even talk to any new girls that show interest in me, I don't even have the energy to stay healthy. I feel so fucking weird I just don't know what to do. I feel like especially girls now think that I must be weird too since I am a tall good looking guy that has hardly ever had a relationship and is obviously broken and beaten down from past failures. I feel like it is inevitable that she will leave me if I look at her and I am attracted to her in any way at all, so I just choose to be alone.

I‚Äôll see strangers walk by, a familiar face in the elevator, or make small eye contact, and in all of those brief moments I think ‚Äúmaybe this is it. Maybe now my life can truly begin‚Äù. For some reason (probably the social construct surrounding love) I have associated any internal merit with the capability of being loved. I‚Äôve always thought, conscious or not, that the best part of my life would start when someone fell in love with me, and I with them. And I‚Äôve always craved an epic love story: love at first sight, second chances, childhood friends to something more. Ive searched for the beginning of those stories everyday in my life because I know that in the monotony that is my day to day, and the more than likely similar future, the only epic part of my life are my feelings in it. And no feeling can be greater than love, I hope. So, for brief seconds during my day, I fall in love with strangers. I see picket fences, and white gowns. I picture Christmas lights and warm beds. Then I blink. And it was all a daydream. I‚Äôve never been in love, and I know my perspective is askew, but I just hope that one day I will be. That one day I could be consumed by something as powerful, and beautiful, and masochistically blissful as love. But instead those strangers keep walking, elevator doors close, and eyes divert.

4610,t1zcx4,Elaurin34,"Hi there,

I always hear that people need to be able to have fun on their own and when they always drown themselves in company by others they are too dependent on other people. Well it's not like I always seek company but I never do stuff on my own because I always think it's no fun when I do it alone. And even if I try it usually feels boring. I also never met anyone new to create possibilities for making new friends. So I am usually just like ""well if it's boring and doesn't help me with what I am trying to achieve I can save money and feel bored at home as well"". So I mostly sit home alone not knowing what to do with my life. It's not like I'm not interested in anything but mostly my interests just come and go every week or two and change all the time. And then there are times when I can't enjoy anything... I always feel like I'd had to do something more productive even after a whole week of work. I started working out every two days now but I can't get rid of this feeling. Especially on rest days I feel completely useless and uneasy.
I don't understand how other people manage to be busy all of the time or at least they act like they never sit at home doing nothing.
Can someone relate to this? What do you do in these situations?

4618,t20xtk,utjgkldfkesp," It was a few years ago when I was studying. I had taken a likening to someone in one of my classes.

I forgot why, just as any other fleeting thing I only seemed to feel. only an object to what I was feeling at the time? maybe. back then, I was still motivated. I had come from a months-long period of depression after getting left out and hurt by my friends a year before that. Either way, it was very strong, a strong desire to get closer.

It was weird. there was this immediate compulsion to fix my life. To get right with how people see me. To be kind. And so I did, for about two weeks. I hadn't really done it yet at the time. but some students in the class eventually noticed the changes in me. they said I got kinder, looked happier, and I seemed to put in a bit more effort in my classes. And then I did become happy because of that. At least for while.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she took notice. A few weeks come by and we started talking to each other for some school event. we hung out, and it turned out that she liked me too because of that. it was my first real chance to be intimate with someone. I think this was the first time I ever felt I was doing something right for myself, even if it wasn't really that.

It was going well for a while, but suddenly, another period of depression had hit me. it was unusual, because I think I'm smart about it and there is usually a trigger. but I didn't know what it was. there should have been no reason for it.

My focus slowly started to wane as the week followed. I slept in my classes, and my grades fell. more importantly, I wasn't living to her expectation of me anymore. I had suddenly lost all motivation to be better.

We hung out less as the weeks followed, and eventually she ignored me completely, even if we attended classes together. I also noticed that my friends had started to avoid me more. I didn't know why. I wanted to know why. For some reason I couldn't tell them why, like they wouldn't understand if I told them. I even tried praying to God why I was like this on why I couldn't be better, even if I didn't really follow him.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, a day came where I just couldn't take it. I didn't attend classes for about a week, disillusioned about all of this. *Why?*

I realized after that week that I was doing all this to feel good about myself. Even though I don't what I should be feeling good about.

I realized after that I had lived inside of my head for so long that all I see is me, and all I feel for is the good of it. In all these stupid ideas of the ideal life, relationship, and routine I saw other people embody, it all became so far to me.

In the manifestation of that everything - so hungry and addicted to that grandiose sense of expectation - I see and feel for nothing. Maybe I just wanted to imagine, but not really live. Maybe, I realized that I don't want to know what I should be good for.

Maybe wanting to get close to her was my way of trying to get close to myself. But I had subconsciously realized that it just wasn't possible. When I realized that it wasn't finally about the relationship and what you feel from it, but for who she is as real, I was... disappointed.

I became disgusted myself after that, and I closed myself off of everyone. Things have been like this for a while, and I still only live inside of me.

4639,t25b5k,peaches483,"I had a pretty decent social life in high school. It dropped slightly my first year of college, but met some one in one of my labs and she introduced me to her other friend and we became a trio. I was working retail at that point and had some pretty good friends from that job too. Met my boyfriend at that job and we now currently live together, but this is not the point of this post. 

The friend I made in college started dating someone that I did not really care for and she complains about him a lot. This made me not hang around her as much as they are engaged and it is tiring to hear negativity in any conversation you have. Only one friend from my retail job has stuck around, but because of busy lives, work, and his own relationship we maybe see them every couple of months but my boyfriend is there because we hang out as a couple. 

Of the two groups of friends in high school, (1) one group every person has basically moved away to states 10+ hour drive making it unrealistic to visit as per normal. Others from that group I was not close to so those relationships fell off. The (2) other group all live in the same relative area, but we have gotten to the point where we hang out once every 6 or so months. The second group had a friend having a wedding shower and I verbally invited them to come see my apartment. They said shouldn‚Äôt be a problem send it in the group text, but then no one ever responded and had an entire week to do so. This was the first time I tried to initiate a gathering so this hurt, especially since over a year ago they were excited for someone else in the group.

I still find myself purposely entering random situations, exposing myself to varied books and wanting to consume various substances in order to coerce new unknown and never before seen reactions from myself, as if I want to discover new things from myself. 

At a lack of people to interact with, I turn inwards for new, and it is now that I have been reading authors like Byung-Chul Han, Lipovetsky and the such that I understand what I'm doing and why I do it, that I want otherness but find the thought of an other with alien goals deeply offensive, so much that I look for said otherness from within myself, thus my past obsession with Jungian thought.

4687,t2czk9,lonelyfishie91,"I just feel so goddamn lost. Being betrayed by the person I loved‚Ä¶finding out that our whole relationship had been based on lies...lies from before we met and lies during our time together.‚Ä¶has destroyed me. That was four months ago. I've been a self-destructive mess since then. Despite meeting someone new and having some good changes happen in my life since then‚Ä¶I'm not okay. I've been broken. I'm changed. I can't think clearly. It feels awful‚Ä¶ 

The first time I've ever been in love. The first time I've ever had [what I thought was] a healthy relationship. The first time I've ever found someone who I felt understood me. I found the person I was willing to do anything for and I did do anything for him and he was just taking advantage of it the whole time. He never loved me. He played me. He's a sociopathic fraud and I gave him my heart and all of my trust. Ever since certain things happened when I was sixteen, I've had major trust issues and sexual trauma. I shared all of this with him and he told me time &amp; time again that he would never hurt me or betray my trust‚Ä¶ He exploited my desire to be loved‚Ä¶ Just lying to me the whole fucking time we knew eachother. At the time, all I knew was that he was someone who was lonely &amp; fucked up like me and we understood eachother and loved eachother unconditionally and belonged together. He was so good to me‚Ä¶ Based on what I knew about him  I believed every word he said. But it turned out I knew nothing about him. His entire life as told to me was just a giant heap of lies. I can't get over this. I don't think I'll ever be the same. I wasn't trusting of people before this and then he turned all that around. I thought I had finally found someone trustworthy. Now‚Ä¶now I'm left even worse off than before. If someone can look you right in the eyes and profess their love &amp; fidelity to you‚Ä¶and it's not real‚Ä¶then idk. How can the lovelight be faked? I saw it in his eyes. How can someone fake that? I'm afraid of everyone now even more than I was before. Before I had only ever experienced people being blatantly shitty to me‚Ä¶ But he led me to believe I was loved and valued and accepted and cared for. 

I loved him so much. I don't love him anymore but this still hurts me. Every fucking day. I still get hit with the physical pain and nausea when I have thoughts having to do with him. 

I can't even go to anyone to talk about it because no one could ever understand the depth of our relationship‚Ä¶what I believed we had‚Ä¶I've never felt it before. There's nothing I can do except stew in it by myself. I can't express anything about it to anyone. I've never been able to verbally articulate my thoughts well but now I'm finding it hard to even write them out. I can only sit isolated in my emotions, feeling miserable. Maybe it's all the drinking &amp; smoking I've done in the past four months. Maybe it's the state of depression I'm in... My psychiatrist told me each episode of depression causes brain shrinkage...and the longer it goes on without intervention the more it continues to shrink... 

When will I really heal from this. Feels like this will just be another facet to the PTSD I've had for the past fifteen years. Except being fooled by the man I loved with my whole heart...feels so much more traumatic than the things I went through back then...",2022-02-27 01:52:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642441109,3,/r/lonely/comments/t2czk9/dead/,,0,1,Dead

4718,t2gdr6,nyx_moonlight_,"I was invited to a gathering this weekend with my roommate &amp; his family. Forced myself to go, telling myself I needed to be around other people, that I've been way too isolated. But once I was there, I kept ending up in a corner on my phone. 

I just felt miserable being around other people. Happy people. People in love. 

I haven't been involved in any kind of dating in two years. My roommate's niece was there. She was FaceTime-ing her new bf after she just broke up with another one. She's much younger and thinner than me, it's not surprising. I just wish it were that easy for me.

 I'm still hung up on someone I dated 3 years ago, that I haven't seen in 2 years. And even though he treated me horribly, it was the deepest connection I'd had in a decade. Every day is a struggle to keep myself from sinking deeper into my depression. I have constant thoughts and memories of him. 

My roommate's ex wife also had a new partner who was there. I'm happy for her but still found my mood just tanking the longer I was there. I realized being there was making me feel lonelier. I kept saying stuff that wasn't that funny but made others laugh while I myself barely smiled. I guess I hide behind humor. 

Anyway, I'm back home and just feel awful. I feel guilty for being so unhappy. I feel like I'm not good company. I wish I had more energy and wasn't so depressed (yes, I'm medicated after trying 5 different antidepressants over a course of 20 years). I wish being around other people didn't make me feel so lonely.

4724,t2h9lg,Snackulois,"My(20m) friend(20m) and I have been friends for a long time. We know each other since kindergarten but we weren't friends until about the end of middle school and we became a lot closer friends in the beginning of High School. We took the bus to and from school together every day,hung out after,and when we weren't with each other we would talk on the phone or play video games almost every day. We are in the same friend group but neither of us hang out with our other friends as much as we did each other. In the last year or two we've been hanging out less and less. My friend has had the same on and off girlfriend for about 5 years(and I don't think she likes me) and she is constantly pulling him away from friend activities. Even when I'm with him he will be on the phone with her nearly the entire time we are hanging out over something very small and petty that she is mad about. I don't want to sound like the jealous friend. Even when they weren't together I've felt like an after thought to him. In recent years we went from talking almost everyday to not hearing from him for weeks at the most 1 month. I've tried a couple of times to plan hangouts but the majority of the time he flakes on me. Recently we hung out and I wanted to see him but it was on his schedule and convenient for him and not very convient for me. Me and my other friends don't really talk that much because they are busy with school,work,or general life things¬† which I sympathize with. We all see each other maybe one a month or every other month when most of our schedules align. This close friend is really the only friend I have left who I talk to somewhat regularly.

I mentally wasn't together since then, and am getting better only recently. It feels waaaaay too late to try to reach out to them and explain now.

Socializing in person? Yeah, right. With the pandemic and with my classes now mostly being online? Plus, I have asthma (bad enough that a common cold sends me to the ER), so I can't risk it. I'm vaxxed, all three doses.

I wonder if anybody out there is remotely similar? Someone who's been unable to find friendship in people thus they turn into Music as their one and only friend who's there for you always.

I‚Äôm so lost and so lonely. I feel like I have no purpose and like such a loser. 

I‚Äôm 30F, I work full time, I have a great group of friends and people who do care about me but at the end of the day they all have their people. I don‚Äôt. And it  just makes me so sad. 

I‚Äôve been single for 5 years now, 4 of those years I had absolutely no contact with men at all and it didn‚Äôt really bother me for the most part, I wasn‚Äôt interested and didn‚Äôt open myself up to be approachable. 

In the last couple of years my friends, who I was pretty inseparable with all partnered up and settled down, they don‚Äôt have the same time for me anymore and I fully understand that, but it really sucks now having to schedule in advance if I want to spend time with them because their schedules are so full with their partners and when we do see eachother it‚Äôs just not the same anymore. They‚Äôve changed. 

Anyway, the last 12 months I tried dating again. It‚Äôs been a disaster. If I went into how badly I‚Äôve been treated I‚Äôd be typing all night. After a string of awful interactions I finally met someone who I really thought was going to be ‚Äúmy person‚Äù and it felt so comforting, I thought I was fine all those years alone but once I got a taste of that again I realised how badly I missed intimacy and how nice it was to have that again. 

Long story short, that didn‚Äôt work out either. I guess I got too excited and I overwhelmed him. He said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù he was, he found someone else pretty quickly, he just didn‚Äôt like me. 

Since losing him I just can‚Äôt get over this feeling of hopelessness and loneliness. I feel so damaged now and I know that I couldn‚Äôt possibly go through this again no matter how badly I want it.

I so badly want someone who cares and wants to share their life with me. Someone that is on my side and I can come home to everyday and talk to about everything. I‚Äôm so disconnected from literally everybody but so desperately crave a deep connection. 

I can‚Äôt do it all over again. It‚Äôs brutal and I truly feel like there isn‚Äôt anyone out there for me anymore. But I‚Äôm really struggling to accept it.

I am no contact with my family as they were mentally, emotionally, physically and financially abusive/manipulative. I don‚Äôt tell people the whole story until we‚Äôre in a relationship.

4805,t2rfp6,xXMissunattractivexX,"So, I (F20) met this guy (M23) on reddit. He was sweet, kind, nice etc...We facetimed everyday and had hour long talks. He was from the UK and I'm in the US, so we made plans for us to meet up. We were going to get an airbnb, I was going to cook for him, and we were going to spend our time together. I was soooooo convinced I had a guy like me for me, he even watched me delete my tinder profile account for him and sat and watch me cry as I told him the bullying I went through in Highschool. The other day I brought up religion. I asked if he's parents would care what religion I was, he said no. He told me that once he gets his own place then things like that wouldn't matter. (He's Muslim), so after that conversation we ""fooled around"" like playing with ourselves and talking sexually, I thought all was good. The next morning he texts me how he misses me and how he wants to see my face but then minutes later he writes how he's been thinking of what we were doing and how he has been sinning by saving my naked pictures and he shouldn't be with a non Muslim woman and can't marry a non Muslim woman...not like I wanted to get married anyways lmao.... and that PISSED ME TF OFF. This man told me plans on plans how he wanted to see me etc. I feel sooooo fucking stupid. I'm honestly done trying to find a partner. I might aswell become a men hater because what the actual FUCK!!! I know that not all men are like this but it's enough to make me want to die alone.

4807,t2rpqy,Sarah6893,"Im just really here to vent, so here I go. I guess that now I‚Äôm in high school things have changed. Though it was only for the worse. All the other people I knew in my life changed for the better, they got more friends, more popular and all that stuff. While now I just stand alone and observe everything. I became the one thing I feared my whole life. To be lonely and have no one. 
I remember from elementary school I had quite a bit of friends. I never Ed had too many though as the years went by, I had more and more. By the time I was fourth grade, I had my first ever friend group. As time went by and I went in middle school, we were still in that friend group (I went to a k-8 school). Even more people came into our friend group and all things were good. One of those people, that were with me since 4th grade, we‚Äôll call Abby. We were pretty close, not like BFFs but close. Though I guess things stated to change. We were all close until COVID happened. Just like that, we were in quarantine. During that time, I texted her a bit, not too much since I never really texted many people. Though when we went back to school (we were now in 8th grade) we kinda split. I don‚Äôt really know why but we just did. I started hanging around these other two people and we became really close, like we were all just three BFFs. While Abby kinda went with some other people. I guess I could see it coming though it still hurt to just see her change like that and not really want to be with me anymore. Thoughts that‚Äôs not the end of it. Once I got high school, everything changed. I remember standing there in the cafeteria, wondering were to sit on that first day. I saw Abby hanging with these two other people from my old school and some people I didn‚Äôt know. I went up to them, trying to sit with them and they declined. So I alone next to the wall, which was right next to them. I tried to but in some of there conversation but they just ignored me. It became that for the first few days. I sat next to wall trying to talk to them while they just ignored me. I eventually gave up and faced the wall. I was still okay because I had hope, though now I completely give up since now moths have passed by and I still have nobody. I went from everything to nothing. And it‚Äôs not like Abby started some completely new path in her life because she still hanged out with all the other kids from my old school. Even the ones she wasn‚Äôt even friends with. Though one person who was in your friend group, you just completely ignored. You knew I was alone, you saw me alone even single day. And yet you did nothing. You left me there alone with nobody so you could have the time of your life. 
Know from feeling this, my life has been getting really hard. I gave up on everything and I‚Äôm even kinda suicidal.

You got people who sometimes reach out but then really hurt or upset that you do not living in a world of positivity. Like no shit. Hard to be positive when everything in your life is shit and you see no way out of it. So why do people reach out fully knowing this and expect differently it just doesn't make any sense. All it ends up doing is punishing the people who are already suffering because they abandon them they make them feel bad for being alone and depressed. It is not cool at all.

4824,t2v7gd,UnderlyingMind,"In the mornings of days that I don‚Äôt have work, I browse stuff on my phone‚ÄîReddit, TikTok, Instagram, random content to wake up. I opened instagram, and foolishly opened my crush‚Äôs story who I‚Äôm somewhat still I contact with. I saw that last night, she got married to her boyfriend of a few years. To premise, I am diagnosed with depression and have dealt with confidence and anxiety issues for years, and my major vulnerability is my difficulty with romantic relationships. It‚Äôs a major point of self-loathing, which kind of propagates itself when I‚Äôm in situations where someone is possibly interested in me. I‚Äôve seen a therapist for a long while, though, and have practiced mindfulness and redirecting my mind when useless self-hating thoughts start rising. But this? Seeing her getting married and being happy while I‚Äôm just sitting alone in my bed on a Sunday morning, struggling to just get up? It rips a hole inside me. I feel worthless, empty, like it‚Äôs useless to go outside or try new things like I‚Äôm ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to. I would say there‚Äôs nothing redeemable in me, but that‚Äôs the worst part, because there IS. If I get real, I‚Äôm pretty smart, I‚Äôm pretty funny, I like to be creative with writing or worldbuilding, and I‚Äôm very sensitive to others‚Äô feelings and my own. I‚Äôve been told these things. But that‚Äôs what makes it all the worse, because then this must mean the reason I am alone is because I am ME. The ‚Äúme‚Äù in me must just be‚Ä¶wrong. Undeserving. Repulsive. Just not enough. It‚Äôs really‚Ä¶just unbelievably painful. I remember when my crush visited me as a friend a few years ago from where she was living after moving, and she talked about this guy, thinking that it may grow into something, and I remember feeling that deep hateful jealousy inside, but said nothing. I had already told her I liked her, she already told me she didn‚Äôt have feelings for me. I guess I wasn‚Äôt enough. I guess I‚Äôm just not enough. I keep telling myself that you‚Äôll find someone, you have before but it just didn‚Äôt work out because of circumstances (I‚Äôm not totally inexperienced, I‚Äôve had budding relationships and interests now and then), but every month it becomes harder to believe‚Ä¶A childish part of me wishes and wants a magic cure, something I can do that‚Äôll just make the pain go away so I can enjoy my life, alone or not, but I know that‚Äôs not real. So I get stuck in these cycles of immediate self-gratification: video games, junk food, porn, all of which I hide from people in my life so no one really realizes how bad it is. I can feel my health declining, my heart hurting, and even when I go to the gym I still feel the emptiness.      

Am I just not enough?

I understand why he had to end it, and I have tried not to dwell on everything for too long. I‚Äôve put my life back together, started to make more friends and put myself out there more. I started anti-depressants and therapy so I can work through a lot of my issues. I‚Äôm worked very hard to adjust to a reality that doesn‚Äôt include him. 

But I still can‚Äôt help but miss him every damn day. I went to a small gathering last night with a new friend. There was a few local artist performing, hand made goods for sale, places to do art and play cup pong. I danced all night and it was amazing, I had a wonderful time.

It felt like I was missing a piece of myself, and it made it so difficult to be fully present in that space because of it. 

I just really don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to survive without him. Everything in my life is better when he‚Äôs there. He is the great lost love of my life.

I'm not sure whether this is for the better or worse. I guess if I'm destined to be on my own, I might as well get used to it. The only time I even feel a spark of my old self is when I'm alone or with someone I have a deep, loving connection to, something that is hard to come by nowadays.

To preface, I don‚Äôt have any problem with people helping out others and giving bits of advice. Some people do want some insight on their situation, some just wanna vent. 

But *WTF* is with all this forced positive posts popping up and getting upvoted? There‚Äôs just as much comments calling people attention seeking just because they go through loneliness? It could be the case but if you‚Äôre going to say that then almost every post here is like that. 

‚ÄúOh you haven‚Äôt tried hard enough‚Äù

This is exactly why I don‚Äôt reach out to anyone anymore because of assholes like this downgrading my experiences. Most of these ‚Äúadvices‚Äù boil down to ‚Äúforget and move on‚Äù ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù and ‚Äúsuck it up, nobody cares‚Äù. 

Wanna know the real kicker? These people tend to say ‚Äúoh I've been there before‚Äù and haven't elaborated any further on that. Some will make posts telling people to just forget all their problems and people will soon come to them. When you check these profiles to see an update you can't even see it because they deactivated/deleted their account. Wow, how helpful to lonely people!

4912,t38b3u,ravynkish,"I'm married (4 years in Oct) with a 2 year old. My family sucks. They're unreliable (the ones that are still alive) and my spouses family is small, old, out of state or all the above. It's me and my husband white knuckling life. My sister (I love her but a never ending Shakespearean tragedy) and my mother (same here, too) are my only 2 options outside of a stranger or facility- can't really afford and don't really want to anyway d\t COVID, etc. I have 2 dogs, rescues, and one is so fucking nutty and incessant (a coonhound) with severe food aggression and a really huge set of balls. (We have to lock food away or carry with us if we walk away because he's sneaky, quick and annoyingly smart.) With every possible precaution - we hang our garbage bag in the freaking air- he still manages to steal food multiple times a day...incessant. 
My mom is ALWAYS watching my niece so my sister can go out and do wtfe and then there's no one available to give me a break. (I should also mention, I am STILL BREASTFEEDING MY TODDLER ON DEMAND AT 2.5 YEARS OLD. She's great! I see the benefits of breastfeeding, she's smart and kind and sweet and beautiful. But I feel absolutely 100% alone. I have arthritis and a birth defect in my spine that leaves me in chronic pain. At 28 years old. My abs ripped apart from my pregnancy (diastasis recti) and so my core is not really adding much help for my back pain at all. 
My mother and husb are chronic interrupters. No matter how many times I bring it up and feel we get some headway, it happens again and again and again. 
So I just keep it all inside and bottle it up. Grow resentments like a flower bed and harvest anger (which I present to everyone, especially myself- not helping my pain either, I'm sure). I'm so depressed. 
My husband is forward thinking and a self proclaimed feminist, and I have seen improvements in some aspects. (he struggles with OCDPD) but the hypocrisy of the things he tells me that I do\dont do or the things he asks of me for him (affection, love, compassion) are rarely reciprocated. 
I don't know what the FUck to do. We're moving soon. I'm in therapy, I'm taking medication for depression and a low dose stimulant for my ADHD (I did GENESIGHT testing and found out that my body doesn't metabolize *any* antidepressant well enough for it to be beneficial and that stimulants are the only thing that I really do metabolize). 
I wake up every morning with a text from someone who is asking me for something. Can I do this, can I help with that.
I cannot rely on anyone else to fucking handle it so I can do some self care. I have not been able to develop a routine because I'm like a 9. 1. One service to everyone I know. 
The thing that hurts me about my husband is that he can be so understanding and compassionate in theory, but when I express any specific thing, my feelings are minimized and he becomes defensive. It then becomes about him, and I feel guilty for fucking saying anything or God forbid being a fucking burden to anyone who I so freely give myself to... That I just bury it and move on. My patience ever-thinning and my anger ever-growing. 
I don't want to be like this.i don't want to feel like this. I do not see any end in sight. I'm perpetually exhausted from existing as a npc in everyone else's life, I can't be the main character in my own. I'm too tired to explain to people why I'm too tired to explain to them why I'm not explaining it to them. So I really end up in this cycle of having no support.",2022-02-28 05:50:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595259389,2,/r/lonely/comments/t38b3u/lonely_with_a_child_and_a_marriage/,,0,3,Lonely with a Child and a Marriage

4923,t39yvg,alone3674,"I (29M) had the joy of watching one of my closest friends get married, and it was honestly a beautiful and wonderful celebration! I was in her bridal party, as was my ex (she became her best friend while we dated), who I still consider one of my best friends, and our breakup was totally amicable. I hadn't seen my ex since the breakup (5 months ago) because we live in different countries, and it was amazing to see her and catch up, but we both got pretty emotional at the end of the night when we shared how we've been since we separated (she dumped me fyi). 

We both want nothing but happiness for the other person, and have no ill will, it really is as healthy as a breakup can be. That being said it was still really, really hard to see her again. Old wounds opened up, emotions came flooding back, we both ended up crying in each other's arms a few times... We hung out almost every day I was in town, but it didn't hurt until we opened up emotionally again. She's casually dating a guy now, which I fully support, but I'm a little too busy and not at a point in my life where dating interests me. It was just hard going through the wedding with her by my side (I was planning on proposing before the break), then celebrating love, and seeing so many loving couples, and how happy they are. I miss that feeling of love, and being loved. I don't necessarily miss it with her, but I don't know that love from anyone else. 

I don't even really know what I'm saying. I know I don't have the capacity to be with someone again, and I'd need to find them first. I've been so busy with school, life, and work that I've forgotten just how lonely I sometimes feel, and this week really knocked me on my ass. It sucks.

One night we were out at a fancy hotel bar and‚Ä¶BOOM‚Ä¶lights went out. My first seizure caused a pretty wicked traumatic brain injury. The next thing I remembered were the bright lights in the trauma unit. Then I went back to sleep. 

When I woke up everything was different. One of the side effects of going Humpty Dumpty with my skull is called pseudobulbar affect syndrome. The way perceive and express emotion is dysregulated, so my brain tends to overreact and cry uncontrollably at slight triggers. Because of the way I used to be, no one knows how to handle me when I show real emotion instead of bullshit, always positive facade. I was always the one to lift everyone‚Äôs spirits. No one does that for me. So now I just isolate because it is not any one‚Äôs job to make me happy. 

I‚Äôm addition, now I work from home. I am alone all day, and whenever everyone is home I just keep to myself. My wife and I talk about tasks like roommates. As a chronic insomniac as well, I stay awake until 4-5 am by myself. Cycle, rinse, repeat. That is the current state of my life. 

I need deep emotional connection with people. As an introvert, I hate small talk as I would rather dive into something really interesting. I always kept a small circle of friends to whom I was very loyal. But since my injury, my friend list is at zero.

I don‚Äôt feel happy bout myself I‚Äôve felt like a Cynical Ass

The funk (as I call it) lasts usually till about 10 o clock on the days I work early. It mostly goes away cause well I get paid to stock produce and cut fruit not to wallow in sadness. 


The days I work late are a lil worse cause on those days it‚Äôs not constant down parts of the day feel slow if there is nothing to do that moment, and some days are fast paced.


Then when I get home I just get hit with drowsiness and sleepy feelings which I feel werid about cause I don‚Äôt work as long as like my mom or dad does. Like yesterday I get home from work at 3:40-3:50

I let the dog out lay on the couch my dad texts me not even 30 mins later about how‚Äôs he‚Äôs got food for dinner go to his house

Then as I‚Äôm summoning the will to get up he‚Äôs like also can you grab me abc x y and Zed. And also bring the dog. 

So after a nice dinner and time with my dad I go home it‚Äôs about like 8-9 o clock 

The minute I sit down it‚Äôs like I ran a marathon or something my eyes feel so heavy I pass out on the recliner which something I‚Äôve never done before 

My mom came home around like 10:30  and I woke up dead ass from my sleep and it‚Äôs all so disoriented I‚Äôm like just slowly shuffling over to my room, and like  just like slurring my words and yawning like crazy  and coughing.


I remember the other day I woke up ans everything felt heavy like it wasn‚Äôt sleep paralysis I could move and breath fine but like lifting my arms and body it was like a weight was on my body like I forced myself to sit up and it was like my body just collapsed back into my bed.

I tried checking my phone and nearly locked myself out of my phone cause I could coordinate my hands correctly.


But like other big life events include my Mema being put into a Rehab facility so my family has a lot of drama about that it‚Äôs all chaos and a big fiasco 

Also like my fish have just been dropping dead left and right and like I‚Äôve been working on it trying to fix it but it‚Äôs just sad but like I know there fish and they don‚Äôt have like the emotional capacity of like a dog but like I really like my fish it‚Äôs so cool and I feel a bit guilty there dying, and  it feels like no matter the money I put into it it‚Äôs not working (or working fast enough) to reverse the damage.

I've spoken with friends for maybe an hour in that time. I want to talk with them more, but unlike me they actually have lives that need living. They're working for Moderna and the navy, and my autistic ass has been working 8 hour max weeks at a Marshalls for the past two months.

I wish someone actually wanted me around. I legitimately can't remember the last time I was invited to do anything, hell, I can't remember the last time someone simply messaged me for conversation and not just to ask a quick question. Growing up I didn't have any real friends, just people who weren't mean to me and tolerated my presence. I was so happy when I finally had real friends in high school, but that was almost ten years ago, and now like I said earlier, everyone but me is busy with life.

I want to try and meet new people, make new friends, maybe actually have someone want to maybe go on a date with me, but where I live there's pretty much nothing for my age group or my hobbies. There's a barcade, but I don't make enough money to go there very often. I've tried multiple apps to meet people: meetup, tinder, bumble, PoF, hiki, but no one within like 100 miles so much as wants to chat or be friends, let alone anything more.

Social anxiety shapes the perception of ourselves, of the outside world. How exactly is this accomplished? One possible explanation is offered by the field of emotion regulation. Social anxiety influences our emotion regulation strategies, for example in their effectiveness and/or frequency of use. Simply said, emotions which drag us down overstay their welcome, while emotions which bring us joy stop visiting. The lack of positive and the excess of negative emotions then influence how we see ourselves. One explanation for how social anxiety shapes our perception.

My team and I (graduate students and a lecturer at the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Vienna) are further investigating this topic. For example, we want to find out, if the relationship between emotion regulation and social anxiety changes regarding experienced loneliness.

By participating, you would help us to find answers to our questions. All you need is 20-30 minutes of spare time and you need to be over 18 years old. It is recommended to use a Laptop or Computer (for format reasons).

The link to the study is:

You will find further information on the website.

You can also comment below if you want to know more. I try to answer as fast as I can.

4978,t3jcy9,LonelyLameWeeb,"My happy, safe place used to be my home. Now it's just a cold and  alien house. Place where recently more bad memories were created than good. A place I can't leave because I can't afford anything on my own. A place that used to bring me joy, made me feel peaceful and loved. It's like a shadow of its former self. The room I used to play in with my cousins is now a room where my grandfather died, the yard i played with my toys in, is a place where my childhood dog is buried.

My happy home turned out to be a fabrication, something a child didin't understand, but adult me sees so claerly. Dad drinks too much, mom is overworked and I keep failing myself and everyone around me. I was a ""good child"". Always quiet, always good at school. They expected better from me and I can't stop feeling like my life is the very opposite of what my family wanted from me. 

These days even my imagination isn't enough to bring me comfort, so I look at my laptop screen and watch... anything I can. As long as the video is long. Documentary, interview. Doesn't matter. As long as the sound of the video is louder than the sounds around me. The arguing or the deafening silence.

4985,t3jnjl,sunny_starblossom,"Hi friends,

I know none of you are going to read this because I don‚Äôt plan on ever releasing it.

How‚Äôve you all been? I hope all is well with everyone. I just wanted to take this opportunity to formally apologize for being M.I.A. in your lives. I‚Äôve endured a years‚Äô long battle with abandonment and trust issues. (and still am) 

You see, when I detect any remote signs of something off, I tend to automatically assume the worst. I tend to prepare myself for the worst possible outcome of any situation, and because of this, I begin to lose the interest I once had into investing in these friendships. 

I secretly begin hoping that y‚Äôall will leave me eventually because it hurts too much to do it myself. As much as I have the ability to do so, it sucks to hurt people. As much as I fear abandonment, I would rather y‚Äôall do it first because I‚Äôm already prepared for it. If not, I just wait for everything to fizzle out itself.

I truly hate this part of myself not because I feel like a bad person, but because it affects my ability to form close relationships with others. I see friends or romantic partners who are attached at the hip and constantly long for that. I want to feel loved by someone, yet I laugh in disbelief anytime someone says or tries it. 

As desperate as I am for any sort of connection, I still can‚Äôt allow myself to get hurt again. I feel empty yet more at peace when I‚Äôm lonely. It becomes depressing eventually but I‚Äôd rather have that than my continuously spiraling mind. I want to love but I can‚Äôt. As much as I love y‚Äôall for the company and good times, I don‚Äôt love y‚Äôall on an emotional level. I don‚Äôt love anyone that deeply other than my dog, Jerry, or family (which I question sometimes). It‚Äôs mostly Jerry though. 

Jerry is my rock. He‚Äôs my life. He came at a time I needed him the most. He‚Äôs given me what no one else ever has. He was my best friend when no one else wanted to be.

I don‚Äôt feel included anywhere I am so my friendships mean nothing. But I have company and people to laugh with so that's all that should matter.

I don‚Äôt wanna be a nuisance, or cause any more anguish than I already have. I don‚Äôt have the guts to leave y‚Äôall myself, otherwise I would have a long time ago.

I can't really talk to him about it because then it just goes to the point that we stop talking altogether.

It's like today I don't want my dms flooded with people, and if I state that im a woman then my pms would be just filled with dick pics and fucking shallow people making poor attempts to flirt with me and it's pissing me off. And yesterday I had to deal with this fucker while I'm drugged saying ""take it one day at a time"" that's not the part that I'm pissed off about, it's the fact that he would say ""it's in the past now :)"" and I'm like??? I'm dealing with trauma and feelings in the moment and you're telling me ""it's in the past?"" Like wtf? And he had the AUDACITY to say that he'll ""say it to everyone"" when I asked if he'll say that to people that are fucking dealing with shit, traumatized, almost dead or dealing wjth war?! And then he said that I'm wasting my life being stuck in the past and it's a shame?! 

Excuse me, I admit that I say mean stuff to myself but NO ONE should fucking insult me like that while i just had a dream 10 minutes ago of my mom telling me she loves me but I'm also having flashbacks of her molesting me when I was 5 fucking years old. I'm not a violent person, but at that moment I wished I could go through the fucking screen and give him a good bitch slap and fucking mock him while he winces in pain saying ""why is your face like that? It's all in the past, remember?"" And block him. But the most I could do is yell and block. 

Maybe that's why I'm so hesitant. Sorry about the sudden mood change. I don't know where to post this so I post it here because I'm actually lonely and everywhere else didn't feel appropriate, you know? I'm still affected by someone basically saying ""I can't play this game if we can't voice chat"" and I'm too scared to call my own lover. He isn't even there. He's never there when I need him the most and it's frustrating. I know my last rock bottom was when I was 15 and about to end it, and it'll always be my true rock bottom, but as an adult, this is my rock bottom, it isn't as painful as when I was 15, but god, I'm abusing cbd oil and drinking sleepy tea daily so I can sleep or not feel anything.

5000,t3lzoy,HANtourage,"I have been overweight for most of my life and it has always made me feel so distant from others. It always made me feel like I was less than everyone else and that I had to prove that I was more than just my weight.

Since it's the first thing people see, I always felt like I always walked into a room with a physical representation of how I failed in my life.  Because of this, I never wanted to talk about my weight or draw any attention to it. Unfortunately, that also meant that I could never talk to anyone about how I wanted to lose weight and how I was trying. I always tried in secret and wouldn't ask for help. 

BUT I came across one post that shared common ""fat people problems"" and it weirdly made me feel less lonely and made me want to do something similar.

Hello folks! I've been lurking in this sub from time to time and finally decided to make a post. People around me seem to stick around if they can get something from me, and if they can't - they stop talking to me. I like to help people, but if they don't need anything they just throw away our friendship like trash. My health isn't very good, I have low energy, so I mostly interact with people online. In 2018 I was in toxic relationships where my girlfriend liked to make everything about herself. She was nice to me, so I didn't realize that she was manipulative. We broke up.

I met a girl in 2019 in online game, we clicked, we joked and laughed, we watched some TV shows together, talking through voice chat. She said she was out of relationships and wanted to take things slow. I respected her boundaries. She said she felt lonely cos she's writing a paper so I did my best to keep her company. We chatted almost every day through voice and texted multiple times a day. She was writing a paper for university and working so she didn't have time for irl friends. Then comes summer, she finishes her paper and that's it. We barely text, voice chat only once, iirc. Now she has time for irl friends, I am not needed. I was a placeholder. Then around October she says she found someone, I decide to tell her about my feelings, she doesn't need them and suggests to stay friends. Around New Year 2020 I deleted her from steam friends cos it was too hard to see her name in game. She didn't text me since, she has my number.

2020 rolls in, Covid, social isolation. I get a copy of Animal Crossing for my Birthday and think that finally I'll play with my friends, cos they all play and talk how great they spent time on each other islands. I collect DIY and stuff in case they need anything. They don't. They visit each other, have fun, but don't invite me. If I ask, they are like ""sure come as well"", I ask them to let me know when they will play together next time, they don't. To this day only two of my friends visited my island, once each, when they needed to trade something. I see someone ask for stuff and answer that I have it and they are welcome to come and have it, and someone else says that they have it too, and sure enough that person goes to that other person. I feel so pathetic when I offer help or stuff, because people turn it down in favor of others.

So, 2020 I am depressed over that girl I mentioned before, 2021 my parents and I get Covid and I have even less energy than I had. I slowly recover and start of February 2022 we have Covid (Omicron this time) again. I have even lesser energy now.

I want a girlfriend. Long distance is fine, since I don't have energy for meeting up anyway. I want to write her some silly fluffy stuff in the morning, like ""good morning to most beautiful girl!"", something like that, and wish her good night. I want to watch some TV shows or movies together, joke, laugh, maybe play some games together. I don't want to be a placeholder. I want to care about her and I want her to care about me.

Thank you for reading. I hope you all are okay and staying safe.",2022-02-28 22:07:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646082437,10,/r/lonely/comments/t3rbz7/feeling_lonely/,,0,1,Feeling lonely

5033,t3rnoq,Flyaway_5,"A couple of years ago, I remember helping a woman in the library. She is 40 years my senior. The library is where I first met her. I noticed that she never asked me what my name was, and I do know her name. She asked me if I can fill out marriage certificates online for her and to type for her, and begin asking me for favors or her. She would pay me a couple of dollars in return. 

I was able to get her number and e-mail because she told me to login to her e-mail, and she mentioned her number when we were typing her e-mails. I started calling her and asked her to meet from time to time, because I don't have any friends and wanted her company. Even thought I know the attention she was giving me was not in the way I hoped. She was only using to do things for her and never asked me for my name. I noticed I was always the one who initiated the contact and kept calling her first. She never called me first. Once, she told me, ""I thought about you a lot."" How can she think about me if she doesn't know me? 

I also noticed that she seemed out of touch with reality. She was never able to make reality based conversations with me, and seemed focused on doing things that were unrealistic and would never happen in reality. Like, she told me she has a cousin named Joyce, who is Oprah's cousin. She said she wants to sue David Siegel for 300,000,000 dollars. She said she is filming a movie and will make a million dollars, but till now, there is still no movie I bet. She kept on going on about a movie about just some cornbread and made it into a big deal. She wants to buy a home and contacted mortgage brokers when she has no job and bad credit. 

I also noticed that aside from never calling me by name, she never asked anything about me, like she doesn't care about me. She never asked me where I live, where I work, about my family, what I like to do, etc. If we were hanging out past midnight, what the normal person would say is, ""Hey, it's late, aren't your parents worried?"" She didn't seem to look out for me. We stopped contact a couple of years ago and I have not seen her or heard from her since. 

Why does my friend treat me like a nameless slave? Is filling out marriage certificates something that you can even do online? Is she, like, I dunno, mentally deranged?",2022-02-28 22:21:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601518649,2,/r/lonely/comments/t3rnoq/my_friend_treats_me_like_a_nameless_slave/,,0,3,My friend treats me like a nameless slave

I feel really numb and detached most days and then if not I‚Äôm crying. This is probably gonna be all over the place but there so much I have to say and it all boils down to the same end. I‚Äôm pretty sure my mom is terrified to let me go. I didn‚Äôt get the ready to start driving lesson or the let‚Äôs go car shopping lesson. I‚Äôm forced to depend on her for rides and the only places I go are work and out with her. I didn‚Äôt have sleepovers when I was young and lacked social skills so no friends. Don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to wear shorts outside of the house; hell I‚Äôm scared too and I‚Äôm fucking 20. Any mention of moving out of traveling is met with oh I‚Äôm going with you and if I say no I wanna go by myself it turns into a guilt trip of silent treatment or a dismissive tone of fine then leave.

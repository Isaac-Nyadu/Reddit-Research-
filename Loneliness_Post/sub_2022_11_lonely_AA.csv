2,yit674,rumpelstiltskine,"24m in Singapore. On the surface I seem like the very poster boy of the good Asian kid. I was bright but not extraordinary, and so the little taste I got at the top made me obsessed with it. Being born in an Asian society comes with feelings of inferiority as you are compared relentlessly to other people. And so rise to their level and to compensate for my other flaws, I've never been anything but a busy bee. 

So I pushed away anything fun and did nothing but work hard. It worked, kind of, but all that I had worked for gave me nothing in return. I thought I was ready for the consequences. Now I work to distract myself. I only go faster now. Slow down and the loneliness would catch up to me. I know I can't run forever. I won't have that energy forever.

My attachment issues did not help. From young I was kept at home to study most of the time. So I never kept any friends nor want any after that since I knew it was always ended after 1 or 2 years. They would always move on, and I did not want to hold them back. The pain of discarding all the memories after was too great so I seldom have friends.

Does not help I'm terribly ugly. Kids and old people would Stare at me. Once, a couple tried hard to hold back their laughter when sitting next to me on the train. I also have migraines. And for fear it would set in while outside, I don't go out much.

Weakness is shunned in this culture. Even those at the bottom feel that way.

If anyone wants to talk pm me. I think a good way to start for me is to talk with people who feel the same way.",2022-11-01 00:04:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1562511689,1,/r/lonely/comments/yit674/the_cost_of_success/,,0,0,The cost of success

6,yitnf1,iWantGoodTimes,"I'm 28. I am just so tired of feeling and being completely lonely 24/7. Most people I grew up with have either moved away or just never want to do anything. It's always me who has to initiate conversations, or else I'm never talked to. Each morning I wake up, I'm.immediately ready to hang with people and make plans but nobody does alllll day and night long. It's always me initiating everything and told generic bullshit like ""yeah, for sure!"" when I tell people that we should hangout soon sometime, meanwhile I'm anxiously hovering over my phone 24/7 waiting for those people to get back to me, but they never do.

I just don't get how people can ""forget"" that easily about another human being. I don't get how people's favorite excuse is that they're ""busy"" but then be posting themselves out and about with other people. But me? When I tell someone I'll get back to them, I do so ASAP the same-day, usually the same hour. I make people a priority. I'm constantly craving attention and just wanting to be around people, but it never happens......

People have told me things like, ""oh, just don't keep those people in your life then"" etc etc, but it's like, yeah, OK, then I'll truly have nobody to even talk to. I'm in a very small town. I rather wait by my phone like some lost puppy waiting for its owner to get home from work everyday on the chance that someone might message me than totally just cut those people off and truly have nobody at all. It's so beyond sad.

Video games? Fun for like a hour. TV/Movies? Boring. Reading? Eh. Being outside and walking around? Love to do this but I do this every single day and just see the same things all the time. I'm just so bored of everything when I'm alone and my typical day is waking up, messaging people to hang out, walking to liquor store, then walking to one of my select outdoor drinking spots (woods, railroad tracks, etc.), then waiting and praying for someone to message me all day.
I hate this. So, so much. I go to bars and meet people there sometimes but it's so pointless to me because these people never last in my life. I really only go for the compliments I'll get (""you're really attractive "") and it's like, ""thanks, we should hang out sometime"" but then nothing comes of it. I'm just so sick of feeling bored and lonely.

Online friends are nice to an extent but most drift off and never message unless I yet again initiate it. I guess this is just my rant. I'm so done with people being shitty and ignoring obvious cries for help and company then just seeing that and doing nothing about it. Not even checking in to see of I'm OK or anything. Not a word. I miss my childhood and early teen years, where I had a nice neighborhood of friends. Screw today's people my age who don't give a damn about anyone else or always use the ""busy"" excuse, etc etc. How truly ""busy"" can someone be, ya know? I literally cut my grass, walk around town, do work stuff, etc. and can still respond super quick to people. Because I make them a priority. Tired of never getting that in return.",2022-11-01 00:26:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666965383,11,/r/lonely/comments/yitnf1/how_can_i_be_happy_when_i_feel_totally_lonely_247/,,0,7,How can I be happy when I feel totally lonely 24/7 and constantly go out of my way for others but *never* have that in return?
7,yito1m,NeedingaConnection,"Normally I can keep it more or less under control, but for some reason I feel like I'm just falling appart today. I'm 29, I  am trying to get my life together. I'm looking for a job, I'm applying and applying. I'm trying to get healthy, watch what I eat, ect. I  just, I'm tired. 

I don't really feel a way out of this hole. Even when I spend time with people , with friends, I feel apart from them at the same time. I feel like we want different things in life and while I love spending time with them, there is still this inner loneliness that I can't quite shake. 

I feel like I don't fall into some of the common tropes you see on here. I'm Lonely but I have friends, I'm social, I try to be emotionally healthy. I'm not looking for someone else to ""fix"" me. While I would love a relationship I don't think it will ""fix"" my issues in and of itself. I'm able to talk to women without issues (though flirting is a whole different issue). 

I struggle to meet people as most of my hobbies are male dominated and I don't really have the time or energy to pick up new ones. I'm mostly ok with who I am as a person, I'm fun to be around.

Honestly, I want someone to cuddle and watch netflix with. I want physical contact and affection, I can't remember the last time I got a REAL hug from someone. It sucks, I feel like I'm going throughout my day with this weight on my back, the lonliness weighs me down and just makes everything in life harder.

Because of this I always leave places feeling like everyone has had enough of me, and I have been proven right a few times. Just today I just saw a group of friends that used to invite me to their gatherings had a Halloween party without even mentioning it to me.

12,yiuc1e,fake_friends_please,"Unbeknownst to me, I got hopeful that I might have a chance with my crush, which appears to always to be a prelude to despair. We do work together quite frequently, I do make her laugh a good bit, and we do seem like we could be friends. So ig this is the closest to correct the misplaced hope has been in ages. But she's going to a party tonight, and it just reminds me how far apart we are. I can't see a way I could do that, and she does it with ease and for fun. She's socially normal, and I'm damaged goods. Working with people again and not dying from the stress almost had me believin that I wasn't so different from them, and that I wasn't as socially kneecapped as I thought. But I am. There's no way she'd want to be with me, cuz being with me is boring at best, and a burden at worst. Even if I could get better at being social and normal with time, for the first month or two I'd be social dead weight she'd have to drag around on dates. Even if she had liked me and invited me to whatever tf she's doing tonight, I wouldn't have been able to say yes.

And the stupid thing is that now I'm worried she'll meet somebody there. As if that harms me in any way, as if subratcting from a 0% chance could somehow give me negative odds. I hate the way it turns my stomach when I think about it, cuz I know it doesn't affect me. It's not my business, so why can't my brain just fucking listen to me for once and shut the hell up about it?

How much longer do I have to live like this? Like seriously, to whatever god made me for this fucked up TV show or whatever the hell it made this shithole for, how much longer am I expected to do this? Is this my entire life, do I just spend every night dying to have someone next to me and never getting it? I cannot fucking take this, dude. It is going to kill me. I can see it now, I'm gonna be too fucking fed up with it all one night, get drunk off my ass, and jump off a bridge. It's too much for someone to bear for a lifetime. Humans aren't meant to live like this. I can't wait forever, I can't keep surviving just so my family doesn't suffer. I need my own goddamned reason to live, ffs. It's not my fault that the only thing that looks to me like it's worth living for is love. And although it probably is my fault somehow that I'm unlovable, there's just about dickall I seem to be able to do about it.

Been putting myself out there and nothing. Few dates and they never lead anywhere. I dont think I'm ugly, I feel relatively attractive.  I'm not great at leading or initiating a conversation but I can help carry one well.

Do I deserve to be alone? Damn, really wish I wasn't a romantic then. 

I don't expect this to change or help anything. I just need a friend (guy or girl, not romantic) to talk to.

39,yiwkz2,HangryVampireBat,"I have dated both men and women, and experienced the culture associated both straight relationships and gay relationships. And my god, is straight culture so lonely. In lesbian dating culture, there is a degree of tenderness, compassion, and trust for each other, because we've all dealt with homophobia and we have to support each other. I'm not saying that the community is perfect, or that there's no toxic elements. But in straight dating culture, sometimes it feels like men and women are almost pitted against each other. I'm frequently aghast at the way other women treat and talk about men. Recently I was talking to a male friend of mine who shared some of his dating experiences, and I started to tear up hearing about all the times he had been dehumanized and treated with no compassion. We have been friends since high school, and he seemed to have alright self-esteem back then. But now, he feels so insecure and I feel so awful about the dating culture that did this to him. Reading posts on this sub, and others, I know a lot of men crave tenderness from women, and I can totally see why! But in the past when I've dated men (before realizing I'm a lesbian), so many guys have been weirdly mean to me for no reason. I met a lot of great guys too, both when making friends, and when I was trying to date them, but it's just weird that it's such a common thing. Like manners just completely evaporate if the potential of a romantic relationship is thrown into the mix? It's sort of surreal to be thrown into this world where the social rules are completely different and infinitely worse for no apparent reason. 🤷 at the end of the day, I think people of any gender just want to be treated like humans, and make genuine human connections with each other. It sucks that the current dating culture doesn't really encourage this, and crushes people the way it does. Stay strong everyone, just because you can't find love doesn't mean you're not worthy of it.",2022-11-01 02:42:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1562439487,54,/r/lonely/comments/yiwkz2/im_so_sad_about_the_social_divide_between_genders/,,1,21,I'm so sad about the social divide between genders.

43,yiwtsm,BatCupcakes,"My first day at my new job didn't go well at all. Long story short, I think I'm going to be as lonely with this job as I was in my last job. The worst thing is I literally don't have anyone to talk to. I have two or three friends I occasionally text, but it's just a few messages exchanged and they just stop responding, until we do the same thing again a couple weeks later. I don't have a single person in my life that I can start an actual meaningful conversation with. I don't have any emotional support at all so when something bad happens I just have to sit with that shit by myself.   


The worst part is I've actually been fucking trying for the last couple of years. In the past when I felt like my life was going to shit I knew I could have tried harder, but not this time. I did the therapy, took the stupid meds, ""put myself out there"", tried to reach out to coworkers, but it doesn't matter because the longer I'm alone the worse my confidence in social situations gets. I actually feel more like an outcast than I did in middle school and middle school sucked hard.

52,yiy7xo,theanonymouswriterr,"My mind keeps going back to November/December as time creeps closer to when these events happened. It was the first time I had a crush and it was truly reciprocated. He was the perfect gentleman. He drove me places. He bought me dinner. His hugs were tight and warm and I didn’t want to let go before he did. 

I supported him. He mostly supported me. *Mostly* is the pitfall of it all because we are very different people. I expand far and there are places he can’t reach. I know it’s possible to grow together, to learn from each other, et cetera. But in this case, I think we were both too set in our ways to see commonality. 

I remember the day he told me he liked me. We had just gotten back from a botanic garden that twinkled with a million lights. It had recently rained and the shoes I chose to wore had little to no traction. His hand would fall to the small of my back, make sure I wouldn’t fall and bust my behind. It made my stomach turn, the way he would touch me. That kind of feeling you get when you know something is too good to be true. His laugh wrung in my ears like Christmas bells, that smile a thousand miles wide. 

He told me in the driveway. The pavement was wet under our feet. His hands jerked at his sides, eye contact everywhere but me. He was nervous. I knew what was coming. I already knew my answer, as much as I felt my heart aching at the decision. I knew it was the right one when I let him know two days later. 

I think he still thinks I used him. I didn’t. I liked him, too. I liked him a lot. But there are reasons, and someone else I finished getting over swept in. He’s another regret I have. But #2 isn’t who I’m thinking about as we get closer to the holiday season. 

I think of Christmas light bright smiles and listening to “Last Christmas” while needlessly driving him around. I think of how we almost got lost while hiking. I think of him. I think of him a lot. 

I miss that feeling. What we had was too fleeting for him to love me. But I miss knowing that there was something there. I hate dating apps. I hate the “How are yous?” and “What’s your favorite colors?” 

I want to be touched, hugged, loved by someone I’m already secure in. I just want to be loved.",2022-11-01 04:02:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626468075,3,/r/lonely/comments/yiy7xo/i_just_want_to_be_loved/,,0,1,I just want to be loved

64,yizuwk,[deleted],"I'm just posting this here since it's not something I feel comfortable venting to friends about.

I've never been in a relationship despite trying hard to put myself out there for a while now. I feel like I've just been hit with a terribly unlucky streak of women that I've been attracted to and it's made me feel really set back and hopeless. Every time I've gotten to be close friends with someone and want to take the relationship further it just doesn't work out. For example one of them denies that mental illness exists, another just doesn't have a sexual orientation that lines up with me, another is hung up on an ex and another just doesn't reciprocate in that way. I've had deep feelings for about 7 different people and it really hurts when it doesn't work out. I see my friends coming in and out of relationships while approaching a really small number of people and it's tough for me to see.

I consider myself relatively attractive; I put effort into my appearance, I'm not overweight and I go to the gym fairly often. I put myself into social situations often but I just can't meet people I reciprocate feelings for or them for me.

It's got me feeling pretty down. I've got a nice group of friends and I recognize that a relationship shouldn't be a sign of my self worth but it still hurts and it's a different kind of loneliness.",2022-11-01 05:31:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/yizuwk/feeling_lonely_while_trying_hard_to_fix_it/,,0,3,Feeling Lonely While Trying Hard To Fix It

77,yj1bsg,Heisenwalker,"My girlfriend of 8 months has just left me. And although we were together for a relatively short time, it hurts. After 5 years of knowing each other,  we've finally decided to give it a shot.

The thing that hurts the most, it was so abrupt. We've had a normal,  happy weekend. Nothing seemed to be off or weird about her. And then she dropped it after dinner. 

The thing is, she didn't give me a reason. Nothing concreet. She is just tired. Got the feeling she is bad for me. She has this coping mechanism of closing herself off. And it got to a point where it hurt me way too much. 
And I keep blaming myself. Keep trying to find the piece I've missed. And it hurts. I've failed her. Sleeping is hard. Concentrating even harder.

Maybe I've rushed things. Did way too much to help her. But I wanted her too feel loved. Not treated like shit as all her other exes did in the past. I wanted her to feel special. I know that I might've accidentally pushed me on to her with the helping part. So that might be on me. But that's what a good partner does. And I never got the feeling she didn't want too. Yes, she admitted that I gave her too much gifts,  and I worked on it. I guess it was just too late. 

I hate the fact that I'm getting angry towards her. But these things,  her reasons for this breakup are going on longer then she'd would've like to admit. Why didn't she just talk to me? We could've fixed it.

But now it's too late. I've lost her again, and I'm starting to hate someone I once held so dearly.",2022-11-01 06:51:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1470669154,5,/r/lonely/comments/yj1bsg/shes_just_gone/,,0,2,She's just gone.

79,yj1dyi,VeterinarianNo4461,"Today was especially taxing. Not only do I have a lot of work to do, I am having a pretty shitty day on top of that. Well, more like shitty couple weeks. It technically extends all the way back to middle school, but I digress. Point is, that no matter where I go, everything feels the exact same; crappy. During homecoming, I managed to will up some courage and asked my crush to dance. Now, I know that I am by no means on her level. I have explained in a previous post that I don't have any natural talents, nor do I have any good characteristics. However, I really want to spend more time with this girl, and maybe even go out with her. I have pretty much zero luck socially, but I thought I had a fair chance. Thing is, she actually said yes. I never thought it would happen, but I asked and she said she wanted to dance with me. Those 15 to 20 minutes were the peak of my high school career. I have never felt better. Seeing her face stare back up at mine made my heart flutter. She looked gorgeous that day too. Her make up was great, and her dress was beautiful. I know it sounds so horribly cringy, but that shit put me on a cloud. I decided in that moment that I would ask her out, either to prom or separately. That will never happen. I thought that every time I get into class and see her, we would exchange smiles, maybe even a few words, something. But instead, we don't talk at all. Not only that, but she talks much more with another guy. They laugh together, are always smiling, talk a lot, mess around, the whole shebang (only in class hopefully). This guy is my complete opposite. He is this fair skinned, tall, muscular and lean guy, with soft long brown hair, clear skin, funny, intellectual, and very social. He has a great relationship with anyone I have ever seen him even talk to, even if they barely know each other. Not only that, but he talks to me of all people. I can't even be mad, because he is genuinely nice, and a good person all around. Great grades, great social life, seems like he has everything. Then there is me. I have a friend group sure, but none of them really like me being around. I am a stand in for others when they aren't there, and even then I am pretty much completely left out. I try to be funny, but most people don't even laugh genuinely at my jokes. My grades have gone to the shitter, and I can't seem to bring myself to hold conversations (that is more of a long term issue, it's been around for a while). This fucking sucks. One day, I looked over and saw them talking and laughing together, and it hit me like a truck. That dance we had made no difference, it meant nothing to no one except myself. this further cements that, I simply cannot succeed in anything. No natural talents, no social ability, no intellectual ability, and no chance of escaping loneliness. I am going to try NNN since it is legit in 15ish minutes, but I have low hopes. Everything fucking sucks right now, and I have no one but myself to blame. I haven't slept longer than a 3 hours a night in a while. My body, as useless as it is, has been degraded to pretty much just a sack of meat with no actual strength. I tried playing soccer the other day, but as usual, I either got no help, or just barely participated at all. Ended up picking at turf and staring at everyone else play. I give up. I clearly do not have the mere ability to be a human being. Makes sense now why everyone ignores me, even adults see that I am basically useless. Whatever, I guess this is my life. Waiting for it to end, maybe I will get peace. I won't do it to myself out of respect to my parents, but I still don't see why they love me. It makes no sense to love someone so unlovable. Numerous occasions have shown that they too get tired of me. So far, my parents are the only ones to really stick around, so I guess I am grateful for that. Maybe once I leave, I can finally get peace, either with new people (doubt), or without myself. Removing the area of issue.

I’m not sure what I even want from this but I feel so alone. i basically have nobody in my life. i have a “best friend” who I feel absolutely detached from. we talk but it feels like they force it and make me feel like I should stop talking. i feel as tho they would rather be at their friends place and when we are together they’re CONSTANTLY on their phone like high key addicted. but when I text I get dry messages or none at all. it hurts more because I know they’re on their phone so I know they’re ignoring me. 
i have no other friends so it does hurt a lot. 
i feel so alone when I am alone in the house especially because when we aren’t together we don’t talk (I try but ends up making me feel upset because it’s not the same anymore.)

2. Get out of your comfort zone. Leave that room,drop that PC or phone game. Make it work with the potential friend who shows interest in your life. Take up hobbies, explore his/her hobbies. Try new music, new art, explore new genres- reading. Try new food.

3. Stop talking about shit your life is, how everyone treats you like shit and how you hate yourself. Nobody wants to hear that all the time

4. You are going through a bad phase? Got busy? Dont go missing for days or weeks. Dont make assumptions how they dont care and ghost them. Communicate

All of this heart breakage and playing around has worn me down and made me stressed. On top of this I suffer from anxiety, OCD and insomnia and have ran out of sleeping pills. Because I haven’t been on these pills I only sleep a few hours a night, and my sleep schedule is so bad I just sleep at like 8am. I haven’t been able to make any friends from my course either because of all this distraction and the weight I’m carrying. I feel shit, and I really don’t enjoy most of my time.

96,yj4vua,1drake195,"In the last few weeks I've been thinking a lot, more than usual tbh, about what to do with my current situation.

I am a 27M, never had sex nor have given the first kiss yet. When speaking with my friends of finding a relationship they've always told me to wait, someday you'll find one etc. but in 27 years it hasn't happened yet. 

After the school years I've started improving myself by going to the gym, having new hobbies etc. and altough it helped me with my self esteem nothing has changed with my relationship problem...

I went to a pshychologist for some time, helped me for a litle with self esteem and in building stronger relationships with my friends. I've never asked him directly what is wrong with me but after some research I've identified some abandonment issues caused by moving from a city to another when I was young, the costant presence of God's judgment in my family and ""friends"" leaving for no reason when I was 17. The combination of all of this caused me to develop an avoidant attachment style so I won't open up with anybody, I've been working on this with my friends so it's getting better.

I'm doubting the existence of single girls in my area, whenever I ask my friends to introduce me to some of their girl friends they say they don't have any or that they're all already engaged. 

The few times I've managed to know some girls and even confessed my feelings I've got the same responses: I'm not ready for a relationship, let's just be friends, etc.

I know I'm not beautiful, I'm a 27 short bald guy with poor eyesight but I was hoping there existed people who didn't care about looks, this hope is vanishing with the passing of years.

I've worked on my looks (gym, personal hygene, clothes, ...),

I've worked on my hobbies (sport, reenacting, diy),

I've worked on my status (work, house, car)

I've worked on my actual relationship (opening up with friends I care);

I really don't know what to do and just the thought of doing nothing about it is hurting me, the thing I get from analyzing everything is that I'm destined to be alone, unlovable.

For people asking I'm not even contemplating suicide, I've thought about when I was younger but now I know there are people who really care for me.

Do you have any suggestion or question on how I can overcome this?

102,yj7d73,aloogumball,"When I first joined uni, I had a ton of friends, I was part of a massive friend group, but each year I'd find out stuff about people from the friend group which would make me want to distance myself from them and then eventually I've completely cut them off from my life. I've been doing this every year and now I'm in my 4th year with absolutely zero friends at uni. I like to think that I've done good by cutting people off who I deemed toxic, but I am constantly reminded that, they have still so many friends always going out and having fun, through their social media posts. This makes me sad as I then compare myself to them: I cut so many people off due to my own morals and now I am lonely. They however have so many friends and are constantly making new friends every year. 

I know I shouldn't compare myself to them, but it is hard not to and yes I can always turn my social media accounts off, which I have done before. It still won't make me feel any less lonely.

I want to be able to go out and make new friends, but because of my social anxiety, I stop myself each time. And being introverted also certainly doesn't help. 

To make myself happy or not so sad rather, I keep telling myself that having no friends is good so I can just focus on my studies instead. As in previous years I struggled in my exams because of, again, bad company, as none of my friends would study and I'd fall into the same peer pressure and also not study. But I really don't want to be fine with this thinking. I use it as a way to cope with being lonely, but I don't think being lonely is healthy at all and that's why I want to change, but my social anxiety prevents me. 

Also, another thing that prevents me is the fact how everyone already has their own established friend groups. It doesn't feel right to me to just join another group, and even if I were to do that, I wouldn't even know how to do it, as I also am quite socially awkward.",2022-11-01 12:25:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666163551,15,/r/lonely/comments/yj7d73/how_do_i_make_friends_when_i_have_social_anxiety/,,0,4,How do I make friends when I have social anxiety?

- a loser to make fun of, usually ugly, a nerd, a stereotype full of clichés 

- gay (because according to movie logic there is no other explanation as to why men don't have GF or casual straight sex)

There is a lot of effort to fight unrealistic representations of women in media and promote different representations (e. g. curvy female characters), but I don't see anything for male representation in media.

114,yj99n7,InspectionPowerful41,"The title speaks for itself.

My bestfriend, who I have devoted myself to for more than a decade, and I are not talking anymore. It felt like a one sided friendship, with me being the one who always puts the effort while she can't even do the bare minimum for me. I just... had enough. Which is insane for me considering how loving and loyal I am. I was just tired and done being undervalued. But you know? Losing a bestfriend felt like losing 70% of you. I might've been the one who broke things off but I was more hurt by it. Especially seeing her living her life like nothing happened.

The guy who I have liked for over a year now, that I constantly flirted with, got himself a girlfriend after knowing her for a month. The whole year he told me he didn't want a relationship. Turns out he just didn't want me. It sucks because of all the what ifs, and also I just cant help but think that why wasnt I enough when I was literally right here the whole time.

My ex boyfriend is currently happy with someone else. We basically fought our monsters together while we were still dating. Just feels devastating to know he didn't choose me over in the end too.


These are the people that I devoted my time and effort the most, and knowing that they are going about their lives just fine without me feels suffocating and almost wanting me to disappear from the face of the earth. I cry almost everyday, asking myself why I was never enough for them. And then also wishing they feel the pain I'm feeling. I can't be the only one suffering. I hate that I am.

I wish to avoid that in the future and also make another great relationship with someone if I am able. My main hurdle is starting out, because in my opinion it’s the worst phase and easily the hardest. I can’t count the amount of times I thought things were going decent just to not get a reply the next day, sometimes not even lasting that long. These occurrences have impacted my confidence in regards to meeting new people as the world is so incredibly expansive and diverse, that what are the chances that I find someone who connects with me and finds enjoyment in at least some of the things that I do. I know that there will always be risk when it comes to putting myself out there, but when it’s so easy for people to just disregard someone else on the internet, I admit it’s incredibly daunting and I find it hard to even strike up conversation.

137,yjevjm,Gondal90,"I am in a very bad situation right now. Very bad. I need someone to help me. The problem is that I have been unable to maintain friendships or even get a single girlfriend in my life and I am now 27 years old. Not only this, but I seem to get treated badly quite a lot. So often, that I feel like I get treated badly to an abnormal degree. I have been a target of mistreatment for pretty much my whole life. Something happened to me recently that was the final straw for me and now I am very very serious about figuring this out.

There are three important things to know.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my life I was able to *make* friends but unable to *keep* them. They usually fall apart. Either the person ends up blocking me or they just gradually lose interest in me. In all these friendships it always *seems* like I am the one who cares more, the one who makes more effort, and the one who values the friendship more. It seems like the other person does not care as much as me and to them I am easily expendable.

I was never able to get a single girlfriend. I think the average person in the US starts dating at like age 17 and I am 27. Now, I have seen other people make friends and relationships in a matter of months. Something which I could not do for years, and they were able to do it in a matter of mere months. It feels very humiliating, and my self-esteem takes a nosedive every time.

I seem to get treated badly quite often. This has happened ever since I was a child. I have been a target of relentless bullying and even now it seems like people just have no respect for me. It's like they think I am completely unworthy of basic respect.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I keep thinking about this over and over and over and over again in my head for hours and hours and hours. Why is it like this? Is it something I do wrong? Is there something wrong with me? Is it me that causes all this? Or am I just unlucky? A lot of times I feel like it is something about me that causes all these disasters to happen.

Maybe I do something wrong that makes people react this way. I am very serious about figuring this out now. I will use every fiber of my being and all the energy I have every day if I have to just to figure this out. I am fed up with this. I just want to be a normal person. I am so tired of being a loser.

I look for you in the crowds

I yearn for you in other people  
I hope you’ll be there when I turn

I look for you in the crowds  
Hoping you are also looking for me

Like it has never truly beat before

I wish I could see you again

150,yjhwh0,Short-Possible2316,"Hey everyone, I’ve posted on here once before about my experience of getting ghosted and wanted to follow it up because I’m struggling a lot.

(original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/y8bzx5/i_fall_for_people_way_too_easily/)

It’s been nearly 2 weeks since that original post and I’m no closer to moving on. I feel so alone because I was really kind to this girl and tried to help her through a depressive episode but she cut me out with no explanation. I tried to reach out to her twice before to ask for an explanation and then again to check if she was okay and ask if we could start over but she left it on opened. 

Since then, I haven’t tried to contact her. I’m angry that she discarded me so easily but I’m more hurt that she wouldn’t tell me why. And I was really starting to fall for her. I think about her every day and she hasn’t blocked me on insta so I can still see her posts etc. But I still don’t understand why she hasn’t blocked me and why she still read those messages if she just wants nothing to do with me. Either she likes the attention or she’s using me as a backup option for later. Tbh I don’t even know why I care so much after everything, but I do.

Anyway, I’ve thought about messaging her to ask if we can talk because I’ve been struggling with some other personal stuff too (a few days after she ghosted me a close family member had a heart attack and has been in hospital ever since). I’ve been feeling really vulnerable and she was the first person in a long time that I had caught feelings for. I don’t know if I should, or what to expect in the way of a reply (if any) but I’m hurting a lot and I miss her. But I don’t want to sound desperate either.

My question is - what do I say to her (if anything at all)? Should I try to ask for a second chance? And f she hasn’t blocked me, should I expect any contact from her in the future? Any advice or responses would be appreciated.",2022-11-01 19:05:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637423808,8,/r/lonely/comments/yjhwh0/got_ghosted_follow_up/,,0,12,Got ghosted (follow up)

I felt invited by let’s say the “rebellious rejects” of my year, at the time I was the only girl. I wanted to be accepted, I felt like I belonged a little better and they enjoyed my company. 2 months in it started to change, the body shaming, the names, the detailed stories of raping me. I was 14/15 and did not understand the severity. They would call me sensitive for being upset or say it was just a joke, now I understand as gaslighting. My school did not advocate for me from past bullying experiences, so I felt like I couldn’t reach out to anyone even my family. Another girl then came along, the same thing happened to her so we stuck together and by the end of school it was just us. We do not talk anymore… and I have been grieving her loss for 2 years. I have new friends but I don’t not have that same connection and struggle, I feel like that floating friend again. Those three years of bullying has ruined the way I make friendships and maintain them. Watching people from my school who could have saved me from those horrific years on social media leaves me heavily envious and depressed. I still feel like I am suffering and my bullies get to live the life I want to. Every friend I make I am anxiously attached to (if I get a good vibe), I’m mostly just excited or I constantly look for red flags from my past ruining any potential good friendships… idk what to do I isolate from the friends I have but have no means to form a friendship with them. I am not ready for big social gatherings like clubbing with the few friends I have made in college, they have other friends and I don’t since cutting everyone off who abused me. So it gives me an excuse to turn down the offers they make because I am anxious to meet their friends and feel out of place like I use to. Not to mention I went to one gathering and I got called “boring and not fun” because I did not want to drink… idk why it hurt me the way it did but now I’m even more anxious of what people think of me in those situations.

I'm very emotional and sensitive but usually I have loads of trouble expressing it. Like for instance I have trouble telling my parents or my friends how much I love them.
So when I fell in love with my now ex, I broke through that barrier and poured every bit of my soul into it. I had found someone to love unconditionally at last and I expressed it in every way I could. And when it ended, I think a part of myself just fucking died on the spot.
I don't even miss her anymore; I miss being with someone who I can just love man...it's been so long and after being hit with rejection after rejection, the thought of being unloved for the rest of my life is killing me.
Nobody sees me as anything other than the guy who cracks jokes man. Everyone just looks at my height and face and just rejects me. 'Oh you're a nice guy but....blah blah blah'...just say it to my face that I'm fucking ugly...

5 minutes later, I check and she blocked me both on snapchat and on here.

215,yjsusa,StrangeGrapefruit615,"Yesterday was my birthday. I (now 22F) woke up alone, as my boyfriend (23M) was still at work. He came home and didn't lay with me for the hour that we had before I had to get ready for work I went to work and no one really talked to me. My dad didn't bother to call me and say happy birthday. Every year I feel more and more lonely. I don't know why I have such a hard time making friends. People are friendly with me, but no one ever gets close enough for me to consider them a good friend. Sad to think that when my boyfriend and I get married, I won't have any bridesmaids. 

Today when the Taylor Swift tour was announced, I was so excited and couldn't wait to order tickets, and then realized I will have no one to go with. My boyfriend refuses to go with me, saying he wouldn't have a good time because he doesn't like her music, and that would be a huge waste of time. I have no one else that I can go with. I either go alone, or I don't go at all.

I am so incredibly lonely in life. I fear that I'm only with my boyfriend because if I'm not, then I will truly be all alone. Does it ever get better?

It’s like in Highschool there were people all over the place that were my age, so I always had friends. Now, there’s no one, and it hurts. It really hurts to not be a part of a friend group or have anyone to hang out with on the weekend.

I mean is that what happens? You grow up and stop having friends?

225,yjtxev,Beyond_Creativity,"Hi everyone,

I've recently become a denizen of the sub-reddit. 

Recently, I've realized that I am alone. I am naturally an introvert, and do prefer being alone on many occasions; however, for those moments where I want company I have no one. People I met in college have moved on with their lives, co-workers struggle with their own drama and see me as a outlet to vent.

It has become a common pattern for people to simply ignore me when I want to talk. ""Friends"" will only talk about mundane stuff and have no interest in anything beyond what they have going on. 

I should state that, I do understand that some of this I can fix. I think. But when I work on myself and see so many people simply existing, I think to myself, ""Is there someone who will embark on this journey?"" 

I've given up on romance. I am terrible at it and have hurt people due to my own ignorance.

For now, I am alone and working on myself, and that will have to do.

If you've read through this, thank you. If you didn't but are reading this line: still, thank you. I hope you all have a wonderful day/night.",2022-11-02 03:13:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1559007641,2,/r/lonely/comments/yjtxev/working_on_myself_lonely_while_doing_so/,,0,3,"Working on myself, lonely while doing so..."
226,yju22o,aman2234,"It was a totally normal night, we were over at my parents for enchiladas. I notice on the way back that she's a little emotionally distant, and I ask why, and then we sit down on the couch to have this talk. She wants to end things and move back to her hometown. She's talking about getting this work visa to go to New Zealand after she stays there for a little while. 

I was stunned. We had been in couple's counseling a few months back and both agreed to end our sessions because we felt like they were really productive. It basically boils down to that she feels like our 'long term goals' don't align enough. I always countered that those were far away, that we're both working less-than-ideal jobs because they pay the bills and let us save money, but apparently that wasn't enough. I even told her — honestly — that I'd find a way to follow her back to her hometown, find some job there and make it work, but she told me that it wouldn't work out. I was practically pleading, but nothing worked. 

There's obviously more I could go on about but it's the loneliness I came here to talk about. Everyday now I wake up and come home to a totally empty apartment that I can now barely afford. I used to say ""anon, I'm home!"" and she'd say ""welcome home!"" and it'd make my day so much better, even if it was absolute dogshit at work. We used to be able to make conversation out of thin air. Now all I can do is pace around until my drugs can (hopefully) make me fall asleep. My feet are covered in blisters. The obvious ""solution"" peddled by most people, ringing in the back of my head, is to just go out there and find new people, but I find that almost impossible. I have pretty severe social anxiety, for one, and I'm also not very confident in my body. I've been going to the gym, but still. I was lucky enough to meet my now-ex in college and fear that I won't have any organic avenue outside of bars or Tinder, neither of which really work for me historically. With the few friends I do have, I feel like I'm talking to them from behind some sort of gauze mask. They've also all got partners of their own and are often busy doing things with them while I'm left to twiddle my thumbs until the next meal, or sleep, or shift at work. Video games and TV and movies used to be fun, but no more. 

I basically have no idea what to do with myself now. I'm just — existing, I guess.",2022-11-02 03:19:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1348190164,9,/r/lonely/comments/yju22o/broke_up_with_girlfriend_of_5_years_26m/,,0,2,Broke up with girlfriend of 5+ years (26m)

Hi! I'm 20M, haven't had a friend since just after HS. We had a falling out, she told me my personality was boring and I cut her off. She tried to contact me several times over the years to apologize but I never budged. Why do I do this? It doesn't help that my anxiety and lifestyle make me incompatible with making new friends but for the ones I did manage to have I've ruined the relationship due to impulsiveness. I made an MC server (paid premade) and since I'm alone I have spent the most time on it. Anyways the people I did invite to the server flaked on me. Played me to boredom all weekend and now I'm just sitting here thinking about how I have managed to disconnect myself from the connections I really valued. I'm no longer a person someone would text or invite out, not even a thought in their head. My only Snapchat friends are older past co-workers who I don't even really know or want to. I really dug myself into this ditch and there's no way out. I don't want new friends I just want the ones I had :( And if I were to reach out, how weird would that be? I'm sorry I have depression and anxiety, I'm an idiot take me back? It's already gone and I'm just a breathing corpse thinking about the uneventful life I've led so far. It would be so selfish of me to try just because I feel lonely. I feel like I deserve to be alone after all of that. I keep telling myself that I need time alone to ""figure myself out"" but I know who I am, I'm aware of the choices I made and the consequences that came of them. There's nothing else for me to do except punish myself. I have a therapist but I'm realizing now that it's her job. Also, she's really old and here to give me tips on how to better manage my life. I understand everything but I'm just dead and I feel hopeless. Or maybe I don't and want to swim in my own misery but here I am, this post is just another non-solution for temporary relief. Sometimes I feel like I have all of this in my head and none of it can get out. Idk I just feel selfish for all of this. I'm honestly not even sure if I have social anxiety. I've had a few panic attacks recently but I'm just not so sure. I can interact with people normally at work but struggle with limiting myself and thinking about what other people might perceive and ruin a possible friendship, then I think it's stupid to even have that thought that there would be a possibility for one anyway. Like who wants to be friends with someone like me? I feel like I have the potential for more but I don't know anymore. Tomorrow is just inconceivable.

My only other friend was my ex, he was wonderful nothing at all wrong with him, an absolute gem of the earth. I ended it and now I cant live with it.

I mean he cheated too but I found out she knew he was cheating on me with her. When I made him and her break it off he told me he was happy to bc she was obsessed and crazy. I have screenshots of her lying about being pregnant with his child to stay with him LOL. Anyways life has been ok for me it’s just I’m consistently horny and thinking about him all the time ever since I heard his voice on someone else ig story. Idk I want to be strong and not message him. I feel like we are both horny ppl and if given the chance he would let me suck him off one last time or fuck him. I’m scared he may also reject me. I think the only reason he’s with this girl is because she gives him pussy. I honestly don’t care though I miss the sex with him. I feel like if we fuck again I would give him the slowest wettest blowjob he would fall in love with me again and leave that troll. 😒,2022-11-02 08:15:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664862522,2,/r/lonely/comments/yjzb0b/i_miss_my_ex/,,0,0,I miss my ex

&amp;#x200B;

During these couple of months, I've learned a lot about myself, but also about society, and what is required of you to function as a healthy citizen of society.   
The reason I feel like writing this is that in under a month, I've started to care even less than I did before. I guess a poetic way I could rephrase it is   
***""I've started to care so little, that I care too much""*** everything has just gone a full circle. A rotation of emotions to put it in prettier words.   


So why am I writing **this**, and why am I doing it **now**? And why here?   


I don't know the answer to any of those questions, but what I do know is the answer to the question ""Why am I doing it now?"" and that is because, If I don't do it now I won't ever do it again. I've reached the point in my life where I start to question whether or not the accomplishments in my life matter, or if I have even done any accomplishments. I guess you could say I am basing my current life around the word '**Fomo**' short for 'Fear Of Missing Out' and I have been feeling that way for the past 2 years now.  


**What happened 2 years ago that caused this wave of emotions to spill out?**   


Well, a certain person in the past made me realize what my life is, what I had, and what I didn't have. The things I could have, and the things that I never could have. This person made me realize what I had been missing out on, but also realize that I had wasted my entire youth on nothing. I had woken up from a 20-year-old coma, and just now I struggle to keep up with the sudden change in life. Suddenly, I am 22 years old, and suddenly need to get out of the home and start working, or I won't have any money to survive. Suddenly I'm an adult.   


I sit here and wonder, 'What have I been doing all these years, to just now realize what has been going on?' and I can never find a direct answer to that. The closest answer I could reach and grab is that I'd been in a trance. A trance of delusions. Refusing to believe there is a life outside my home, my computer. But again, I always had a fascination with what is on the outside of the closed walls in my room. Yet I've never taken that chance to pursue it.   


I sit here and wonder, ***'why don't I have the same ambition as the other people? Why don't I crave action, or the teen partying and screwing around?*****'**  


I sit here and wonder, ***'Why am I so abnormal, yet not at the same time? Haven't I just had the taste for that life, and because of that I don't care more?'***   


But I have had a small taste of it. Yet it doesn't appeal to me. But I want it to appeal to me. I want to feel normal, yet I don't.  


I read on social media about that crazy time someone had with a group of people, and how they wish to experience that again next year. And I try to imagine if that was me, having a group of friends. I see on social media, the pictures people post about their crazy adventures, where they find themselves in these weird situations and just need to take a snapshot of that moment, and I think 

  
***""Why have I never had the opportunity to experience that?""***   


Questions like these are always in my head, every day I think about them. **FOMO**. The Fear of missing out. It's a disease. A disease that has been plaguing me for the past 2 years.   


***When will it end? How will it end?*** I wish every day that my life could be a book, and I could just turn to the last page, just for a small sneak peek at how it ends.   
Or just randomly pull up a page near the end, to read the first two lines of text, to have a taste of what lies beyond. But that's unrealistic. That's not real, and will never be real.  
Time travel **doesn't exist**.  


People talk about the theory; If you had a time machine and could travel back in time to experience your childhood again, would you do it?  
My answer would be: **No.**   


I don't want to experience the things that my brain protected me from. I remember only a handful of things from my youth, imagine going back and experiencing all the bad things over again and realizing that the good events in your life, weren't as good as your memory tells you.  


I could already feel questions being thrown at me like; ***'But what about the good times?'*** or ***'Surely there must be something you want to experience again'***   
And my answer to those questions is: I can't remember any situations that I felt were a good time. Every good time I had, was a distraction from the bad things that kept happening.  
I could never go on vacation before starting to think about me having to go back home and just doing everything all over again.  


Even now I can't go on vacation without thinking that the vacation has to end at some point, and my life will return to the same thing that has been my life for the past 22 years.   


I can even feel more questions being shot at me like 'Why don't you go out and try and fix everything then? Maybe stop being stuck in your home and achieve something   
Trust me, I have asked that question myself too many times. But to answer that question; If I tried, I wouldn't know if it would work. And then I would have wasted more time trying to believe things would be better, and they never would.   


I keep thinking about the scene in Avengers: Endgame, where Black Widow looks for Hawkeye in Hong Kong, finds him and tells him to come home. Hawkeye responds with ""Don't give me hope""   
That's basically how I feel. Hope for me, is dangerous. The last time I had hope, was 2 years ago, and look where it lead me.  


I have a few friends that have helped me through these times without them knowing what an impact they give on me, And I am eternally grateful for them. But they have lives too, friends and family to come home to after school or whatever. Other friends, they can talk to, and relationships they can deal with.  
And then there's me, who has neither of those. And the only thing I have is the expectation that they will have conversations with me when they can. I can wait for hours, just for them to get on, in the hopes that they want to talk with me or play video games with me.  


**FOMO**, the Fear Of Missing Out.  


Something that holds me online every time. What if a friend comes online, and I missed a conversation with them? What if I missed out on being invited to a party? Missed out on being able to be normal?   


I sit here and wonder, What do I have to do to make people understand my situation, and not force my story on people?  


I've always been that kid that has been picked last during dodgeball sessions in school. Always be the last option  
to be in a group with during school tasks. And my opinion has always been the last people ask for because it would be rude not to ask me when everyone else had their chance to speak. Not because they want to hear it, but because of social standards.  


What will it take to become normal and accepted? But also overcome the shackles that only exist in my head?  


**FOMO**, the Fear Of ***Missing Out***.   


I keep thinking about things that I never could experience, and never will. Having a group of friends in your teenage years, and doing weird things. Adventures. Going to parties and getting drunk and having hilarious stories to tell when you get older, how stupid you were.   


Being a kid experiencing a relationship for the first time, and having a childhood best friend. Or just having a best friend.  


Those are the things that constantly haunt me, knowing that I will never experience them. No, I am an adult, with expectations from others. I can't go around being weird with friends, because that would be immature. Going to parties won't be the same, because everyone has already done that before. They know what will happen. And I won't have any stories about my childhood where I can tell the weirdest things that happened with me and a group of friends. Or just any events. Because those memories don't exist for me.   


I'm at the age where people expect me to have a job, and an apartment, and act like an adult. I missed the time when I could be free and be myself.  


**FOMO, the Fear Of Missing Out...**  


*This has been my whatever you want to call it, and it's very cringing but I wanted to write this because I was bored, but also I want to see what happens. I don't expect anybody to read this anyway so which is why I feel comfortable writing this too. I am not suicidal, nor would I consider myself depressed medically. I am just a lost soul thrown into a world without guidance. Abandoned by fundamental human emotions like kinship and belonging. I do not seek pity, I do not seek answers. I just want to tell my story so other people might relate. Or to find the words to describe a situation for someone who is as lost as I am. Because it's easier to describe how you feel than feel without any definitions.*",2022-11-02 08:53:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608411146,18,/r/lonely/comments/yjzwmu/fomo_the_unseen_shackles_of_depression_the/,,0,2,"FOMO, The unseen shackles of depression.

I think most people don't talk to me because they think I like being alone. It's almost funny in a twisted sense. Every time I try to pursue a relationship with someone it goes to shit, I don't know how to talk to people. I'm very awkward to be around and have no grasp on how to socialize. I can't handle being alone, I always breakdown and end up having feelings I don't like having to experience. People say it gets better so, why hasn't it. 

This post is all over the place, I'm kind of new to reddit, I apologize.

I mean, during lunch I go cry in a stall, thinking about how lonely I am, and how lonely I will be, because I'm too fucking scared to do something about it. I've kept a lot bottled in, always told everyone that I'm fine even though on the outside I look like every depressed lonely person you see in the movies (which I'm not, im pretty sure). Instead of doing something, I come to reddit. I'm a fucking idiot arn't i. This post is getting out of hand, i promise ill organize things better if there's ever a sequel to this shit show.

tldr: someone said hi to me and it reminded me how stupid i am (did i use the tldr right it feels wrong)",2022-11-02 12:19:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667390040,7,/r/lonely/comments/yk3qix/someone_said_hi_to_me_today/,,0,4,Someone said hi to me today

I'll tldr it cuz it's a very long story but I've been depressed and all my friends have drifted away. And the group I was so excited to make experiences with has left me in the dust. So now currently I've booked my tickets and a hotel for the con weekend. 

I've gotten so numb and jaded from recent events I kinda don't care anymore. I've given up hope on friends and relationships. I know that's shit but idk. Letting people in only to be hurt is absolutely not in the plans anymore

Donating plasma today. 2nd time altogether. Both times, I get the same nurse. Or technician, I guess. The first time, I was caught of guard. She was rubbing my arm trying to get a vein to show.

Not sexual, but my perverted brain can work with almost anything if needed. But no, nothing perverse. It was a good warm tingle.

Thought it was a one off. Go back today, same tech. This time, it's when she sanitizes where she's going to stick me. Once again, didn't notice it at first. Then I just felt it.

332,ykd8jy,Marvellover13,"When I think about it I've been through many hardships and managed to always come out stronger at the end no matter how hard it was in this period.
But when I think about it I don't have any close friends, I'm a friendly person and people at work will probably describe as kind or always ready to lend a hand, but if I'll go through something I'll just deal with it myself, I've been to a few therapist in my life none really helped me but myself and the harsh world itself.
So I think I'm missing a key feature that lets me connect to people on a deeper level.
I would think to myself that the deep topic I wanna talk about is way to heavy and will ruin whatever mood is there at that moment.
And I always thought that I didn't have much standards for women as s/o but with every new female worker/friend that enters my life I find something that's bothering me, I might sound like a really bad person but it's only when thinking of them as a s/o that I think to myself no way I can do it.
Whether they talk way too much, are not intelligent enough imo, or are just plain rude/unkind, not sure if my standards are too high or am I in the right, and with today society that males are demonized and women praised kinda hard to get an honest answer.

I might come off as a negative person but tbh rn in life I don't really have any complaints, I'm at a nice job for now, got my small car, am trying to keep in shape and hang out with friends sometimes, but I still feel like this last layer of friendship with people isn't there yet, you might call it intimacy, idk.

339,ykffcd,bncole05,"To put into words with how much loneliness hurts is near impossible, I'm 17 and don't know how I can continue living like this. I moved across the country last summer, in my previous state I had ""friends"" but sophomore year I started smoking pot and drinking and my parents pulled me out of school, and I had to cut contact with them, I started doing virtual school/homeschool. I bounced around jobs and made association with coworkers, but they were just coworkers and even at my current position, they are still, \_just coworkers\_ 

what hurts the most is that I didn't need to cut contact with my friends. They just flat out forgot I existed, I've seen texts and heard what they said about me since I left, and it isn't pretty.

growing up and even now still growing and changing, I quickly came to notice that I am the ""chameleon friend"" I have always been an option to others, I was there if you needed to text someone late at night, I was there. if your girlfriend broke up with you and you just wanted to get coffee and relax, I was there. I was there third wheeling as you develop relationships with others that have cooler and more interesting personalities than I do. 

 I love to see other people grow and change for the better and I realize that my scope of view into others' lives is pretty much limited to social media. But still. Lying in bed at night, no one to talk to except a cat that has the same sleep issues as you, hurts.

These are mostly thoughts that have been boiling in my head and its finally spilled over the pot, it's out there on the internet for all you beautiful strangers.

But one last word. Being truly alone, and finally realizing the range of just how socially inept and starved you are; is like touching a scalding hot pan. The burn hurts but not too bad, you find a way pretty quickly to deal with it, but once the ""man up"" thoughts subside, there's a lingering burn, Worse than the original and you hate the feeling, but it's there. No amount of ice or Neosporin will cure the burn.",2022-11-02 19:59:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593474499,8,/r/lonely/comments/ykffcd/it_hurts_in_everyway/,,0,1,"It hurts, in everyway"

I love drinking and bars are really fun for me. I often get quite a bit of male attention, but to go out alone, I'd feel so awkward. To go anywhere recreational alone I'd feel a bit awkward because I always see everyone with friends- no one else is ever alone. 

The advice I'm seeking is- how do I see things differently so I don't feel as awkward going out alone? Or what can I do to make friends in the same city as me? I've tried apps, subreddits. I don't know what else to do. My loneliness is getting unbearable.

410,ykolcd,tinyjedii09,"I want to close my heart up. Lock it up and throw away the key. 

Recently, I have lost two friends in a very complicated, emotional conflict. I have given a lot of myself to these friends, one in specific. We've spent an extended amount of time together and I have lent my ear and shoulder to him. Helped him with advice and decision-making and have been a friend to him throughout the conflict between the three of us. I don't think I wasted my time by being there for him but I wish I valued my time a bit more and spent some alone time thinking of myself through the conflict. I think I gave too much of myself to him for him to not take me seriously. He said he would like to continue being friends with me but I think he took and learned all he needed from me. I don't think he needs anything else from our friendship that he can't get from his own relationship with his girlfriend. It also really upsets me that he would say he wants to stay friends after all of this, it's quite selfish. After all of the ups and downs this conflict has put me through, I almost never want to repair our friendship again. I don't know how someone could just expect me to welcome them into my life with open arms. As well, his girlfriend has burned a bridge with me, rightfully so - I can't even blame her for that but I don't think I can stand to be his friend after the things she's told me and has said about him. I do hope they make things work out and truly come together stronger. If they can get over this kind of hump, they can do anything and I am truthfully rooting for them. 

I'm upset that I give my kindness and support and love to the people I think are my friends or lovers and they just take it from me. I don't think I deserve to give that to everyone I meet. I am really feeling like closing my heart and becoming a shell. I don't want to open up to anyone anymore. I don't think anyone deserves how wonderful I can make them feel. I end up getting used in the process. I don't know if I can handle that anymore. I don't even know if there's anyone left for me to love. I think I'm really burned out of these kinds of relationships. I don't really care if I sound selfish because I'm just really tired of being used. At the same time, I was so jaded when I was younger and I hated feeling like that but I don't know what else to do. I don't know who deserves me or what I deserve. Maybe I need to be treated this way and learn something else from it.

I have seen a therapist (actually 5-8 different people ) over my life and I have never been a fan when attempting to talk out my feelings with them. I have found myself to be a person who self reflects on their own surroundings, but for some reason I have not been able to find my own resolution to my issue of being happy.

Context I’m 18 and am finishing up my senior year. Grew up in a sheltered religion (Jehovah’s Witnesses) and was taken out of school after elementary. Only interacted with my JW friends and airways gave more then I received. I left that high control group 2 years ago and am trying so hard to find people who want me in their lives. It’s not been easy but this semester I’ve been doing more with people. Still though, I feel hurt because I do more then I receive (on a general scale). It’s not that any of these people are necessarily bad people or anything but I put so much care and time into talking to them and it seems like that’ll never happen unless I take the initiative. These people were asking me if I wanted to do this or that at the start but then it just faded. I still do stuff with them and text them sometimes but it’s generally only when I say something. I just don’t feel cared about or wanted by anyone, makes me feel like I’m dull and easy to forget about when I think I’m a very fun person.

461,yktvsl,IntrovertRudy29,"So before I start this post, I just wanna say that I am not interested in having a relationship any time soon in my life, due to the fact that I don't have the time or resources to maintain one at the moment. I also want to say sorry to all the men out there that could really use a friend right now. I haven't had a good experience with being friends with men and it did land me in having to go to therapy a lot one time. 

I really miss having IRL women friends since I feel more safe, happy, comfortable and having the ability to talk about anything with them that isn't NSFW. I miss the times when I had women friends in elementary school and high school where we could go to lunch together, listen to music together or have deep meaningful conversations together. I am currently in college right now and the loneliness only gets worse everyday whenever I see young women hanging out with people that are really close with them. It sucks going to college everyday without looking forward to talking to a woman that you feel really close with. I feel like I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I may never have any IRL women friends ever, and I'm trying to fill that void so much with online women friends, but it doesn't seem to work anymore now and only makes me feel worse about myself.

I also need to say about myself is that I am a 24M, have high-functioning autism, I am an extreme introvert, I suffer a lot with social anxiety and ways to help cope with my loneliness are exercising, playing with my black cat or listen to heavy rock or metal music.

470,ykvcou,Suffering-wallowing,"I, (25 ftm), have been feeling more and more alone. I have a partner but we’re long distance currently. I have “friends” but no one ever tries to talk to me. I always have to initiate and if I don’t initiate I am forgotten about. People don’t want to hang out with me and although people think I’m “so sweet and kind” I don’t have people I’m close to at all anymore. The person who was my “best friend” went cold on me when I tried talking to them about something that was making me uncomfortable. My “best friend” before that doesn’t talk to me ever unless it suits her needs because I’m “the best at comforting.” Most people view me as a parental-type figure and I’m tired of it but I was trained to be that way. I’m trying very hard not to over-lean on my partner and suffocate them because I know I so easily could. they’ve been trying to include me into their friend group but I just feel like I’m imposing on every situation I’m a part of. I try to hang out with people from work but I guess my nature just encourages people to dump trauma onto me every day and all day. No one knows me. No one knows anything about me. My partner saw something their roommate was getting rid of and knew I’d want it and it made me fucking sob for 20 minutes. I’m tired of feeling so lonely. I’m tired of people not knowing who I am but no one wants to hear me talk unless it’s about them. So I let people just vent to me for hours. Because at least that’s something.

But I think it's not unimportant anyway, it's painful.

I feel that... I am a disgusting alien that people do not take into account at all, that does not attract anyone, that has never been loved more than by his close family.

It's been a strange life, even among my own family I was seen as a weirdo who spoke very little. But honestly, it was not something that mattered to me at all, at least until recently.

And now, every day I feel that my sentimental and carnal needs devour me from the inside. Day after day with more intensity. I have come to think that maybe, just maybe, if I could at least satisfy the carnal, I would feel better, and what would I do to achieve it? Probably hire a escort. 

But I never did, and I never will, because it violates my moral values, and I don't mean to betray myself in that way.

If we talk about the emotional, I have tried to be a little more social, trying my best to achieve it. But every conversation gets weird, every interaction ends with people thinking I'm weird and them trying to avoid me. I know that it is something that does not change overnight, but I feel that little by little I am losing hope.

I don't know how to stop being who I am, because I know that I am the problem that has me so horribly alone. And I feel like I'm going crazy because of it, I can't understand how people's minds work, how to attract them, how to be interesting to them.

In my poor ability, I started using dating apps, as I need love, and it is my best option being as lonely as I am. One day, someone told me that if I wanted to improve my chances of getting someone else's attention, I had to put good descriptions (which I've tried to do), and that I had to put pictures of myself where I did interesting things, like my hobbies, pictures of places I have visited that are interesting or just images of hanging out with my friends at a party or something.

I only have one or two photos of my hobbies. I think it's pretty obvious because I don't have any of the rest. I just don't like going out and I have 2 friends.

How do I escape this cycle of madness? How do I stop being me to fit in with others? How can I get that love that I yearn for so much? Am I just not meant to be a good human being?

485,yky636,Repulsive-Oil-652,"Hi all, I’m a 28M pondering his existence.

I was recently driving back from a concert late at night. It was raining, about 1am and little to no other cars on the highway. Gave me time to think.

I’d been to that concert alone and then I realised that every concert I’ve been to in the last 7 or so years has been alone (except maybe 2 or 3 I’d taken my parents to as Christmas or birthday gifts).

Then I realised that almost everything I do is by myself.

I have a couple of ‘friends’. 5 guys I went to university with. We are in a whatsapp chat but it’s mostly me doing the talking. Whenever I suggest an activity or meeting up everyone is always busy. They are all either married or engaged so I understand they are usually busy on weekends with their partners. I’m single (the only single one left out of my ‘friends’).

I’ve realised these people aren’t my friends. They make no effort to talk to me without me initiating some sort of conversation. They always find an excuse not to do anything with me.

Last time we met up was about 2 years ago to celebrate one of the engagements. Another of them also had an engagement party last year but I wasn’t invited. They said they just asked their friends local to the city and they didn’t think people would want to travel.

I decided to try something, so I stopped messaging people. It’s now been just over 1 month since I had any contact with 4 of my ‘friends’. Out of the 5, 1 forwarded me an article about a band we both like going on tour, I responded asking if he wanted to go see them live and suggested we get tickets together. He never replied, this was 4 days ago.

Guess I just needed to post this somewhere to help me accept it’s how it is.",2022-11-03 10:10:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624218819,3,/r/lonely/comments/yky636/when_my_friends_arent/,,0,3,When my friends aren’t
486,yky8oo,bimbot-maddison,"I’m 24 now. I broke up with my ex two years ago then spent a year being sad and lonely and then somehow I’ve basically spent the past year trapped in this endless cycle of shitty attempts at finding a genuinely good guy who also happens to like me.

Fun fact about me, I’ve only really had two relationships. My first real (back in hs) bf cheated on me because I “wasn’t able to satisfy him” like this other girl could. Then I spent a long time trying my best to avoid feeling any kind of emotion for and bouncing from basically one rebound to another to another. Finally, after all that my second was extremely abusive and manipulative. Both abusive and manipulative in every sense of the word. It took me way too long to realize that he wasn’t worth it. 

Idk maybe by now I’m just too fucked in for real love. Lord knows I’ve got a whole family pack of issues at this point. The worst part is that I’ve still got this unshakable hope that one day I’ll find my soulmate (if those are even a thing) and every passing day that I don’t meet him just crushes my soul. 

Here’s the endless cycle I was talking about btw: 

Step 1: feel sad, lonely and pathetic 

Step 2: after a long time of this, get ✨inspired✨ and download tinder / hinge and use really revealing pics on my profile to get attention from guys while also having constant anxiety knowing that someone I know could see my profile and idk I’m just really socially anxious in general 

Step 3: regret it in the morning but I’m already loving the attention and I somehow feel a bit better about myself even though it’s all super superficial 

Step 4: start falling for the cute guy who shamelessly says everything I want to hear 

Step 5: meet up for lunch and even though I tell myself I won’t do anything physical on our first date, we end up spending the day together then he convinces me to go back to his place 

Step 6: pathetically agree to do basically anything he wants because I have zero self confidence and crippling anxiety of disappointing him so I end up spending the night at his place 

Step 7: he kicks me out in the morning and then proceeds to treat me exclusively like we’re fwbs and only texts / responds to me past midnight 

Step 8: after a few weeks of this, I finally muster up the courage to say to him that I want to be more then friends and then he says that he’s just not looking for that right now despite everything he said to me before we met the first time and then he proceeds to never contact me again (or sometimes he does but just in increasingly more gross and disrespectful ways until I block him)

Step 9: rinse and repeat from step 1

Well I think that’s all. There’s a lot more too it and everything else but I just realized how long this is getting so I’m going to stop here. I hope you have a fantastic night",2022-11-03 10:13:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664356259,30,/r/lonely/comments/yky8oo/idk_what_to_put_as_a_title_theres_a_lot_here_that/,,0,23,Idk what to put as a title.

488,ykys22,Mad_Season_1994,"Shows like Stranger Things and movies like Harry Potter are perfect examples of this. When I entered middle school, that's really where my aloneness and loneliness took root. I never went to any birthday parties, didn't go to any friends houses after school or on the weekend, and I only went to school dances because my parents urged me to, and that usually meant I danced by myself anyway or stood off to the side. That was, and is really, my life. 

As for love, yes I of course had/have love from my parents and my family. But I'm not talking about that. I mean falling in love with a girl. I've of course always had attraction to girls. But I don't know what holding their hand or kissing is like, because I never got to that point. I've never had some girl fall head over heels for me, or me for them. And that of course means I've never been intimate with one either. 

It's probably pretty easy for you to say ""Well, that's your fault. You didn't take initiative and missed out on everything"". And you'd be right, which is why I hate myself to no end and, on my worst days, just wish I didn't have to deal with it anymore. But taking my own life wouldn't be a good option because I wouldn't want my parents to see me like that. 

But I'm getting off track. I've never had either of the two aforementioned things at really any point in my life and live on an island basically.

granted, we aren’t very close but it did give me a overwhelmingly happy mood for about a week. that was probably the happiest i’ve been in a LONG time.

now that that feeling has passed, i don’t feel as sad, but i’m just disappointed. having a friend gave me temporary happiness, but i just feel like it’s pointless. like life is pointless. i don’t see myself ever doing anything successful or great and honestly i’d just rather die

504,yl32ip,aDrainedsoul,"I (28f) have 4 kids under 8 (6,5,2&amp;1). Two have SEN, one with a serious behaviour disorder which we didn't see signs of until everything shut down with the pandemic. Everything is on me. I work part time from home, only 20-30 hours a week. My husband (33m) works 8-10 hours a day, 12 a couple days a week to pull in some overtime. When he gets home, he won't really help with anything. He will occasionally change the younger ones for bed. But he says since he actually works, he shouldn't have to come home and do everything. He has done the dishes twice in the past 8 months (both times I was incredibly ill) and he let me take a few hours nap, and has taken out the rubbish a handful of times. 

I'm struggling with all the responsibilities I have. The cooking, cleaning, laundry, vacuuming/mopping. Keeping the kids calm and out of his way when hes fed up. Tidying the toys and garden. All the paperwork for assessments for the SEN children and registration for nursery, managing the bills and maintaining appliances. Doctors appointments, including booking his for him. School meetings and EHCP meetings. Picking up after him. No matter how many times I mention it he leaves his rubbish on the counter instead of binning it and his clothes on the floor right next to the hamper instead of in it. I am not in bed until half 11 at the earliest and I'm up by 6 at the latest every day. He gets every Sunday off and most Saturdays and gets lay ins every day off and can go to bed as early as he wants while I'm left with everything.

The side comments are getting too much too. I asked for a dishwasher so I don't have to keep doing them all by hand. He said he already has one and laughed. I've asked a few times, same response every time. He makes comments on how I need to get the weight off for my health (I gained a LOT with my youngest and developed hypothroidism). I already know I need to but I don't know where I'm supposed to find the time or energy. Most days I don't even eat until dinner and even then its after I get the kids to bed. If the housework falls behind he complains instead of helps. He was watching a comedy show last night and i decided to read on my phone. He asked why I wasn't watching the show. I said I wasn't really into it and wanted to finish my book anyways. He said its intelligent humour so he wouldn't expect me to get it. I do struggle to get humour sometimes but pulled excellent grades in college and uni and I am sick of him insulting my intelligence just because its different from his. 

I just feel like I'm drowning. I'm tired, I'm fed up, I'm overwhelmed. I need a break that I just can't get. It's all too much. I feel so lonely even having a husband. I reached out to social and they said ""just keep going, you're exhausted because you're doing it right.""

I feel like a shadow. I feel like a ghost. I happen to be off work today and all I can do is wander around the house and try to fathom what the hell happened to me.

fast forward to today and I have a partner that makes me feel like I deserve the happiness i was lacking. someone who is breaking down my walls, eroding my body dysmorphophobia, rebuilding my trust and hope in love and life. i had convinced myself that I deserved the misery I lived in day after day. i despised the way my body looked and thought everyone around me looked at me with disgust. 

I still don't have friends but this relationship gives me the confidence to be more outgoing and conversational with people i might want to get to know.

588,ylkv3o,[deleted],"Hi.

Someone suggested I try Reddit so I am brand new to posting on here. I have been separated from my wife for several years and have been living on my own which I had never done before. For the most part I handle things well, but the loneliness, not having that person to share your feelings with, and not being able to hug my best friend whenever I needed to has been very tough on my mental health. I didn't want to make a stupid dating profile just to meet someone to talk to and so here I am trying something different.

Catchy title, check. Greeting, check. Synopsis of why I'm posting on here, check.

So what's going on r/lonely community? Is this where I should be posting at? Is there a better subreddit? 

Uhm, here's a little more about me that's ok to share. I'm 37, a father to an amazing little girl, long red hair, gauges, glasses, and I'm short. I work in a high school cafeteria making breakfasteseseses, luncheseses, and desserteseses for the kidseses.

I really enjoy helping people, but I'm awful at doing things for myself (does that sound familiar to anyone here?). And I have emotions, a lot of emotions, why do I have so many emotions? And my brain is like nonstop thinking about everything all the time. It makes me feel happy and have lots of fun at times, but sadness and depression are always there as well. Whatever reminds me of what I've lost, it sucks. I know what I want to accomplish, I have goals, I want a better life for myself, but I seem to constantly fail on my own. I feel like I need someone in my life to help motivate me, someone to share our successes together. I've been told then that I suffer from codependency. That I shouldn't need someone else in my life, and that's fine, that's fair, I totally understand, I really wish it was that easy for me. Some people sail through life doing things on their own. I should be able to do that. Those people all believe I should be able to do that, I believe I should be able to do that. But the pull is so strong, ever since I was young, all I ever wanted was to be happy with a nice girl and share my life with her. But ""girls only want boyfriends with great skills"" as they say. How to be used when you're useless.

I've rambled on now. That's it reddit. I don't know what I'm doing. There's way more to my story of course as we all have our origins. At least I tried to reach out to someone in this world.",2022-11-04 01:16:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,,13,/r/lonely/comments/ylkv3o/how_to_be_used_when_youre_useless/,,0,6,"""How to be Used When You're Useless"""
589,yll1a4,squidney1030,My boyfriend has been gone for months now due to being in the military and won't get back home until mid December.

I never want to lay down on the couch anymore because I don't have someone to cuddle with and I can't fall asleep unless I surround myself in pillows and blankets to create the feeling of someone being there.

617,ylo0ov,Revolver-Knight,"All through out school even my senior year last year I was the weird kid I feel like.

I used to be a lot worse before highschool.

I was just so stupidly naive, and rose tinted glasses, such a stupid teachers pet.

Some of that has crawled over into my adult life I’m 19 it’s mostly just haveing rose tinted glasses.


I used to get picked on but never severely bullied.

But I knew a lot of things. People didn’t really want anything to do with me unless they needed help or wanted my quote “weird level of knowledge”


I had genuine friends at school but that was it at school. I only rarely talk to them.


I used to get picked on a lot and made fun of because of my nativity especially in middle school. Like people would make sexual jokes and I knew what sex was but jokes flew over my head I didn’t know the culture the lingo.

Shit still flys over my head all the time.

It’s weird I love sarcasm and cracking jokes but whenever people say it I always take it literally. I feel like a real dumbass


Also besides being the weird kid I prolly was a weird looking kid also.

Like I don’t think im totally ugly but im not a looker I have days where im able to look at my face in the mirror and think im handsome or at least not that bad.

Also I did have a girlfriend at one point so I can’t be that ugly.


If I had to do it all over again which is weird thing to say considering I’m only 19. But if I did I’d definitely try to change some things.

But the one thing I wouldn’t change is how I treat folks.

I might have been some weird, naive, gentle giant. But I’d help you I don’t mind helping folks if I can.

It’s why I love my job I love providing good customer service

Maybe I’m sucked into the corporate system but I like helping folks.

I especially like helping people who have helped me.

Which is  a bane cause I get attached really easily and stupid loyal to people that treat me well.  

I crush really hard on woman who are nice to me it’s sad especially when I encounter girls who are my type which ironically are weird girls if that even is a type.

I’m so starved for companionship and I can’t stop it.

I’m afraid to really put myself out there because I’m afraid of being to clingy for woman.

My ex broke up with me because she said she felt guilty for not putting enough effort in our relationship.

She kept saying I’d never been clingy.
But I feel like I’m a clingy guy. I also feel like I’m really fucking boring.

I’m not asexual but I don’t even want sex I just want love and companionship and to give it.

I think the saddest part of my brain is that I remember coming up with imaginary friends and even girlfriends as early  as 5th grade (which is way later than kids should have imaginary friends)


But one of my personal maxims is that even though I’m not having the best time right now on this earth and even if It doesn’t change. I’m not gonna be an asshole to people cause I feel like shit.

 
People are entitled to feel the way they feel but I can’t for the life of me understand why people feel justified on being shitty to others cause they feel like shit.

I spent a few days in bed crying and SHing and realized that it was dumb for me to think that i was ready for college. I couldn’t start a new life. That thang brought out all of my PTSD and past trauma issues and i withdrew and went back home.

Remembering how I posted here not too long ago about a horrible day I had where nothing worked out and I wanted to kill myself to take away the pain. Well, today I just had the polar opposite- a day where everything worked out!!!
Today I woke up earlier than useual, spent some time with my crush and lunch and ACTUALLY STOOD WITH HIM IN FIRST PERIOD. I know they're small steps but I'm shy and we haven't really gotten an opportunity to talk, *yet*. I love him. But anyway I taking baby steps. And maybe it's just my imagination but he kinda scooted closer when he noticed I was standing close to him!! :DDD  And I was touching his backpack. I also finally totally took off my mask in front of my peers later that day, I finally being free from insecurity. I've bren insecure another my face but why tho??? I look fine AS FUCK!! And even though there are some drawbacks I can see, whatever!! Everyone had them and if anyone's judging me, screw them! They're not worth an important role in my life anyway then. IT'S MY LIFE, I DECIDE IT.

I orated an amazing presentation in English, had people be friendly, talked to a bunch of new, amazing people and came up with some AMAZING ideas for a new project, most of which was my work!!!! Also, I'm smarter tha  I think. Yesterday, I got lots of questions on a biology test RIGHT even though I'd thought I'd bombed it and had little to no preparation ad I studied last minut. But I'm just slay like that!!!! 

Stayed after school which I loved, talked to a girl form my class who smiled at me whole going out, and everyone said bye to me!! I felt like a leader, all in the classroom, hallways, project and group!!!! People literally turn around and look at me in the hallways as they pass by, keep staring at me for as log as they can, that's how pretty I am, even if I don't see it. And this is an everyday thing!! I live me, I love me and I try to like me lol 🧿✨💪💗

Bought makeup, haircare and skincare and traveled home all on my own through a large route even though I was scared and skeptical at first but then I just got my *hypothetical* balls together and said ""Let's do this.""


and even came home after buying everything and my own, giving a feeling of independence. Got home and did an AMAZING hairstyle that took a lot of effort bland perserverence but I NEVER GAVE UP!!! I JUST KEPT DOING IT!!! And so I finally got an amazing hairstyle by me, which I only tried to do yesterday night for the first time once, and for the second time today night. I never even thought about it in the middle. And my parents even gave me time enough to do that, even if they didn't know wtf I was doing, it's pretty late. Gonna do some good stuff too now!! 

Reminder and message to myself: It always gets better and people are there for you. Be there for yourself. I love you so much and good days are so near, thy are so so close, just over the horizon, coming in abundance. Please dot give up, please keep doing it, because IT WILL BE WORTH EVERY INCH in the end. And also, ofc, #SLAY.

Byee and have a good night/day!!! I love you so much and I just wanted to share this to anyone, including those going through a rough time. Take this as a sign to keep going in the direction that's actually good and healthy for you and love yourself, because it is!!! Love you, muah&lt;3

[TLDR]: Just had an amazing, wonderful, fulfilling, very good day; Don't wanna jinx it :D🧿🤞",2022-11-04 05:55:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656961372,4,/r/lonely/comments/ylqaxp/everything_worked_out_today/,,0,2,Everything worked out today.

644,ylrub0,Doom_consumer_9000,"My friend in 8th grade suicided and sent me into terrible depression. I became screwed up in the head because of it. My parents have noticed my depression as obvious it would be from after the fact what happened. I was told they couldn't do anything about it for me. Eventually I made friends with a girl that I to this day find the most important and special human being to me. She didn't deserve for what I did and said to her. It's a lot of regret when I think about it. But after a year I started telling her about my Depression about every few months. I was really desperate for love and being liked by someone. Just no one does no matter how much I've changed. Some time goes by and she told me that she didn't know what to do to help me through my depression and that moment hit me hard... 

I was alone with myself with depression. No one to support me, no one to uplift me, no one there. Just me.. I cried harder that night than ever before.

 I forced myself to accept the fact that I was going to be like this for the rest of my life. What doesn't help is years ago,my entire family has called me retarded so that memory put more weight onto it,same with all the rejections from others over time. I was being buried alive in my head. With no one to help me, I cried every single night for a year with a strong will to survive and get through this.

 I eventually came to terms(this year) that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life with no choice. I tried to be nice to everybody, support all friends, be nice with people I found interest in and supported them and did things for them. Only nothing to come from it. I refuse to go to suicide or self harm or anything. As I was taught from my dad and others around me, to suck it up and deal with it, nobody cares about how i feel. Life was just going to treat me like shit no matter what. Any hope for not being alone is gone. Recently my mom has told me that being on my laptop all day everyday Is a sad way to live out of anger. I can agree but no one wants me for who I am...not even my own parents. 

Its been so lonely and I'm trying to meet up with that same girl I've mentioned. I haven't talked to her in a year or 2. She hasn't messaged me for a whole day so I feel like it won't happen. She agreed to do it but today just been silence. I'm trying to be more social but ig she only sees me for how I was before which is fair to think. I want to at least be able to show her that I've changed and have tried to be better after a school change. All I want at the very most cause shite I've done before was definitely not okay.

Should mention I do have a lot of friends and do make friends with about everyone I meet just nothing more ever. It still feels rather lonely cause I don't talk to em that much.

668,ylxct6,CEOofStrings,"So yesterday, I was on the way to a lecture at uni as normal, except as I was walking into the lecture theatre and saw the people inside I realised I went into the wrong building. I immediately walk out and these 2 girls who were behind me who I recognise as being on the same course as me, also proceed to start walking the other way, probably realising that I walked into the wrong room and that they had also done the same thing.

As I was about to walk out of the building, the girls in front of me were already pretty much outside, except one of them stays to hold the door open for me as I was walking out.

Now I know that it’s common courtesy to leave the door open for people behind you but what made this different is the door was already closing and I could easily have opened it myself, but despite that she stayed and waited for me to get to the door before leaving it, even though her friend was waiting for her.

After this happened she went straight to her friend and I didn’t even get a chance to say “thank you”, I did to smile  to show my appreciation but I’m not sure whether she saw or not. That small thing genuinely made my day and I wish that she knew how much I appreciated it.

I am the problem. You need to build a friendship. And i am exactly struggling with that. I never reach out to people in my life and deliberately avoid anyone personal conversations. I do that by never being my true self. I am not sure if there is. I am not sure if this text really reflects my inner self. I always adjust my personality. For example I lie a lot just to be part of a conversation. You know, when you actually haven't seen a movie but you pretend you did. That has lead to eveybody liking me but not caring about me. I myself feel like I have stopped caring a long time ago. I lost interest in a lot of things. So I kinda now what my problem is and that I need to change but that is really hard. You never know where to begin. Sometimes it feels like I want to be alone and miserable.

I dont even feel like a real human anymore, i feel like i have nothing in common with people, i feel like im just born this way because people always act like this even if there is no issue. Currently i only have 5 people who i consider close and i never recieve texts or calls from them, they never try to talk to me, i usually just go next to them and listen or maybe try to contribute to the conversation but they just say like 4 words about it and then stop talking. The only time people have actually talked to me was to mock me in a way they think i wouldnt know. İ always thought i was the problem but now i notice its others thats the problem, they never do these stuff to others its always me for some reason, no matter what i do they will find a reason to hate it.

People online havent helped either, ive never been able to communicate with them, they never tried to talk to me, they always ignored me or mocked what i said even when there was no problem with it. My posts or comments never reach anyone, its like i dont exist, but i see people saying the same thing and getting a lot of engagement. I walk this path alone, my only friend is my God, and my motivation is to be better than the ones i hate, nowadays i cant even feel sadness or happiness; the only  two emotion i can remember feeling are hatred and disgust.

741,ym9eao,Even-Blacksmith9384,"TW: Mentions of Alcoholism

This is my first Reddit post. I’m not really sure what I’m expecting but I always make notes to myself and kind of wanted to share this one to get it off my chest. 

No one ever talks about loneliness. Not really. People know that some people are lonely. People say it’s okay and normal to feel lonely. But the people that say that don’t generally know what true loneliness is like. True loneliness is feeling desperate for connection and intimacy even when you’re surrounded by people. Talking to multiple friends, family, people but not truly being able to “talk” to them. Never being able to talk about your true feelings, desires, worries. Never having that best friend to go to that you can tell everything to. Having things go on in your life, good or bad, and no one to share them with. True loneliness of having the world at your fingertips and no one to talk to. 

I am lonely. It’s horrible and painful to admit. Not that it should be or if judge anyone else for saying so, but I do judge myself. I have friends. I have people who care for me. But I don’t have people I can go to. I’m no one’s first port of call when they get exciting news or need to talk to someone. I used to be. I have been, for friends, partners etc. but not anymore. And it hurts. It really fucking hurts. And the problem is, you can’t really do much about it. It’s hard to make friends at this age, and in this era of social media. Everyone is so contactable yet so many people feel so alone. And social media glamourises everyone’s lives. So everyone puts out this picture perfect image of who they are and what they do. It’s not their fault, but everyone’s mental health takes a hit. 

I’m sat alone, drinking despite trying not to for the past few weeks. Putting off work and responsibilities that I should be doing, and frankly want to be doing but can’t bring myself to. At this stage I can barely feed myself properly. I’m putting off exercising even though I love it and know it’s good for me. I’m reaching out for romantic connection just to feel something, knowing that I’ll feel guilty when I inevitably end it because I know it’s not truly what I want. Intimacy of a relationship is so passionate and raw that it feels amazing, but it can’t be relied upon as your only source because it’s so volatile. Relationships can blow up and disappear so quickly. I’ve learned that lesson before, so now to shield myself I don’t even allow that. But without the intimacy of friendship and family, now I’m left with nothing. I feel like I have nothing. I have friends but no one to go to. I have family but I don’t want to burden them, or don’t think they’d understand. I hate to be a burden. And I don’t want sympathy. But I am lonely. And I don’t even know how to fix it.",2022-11-04 20:25:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627027843,5,/r/lonely/comments/ym9eao/thoughts_of_loneliness/,,0,2,Thoughts of loneliness

It feels so ironic that ppl kept saying to find your kind of people, but as we know the journey is sometimes very lonely.

770,ymddnf,Jormala,"I have a bad habbit of forcing myself into socializing even when I don't want to. At first it started with the basic ""I'm lonely and I need to change it by being more social!"" and my grand solution to this was to force myself into every social event I was asked into.

This has basically ruined my enjoyment all social events, because I ALWAYS force myself. This has ironically made me feel even more lonely, because I end up faking most of my interactions with others and I don't actually ever get to talk about things that interest or bother *me*. I always prioritise others over me because I'm scared of becoming alone by *talking too much* or by being not that interesting.  

It has gotten to the point that I don't even enjoy most of the activities or conversations because I'm so anxious about becoming ""abandonned"" by others. I have instead started to secretly hate on people I spend time with. It doesn't stop me from being with them, because  I'm so fucking scared of being alone, that it's actually better to be with people, that I don't enjoy spending time with or that care about me. I'd rather spend time with people that I don't like than be alone.

In the long term I think all of this has made me into a more of a toxic person. I secretly start nitpicking everything others do in my head and begin to think that I'm better than them (I'm not). The only person who actually knows about my worries, troubles and interests is me and that's why I'm so goddamn lonely.",2022-11-04 23:09:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1512569368,6,/r/lonely/comments/ymddnf/forced_myself_into_socializing_and_now_i_feel/,,0,3,Forced myself into socializing and now I feel ever more lonely.

So I thought waiting for the right one will be the right thing even if I don't know such person exist or not. I noticed now, after many years I have created a ideal girlfriend for me in head since teenage. She had everything I need. A caring nature, true love for me etc. I used to make romantic scenarios in my at night and sleep with smile on my face almost sure that future would be great and lovely. This were the only thing I had that brings me happiness to my depressed life. Is it something everyone does?.

I’m an only child that was raised my a single mother. My bio dad didn’t want me and so I was lonely. My mom was loving but she was tough. Anytime I felt sad or depressed she’d tell me I was lucky to have her and to look at the good things in life and not complain. So I didn’t. I never vented I just tucked it all inside. 

She got remarried quickly when I turned 7 and I felt even more lonely because she met a new man who I didn’t know and who was now my step dad. They were all  about each other and I was put on the back burner. Once again lonely. 

I didn’t realize I had bad social anxiety and adhd. Making friends was hard and so was doing well in school. I was always the tag along friend and told I was lazy.

Eventually I got married at 26 and although he’s like a best friend to an extent, he doesn’t listen well and is not very attentive when I share my feelings so I say nothing because I don’t want to be a bother. 

We then had kids and all my “friends” disappeared because I didn’t always have time to go partying like I used to. 

My kids constantly want and need things from me. I love them with my whole being and they’re the ones that are keeping me going but it’s exhausting. I just turned 30 years old and I’m still so lonely I don’t think I’ve had a moment where I wasn’t and it makes me sad. 

My husband talks to his siblings almost every day, he has cousins. I have no relatives but only my mom and step dad.

If people with no mental illness and social problems understand and relate to their problems (for e.g. relating towards memes and humor about the same.), then act like it. Why am I seen like a freak and being actively left out socially? Sure i come off as awkward half of the time, but that is simply because of lack of interaction because of this. I have seen people doing this to others too, ignoring people as if they don't exist is just wrong. And simply approaching them when you need your shit done and then throw them in the bin again. Then i am expected to change and become social. Sure it works but it doesn't seem to work for me though. I have decided that at least I will work on myself physically if not socially. 

Loneliness consumes you to the point it becomes physical pain. The smallest thought/courtesy towards those that seems distressed and alone goes a long way and really makes yours and their day.

Parents had 3 kids, adopted me out, kept next kid.  
Awesome feeling that still impacts me. Makes me think they knew something was wrong with me from before the time I was born and that’s why they gave me up.
Adopted into a racist family of white hateful people.  
Cue being abused in all ways, “forgotten” on Christmas, sitting watching abusive cousins (one of which tried drowning me) open their presents, and if I did ever get anything they made sure to buy sizes too small cause I was a fat sad child and I needed to be reminded of it. Trust me they knew what size I worse it was deliberate.   
But grandma loved me. She cared. I had her in my life until I was 7 and she passed away. Go back to just being with abusive parents.   
First “friends” were actually abusive but I thought their behavior and treatment was normal. I only realised it wasn’t when a girl I treated the exact same way as I was, said **no** she didn’t want to be friends. I truly didn’t understand why, until it clicked, the way I was being treated, and treating others I wanted to be friends with was **unacceptable.**.    
Always called weird, bullied at school, abused at home, no friends and no one to talk too. Mom never interacts with me unless it was to abuse me, dad turns a blind eye and is abusive in other horrid ways. I remember getting gifts and sitting alone in the dark kitchen, trying my best to figure out how to use them but having no one to ask for help or play with lmao which is a mild piece of my history but a memory that is seared in.
Finally make a real friend, my best friend in my entire life. Yeah there was still some shitty stuff but I really felt like I had found my non-romantic soulmate when I was around 10 until they had to move.   
I had some stuffed cats I had as “friends” and the day they were moving I brought them to school with me to make it easier. They ended up getting ducking stolen and she moved so in my little mind I lost everything that day.  
As we got older we met up occasionally every year or so. Eventually she got into a relationship and idk if her gf made her block me or if it was my old friends choice but one day I check Facebook around 20yrs old and I’m blocked.   
Have bf, get married at **17** due to cult reasons basically, he turns abusive and hurts our baby at 23.   
I leave with baby at 9 months old, escape to far away city, living in car and shelters for years until we get housing.  
Get into another abusive relationship few years later that I’m still in because I would have no one and I’m fucked up mentally.
Now I’m 27 and still haven’t had any friends and don’t know how to make them. It’s been 10 years since I’ve had a real friend and I’m so fucking lonely.   
Yes I count my blessings, I have a job, hobbies, I have a home with heat, water and food, a dog, a 4 yr old who loves me and I them, but I am **SO LONELY**.   
  
I just wish I had a real friend. A family. I wish I had love outside of my child, because it’s not enough and I can’t and refuse to rely solely on them, I’m just so sad dude. I’m so fucking sad and I can’t imagine my situation ever changing. I wish I knew what to do. I used to volunteer In shelters just so I could feel useful in some way but I can’t do that anymore which is fine but just adding that in there since I tend to get replies like “why not help out the less fortunate,etc, join a church, etc”.

839,ymm4lw,Dependent_Ad4435,"I’ve had a lot of rough patches with my family. It was a bad situation for both, but I do want to give some context. I was the golden child with high grades, track star, loads of friends, and very outgoing. Relationship with my family was great until a few years back. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia/bipolar and was miserable. The fair weather friends showed themselves and I was happy I didn’t have fake energy around me anymore. I realized once I was no longer useful and fun my family started acting different. It was a gradual change but fairly obvious. I would start getting disrespectful remarks such as “why are you being a wimp” and slowly developed to “you’re a waste of money and a massive burden”. I didn’t want to accept that my family could do that and I was pretty lonely so I passed these remarks for lack of energy and some social contact to keep me going. When the people you look up to the most never miss the chance to put you down you should drop them from that pedestal. Well I didn’t and my sibling spit in my face, literal saliva on my face, and I just broke down. One of my parents was there and saw everything and all they did was smile a little and do nothing. 2 years layers I bring this stuff up with resentment and I’m told I’m being unreasonable and just let it go it wasn’t like that, you know typical gas lighting, which I was very susceptible to because I didn’t understand it. Recently I tried fixing the relationship but I cannot stand these remarks anymore. It’s fucking back breaking having to deal with them but I need them for their financial assistance. I really don’t miss the “golden years” some people really miss, I just miss the respect I was given and gave back. I have come to an understanding that people are not inherently good, they convince themselves their evils are for the necessary good so it makes them as a person a good person no matter their actions. This is gonna sound horrible but I do hope they all just drop dead and I can cash in my inheritance because I shouldn’t have to deal with all of this just to survive. I know people on this sub have it worse and others have it better but Jesus fuck this is miserable. I never look at happy people and envy them, I’m happy for them for not having to deal with the shit most of us deal with on a daily basis. I know life isn’t fair and that’s a reality of being alive, but I truly hope that people who put others down for no reason other than some sick twisted sense of satisfaction get that turned on the 100 fold.

Even though there are two teams, everyone have a great time and a strong feeling of being part of a bigger plan start to bloom into everyone's heart.
As a soldier who tried to complete the NNN, I really felt like a part of a glorious army. Everyone was supportive to everyone else, even hunters to soldiers and soldiers to hunters.

As a true loner, it was the first time I felt a bond this strong to a community.

This afternoon I lost my precious nuts and I am now disqualified from the NNN. As a fallen soldier, I am not part of this glorious army anymore and the feeling of brotherhood I had for every soldier is now a feeling of pure emptiness and loneliness.

I had a taste of the fulfillment of being part of something bigger and now I am just alone again.

887,ymv6p1,Remarkable-Lab6716,"I (M19) was an extrovert since childhood, my dad works in a bank so we used to get transferred every 3 years and I've lived in lots of cities and when we(our family) finally got the opportunity we came back to our city. We left when I was in 4th grade and still have 2 friends with whom i rarely talk to. I did my 11th and 12th from my hometown and manage to get along with a few friends, I attended coaching classes for my college and developed a liking for this girl and we've been on and off(talking and ignoring each other) for 5 years and i confessed my feelings to her approx. 6 months ago and  removed her as a friend on snapchat (idk why )and  I used to follow her on when we were in 12th grade but didn't received the same vibe from her and she unfollowed me after that,so did I.

Currently I'm in 3rd year of College and I'm 5'5 , and I've been approached by a few girls indirectly but I didn't initiate a conversation. However, I recently approached a girl and didn't get the proper response one can expect however i deleted the chat on Instagram and stopped watching her stories.

Currently, I have no REAL friends I'm in a group of 7 guys but all I see is how everyone uses me for their own  good. I'm omw to college after a vacation of 10 days at home and just recieved a snap of all the guys going to my favourite go to place without even asking me or even considering the possibility that we can go there after I come back from home. The only thing I think is for a person to leave is while having food(I'm a slow eater) and these guys just get up and leave even when I'm having food and that disgusts me. Not only that they never ask me while going out, they are all lazy people and usually I'm the one cheering them for a trip and they are the ones who cancel by giving foolish reasons and even while travelling we rent vehicles, and all of these guys pair up and leave me alone. That makes me sad from the bottom of my heart. Those were not even the friends I chose but tend to get caught up due to the place where I rented my apartment. I'm more Intrested in general topics like geo-politics, General Knowledge and I have a decent amount of knowledge on many topics and when I explain it to them they ALWAYS make fun of me for giving too much information. I just dont like feeling like this anymore, It has been worse after covid hit the world I googled the symptoms I have and It says that I might have depression, I don't believe google and don't want to consult a doctor. I am just so frustrated sometimes I feel like committing suicide but then I remember my parents, my family and being the only boy of the house I just can't Imagine what would it do to my family.

I've been fooled numerous times and lended money to various people(huge amounts) and never got them back and it has created trust issues inside me and It has been very difficult to trust anyone after that. However I can't roam for a 100m near my apartment (I live 1100km away from my hometown due to my college ) without a single person greeting me. I'm all that extrovert, handsome, confident guy from the outside but I just wanna talk to someone. just an honest conversation with anyone at the end of the day to give me hope that Everything's going to be okay. 

All I wish every second of my consciousness is that maybe someone will realise what I'm going through in life and stay or even talk to me for a moment being selfless. I just want an honest girl to help me be the better version of myself. 

I'm sorry for any grammatical errors in this post, I'm just full of emotions at the moment and I have written whatever that came to my mind I just wanted some stuff get off my chest.

911,ymzvpi,Practical_Step_3930,"I have no friends right now and physically just can't make any because I can't talk to people at all. I'm in Highschool joined late as well, (3 weeks late new hs). I feel so awful about it I was kinda excited to start a new Highschool told myself I was gonna be different and actually talk to people spent my freshman year online and didn't have contact with anyone from my previous school so I was excited to get out and make friends unfortunately that hasn't happened.

at first, I thought it wasn't entirely my fault I didn't have anyone since I joined late and missed the whole beginning of-year introduction stuff + I kept telling myself that I didn't have any Opportunities to talk to people. For example, sit next to someone in math how am I gonna talk to people in math? That being said I wasn't the only person to join late a boy sitting behind me joined late as well as a deskmate as well and I hear him chatting with him + saw him in the hallway chatting with people and that made me feel really shitty since I wonder why I can't interact with people at all. For my science class, someone else joined even later than me and on the second day I saw him joking around and chatting with other people; also made me feel shitty.

Worst of all I had an English group project and a new girl joined like a week ago so we're over 2 months into the school year at first she was kinda quiet in our group one of the people in my group actually asked me what her name was since she couldn't remember and we needed to write down our group members names and she had left early.

Come to find out I miss 2 days of school and when I come back she was really chatty and is talking with the rest of the group and I'm alone.

I don't know wtf to do I can't bring myself to just talk to people I kept trying to tell myself it wasn't my fault and I just didn't have the opportunity but, as cited in my examples I realize that's, not the case and it's me.

I was actually kinda proud of myself because on the first day of school I was so unbelievably tense I physically couldn't talk when I walked in I had to ask my teachers where to sit (assigned seating) and I could barely get the words out. On the second day of English had to have a classmate help me (I didn't ask the teacher to make her help me) and I couldn't ask anything throat was unbelievably tense. Currently, I can ask teachers for help without squeaking my words + when I was in my English group project I could at least talk normally. So I was kinda proud of myself but, I still can't make friends and it makes me feel so unbelievably bad and alone. I don't know how to just talk to people as soon as we're done with our work everyone else continues talking to each other but not me.

So I realize now that the issue is me and not circumstances of no opportunity and Idk what to do being alone sucks so much but I genuinely don't know how to just talk to some1/can't because I have really bad social anxiety which I like to think has gotten better but I still feel as though I don't function regularly in social interactions and feel I seem odd.",2022-11-05 17:07:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646357150,1,/r/lonely/comments/ymzvpi/social_anxiety_making_me_alone/,,0,0,social anxiety making me alone

I wanted this all to change in college, there was this girl in my class that I reallt liked, but every time around her I got nervous, I struggled to talk to her so I started avoiding her, because it was really hard to have a conversation and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or make myself look like a creep.

When I returned from the holiday's, I had this in my mind that this girl is my only chance, I can't stay like this, I can't keep losing women I like just because I'm scared of what people might think.

I told myself if I lose this women I will never be able to forgive myself ever again, I can't let this keep happening.

953,yn58b4,Significant_East3242,"A month ago I started a job as a beauty advisor at a department store. I was working in libraries before that but I have a passion for makeup and am artistic so thought it could be a good career move. 

The atmosphere at this place is insanely toxic though. The department manager called me into her office on day five of the job and asked me if I thought I was the ""right fit"" for the role. Basically because I told her I wanted to have my lunch break before 2pm due to not eating at regular times triggering my migraines. I was tired and irritated and told her it sounded like she wanted to push me out of my job and I didn't appreciate it. 

Ever since then she's had it in for me. She has a clique of women in the department and I can tell she's told them I'm a problem and to ""monitor"" me. They watch my break times and report back to her if I'm a few minutes late returning from lunch. One of them is openly rude to me quite often. 

The other two give me these pitying looks that are more patronizing then the rude one. If I make a mistake they will explain it to me, but really impatiently and like it's a huge inconvenience to them personally. 

They also do the whispering and laughing in a group thing. The other day I'm pretty sure I heard one of them say something insulting about my appearance. 

The manager of my department is the main source of this crusade to get me to quit so going to her would be pointless. I feel like I'm back in an all girls high school and I'm a 30 year old woman. I really don't have time for this crap. I've met some really cool people at this job but the clique in the beauty department are genuinely awful to be around. On a day most of them were absent the atmosphere was completely different, 100% less toxic and stressful. 

If you were me would you stick it out or try to find a different job? Address it head on or ignore it? It's stressing me out on my weekends and taking up more space in my life then I want a job to be able to take up. I was interested in eventually heading up a beauty counter, but there's no way I'm willing to spend years putting up with this crap on the off chance the manager,  who clearly dislikes me might see my potential as a makeup artist.",2022-11-05 20:28:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593502437,2,/r/lonely/comments/yn58b4/im_being_bullied_at_work_by_a_clique_of_women/,,0,0,I'm being bullied at work by a clique of women headed up by the department manager?

963,yn6qt6,a_human558," 

I am falling behind in my uni. I am a freshman, an international student, and I haven't attended any of the classes I've enrolled in this semester. A half of the semester has passed and I am still carrying on chickening out, not facing the problem and trying to hide myself away from the stress I need to deal with. I am pathetic, a horrible person and a failure to my family. I know I will be judged by others and I will fail in trying to keep up, and then my family will turn their back on me, and I will never have a chance to redeem myself. In that case I won't even be able just to see them. I am dead...yet still doomed.

It all started off with missing the first week because I had troubles enrolling in due to my bank's financial issues (they lost my money and therefore didn't transfered them to my student account on time, so that I didn't have enough funds to enroll in more than three courses when I needed to; I've received the money only by the start of October, but by that time I wasn't able to register for other necessary courses), which led to my late enrollment and missing a few courses I was supposed to be signed in. As a result I enrolled in one unnecessary class just for the university to letting me enroll in other two courses that have been required of me. I couldn't drop the unnecessary one because I wasn't allowed to take a reduced load. A minimum of 3 courses had to be.

After missing the first week, I tried to go to school, but I got lost (the place I've rented is two hours from the uni and I'm too silly to not mess up with maps), arrived two hours late and was afraid to go in because that way I would leave a bad impression on my classmates and on my instructor, so I literally ran away and tried to forget that shame. After that I felt very hungry (I am prone to overeat and I have experience with starving in the past), so though I knew what I was going to do, I didn't think of anything and ate up my worries and then I felt starving and I lived and I got up just to eat the same thing to the point when my belly stretched too much (it looked like I was pregnant with food or something) and I was afraid to show up, so I shut myself in my room and haven't been out since then. I started to postpone every one of my classes as food is too distracting and I am miserable. It's not really anything, it's not a problem, but I feel more guilty because I consumed too much food and was chickening out the whole time. I don't deserve anything. It's just that I hate seeing people disgusted and condemned of my behaviour and my look. I don't even deserve to disappear from the Earth because I have to redeem myself for all that I've done. I know that this is not that big of an issue. Some people are under severe conditions, who try their best to resolve their problems. And that makes me feeling even worse, cause it's very impolite, wrong and despicable of me to belittle their problems by exaggerating mine and not being able to face them. How can I be normal once again? No one will forget my mistakes and everyone will think of me according to my past, plus I am horrible in communicating, especially in English. People won't give me a chance since I am so off-putting.

I tried to reach out to my best friend and ask her advice, but she's still ignoring me (probably blocked me). Another friend haven't yet responded me either, but he haven't blocked me, so there's a chance he may eventually reply to me. My family is busy, so we do not chit-chat much (only texting), so if I'll call them they'll know tha I'm in trouble and I'll be dead in a second.

I know I made a horrendous, ridiculous decisions (or, to be precise, didn't make any decisions), and that I am a nasty, dumb, spoiled, bad being, and all what I need is to man up and face my fears with my doom. However, I am not exactly sure whether my following actions and decisions will be the best or merely good. How will I live knowing all that disgrace, embarrassment and shame. I don't know how should I punish myself and I am scared to inflict any harm upon myself even if I deserve it. To be honest, I don't even know what to do even after finishing my degree. I know that I need to pay off my parents, but after that...what? Working? What if I will loathe my job? What my life should be? Why my life should be if I'm just a biowaste? I just don't have any desire to meet, encounter and talk to people face-to-face. But I am prompted to and it's my responsibility as a human to act accordingly. I am childish and I don't want to care about others and please them, but I have to in order to live and survive. I'm just a leech who suck my parents' money. How can I become responsible?

970,yn7i92,Greedy_Entertainer64,"So, I am now recently in second year of my uni. Long story short; it sucks. Like really, really sucks, and I hate it 

Short story long: Life wasn't too good for me before uni. My parents split, I struggled with my school work and my grades were terrible, and I always found it kinda hard to socialise and make friends; probably due to having cultural and slightly overbearing parents who never really made me experience the adult world much (still love them though).

And then it was time for university, located in a different time where I decided to accommodate in. After what I've seen and heard in videos, blogs and past experiences from others, I have been excited to go there. This could mean a chance to properly experience life independently, make friends and have quite the adventure. At least that's what I thought. 

The first couple days of my first were pretty nice as I did get to explore the place and talk to new people (especially my flatmates of the dorm I'm in). But days and days later, the talking and venturing has been kept minimal. And finally the first year ended, with me barely managing to make any friends or do much except uni work.

Now I'm in my second year, and as the days go by, I'm just practically feeling more and more depressed. When I try to chat with the few friends I have, my eagerness gets the better of me and now they possibly think of me as 'just that weird guy' they can just make jokes about. I don't blame them though, as I'm far from normal and tend to say embarrassing or stupid and awkward stuff that I can't help, due to my extreme lack of social skills. And I'm beginning to hate myself for it.

Now I'm just constantly stuck with the same routine where I do lessons, chill at my room and occasionally play board games in a society where I continue being the uncontrollable idiot I am, and I'm beginning to crack. I feel socially isolated, started becoming self loafing and even start to wish that I'm not me anymore. I'm beginning to regret going to uni, as it has just made me feel even worse about myself. I'm basically just that 'extra guy' in my friend group (like a person who's just there without much meaning to it) and I can't take it anymore. Uni is nothing to me like what others mention it as, and I don't wanna be here anymore.

So yeah, that's the end of my rant. And thank you deeply to everyone that has read through it. Sorry if some things I have written doesn't make sense due to slightly rushing through this post. I appreciate any notes or advice given, and hope you all have a wonderful day (or at least way better than mine).",2022-11-05 21:55:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621805650,3,/r/lonely/comments/yn7i92/im_starting_to_hate_my_life_in_university/,,0,11,I'm starting to hate my life in University

This could be something take for example “The Godfather”: **The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.”** A beautiful but simple idea that made the directer/crew and all those involved lots of money, contacts and friends. But you got to be realistic, I dont have thousands to spend on hiring and aging back an entire street like Dean Tavoularis did with Francis Ford Coppola’s money.

With my simple budget, of say £30 I can hire out some of the best seats in a cinema and get food/drink to chat with someone I want to take out. The logline goes like this: “**The young bachler looks to make a new friend, and pitchs to a girl who attended his party in seeing a movie together with people they know.”** To be clear, I’m only interested in starting a conversation, which is skipping the long step of actually having to wait and see. If they can be a friend as you lot know. Trust is a two way street, and I cheated by trying to get people to see an expensive movie. Two tickets costed lke £18 and thats with a discount. Not letting her worry about the price, I covered it bec thats wht we do. 

Thats mad, right… but I thought worth it. Because I in truth just thought it’ll be better with just us. Bec no one forks out that kind of money on a film unless its a date and I didnt want it to be but kinda did. Like my old friends did for me, Thinking over what I’ve written I see my selifish mistake. What if we dont get on? What if… I cant find anyone else to go with. Which is what happened as I heard back from no one else wanting to go with us

Its an even lost cause since she says I’m now putting her under pressure to go as I bought the tickets already and well, thats unfair to just say that when all I’m just wanting is to make new friends here.

I get that is putting her under pressure, and really didnt want to make anyone uncomfortable but if I didnt buy the ticket. No one would consider going with me…Well, I do have people. The points for living in a shared student community house.

I have loads of people to ask, and heck even my ex may be interested in hanging out, which is why I didnt. Got to move on from her… and the friend who just uses me.  
What should I do? Do I keep pressuring this girl and let it stay uncomfortable? or should i do one last check if she wants to go tomorrow bec she didnt say no and if she does ask my ex or someone else. I only really just told her if she has anyone interested they may aswell come along, I can get the ticket again?

i've never written anything here before, but i think i want to rant about this to see if i'm being unreasonable or wrong on my opinions regarding my situation. i'm a young woman who just moved to another country to study for a year. it is not my first time moving countries since i also did my bachelors in a different country than my own, this is my second time. my previous university city was lovely, i miss it so much and all my friends there, how we used to make plans and pur friendship was genuine and kind. i was there four years so i really miss it. i met my lovely boyfriend there with whom i have a long-distance relationship at the moment, which is going quite well under the circumstances. today i feel extra lonely for several reasons and realisations i've just uncovered.

 i do not know the language in the country i am studying in at the moment, so it's been quite impossible to make acquaintance with the locals here or anyone outside my classroom. my classmates are extremely international and during the first two months here we hanged out quite often,maybe not all of us but a fairly big number. for some reason the activity in our main groupchat declined and i didn't think much of it, until this classmate, let's call her Annie,  told me that there are people who created a different, smaller groupchat in order to meet. annie is unfortunately being excluded quite a lot because her english isn't very good and neither are her skills in this course, which unfortunately is the case for some people in my class. this is not my case, i am actually quite proficient within my classroom and have a better english level than most of them, i have a good background and good writing skills, which we need, and i am extroverted and sociable. anyways, annie has come to me in several occasions as her ""support"" person, a role that i am not willing to take since i cannot take care of another person's full needs like that at this moment (she is VERY lost and needs constant help with all assignments and even to communicate with others since she is extremely shy). i genuinely told her that i don't think there is another groupchat, mostly because i am not in it. i am definitely not part of the ""outcast"" people in my class that unfortunately are often excluded from social events, so if there was a groupchat, i would assume i would be included since i am quite close with everyone. let me clarify that i HATE that this is being done to annie and other classmates, and i try to include them everytime i can. it is because of this that i now suspect that i have been excluded too. just minutes after annie told me about her suspicions, a classmate wrote in the main groupchat ""everyone, surprise! we are at (club name) right now if you want to join"". this message made me realise how, indeed, there has to be another chat. this classmate has done this before: sending a message ""last minute"" so we can join her and other classmates at a specific club or bar. this is not very nice to those who want to join because: A, it looks like she DOESN'T want us to join but says it to be ""polite"" and not look bad and, B. that specific club is free entry only before 8pm and she sent the message at 10pm (price goes up incredibly after that)

i replied to her message saying that if she would've said before i would've joined, and asked ""isn't it free to go in before 8pm?"", to which she responded ""naah that's too early for a saturday"". this answer angered me so much because personally i am in a budget and i've already had trouble when communicating to them that i need to do cheaper activities. (AND the country we are in is one of the most expensive in EUROPE so i think i'm being quite fuck*** reasonable at this point). i know i'm not the only one in this position either, which divides the classroom so much in a weird ""winners"" and ""losers"" dynamic. the ""cool"" people and the uncool ones. 

on top of this, my boyfriend is visiting my my university city today and met all my friends there and did all the things we used to do. i am devastated for not being there with him and all our dear friends which j miss so much. this course and this country feels like a prison and i feel so rejected. no people i meet here want to actively hang out with me and, even when i proposed plans with my class, either no one answers or they end up doing something else that same day that is reallt expensive and inherently different to what i've just proposed. i feel extremely lonely in ways i've never felt since i think i am a very open and sociable person. i don't want to resort to my family's support because of their toxic dynamics, and all my friends are all working as well and very busy in other countries.

i just feel so angry with everyone, this is just so fucked up. i just want to be distracted since this course is not even as good as they promised, and it's also full of flaws and disorganisation. i am so tired already and i just want to cry. i can't even get a fuck*** job to distract myself here, and have to count every penny as well. i feel like an utter professional and social failure. 

some kind words would cheer me up, although i don't expect them. the worst is that i know i should be grateful to study higher education in a good university and to be here at all. i know i should be grateful for not needing to work to sustain myself 100%, i am able to be on a budget thanks to my previous work during my last year while finishing my degree. but, why is it so difficult to be happy right now?

He never let me pay anything and we cuddled all the time. The sex was good as well and always made it fun and different. We saw each other 2-4 times a week. He also had no family nearby, he was from California. He told me why he was so inconsistent and it was because he has had a drug problem for many years that relapses every other month or so. He consumes drugs after work and goes completely out. One time I went to his place after not hearing from him for almost a day when we were supposed to go to an event together and he was stoned and barely functioning. I had my suspicion that he had a substance problem. I miss the company, the cuddling, and a good conversation with him. He texted me the next two days after he came to pick up his stuff at my place. I offered him my help and left myself open to anything. He did as well. It's been three days and I haven't heard from him. I am so depressed after learning about his problem. I am worried about him. I am not sure how to approach him. I just want to cuddle with him.",2022-11-05 22:37:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585960504,2,/r/lonely/comments/yn8ogw/i_feel_so_lonely_after_dumping_my_inconsistent_ex/,,0,1,I Feel So Lonely After Dumping my Inconsistent Ex

I'm in a relationship but have 0 friends otherwise. Help?   


Tearing up a bit writing this.. loneliness is rough.  


I have social anxiety and the depression doctors call clinical so it's been hard to make new friends.. I've been kind of down lately. I miss the old warm, fun, goofy me.. That guy's awesome. But lately I've been this mopey, quiet loner. If someone could help me change that, that'd be great.   


We might get along a bit better if you can relate to having issues. Not like anyone isn't welcome in particular but lately I've been chatting with people who -really- don't get it.. They can be a bit condescending (Completely unintentionally) Picture pushing an invisible boulder up a hill and trying to explain why you're breathing so hard. I also really don't want you to feel uncomfortable yknow? If you don't seem to fit in anywhere else, maybe I'm your dude.  


I like a lot of things but have trouble maintaining interest in some of them lately. I draw, write, read, play games (PC mainly) watch movies and all that good stuff. I'm into anime as well. My favorite genre is horror.

992,yna122,Of-The-Cloud,"I'm always researching and junk. I'm chronically lonely, and I often compare myself to an unsocialized dog.   
Im so tired of the answer to curing loneliness being ""Just go make friends!"" or ""Learn to love being by yourself! love yourself!"".   
These are coming from people who broke up with a friend or something and were lonely for a week or maybe a month. they have support and junk.   
basically, this ""Advice"" isn't from someone who hasn't had a hug in years, or people who has people throw them away when they get bored. I try, and try to make friends, to no avail. I never learned to socialize properly, so I get too excited when someone finally wants to talk to me, then I guess I make em feel weird? I know the only common denominator is me, so it has to be something I'm doing. But whenever I look up toxic signs or negative signs of a person, I don't fit it. I just need someone to tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong. I give gifts, and support whenever people struggle. I try making jokes, I try staying in contact, I try talking, I try getting into the things their into, I tell them how awsome and how proud I am of them, I do nothing but try uplifting people! but then I crack a little that I am struggling, that I hurt and feel so left out, I crack. And they decide, I'm not worth it. not worth wasting their energy to tell me its ok. Thats all I need, a hug and to be told it'll be ok. But instead they leave.... Maybe that's toxic in itself ? that I try so hard, they can see it and think I'm a try hard? Or how even wanting some sort of affection is so selfish of me, how fucking dare I, right? how dare I wanna play and talk and just hang out, we don't even need to talk! I just cant taking being alone for another year, my mental state is degrading. I try and try and try....  
I've never had a friend, not one who wanted to hang out outside school. I've gone years without contact, I talk to my family and its not the same... I feel so clocked out and not one of my own family. I feel I don't even have one, that its only a matter of time before they stop making money off me and know I'm not the perfect kid they wanted, before they throw me away too. Then what?   
""Go to a support group!""  
""Make new friends!""   
""Talk to a therapist!""  
""stay in contact!"".   
""etc etc etc"" it DOESNT WORK. maybe I'm just too boring for people? maybe I was just the entertainment for class? idk. I just... want one person to know I exist. I try so hard, I do what people want. I do and do and do... Why do I need to use all my energy and more to make one friend? if no one wants to even use a single ounce of their energy to just pat me on the shoulder and say ""Oh hi! we should go to coffee sometime!"".

So im around one year single, 10 months to be correct. We broke up because it was our first relationship and she wasn't sure about her feelings, so i let her go. At the day she told me i was only somehow able to get home, fall on the bed and cry for an hours i even didn't go to school for 3 days after. 
I know i love her, but she don't share same feeling for me. From that day i havent even interacted with female, even when i relly eaned to, because when i did 110% for someone it aparantly wasn't enaugh so i don't think anyone would even conaider me as romantic partner.
Unfortunatly i still love her i still want to be with her, cuddle or kiss her or just see her smile or atleast hear her voice agin. She used to call me her ""star"" it was kinda anoing but still cute. But i thinh love is not about wanting someone for ourselfs but about wanting the best fo the loved one, so if she want to be with somebody else i won't try to forse her to stay.
I also can't stop thinking about our first date. It was day when i felt that joy/happines from life and that my existance had some meaning, i lived for her and i would still do anything for that smile.
I miss even the smallest think in that relationship like fricking hug (yes i didnt even get any hug at all after that beakup) and i don't even speak abou cuddeling, im in point where i would pay someone just for cuddeling with me.
When i think about it it hurts but not only in my mind i also fell like someone is stabing my heart over and over. I even remember how she smeled that evening.
At this point i don't knowwhere to go, i want to go past it and forgot, but i don't have any female friends and im going to IT highschool where are like 20 girls od 130 boys. I don't know how to meet some girl and if how to start a conversation or ask her fo number or instagram. And if i did it somehiw how would i ask her out? I simply don't know. If you know somethink please tell me
I eve thougt of ending it all, but in the last minute i ralize i have atleast few friends but it ist what i need i can't go and for example kiss them.

If anyone red this and made it to end thank you, for your care.

I was identified as a gifted kid pretty young, and I was homeschooled until high school. Complete isolation from social interactions didn't help much since when I did go to public school for high school, I was clueless. I had the social and emotional maturity of a 5 year old, dealing with the problems of a 14 year old. I tried to make friends since that's what people say is normal but I couldn't. I had no idea how. I was never able to form a deep connection with anyone, either I'd push them away somehow or they were never interested in being friends but I couldn't tell since I was a social idiot. I was one of the ""weird kids"" yet I couldn't even make friends among that group. I was (and am) a giant loser lol.

Now I'm in my first year of college and it's even worse since I lost all faith in my ability to form connections. I barely even try anymore. Anything I try when it comes to people deteriorates quickly. I'm sick of this shit and I'm sick of myself.

I’ve been sitting here crying all week. I’ve poured my heart out to this person for 7 years and even bought him Christmas presents that i can no longer send to him. 

I feel absolutely worthless. No one likes me, not even for my body or their own gain. Am i that insufferable? Am i worth nothing?.

1025,ynd9f7,[deleted],"Hi.

My name is Bob and this is my second post on here. A few days ago I made my first post not knowing what to expect. A few people commented with nice advice and I appreciated it, you are a fine group seeking to help others. I actually found myself staying up late commenting on others posts who had no comments in an effort to help them not feel as lonely. It was an interesting experience opening up to strangers, something I hadn't done in a long time. I have more clarity now of what I was seeking. The advice was nice of course, most of it is things I already knew. I imagine a lot of you already know what you could do to help yourselves. It's actually doing it that you struggle with because you still have no one. No one that cares, no one to talk to you that day, no one to check on your mental health. Isn't that what brought us here?

Maybe this is me failing to take accountability for my actions, but idrk. Just seeing someone on their phone or with headphones in makes them unapproachable for me. 

I can’t stand the long silence after one topic subsides and I cannot hold a conversation for the life of me. It’s also a bad habit of mine that I’m hoping to abolish, but whenever conversations end, I just subconsciously go on my phone and search for something to do on it. I’ve noticed this in others too. Whenever they would feel awkward, they would slunk their shoulders and fish for their phone in their pockets and do god knows what.

I only got a taste of time before phones were an everyday thing but this was elementary school. I would get together with others and we would simply talk and make ourselves busy with whatever imagined plot. Then again, we were kids, but I sometimes wonder how things would be if I grew up without cellphones. Maybe I’d be more inclined to leave my house often instead of mindlessly scrolling and wasting my life away.

Just a little bit about me, I am biologically F19. I am a first-year college student majoring in Animation. I was a social person, I loved getting to know people and always found myself surrounded by friends and acquaintances. I was never alone but would get lonely quite often because I only had a handful of friends I could approach about my rants and problems. From a very young age, no one really taught me how to be open with my feelings because my family would just turn to anger and hostility instead of communicating healthily. I always told myself I would be the one to stop that cycle but it was harder than I thought. These days, I found myself isolating myself more and more. I wasn't as social as I was before, I do not approach people anymore, and I barely keep in touch with my friends. It all started when my closest friend became hostile with me, I didn't know what I did to make her feel that way towards me, I tried talking to her but it went nowhere and she would just shut me down. I assumed maybe she was tired of me, she was the only friend I could approach with my problems, but I would always be considerate when talking about my rants and such. I would always make sure she was in a good frame of mind as well and if she wanted to listen. After that, I became too comfortable with a new friend I only started being open with as she was open to me as well. I didn't take losing a friend that great and started making jokes to my new friend that I would often make towards the old friend that I have mentioned (basically wanting to convert my new friend into the friend that I have lost). She got uncomfortable and after she approached me with it and I apologized I thought everything would be back to normal, but she never opened up to me again and I have felt so guilty and shitty ever since.  


I keep telling myself this is for the best as I was a people-pleaser as well, I would do anything just to get people's approval, to the point I started putting myself in danger. But being this alone and lonely has been taking a toll on me. I am used to being social and having people around me. But after everything, I also want to enjoy my own company but I always mistake it as, people hating on me or I am just destined to die alone.  


I apologize for being all over the place. I just really can't pinpoint where I am in my life right now. I have friends but I do not have someone to lean on. Am I just selfish for thinking that? Anyways, I don't really know what I want right now, just wanted to get some things off my chest. College sucks and I want out. That's about it.

What I hate about Saturday nights is that I end up not really planning anything, then, I get lonely and start contacting women in my phone, only for them to either not answer, or pick up to reject/mock me.

“You miss me don’t you”
“In other words, you want to come over”

Only to purposely change the subject and talk about something else until they get tired and wanna get off the phone. They never want to make plans or anything. 

What hurts the most is that I was 100 pounds lighter at one point, and would rarely experience this. I want to care about myself, and start exercising more, but for some reason, I just won’t. I don’t seem to care about myself, or have any self-respect at all right now. It makes no sense, because I’m more successful than I’ve ever been in my life.

1079,yni3hh,Professional_Flow521,"I never had friends in school. Didn’t make friends in college. I never get invited out with coworkers. Etc..

Over the years I learned to accept this and focus on myself. I’m 33m, decent looking, in shape, own a nice home/multiple vehicles, and have a successful career. I’ve moved up into management and had a great reputation and make very good money.

I thought I was happy and at peace…until I made a friend.

About 3 yrs ago I got a new coworker. We hit it off right away. Similar backgrounds, similar hobbies, etc. We’d ride motorcycles for hours, hang out and smoke cigars, work on projects, or just do whatever. For the first time in my life I had a best friend, and I felt a happiness I’d never felt before. I let all the walls I’d built over the years crumble because I no longer needed them.

There was one catch…this friend is a younger attractive woman (28f). First and foremost, she is very much a lesbian and communicated that clearly early on. I respect that and my feelings have been strictly platonic the entirety of our friendship. Nothing has ever happened, nor have I tried.

Because of my position, we’ve been targeted by jealous coworkers who have spread damaging and unfounded rumors regarding our relationship. There are plenty of people at my level or higher that are good friends with lower level employees of the same gender and have no issues. Also, except for one 6 week project over two years ago I have never been directly in charge of her.

Ultimately I was demoted and moved to another building and while she has stayed in her current position…her reputation is destroyed. We’ve barely spoken since and don’t hang out anymore.

I lost the first true friend I’ve made in three decades because of stereotypes. Not to mention potentially ruining both our careers. 

I’m back to being alone, except now I don’t have the walls I built over the years or the success to fall back on. It really hurts this time….more than it ever did before.",2022-11-06 05:52:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612506718,7,/r/lonely/comments/yni3hh/success_sucks/,,0,1,Success sucks..

I’m not really sure what it is that I want. I think I want to be close with someone. Then again, I’m not really sure. I’ve forgotten what it feels like to be close to someone. 


I feel nostalgia for that feeling. It’s like it doesn’t even exist. I feel cold. I want to try to find it but I never do. I’m always saying “next week I’ll do it”. 


I don’t feel attracted to anyone anymore. Like I’m disconnected. What is attraction anyways, our body’s instinct reaction to find a mate? 


Maybe I’ve been alone for too long, or it’s trauma. There’s always going to be someone better than me, so why should I try? On a universal scale I’m a speck of dust trying to survive. Humans are weird creatures. 

28 years old, not sure what I’m missing out on. What if I find the wrong person. What if I have a gf for years and then we break up, and I find someone to fall in love with again. Doesn’t that make love kind of meaningless? If it’s forever reaching, no matter who it is, what’s the point?

Ignorance is bliss. Maybe I should stay alone. It’s peaceful and quiet like the snow, then everything melts away in time.

Yesterday was my brother's birthday, and I was tasked with grocery shopping, cooking, and all of the party stuff. It went okay, but she wasn't satisfied. She was on the phone with my aunt (her sister) and my grandmother; she was talking to them about random stuff, and somehow the topic shifted to my size and weight. My dad mentioned earlier that I was losing weight, but my mom had to contradict that—she asked me to show myself on camera and said that I'm still fat, then my aunt agreed and said I can still do better. I was embarrassed but just laughed it off.

Right after that call, she asked me how much I spent on everything because she asked me to pay for everything first and she'd pay me back. I joked about the expenses, and she started cussing at me. She was eventually called out by my siblings, and I just walked out and left.

Now, I just feel like hurting myself and disappearing. It has always been like this when there's something wrong between us: I just immediately turn into this—self-destructive and depressed. I always cope by hurting myself, starving myself, and isolating myself until I feel like it's going to be okay.

I want this feeling and habit to stop. I want to stop caring so much about what she thinks of me, and I want to stop being this hurt little kid who wants validation, attention, and love from her mother. I want to be unbothered by it and be okay with not having a relationship with her and just co-existing.

I want to know what I can do to prevent this behavior in the near future.  ",2022-11-06 10:04:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666382025,5,/r/lonely/comments/ynm5r6/mommy_issues/,,0,2,MOMMY ISSUES??

1126,ynp6ux,Havoc2077,"I was at an anime convention this weekend, had a great time at it but definitely made me feel a bit more lonely. Idk if its because I've been alone for so long that I've become hyperaware of it (25m, never had a relationship before), or if it was just genuinely more common this year than last year. 

But there were so many couples at the convention this year. Couples doing cosplays together, holding hands the whole time, being with each other. I genuinely feel happy for them, no anger from me because they have something I dont. But it definitely made me wish I had that too. 

Doesnt help my con experience just felt really lonely, felt like there was a lack of actual social events to go to, so the only thing I really did was go to a few panels and shop around. 

I'm tired of feeling this way though. I've been trying to change for the better for the last several months. Started exercising (lost 20 lbs now actually), kicked my porn addiction I had, generally just trying to make myself more appealing but idk. Feels like everytime I take steps forward I just start thinking of how far off it all is. 

I just dont want to be alone anymore. I want someone to share my hobbies and interests with, and for them to share with me theirs.

1129,ynptew,big_calves,"I was your typical socially awkward guy(17M now). outside i looked an extrovert with a lot of friends but it was like an act. i used to get bullied in school ,on top of that these bullies called me their ""friend"". i went along with the act and legit treated them as friends cuz i thought if they see me as their friend they wont bully me like that.
I was wrong. They always made me look inferior. and damn did they curse a lot. i was overweight(not morbidly obese) so they made fun of me for that.

yeah they weren't my friends. i legit had no freinds.i had no girlfriend cuz where im from overweights are not liked at all. funny how in my class only i was fat and everyone including the fcin teachers called me fatty sometimes.(i was insecure abt it)

As i said i was socially awkward i couldnt talk to my crush i felt left out cuz my ""friends"" had gfs. i couldn't talk to anyone about the bullying. basically i isolated myself from everyone including family.i felt empty.my family didn't give me attention. i felt so lonely sometimes i wanted to end it all. i felt lonely inside a crowd of people.

Then one day i saw a jacked dude on insta and i was flabbergasted lol. i never knew a human can look like that. i looked into more lifting stuff and the next day i was in the gym trying to figure out what exercise to do.

its been like a year now and i am a different person now. its like the gains bought out the real me from my shell. my confidence is out off the roof. i dont get bullied anymore cuz they are all like skinny dudes and i am the only jacked guy in my class. i get a ton of compliments from the girls now. i dont feel left out anymore.i have real friends now.i have my gymbros. i still dont have a gf btw. but doesn't matter cuz im like new to the world around me im still learning.

I recently got broken up with and expressed my frustration with how all the people around my (29F) age in my network are in long term relationships, married and/or have kids. I know it isnt good to compare but I see it everywhere and Im also the single person in my friend groups. It is hard to ignore when friends joke about my singleness.

Anyway, she said to me that a good relationship would come when you arent looking for it. But she also said that I could make the goal to be in a relationship in Xyears and it is in my control to achieve that. It is my decisions that would make that happen. I dont think that it is realistic to set a goal like that since I cant control someone liking me and staying with me. I cant decide for someone else that my goal is to be in a relationship so they must love me. Also, is that not the exact opposite advice as not looking for a relationship and having it happen?

On top of that, she said that I shouldnt change who I am so someone else would like me. Then she said that I should think about the type of person I want, the type of person they would want and change to match that. How does this advice make sense?

1152,ynuiy8,Roboticcatisgreen,"I know there are people on here that are always alone. I know how that can be. Been there. Hugs for you. But I wanted to ask the Lonely group here about “friends” that seem to come and go from your life.

For me, last month was the ideal. I was invited to a party with my sisters friend. They thought to extend the invite to me. I really thought that was nice. It’s still my sisters friend, but still, nice to be thought about, you know? 

Also, last month an “old friend” reached out. I’ve known him for 25 years. We seem to come and go from each other’s lives; not seeing each other for years. He broke up with his long time girlfriend and she really prevented him from seeing people. He wanted friends again. I told him when to come over, and last month I hung out with him and his other friend twice. It was so nice and I laughed so much. 

But I wanted it to continue, and I’m feeling a bit ghosted. I tried to have them over again this weekend and he hasn’t responded to any of texts. He’s pretty bad at texting (he might respond more to phone calls but I have some anxiety around phone calls and tend to avoid them). 

But it kinda feels like maybe this month I’m going to be lonely again and without friends. 

Here is the other thing too: when I “have” friends it feels like I have to do ALL the work. I have to text them. I have to have them over to my house or tell them what I want to do (like go to a movie). I have to plan it. If I didn’t, they’d maybe rarely say anything. In fact, I was shocked when he initially reached out last month saying he wanted to do something. I was so relieved to have initial request like that I planned the something. But going forward? I’d probably have to do all the things. I’m going to stop texting and see what happens because I’m already tired of pulling up out texts and the screen is just all me with no response.

I think if I really wanted to try to see them again this month, I’d probably need to call and set it all up. Should I go to that extent?

If you’d like to commiserate or vent about something similar, I’d like that too.",2022-11-06 16:18:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1521683011,4,/r/lonely/comments/ynuiy8/people_that_come_and_go/,,0,1,People that Come and Go

1154,ynv2bg,rushgyu,"I'm lonely because I have poor social skills (maybe it's because of my social phobia) so I knew I'm not a person to last.
But honestly, seeing my few friends stop talking to me hurts me, I've been trying to talk to them, send tiktok links and tweets that remind me of them and while some ignore me, others barely respond to me and it's that horrible weirdness.
I'm wondering what I did wrong to make everyone walk away from me, or if it's just because they have a favorite person they hang out with, and I've only been there to ""guard the place"" while they arrive, and I'm absolutely nothing to anyone.
I wanted to be someone's favorite person, I wish I wasn't so difficult to deal with.
I've always been alone, always, always, always, nowadays it gets worse because of my depression and s*ic*de att*mp*s, so being alone feels like an opportunity, always.
With everything going on it seems like no one expects me to stay because they KNOW what I'm going through and even if I try to talk no one answers me no one wants to keep talking to me so with all this shit in my head it just seems very empty, dense and very high.
So maybe I'm just not that important.
Maybe it's hurting now because I let myself believe that I could have someone for myself, that I could trust and love.

1212,yo327g,WaveGrand5840,"Hello, 

I am writing this bc I just don’t want to go outside anymore. 

Most of the time, we attribute our insecurities to social media by saying that everything is fake etc. However, I don’t need social media to be upset ; every time I go out I see people being so beautiful and in relationships.

I have never been pursued or in a relationship at 24. 

I really try not to compare myself to others bu there isn’t a minute I am not reminded of how much single I am. Everyone has a boyfriend, or girlfriend, group of friends.

Writing this on the train, a couple kissed, hugged and were all nice together…

I only got one experience, just a hookup and we only kissed. I feel like the guy just wanted to use me for his desires we didn’t do anything more. I regret just being a hookup. Now I feel like no one really wants me bc I might be an awful person…

Help me accept the fact that I am forever alone or I might just stop going outside. I don’t want to ruin my life. ⚠️",2022-11-06 21:16:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666391575,2,/r/lonely/comments/yo327g/online_or_offline_i_compare_myself/,,0,2,"Online or offline, I compare myself"

1222,yo4e9b,KornbredNinja,"Lately i have became so overwhelmed with people and trying to interact with them i have to take about a week to myself where i basically isolate because i just cant deal with people anymore. I would say ""it feels like"" but this is not just a feeling its the truth. Everytime i interact with people its like they tolerate me but dont truly enjoy talking with me or want to be around me. I realize some of it could be anxiety telling me this, but when multiple people just stop responding it gets to you after a while. This is mostly online im talking about. But ive ran into a few rude people in real life too and that its stuck in the back of my mind/heart too.  I went through a divorce, no real life friends much and trying my hardest to get back out into the world and just to feel ""human"" again. Im trying to overcome social anxiety and AVPD all the while doing this too so it definitely aint what id call easy. I give myself props for the progress but at the same time i wonder was i better off alone and not even trying to leave my comfort zone. 

Then you run into the usual crazy people when trying ot make friends too. I realize online theres always that risk and try not to internalize that part. Its expected but the rest of this is getting a little rediculous.

I feel like a throw away person most of the time. Like one of those people that will die in their house and nobody finds them for five months until the smell becomes overpowering and it comes up in casual conversation.

I dont hate anybody or wish anybody any ill will but i wish people came with a meter that showed when it was safe to talk to them or try to hangout etc. Just having a hard time lately with loneliness and isolation and im really trying to reach out to people but every time i do i get smacked the fuck back. Ive been ghosted about 3 or 4 times in the past few weeks. People are so bad at communication and just really dont care.

Im fine if somebody doesnt want to talk to me or be around me or even be my friend etc. But just TELL ME! Dont expect me to read your damn mind while you pretend to be my friend etc.  I got zero patience for that crap anymore. Like just say what you think/mean/feel or GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME.

I know people get busy and have lives im not talking about that. But damn man people could be a little nicer and communicate better.  My favorite is the people youve known a long time (years) and then just at the drop of a hat they become somebody different or are part of a new group and you dont fit in that group so youre left out. Thats always fun.

Theres a disconnect with me and the human race and im okay with that. I just wish i could find other people that were disconnected too and we could be alone together.  Things will get better i know it just takes time. So this week is a skip week for me. No people anymore than i can help it. If anybody else deals with this im sorry you go through this. I dont wish this on my worst enemy.

Just needed to vent. Thanks for listening, dont really need advice etc just wanted to get this out. Trying not to bottle everything up.  Alright well im going to bury myself in music, video games and movies/shows for a while.

I hope you have a good week and all the best to you and your familiy.",2022-11-06 22:07:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622143430,1,/r/lonely/comments/yo4e9b/its_a_skip_week/,,0,0,Its a skip week

I’m 27M in the US. I’ve switched majors so much and still live at home because of it. I’ve gained a good amount of weight and honestly so embarrassed of myself. 

In my early 20’s, I was in a bit better shape, and was outgoing as anyone. 

I’m still outgoing and all that but self conscious of my weight and career situation. 

I have a couple part time writing jobs and make hardly anything. 

I’m so embarrassed about how little I’ve done and accomplished in life I avoid women who I know won’t want to date me. 

All my friends have their own place, careers, or wife’s/girlfriends.

1282,yo9vdc,pikasutdalt,"I’ve always struggled with social interactions. I believe my ADHD and autism may contribute to this fact. My brain struggles to get thoughts to come out as words, and even if they do, they then have to go through the process of coming out as coherent and/or full statements. All while struggling with frequent brain fog. This said, people tend to gravitate towards me fairly easily. I don’t talk much, but when I do, my friends like what I have to say. I can handle one-on-one/smaller groups much better than I can larger crowds. But a lot of the time, when I’m with somebody, even friends I am closer to, I feel like I don’t have as good chemistry with the person I’m talking to as much as they do with other people. And it makes me feel like I am socially inept, like I’m not their close friend.

Enter 3 years ago. I met this person online. We started by texting each other almost everyday on Discord, before eventually adding calls to the mix shortly thereafter. We have had calls that lasted hours, long talks about our mental health, played video games and watched shows/movies together. After getting close to each other for so long, I finally met her in person this past April. I feel like this friendship I have with her is possibly the strongest I’ve felt I had with another human being. I have plenty of friends whom I consider myself to be close to, but this felt like something I hadn’t ever had before. Albeit this person is long-distance, we still make it work, and call each other best friends.

Flashback to this past summer, I confided in her about some potential interest in her non-platonically. She gently responded by telling me she didn’t feel the same way, but she cherished me as her best friend. At the time, I took it relatively well and moved on within 2-3 days. Fast-forward to this fall, she makes a new friend through a mutual at school. She started to hang out with him more often beginning October. Of course, those dormant feelings began to flare up again at full force. I approached her about these feelings again now that I began to suspect that there may now be somebody to “take my place.” We talked and talked, and what she ended up telling me at the time was essentially:
* I’m irreplaceable, as every friend holds a unique spot in her life
* She doesn’t talk to anybody else as much as she does me
* She talks about me to her other friends all the time
* I’m the only one who keeps her afloat when she’s down low and the only one who can hang out with her at night
* Things may change over time, but we’ll find new routines when it’s called for
This was all reassuring at the time, and had me thinking that this would come to pass. Whatever happens, we’ll still be best friends.

We still are best friends, and she makes time for me still, but… she did start dating her new friend. And… hearing her tell me that made me fiercely happy as well as heartbroken. To be honest, I haven’t been taking this well at all. We ended up taking a friendship break for a week because she suggested we should after I started panicking on one of our calls. When we came back, she asked me if I was okay because she was really worried about me.

Anyway, I feel like I’m getting sidetracked. I don’t feel like I’m going to get over this limerence for her anytime soon, but I want to be determined to get through this so that we can continue being best friends and have our bond thrive. I’ve felt limerence towards girls before, and my friendships with them ended because of that. I really don’t want to repeat those same events. Especially because this is a really close friendship of mine, when the previous ones weren’t.

But… I find myself hyper-fixating on little things, like being texted less by her lately. And it makes me think that what she told me a few weeks ago… is already no longer true. She must be talking to him more than she talks to me now. I used to be her only friend and maybe that’s why I’m appreciated. Maybe she’ll leave me in the dust since I’m just a voice on the internet, and not occupying a physical presence. Our friendship is going to change. It already is. But she told me I will always be her best friend. I want to be. But I’m scared that I’m going to become increasingly irrelevant.

Because I’m not ready for our friendship to change. I shouldn’t revolve my whole world around her, and I admit that’s what’s sucking a lot of my attention. But taking that week off, shifting my focus to other areas of my life… made me realize how lonely I really feel. I barely have a life anymore. My own educational endeavors seem so far out of reach and unobtainable when I take into account where I’m at mentally, financially… University has always been so difficult for me, but seeing her, who has been dealing with similar issues these past few years, finally getting the hang of the college lifestyle, has been inspiring me while simultaneously making me kick myself for not looking at it this way sooner. I’ve wasted the 18-23 years of my life looking at school as an obstacle to what I want (a bachelor’s degree in music), as well as a pump to my inferiority complex, because all of my peers are so much better than me. They’ve got more talent, they’ve got the work ethic, they’ve got the social skills. How can I do all that when even my therapy and meds haven’t been aiding me?

I feel so pathetic. So alone. I don’t like my quirks. I don’t get how my friends like me. I’m jealous that my long-distance best friend has been getting more of what she’s always wanted through working on herself, when I can’t seem to function or reach the best of what I could accomplish before. I don’t know what happened to me. My best friend is moving on, but it also feels like she may be close to moving on from me. And I have nobody but myself to blame.",2022-11-07 02:11:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1393037669,3,/r/lonely/comments/yo9vdc/i_started_this_off_strong_but_then_started/,,0,1,"I started this off strong, but then started rambling.

Everyone dressing up and hanging out with friends and gf/bfs going to parties. You don’t think I want to put on an outfit and go out to have fun with friends whatever? Holidays suck for me for this reason. Aside from holidays I am just so sick of being lonely in general. I have two other siblings (we’re all young adults in the should be “prime of our time”) and one is always hanging out with friends and their friends beg to hang out with them all the time, and my other sibling has a bf AND friends (wonder what that’s like) and the bf hangs out with them everyday and the friends connect with them through text and also like involving them in their life and occasionally hanging out. Me on the other hand, nothing. I have no friends, I have no relationship, no one texts me or even asks how I’m doing. It is literally like I’m invisible, and when I do go out ppl just see right through me. It’s not even the end of it, I’m literally someone that ppl avoid, yeah I might look kind of intimidating bc of my face or whatever but guess what? My sibling is even less approachable than I am and yet ppl just keep going to them. It all bothers me, what else bothers me is that even the times I do go out with my sibling they LITERALLY almost every time gets hit on and asked for their number or snap whatever when I’m standing RIGHT there, literally in my face. No one pays ANY attention to me, like my sibling won’t of even tried with what they’re wearing that day and I will have put on some good outfit and yeah no, they only care about them, never me. Yes jealousy at it’s finest but I am just so sick of all this, I’m constantly just invisible whether I’m out or online, nothing. No one talks to me or even sends me a text when everyone gets all these friends and bfs and hanging out being INVITED to things. And it’s like no one even notices or cares like no one feels bad that they see me sitting at home all the time not ever having plans or never being invited to anything ever and just rotting away while both my siblings are just going out all the time. Reading this you might be like “ok well maybe you don’t have a good personality or you’re unattractive” I am nice and I portray myself with humor and interesting stuff online like through Snapchat stories whatever and when I’m out I’m nice and polite and when I’m with my sister I show personality and I look like a fun person, but again no one sees me. You would see how this is frustrating and depressing for me and this whole rant has probably made me come off in some negative way but I swear I am not just some demanding, thinks they’re special, jealous, cocky, whatever you’re thinking person.

1381,yonnjv,SaraWinter18,"I’ll try to be brief; to all the lonely hearts out there, I have a few suggestions that helped me come out of my shell that you all may find useful: 1. Learn to enjoy being alone, not saying you are going to stay alone but being happy with yourself is crucial to being happy with others, self reflection and meditation(and magic mushrooms) help a lot with this. 2. MARTIAL AAAARTS!! I don’t care if you are aggressive passive or have literally no hand eye coordination, martial arts gyms are amazing you’ll: meet new cool people who want you to succeed and we’ll happily show you techniques and how tos, you’ll get great shape(fact), you’ll gain self confidence knowing you can handle yourself, you’ll make friends with people who are equally inexperienced and you’ll get some positive discipline in your life. 3. PUNK SHOWS! punk rock is the music of the forgotten and the outcast, the Pyrrha and the rebel, you want to meet a bunch of wild and crazy people who were once loners like you? Find your nearest punk venue and become a regular; they’re cheap, high energy, good vibes and everyone’s blasted, literally the last place on earth anyone will judge you for being weird you’ll be so glad you did. 4. Find your style, whatever that is be loud proud and unapologetic, don’t worry about people being annoyed by you, if you aren’t in their face being obnoxious then let them be annoyed or weirded out who cares? We are all hairless primates spinning around on a waterlogged spaceship known as earth in infinite nothingness around a giant ball of fire, somebody thinking your hat looks stupid should not be something you concern yourself with. 5. And most important; you’re great, yes you 🫵, inside of you there is a genius that was told by the whole world they weren’t shit, fuck that, you’re awesome and as soon as YOU start to realize that others will take notice, and I know what you’re thinking “yeah you say that but you haven’t met me…” fuck you, you’re awesome and don’t shit talk yourself because the genius inside of you hears every word, you want to be dope?

1383,yoo5wz,olls_9,"Hi everyone

I’ve not been feeling great for a while now and it only seems to be getting worse. I’m starting to think I’m just becoming numb to everything in my life, and in a lot of ways, it scares me. I feel I’m becoming buried in my sadness, and although I know talking to people and trying to make connections will help, I feel more and more disconnected because of how low I feel.

I met up with someone a few days ago that I’d met online. We got on really well, had a lot in common, and will probably meet up again sometime soon. It wasn’t meeting them that caused me to feel like this, it was reflecting on the discussions we had. She was talking about all these things that she found interesting, or things she wanted to do in the future, and you could clearly see she was passionate about what she believed in. I think that’s so great to be knowledgeable and interested in things. I didn’t really have much I could say in terms of my own ideas or interests, I tended to just expand on whatever she was saying. I definitely have interests, but I’ve not been getting much enjoyment out of them recently, so I didn’t have much I wanted to say about them.

I’ve not had any friends for a while now. I moved to a new city about a year ago and I’ve struggled to make friends. I think this is why meeting this person brought up so many of these feelings, because I’m not used to meeting up with others my age and talking about common interests. To me, it highlights how different I seem to be from them. 

It just feels so wrong. I’m 22 and I don’t know what I’m doing. At my age I should have ambitions and be excited for the future, yet I’m just getting by day to day and I’m ok with that. I have moments where my dreams seem to reignite themselves and that fire seems to come back inside of me, but those moments are few and far between, and often die out quickly. I switch between wanting to work towards dreams I’ve had for years, when they seemed possible, to being happy to stay inside the house all day and do the bare minimum to get through. I don’t see a long term future for myself, because I can’t see a way out of this situation I’m in. 

I’m ftm transgender which is the cause of a lot of my problems. I’m not someone who makes a song and dance about it- I just want to be able to transition and then get on with my life with the minimum amount of people having to know that about me. I realised when I was 15, and tried to come out at 18 and was completely shut down. My family aren’t supportive, and the ones that don’t know certainly won’t be when they find out. I don’t have any friends full stop, so there’s no one who could help me. I can’t do anything about my transition until I have saved up some money, just in case I get thrown out. However being trans is stopping me doing a lot of things I want to do, and makes me just want to hide in my room and disappear.

I used to try and distract myself by focusing on my interests, or come up with an alternative idea for a route to try and get where I wanted to be. Time after time things didn’t go to plan- sometimes from my own mistakes and sometimes due to circumstances outside of my control. This has continued to happen, and now if anything good ever happens, I just assume it’s too good to be true. I think my hope has slowly died away over time to the point I now just accept things that I probably shouldn’t. There’s things I want to do, or things I want to say no to if I’m being pressured to do something by my family, but I just don’t seem to have the energy. I now just do what I’m told and go through the motions. There’s things that have happened that I know past me would have made a fuss about or refused to do entirely. Even when meeting up with the girl I met online- In the past I would’ve been super nervous and wanted to make a good impression. Yesterday I was excited to meet her, but it seemed like just another day to get through, but something different was happening. It’s hard to explain without being in my head, but for me that’s a huge shift in my thinking. 

I know the only way to get out of this rut is to take steps to solve the problems I’m having. This is an area where I’ve also noticed that I’ve changed. When I try to do anything, my motivation just goes out the window, even though deep down I know I’ll be stuck in this position longer if I don’t do something. I think gaining and maintaining healthy relationships would be a huge help, but who would want to be friends with someone who really is just a mess?

I’m sorry for the rant and thank you if you read this far. These thoughts have been in my head for a while, but I felt I needed to let them out, because it made me feel even more uneasy after that meet up the other day. If anyone else is feeling similar, please feel free to reach out, and if anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated.

I feel so so bad and lonely these days ,I only like hanging with my mother and she has work most of the days 

I wish I had friends or really anyone to talk or not feel lonely with 

I think I’m getting insane by loneliness 

Is there any way that I can feel better ?

I have ALWAYS been a big girl. My waist has never gone larger than a size 20 and the smallest I’ve been since I was in middle school was a 14. I’m current at a 16…He HATES that I’m big. He says that he loves me so much, but he’s lost his attraction to me because I gained weight during my pregnancy. I lost 40 lbs right before I got pregnant by fasting, going to the gym, eating insanely healthy, etc. which has proven difficult with a toddler. He reminds me constantly that I’m still fat and gross. He reminds me that he broke up with me for my weight before and he’s not afraid to do it again. He picks at my stomach, pinches my rolls, makes comments at bedtime, etc. 

It’s been effecting me mentally for a long time. I don’t feel comfortable wearing clothes I used to love, which he comments about. I don’t feel comfortable getting into bed without pajamas on, which he comments about. I don’t want to be intimate anymore which he makes comments about (which is a HUGE fight between us, but that’s not a story for now). 

I want so badly to want to get back into my life pre-pregnancy, but I don’t. I don’t want to bend over backwards for someone that makes me feel bad about myself.

1422,youuof,Jurez1313,"I feel so lonely and touch-starved. My skin feels ""charged"" - like there's this electricity that has nowhere to go so it's just building up. My chest feels tight and my skin feels flushed as well. I know the only way to fix this is to build some kind of relationship with someone, even if it's platonic, where there's comfort and trust with physical touch. But man, it's hard not to feel hopeless about ever finding anything remotely close to that.  

I'm just finding it so hard to think of ways to increase my level of socialization with others. Board games are stressful and I get too competitive which makes me seem too ""serious"" and not worth being friends with. Physical activity is too stressful on my body, and most times requires too much focus for socialization to be possible. (How are you supposed to have a conversation when you're completely out of breath?) Having 0 creativity means like, half the hobbies in the world are out of my grasp. I know that living my life the way I live it now will never lead to me having friends or a romantic relationship. I spent the entire weekend playing video games or helping my dad while he's on crutches. Volunteering is really just another job, and I know you're not supposed to fraternize with co-workers (not that I have the time or availability to do volunteer work, 95% of which requires availability during regular work hours, around here at least). And classes cost money that I don't have, an attention span which has never been my strong suit, and the ability and *motivation* to learn I simply don't possess.  

There's just no other way that I've ever been told or heard of to consistently interact with the same person over a period of time (which is required to build a friendship/relationship with someone). So either randomly someone starts working at my current job and we hit it off, become friends despite being co-workers, and they have a friend (or group of friends that maybe includes someone) willing to date me, or I accept the fact that I'm going to be friendless, dateless, and touch starved the rest of my life.  

I'm trying so hard not to succumb to that hopelessness. Trying so hard not to break down and hire yet another professional to hold me and comfort me. Trying so hard to think of any way to meet new people that's within my comfort zone (or close enough to it that I can cope with the anxiety and fear that comes with stepping out of it). I'm just failing, miserably, and I hate myself for how weak and lazy I am because of it. Hell, I don't even know if I believe I'm *worth* being friends with. I have a few redeeming traits (kindness, generosity, empathy, punctuality), but are they truly enough to make up for all that I'm not (interesting, attractive, fun, witty, adventurous, insightful, financially stable)?

1455,yoyu7f,2D_jc,Last time I went out with friends it was going well till we left the game and decided to go to a bar. Out of the whole group of 8 only me and another friend where single the others 6 where married couples. Anywho at the bar things are going fine until one of the girls practically revealed she was insecure and started throwing my friend under the bus. After trying to calm her down and reassure her it's fine I may have had to much to drink and lost my nerve and called her out on certain things she does when she is drunk with her homegirls since I got annoyed with her throwing my friend under the bus and well I may have said to much and I feel like I'm not wanted around anymore. I haven't talked to them since and honestly I should have just minded my own business but now I feel like the bad guy. Took forever to find a decent circle to hang with too not to mention the last girl I dated was when COVID first hit. Been feeling lonely lately but luckily there's people I like at work but once I leave my job it's just me all over again.

1458,yozcpj,WrittenEuphoria,"I know I could do more to meet people. I could try to ""leave my comfort zone"" and suffer the chest pain, sweating, awkwardness and anxiety attacks that come. I could branch out and try new hobbies despite knowing that I will suck at them, become frustrated, and not enjoy them whatsoever. I could approach strangers in the grocery store, or a coffee shop, or board game cafe and suffer the awkwardness, rejection, and even rude replies.  

But I don't see the point. The times that I *have* done these things, and actually socialized and conversed with new people, the best outcome I've been met with the is just, polite apathy. Small talk that goes nowhere. Discussing only the activity or events currently relevant and never delving deeper into personal information, emotions, beliefs, past events, future desires - you know, things actual friends talk about.  

At this point, the only conclusion I can draw is that it's me. Others at these MeetUps I have been to have no trouble making friends, it's only when I'm an active part of the conversation that things remain cordial, stiff, serious. When I observe from afar, or stay quiet, others are free to cajole, crack jokes, and exchange contact information to stay in touch. No one ever asks for mine.  

What else can I take away from that, other than I am not worth getting to know? I know I'm boring. I don't have very many, if any, interests. I spend all my time watching movies, playing video games, and endlessly scrolling through Reddit or YouTube. I haven't traveled anywhere, I don't have friends to make memories or take part in shenanigans with. I don't paint minis or DM in DnD. I can't play guitar or piano. I'm not part of a hiking group or soccer/baseball/ballsportthing club. I'm not attractive or witty. I have no idea how to flirt or talk to people without sounding incredibly awkward, nervous, or deadpan.  

So yeah, I'm not ""friend material"", let alone ""relationship material."" I'm not worth getting to know. All that I'm good for is being the guy you invite when you need an extra pair of hands to move your furniture, or the acquaintance you ask for advice when your friends are too biased, or that dude online that you might vent to in order to feel emotionally validated.

1473,yp1pz0,ColourMeFooled,"I feel like I am drowning - or like a weight is pressing on me and I can’t breathe. I don’t know how to describe it - it’s like I’m being pushed inwards from all sides. 

I cannot escape the thought that those I love hate me and want nothing to do with me. That I have alienated my friends and I am an unlovable mess.

I feel disgusted when I look at myself in the mirror - I question who could love me. I look at myself and think that the world would be better off if I was dead. I don’t know if everyone is expecting me to be something, but I feel like I am unable to be anything.

I fear that I have driven everyone away and I am destined to be alone, but I don’t know how or why. 


I realised today that I don’t know in my heart of hearts how it feels to be loved.
I feel so alone. I don’t want anyone to be afraid for me, or pity me, but I just want to feel like I matter to someone or anyone. 

I can’t stand it. I’m hurt and afraid and I have just cried into my own dinner.  This is the lowest I have felt in years. I don’t really know what set this off. I guess I have been feeling like this for a few weeks now - the creeping loneliness that came with having more time in the day now is a reality. I see that I have nothing, no one.

I couldn’t even eat more than 3 bites of dinner, my chest felt so tight. What have I done to deserve feeling like this? 

I have to go in to work tomorrow and nobody will know. I will have to pretend like I am okay even though I don’t know how to breathe anymore.

I want to be loved, for being me. I want someone to say I care about you and love you no matter what. Why can’t I be loved? Why can’t I love myself?

I’m starting to think I will die alone, and unloved. I think I have to learn to accept that but I don’t know how to start (or even if I can).

1497,yp58hg,fake_friends_please,"So I thought it'd go horrible. I barely slept (by my standards) , and I thought I'd do terrible at my job which requires socializing. But I did fine, and had plenty of pleasant and productive interactions. First good thing.

Then I caught up on math homework. Well, almost. But it's a lot further than I normally am, and I feel relieved. So relieved that I'm just gonna fuck around on d2 tonight after dinner instead of worrying about school.

I did pretty well on my Chen test, I think. I barely studied and went in expecting a c, but I had to have gotten at least a b. I wouldn't be surprised at a high a, feel like I only really didn't know like 2 questions. So that was really great. Plus I was in a good mood by that point and had Driving My Love by Anri in my head the entire time, which made it even more fun than usual. (I genuinely love taking tests)

And for the main event, I had a great shift at work with my crush and my favorite guy coworker. I went away not feeling like they hate me or anything! It was fun and light, and I even had the courage and nonchalance to compliment my crush's clothes a couple times. And she talked to me like I was human and I got to make her laugh a couple times. So that was fun, my head is still kinda swimming with dull warmth from that.

And to top it all off, it was cold AND dark on my walk home thanks to DST. My two favorite conditions for walking. The world is so much prettier when the sun isn't glaring in your eyes and beating down on your back, making you sweat. There's even a fullish moon out. Very pretty, 10/10

some years ago i used to be the class clown, always making jokes and disrespecting every adult just to make everyone laugh due to not having enough attention at home. it kinda solved my emptyness for a long time, but this year i feel like something changed in me... i still make all these things, but some seconds after it i start to think abt it and regret it. i don't want to do it but I can't hold it. i laugh, i smile, i play w my friends, i look happy at school, but when I get home and feel the silence pierce into my head, i just don't want to talk, i just go into my room and stay there all night, bc i know that if I go out to the kitchen or just face my mom in the house, I'll get into an argument w her. I've been struggling w lack of anger control, and when i argue i spit everyrhing I'm feeling out of my mouth... and i don't like to do it. when i go to bed i can't sleep bc i start overthinking if I'm a good friend, if they really like me, if it is my fault that this is all happenin... and sometimes I just say ""i don't have depression, I'm to young for that... maybe it's just the lack of attention that makes me feel like this""... and sometimes these thoughts come into my head during school and i just stay quiet thinking abt it, and everyone starts asking me if I'm ok and i just answer ""yes, i am"" but actually i have a lot to say.

1527,yp9est,[deleted],"Why the fuck is it so hard to make friends on here (Reddit)? I can't help but feel part of it is because I'm male and apparently all guys are creeps. I know that's old crap but when that shit started circulating around in other friend making subreddits it became rather upsetting knowing I could be ignored or avoided because someone else decided to be a fucking pervert. I feel like another reason is because people expect to get a good read on a person within a matter of seconds. Do people real treat making friends like dating? Both of those things take time or maybe I just don't understand because I'm use to taking my time getting to know people rather than speed run making friends.

People also don't seem to have the attention span to read all of what I type in those posts either. I only type shit up about me so maybe someone sees that I like Pokemon, for example, and they like Pokemon too so maybe they could start the conversation about Pokemon and maybe then that could lead into other things like video games or something else but no. All this does is remind me how much I fucking hate how MySpace took a fucking shit and how that asshole took down the social media element of VampireFreaks. Almost all of my other options have been shut down or ruined.

I also don't care to socialize with people in my town I just don't and haven't for a long time. I've wrote them all off as nosy assholes and it's a small town wouldn't surprised me one bit if they are nosy. I'm also never in Chicago long enough to make friends plus going there and back always jet lags my ass despite going by car.

I just really hate how it's literally impossible to make friends on this site and how all my options are gone and all the new options suck. Facebook is trash, Twitter is shit and shittier now that the bigot with hair plugs owns it, TikTok is literally for stupid kids trying to act cool, Snapchat is stupid as hell, Discord is basically Skype but isn't owned by Microsoft and fuck voice chatting. It takes a long time to get me to voice chat and I'd have to be very close with that person to even voice chat them. Oh, and I almost forgot, fuck Instagram it's owned by Facebook.

I'm just hopeless about it all and seriously in need of therapy but reluctant because I plan on switching insurance. On top of that I fear my current insurance won't be accepted and worst of all have to explain why my medical card is cut the fuck up. I cut it up when I found out my eye doctor won't take my medical card but I had seen him before and it was fine. I fucking hate living in America. I also want to scream from the depths of my lungs out loud how much I hate this country. As I said in another post **a lot** of shit has been building up in the last almost two years and I feel it.

All I want is to have a few decent friends who will be understanding, there for me and me there for them, have a good time and laugh about silly shit on the internet like memes or something, and share interests but nope that is asking for too much.",2022-11-08 03:06:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/yp9est/why_just_why/,,0,3,Why?

and I don’t know how to get help from them.

they rely on me for bills, to help out and im trapped. they can’t know im weak, they need me as a pillar, but im tired. i want to fall to my knees, i want to give into that temptation, the sweet taste of death, relief. nights like these I wonder how much is left in my hourglass, when will my empathic self be selfish and finally pull that trigger that lies under my bed, tie that rope hidden in the closet, revisit that train station. maybe I’d hope someone would stop me.

M, why do you only speak to me when it’s convenient for you? I’m nothing but a free ride, someone you use as a therapist, someone who’ll treat you if you can’t afford it. I have dropped everything and drove hours just to pick you up when you were upset so why can’t I just get a “how are you feeling” once in a while? 

B, I don’t even know what to say. You’re so wrapped up in your own life which is something I can’t blame you for. You say your mom doesn’t let you go out and all of that but you’re constantly out with your boyfriend. I’m not asking to see you as much as you do him but an ounce of your time would mean more to me than you could ever imagine. 

At the end of the day they probably don’t know I feel this way. In their eyes everything’s normal and the three of us are still as close as ever.

I'm slowly turning into a recluse with an annoying back pain. I do remember some moments like talking non stop and actually being comfortable talking to her about anything. 

I miss the good mornings and good nights, my god I wonder what it's like again. Just this morning I was feeling fine but I guess the loneliness comes in waves.

I think I will be alone for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll be fine with it, but I just can't seem to build connections anymore or maybe I couldn't bring myself to try.

I think I'm broken, like not in a cringe poetic way but in a fucked up way that everything I do I criticize myself.

Like, what else is out there for me really?
Man, I do hope that a few years from now I look back and laugh at how miserable I was because I figured it out and got my life in order including my dating life.

But man, seeing as how things are, I think I'm just riding the waves hoping for some miracle to happen to me because I got tired of trying. I've seen people live lonely lives till the end, in fact I've been surrounded by them growing up, it's kind of funny that I'll end up the same way.

I just wish I could have another chance at happiness. Maybe this time I'll help make it work.

1596,ypk3s3,LionLucky3767,"I'm a 34 year old woman who is also a full time caregiver for my parents. I quit working in 2015 to take care of my dad, my mum then became severely disabled very quickly. So now i look after both on my own since covid hit and carers were sent away. I have only left the house a handful of times since that first day of lockdown. I have no one to help or turn to.

Caring isn't even that bad, doing it on my own isn't that bad. Not having anyone to talk to makes it worse.

Until last night i had someone, met him here on reddit. He met me when i was at my lowest and cared, showed me that someone could care about me and think i was attractive. We talked for hours every day, progressed to calls and he re-ignited an interest in gaming and we spent hours gaming together. Even bought an xbox so we could find games to play together easier.

I fell for him and he said he fell for me. We'd both been cheated on in past and confessed our feelings for each other, told him i loved him. Last few weeks he has been distant, hardly available outside of gaming, leaving me on read for hours. His home life had become stressful and he hasn't been feeling the best so i supported him best i could. His sexual interest in me dropped.

Last night i found out he has been dm'ing girls here on reddit, flirting with them although he maintains it wasn't flirting. Nevertheless it was the one specific thing i had asked him not to do, and he asked the same of me. I kept my promise and he didn't.

I haven't slept since. He hasn't taken responsibility or said sorry. I know our romantic relationship is over, and im back to being lonely.

He made me think i was worth loving, that i was enough. Now i feel like nothing.

All those horrible things i think about myself are true, ill never be good enough to be someones only interest. Never be worth a true relationship. I don't know why i let myself believe that i was.

I have nothing to offer anyone, i am alone, no job or career, caregiving requires me to be at home and he was the one person i could talk to. My friends all dropped off after i stopped working. 

I really fucking miss having someone to share the day with and my interests with. 

Im so sick of being lonely.

So sick of not talking to anyone for so long that i wonder if my speech has been affected.

So sick of not being enough.

Hi folks,

There    are lots of lovely folks on here, but every post I've read through    seems to be on the lookout for something very different from what I'm    seeking.

Loneliness has been a    theme throughout my life, has led me to attempt suicide at one point,    and recently I got so lonely that I spent an immense amount of money    (despite being far from rich) flying overseas to meet up with someone    who I'd only met a couple of times over a decade ago, simply because    they were kind to me when we met in a way that nobody else has been    since.

Most people on this sub    seem to be looking for an online friendship or a gaming partner, but    I've never really played video games and I don't have that much interest    in online friendship. I really need someone to meet up with in actual    real life.

I have a reasonable    sense of humour but can't be described as a particularly open or jolly    person. Topics I'd like to discuss are loneliness, depression,    bitterness, rage, self-loathing, crippling laziness, and other such    pleasant themes. I'm also interested in magic mushrooms, religion,    cycling, psychogeography, literature and right-of-centre politics.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex",2022-11-08 12:16:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637781360,7,/r/lonely/comments/ypkf6k/male_38_uk_looking_for_a_friend/,,0,3,"Male, 38, UK, looking for a friend"

Any human with a bit of critical thinking will know that usually your dreampartner wont stand in front of your door, but that it requires actual input from you.
Sure, some people might have so much luck that they meet people ""by destiny""

But for people like me who sit at home most of their time, active work is required. 
Sure it can seem like and endless task, but I guarantee as long as you dont give up you will find whatever you search for sooner or later.

2020 me has it I don't care about how other people thought of me. I feel like a brick wall in 2020 because I was healing from unrequited love back then. I was brash, irrational, unhinged perhaps back in 2020. 2022 was when I understood people better and helped myself to jump out of that depressive state of mine.

Hobbies can't help what I feel, not even all the games I once played. I can't even last an hour playing the games I played.

Anxiety has filled my brain to the brim with doubts, and seeking for company and/or love made it worse. I always feel that I want to throw up whenever I am attending in-person classes in uni.

""You are deserving of someone better.""

""You are a good soul and I can't bear to see you be hurt.""

All of these words and some I did not mention feel like scripted to me. All comes to my mind was that I was never enough to be a friend nor a potential romantic partner. I never felt being important or wanted in someone's life

All other people I consider as friends have relationship and/or career commitments, and I can't help myself being at the short end of the stick in life.

I just want to see my life for the better, and I will keep on going strong even if this world wants me to be down so bad. I just can't help myself way back then in 2020.

But anyways I got rejected in 8th grade by my crush and I was just sad and lonely cuz of the pandemic. But I got out of it the first thing I did was reconnect with people after doing that my friends that I’ve been friends with convinced me to download snap (if you are a teenager who is down bad download snap like literally I get so many compliments). Once I did that I joined a sport and made so many new friends on top of the same people. I got into better shape and learned how to flirt I also cut my hair and made it better.

To never hear that person say they love you again, to never hold them in your arms, to never confide in them again. 

It ended without warning, so quickly I barely had time to register it.

This is somebody that knew me inside and out, knew all my fears and traumas. And despite that, treated me this way in the end. Somebody so aware of how they treated others, so aware of the awful ways they had their heart broken.

And they did that to me.

I haven’t been able to think clearly, I’m just so fucking confused. This is not the same person I fell in love with, the person who comforted me and loved me and wanted me to be happy. This was a selfish, rude, dismissive person who simply wanted to cut ties and walk away unscathed.

I feel as if a huge weight is being lifted off my shoulders. I had an awful nervous breakdown recently, and I'm hoping to recover from it. I want my old life back. Here are a few things I hope to work on:

\- Gay Nihilism; in the gay community, it's really easy to fall into a nihilistic mindset. After all, we aren't given a clear path in life like straight people, we often have to create our own. I find this overwhelming and often turn to booze, drugs, and sex to cope. I hope to create a realistic plan of what life can look like for myself.

\- PTSD; I have been diagnosed with PTSD which I am on SSRIs to treat. I somethings still get flashbacks and panic attacks over it. I was SA Twice in my teen years. I still bear the scars from those horrific experiences. The attack also had a racialized element to it, he called me anti-Asian racial slurs, so I would like to heal from that.

\- Masculinity; Like many gay men, I carry the anxiety with my sense of masculinity. I often felt as if I needed to separate myself from the boys to protect myself against homophobia. I grew up during the 2000s, a time when calling someone ""gay"" was the worst thing you could say about someone. However, I quite like masculine things, sports, going to the gym, tattoos, and motorcycles. I often feel like I wasted too many years hiding my true self out of fear of homophobia. Truth is, I wanna feel more comfortable in my masculinity and do more stereotypical ""guy"" things.

\- Victim complex; I have a victim complex. I find it comforting. So often, I feel that the oppression I experience is denied that I end up overcompensating. As mentioned above, I have an experience with violence. However, I do not want to identify as a victim. I want to be able to recognize the pain and move on. I don't wanna feel defined by the worst moments of my life. I'd like better resilience skills to deal with all the racist and homophobic microaggressions I experience. Sometimes, I get so exhausted just from having to go through the day carrying all that angst.

\- Opening up; I don't know how to open up. My default on dealing with stress is to suppress it. Emotions, suppress them. It's really messing up any ability to cultivate a meaningful connection with others. I have many close friends, but I can't seem to open up myself to the idea of a serious romantic relationship with anyone. I just shut down.- Conflict skills; I have trouble handling conflict with others. Any extreme emotions (sadness, anger, stress) that others through at my and I just shut down. I can't handle other people's drama. Unfortunately, this makes problem-solving really difficult. I wanna be able to work in groups and with others better, without feeling constantly overwhelmed by others' emotional dumping.

\- Executive Functions; Recently, my executive functions day to day skills have collapsed. Work is too much. School is too much. Socializing is too much. Chores are too much. I am filled with crippling depression. I want my old life back. I want the ability to be to do simple tasks without feeling as if my entire body is aching is stressful pain.

\- Grief; I carry a lot of grief. I have a lot of close friendships with other guys that had strong homoerotic undertones. To me, these friendships were super special. I often struggle with letting go of them. I can't help but think ""What if?"". I get filled with grief when I feel on social media years later that they came out of the closet. I wanna be able to recognize this grief and process it.

\- Racism; I experience a lot of casual structural racism and often feel gaslighted by society. I feel like my history isn't properly respected in the way it should be. I see the injustice that many Black and Indigenous folks experience in my country (Canada) and I'm filled with rage. I'm hoping to be able to channel my pain into something productive. As well as to learn how to properly name the pain I feel.

\- Adulthood; It's really difficult being a young person entering adulthood these days. The economy is weird, I don't know what the future looks like, so many young people my age hold very doomer views. I wanna be able to have a healthy mindset on growing up. Right now, everything feels so scary and I feel so fragile. I just can't seem to handle everything. I wanna be able to grow up without feeling like a Peter Pan kid.

Anyways, that's what I'm hoping to accomplish. Is anyone else with experience in trauma I'd love to hear from you. Please keep the replies polite, as I am in a hypersensitive state at the moment. Wish me luck on my healing journey.",2022-11-09 05:34:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661214028,0,/r/lonely/comments/yq9rdw/going_to_therapy_any_advice/,,0,0,Going to Therapy. any advice?

I deleted the dating app I had because I was tired of all the taken men on the app.

And the funniest part is I’m no longer even actively dating. I posted about how for some reason I keep attracting men that are not single, and I have no idea why. I’m literally just existing, and then here comes some dude trying to hit on me and come to find out he is married or has a girlfriend. 

This happened again just last night where someone in a place I frequent has been chatting me up a lot, flirting, told me I was their type, and another friend mentioned their wife. The guy never even brought it up. 

I feel like I’m spiraling. This is exhausting. These people have their partners and they’re being fucking GREEDY. There are some of us who are completely single and alone and are struggling to find a decent person to spend our time with, and you have a SO or life partner and STILL want more. Like what the fuck.

This is just so fucked. So not only can I not find someone, because everyone i seem to find attractive ends up being already taken, but then I am scared to date because I’ll be damned if I’m with someone that is out in the streets acting single while I think I’ve found a partner.

But as the time goes on more and more leave Im not really sure why or what Im doing wrong. Im not that type of person that likes to brag about stuff going on in life but this time I feel empty and alone. Every day I wake up I have nothing to be excited about and Im scared (sidenote: I have both parents and we are lower middle class in terms of money or how to say it) basically I have a great life altogether but i still feel alone. Is someone here who feels the same way or understand what Im going through right now. Im aware people live in far worse conditions and I had this mindset my whole life and I still do and know this but even though I cant help supress my feelings and be happy because I have what I have.
More info why I think I dont have friends if you are interested&gt;&gt;

Since I came to new school I managed to make a few friends in class as i was funny (atleast I think) and very positive person. I have met a friend whose name I dont want to use because I dont want them to find this arcicle but lets call him Joe. Joe and I were like super best friends everywhere where I got invited Joe went with me and also the other way around when he got invited I went basically we were 2in1 package we had a great friednship even when I got a girlfriend I tried to make time also for him(house party etc.) After a longer period whole class was a great collective and we got along very well and went on alot vacations and holidays together. Basically very good firends. One night in 2-3 grade in middle school we went to night club and we got drunk. And me and my girl classmate got a little too close to each other at that time she was my girl best friend you could say. And you could guess what 2 drunk people alone sharing a bed would do. Im still angry at myself i let that happen and its not an excise I was drunk. After that night she hates me to this day and I gave her anxiety attacks (atleast thats what her friends told me) so from that day the whole class separated into 2 groups well basically 3-those who liked me and were my friednds Joe was in this group. Group taht hated me that was mainly girl classmates and people who gave 0 f*cks about that whole situation. Very shortlx after that quaranteen from covid hit us. Since Im only one who lives out the town I study in I was only audiocalling them and we got a bit separated. After covid had ended we were still friends with that half of the class but we have been split into 2 classes now before we were one. Joe and others-the friedly group were in one class and I was put with the girls to the other. So every break i had to go to their class. After some time Joe found a girlfriend and he fell in love which is beautiful but we have been separated even more becuse sicne we were not classmates only time we spend time together during school week was after school when we went together to bus station. But after he got girlfriend she waited for him outside the school everytime so he wanted to be alone with her which i respect but we didnt spend any time together than. A few months had passed and he broge up with her. I was not happy but in a was yes since finally i had my buddy back. We still werent classmates. At that time whole other class started to have distance with me and i thought it was because we were not classmates and basiccly we or they didnt have time during the breaks to sped some time also with me. Joe than started to have relationship and still has with one of his classmates so again we were not friends basically but the first time i got his class as my friends and now i dont not even them and i was not sure why. I started being slone and sad i have ni time to spend with friends. After a few months of being alone one guy from that flass aproached me and told me someone has told him thst i started to make gossips about that class. I was confused because i didnt talk to anyone that year bacally. So someone has been lying about me and made my friends into my enemies and I was not sure who and why would someone want to do this. And i still dont know why but i know who. It was Joe. And from that moment till now it has been another half a year since i have been tottaly alone. 
And thats the story i know its not bad but i just cant help my feelings of betrayl and sadness
If you got here thank you for yyour time please leave how you feel after reading this and maybe help me make thing with them right. Have a great day😊

1787,yqimsu,fake_friends_please,"Ew ew ew literally just woke up from a nightmare. Crush was in a relationship with my favorite guy coworker, and I had to pretend I was happy for them even though it was killing me. The dream's over, but the emotions are still with me. This is why people get upset at their spouses for how they they behaved in their dreams, isn't it? It feels terrible, the sadness was so real. It wasn't even just sadness, I actually was planning to jump out a plane, no chute (how I've wanted to die for ages) . I even tried being pathetic in public as a cry for help, and they didn't care. Really scary.

OK, its just a dream. Its not real. You have no idea whether your crush even has a partner, let alone if its a coworker. She's never once talked about having a partner, not even on her tiktok. But even if she does, she doesn't have to have that control over you. You dont have to let her choices make you wanna die. Dont hitch your wagon to her choices, have your own reason for living aside from her. She's relatively mentally well anyways, she wouldn't want a pathetic person who has no will to live outside of her. You aren't worthy of her attention or affection so long as you remain this pathetic . You may be sick, but you're commanded right now to be well if you ever want to be with her.

1788,yqirdq,ParanoidFury,"Cliché warning. In the beginning of 2020-2021 (I’ve lost track of time at this point) I was seeing this girl that I was basically infatuated with. We’ve been going out, things were heading in the right direction, but I was very wrong. 

We were friends for a very long time and it ended in us going our desperate ways, because I just couldn’t stand the thought of her being with someone else. I’ve been hurting because of loss of a good friend, even the best friend, for a long time. 

I moved on just a few months ago. This time has been socially so bad for me. Didn’t meet any replacement, just living the average life. And here I am today falling asleep after I had to do something very early in the morning. 

I was driving my car back home. Matter of fact to my old home, which is kinda funny. In front of me there is a woman on a Harley, a purple road king. Hell of a machine and didn’t look womanly at all, I kid you not. Lights turn green and she drives off and suddenly crashes. I stopped my car and ran to help her out, she was fine. Helped her out collecting fallen pieces of the bike and waited with her for a friend or parents to come and pick her up. As it was getting colder we went to a local pub and got to hang out for a while. The flow of conversation was great and I felt like I could try to get her number. We seemed to have a lot of common ground. Then her parents came around and picked her up, her friend came along soon after.

So I was going back to my car and this friend of the girl too and I realized I forgot to ask her for a number or even a name. I asked her friend to give me her number and as I was typing her name, Karia,  into my phone, I woke up.

And now i feel like shit, having realized for how long I haven’t felt like this.",2022-11-09 13:17:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567955831,4,/r/lonely/comments/yqirdq/i_just_realized_how_lonely_i_am_because_of_a_dream/,,0,1,I just realized how lonely I am… because of a dream

1791,yqjp0v,Ohboysomiserable,"Basically I've been friendless for the last 8 years, without anyone to talk to, and most of the Times I tried to reach out to someone they were just making excuse or I was left on read. I could turn my phone for like 1 year, then turn it back on, and have 0 messages or calls. So 9 months ago I decided to start therapy, and she seemed beyond perfect, she was the only person I enjoyed talking to, and was always looking forward to meeting her. I suffer from really serious depression, and can't really believe someone could care about me to save my life. She made me feel like I mattered, but yesterday I had an appointment at a new psychiatrist(they work in the same building), and like few days ago I sent her an email where I told her I'm really suicidal, and it's getting more hard to deal with. She didn't reply, but told about it to my psychiatrist, and they decided that I should go to a hospital, cause they don't really know how to help me. Later that Day I had a talk with my t, and told her I don't wanna go there, as I'm scared of that, and I don't really think it's gonna help me cause all I really need is to finally feel loveable. So she told me she's gonna call my mom to get her to persuade me to go to a hospital. My mom said she doesn't want me to go either, and my t got mad and said:So who's gonna be hold accountable if he hurts himself?. Tommorow I should be seeing my therapist, but still didn't get any call if I'm gonna show up, and they always do a day before. As my therapist said to my mom, she doesn't really see any point in me seeing her anymore, and the only solution is mental ward, which I strongly disagree with. All I ever needed was to feel cared for, and it seems she's ghosting me right now, and is not even gonna give me any explanation why she doesn't wanna see me anymore. Fuck the fact she wasn't even suppossed to talk to my mom, cause I'm an adult, and she told about all emails I've ever sent to her. So long story short:She's scared I'm gonna off myself, so she decided to stop talking to me, without asking what I plan on doing. After I had a talk with my t, she went to tell about it to my psychiatrist, which she told my mom. I don't know what they talked about, but it seems like my t doesn't know the word CONFIDENTIALITY. It seems like she can tell the whole world what I'm saying to her. Never felt so hurt by anyone in my life. I trusted her, and like seeing her, and it seems like I was just a nobody to her.",2022-11-09 13:56:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667917212,13,/r/lonely/comments/yqjp0v/i_got_literally_no_one_to_talk_to_and_it_seems/,,0,16,"I got literally no one to talk to, and it seems like I got dumped by my therapist."

1806,yqnsn4,Slaying_Salty,"I joined this sub so that I wouldn't feel so alone - that the emotions I felt did not make me an anomaly. I came to this subreddit hoping to find people who could empathize with my plight, and I could do the same for them. This was supposed to be an online, makeshift haven for those who struggled with building relationships, be they romantic, platonic, familial, or otherwise.

But no. Instead, from the multiple posts that have been made on this subreddit, it's very clear that this group has only allowed anonymous users to prey on the emotionally and mentally vulnerable. *Especially* women.

The second a woman comes here to post a rant in the hopes of receiving advice or understanding, instead they get their messages flooded with offers to sext.

It's disgusting. There are other subreddits out there that are more appropriate for that kind of thing. 

It's frankly absurd. But unsurprising. Historically, women try and open themselves up only to be used during their moments of crisis and end up worse than before.

I don't expect those creeps to feel remorse. Or shame.

But I urge the moderators of this subreddit to fight back against this.

I don't know if it's perfect, but users who have posted here should be allowed to defend themselves.

Perhaps they can post screenshots of those anonymous users messaging them, their usernames and profile pictures plain to see. These users, for the sake of clarity and evidence, could also perhaps submit the posts that attracted said unwelcome creeps.

It's not perfect. And it's not foolproof. But please, for the sake of those who came here looking for understanding only to find themselves feeling unsafe, I ask that we *do* something about this.

Edit: I'm also not surprised by how some of the comments lack basic decency and empathy.

My immediate family: borderline abusive and haven't spoken with them in a month

Extended family: No chance to see them without seeing my immediate family

College clubs: I feel like an outsider save for one senior who actually seems to care

Roommates: this is the reason I'm posting this, I actually thought I had become friends with them and we were getting along well, my two other suite mates would even complain about the other roomate to me, to which I would say hey he's not so bad etc... But I came back to my dorm today, and someone had ripped off my name tag leaving the other 3, the day after they had all been replaced. I just feel like shit now, another group of people who cast me aside. It's not like I'm not putting in an effort, I just feel like people use me and toss me aside, or events happen out of my control to pull other people away from me. It's like the universe wants me to be alone.",2022-11-09 19:20:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594685156,1,/r/lonely/comments/yqsnx1/why/,,0,0,Why?

1829,yqtoyp,Yuris1492,"In 2019 my life changed courses when I found out I was going to be a mom. Unfortunate events occurred soon after that meant I’d also be an only parent. I knew that I wanted to make a life change in order to be present for my daughter. I made a plan that we would expatriate around my daughter’s first birthday. I wanted to immerse our lives in childhood wonder as well as different charitable endeavors for her to experience. I wanted her to take in the world and experience things from different perspectives &amp; have beautiful, meaningful memories.

That was the plan until right before I had my daughter, when I found out that someone I regard as my best (&amp; only) friend, who is like a mother, was diagnosed with dementia. She (I’ll call her K) is the closest person to me in the world.

– In 2008 an accident occurred while I was having surgery, a scalpel was left inside and I almost died, twice. This caused me to suffer neurological damage. The long-term result for me is that I suffer from communication disconnects, it’s hard for me to speak and understand language correctly without having visual cues. I have to be able to speak to another person face to face, &amp; situations like phone calls are hard (&amp; embarrassing). I wasn't far out of high school when this happened &amp; it was beyond hard. I became an extreme introvert &amp; learned at a young age that the people who say they’ll always be there for you are the first to leave when things get hard. K was the first person I met in my life that viewed me for who I was, nothing else. She helped me through this &amp; showed me that not all people are so selfish &amp; quick to abandon. So, when K got this news, there was no way I could still leave. -

About six years before this, during a time when K had gotten very sick and was worried her cancer was returning, she listed me as the acting agent in her medical directive and her durable power of attorney. We trusted one another immensely with the other's wishes &amp; everything else. I also already knew her personal preferences, expressions, comfort measures, ins &amp; outs with her medical history, etc. She loved her family (siblings) very much, but they had families &amp; weren’t the type to go out of their way; something I experienced firsthand with my own family.

As far as my long-term plans, even though I am young in comparison, I have no interest in being in another relationship; choosing instead to be committed to my daughter. Engaging in a relationship would mean compromising that to some degree &amp; I refuse to do that or to force her to accept a man she doesn’t know to be a part of her life. Therefore, I promised K I would be there for her and take care of her, that we would combat this together &amp; find an answer &amp; she wouldn’t have to handle things life was throwing at her alone.

K progressed so quickly that I unexpectedly had to move in with her shortly after recovering from having my daughter. This was right as Covid was really hitting so we knew a move wouldn’t come quickly, I was in the market to purchase a home, deciding to put the majority of my savings into somewhere that we could call home and make our own that was closer to the school I planned for my daughter to attend.

K’s sister owned one of the big real estate agencies in this town and her nephew was an agent there, so that is who was being used to find our new home. I also invested in &amp; expanded my business from home, which, along with my writing, was also going great. -  So that was life. I was glad that I had someone to celebrate my daughter’s milestones with &amp; felt the greatest sense of purpose. I was happy &amp; life felt right for about a year and a half. Then things fell apart.

K has a brother, (who we’ll call M), that has spent most of his life on the road for work. For some reason they didn’t see eye-to-eye regarding something in the distant past and they had been estranged from one another for 3+ years. Upon learning of her condition, he calls and expresses wanting to fix things &amp; connect with his sister again. My job was to take care of K, not control her life, so when she said yes that was the answer. 

I spoke with M on a regular basis for about 2 months before he came for an overnight visit. When we spoke, he would thank me over and over for what I was doing by caring for his sister, he cried with me when things would get hard watching my best friend fade away &amp; he even prayed with me; but this still didn’t change the fact that I didn’t know this man, so during his visit I planned to go 10 minutes away to my parent’s. I just don’t believe it’s a smart thing for any single mother to spend the night under the same roof with a man she isn’t related to &amp; doesn’t know. This would also give them personal time without being intruded by a toddler who always wanted to do what K/her Nana was doing.

Before leaving I gave K a big hug, she whispered she was nervous &amp; I could tell it. Due to Covid and having to quarantine longer than most because of her &amp; my daughter’s immune systems, we hadn’t spent one minute away from each other the entire year and a half &amp; thought this mixed with her deteriorating mind wasn’t cause for alarm. I whispered back that I would be very close, just to call me if things felt off. She shook her head, backed up, looked at me and said, “I want my girls back home tomorrow. You are coming back, right?” I told her of course in the most bubbly way I could to lift her spirits, and told her goodnight.

This is the last time I saw K.

He abducted her from her home that evening. I later watched security &amp; saw he did this by telling her I called &amp; he couldn’t hear me, but I sounded distraught &amp; that they needed to find me. He took her phone out of her purse &amp; rushed her out of the door. Where he took her; what happened after that is hard to tell, but I know she was manipulated by her own family to play a part in her own robbery at the expense of her already fragile mind &amp; emotions by someone who should have possessed a natural desire to protect her.

When I learned of this I did what I think anyone would, I called the authorities and planned to file a missing person report for a vulnerable individual; something that should have been an all-hands-on-deck priority. However, when the officer arrived at our home that I had already rushed back to, something different played out. I told the officer what had happened and showed her some footage and all the legal documentation containing her long-ago made wishes, only to be told that “a family member voids K’s POA, as well as all other legal paperwork”. I’m not ignorant, I knew right away that was a lie and tried to politely tell her that she was wrong &amp; urged her to call the attorney that the Sheriff’s office employs for just this reason. She got loud, acted offended &amp; ultimately told me to screw-off that I didn’t have a badge, she did, &amp; I was the one who didn’t know anything.

I wasn’t allowed to file a missing person’s report, or even a general police (this time or the others report about the events. Distraught &amp; massively confused at how this was happening, I returned to my parent’s home to receive help with my daughter while I searched for what to do next. I continually called M as well, but never got an answer. Early the next day, I get a notification and I see him pulling back up without K. He breaks in and starts loading whatever he wants into his vehicle. I immediately call the Sheriff’s office who tells me that someone is on the way &amp; to stay where I’m at until I see that an officer arrive. Time passes and when I see he’s loading up our hidden safes. I called again. I’m told this time that “Yeah, that’s the address from last night, you’ve already been told that you’re not going to receive assistance from us. As if talking on the phone enough to be understood wasn’t hard enough, this is when I start getting interrupted, even laughed at on the phone by two dispatch officers. I ended up watching, helpless, as he took everything he wanted, his own sister's money (over 100k in cash), everything I’ve ever worked for, all of my daughter’s things, including her birth money and even her toys. He finally answers my call and immediately starts to vividly threaten my life, even going so far as to word that he will ""orphan my daughter"".

Between this time and now, I have done all I can think of. I’ve personally gone up to the Sheriff’s Office. Every time I am sympathized with, told that an investigation is starting or that “we’ll be on this right away”, then nothing ever happens. I even retained an attorney, yet once I paid in full he went from “this is ridiculous, I’ll have this fixed in no time” to stopping communication with me. I’ve sent over 2,000 emails and even contacted the media who was going to do a huge story about the Sheriff’s Office refusing to assist me or to recognize legal, valid documents, including my lease showing I had every right to call that our home &amp; we had been robbed, only to then be refused assistance &amp; therefore, our rights. I was contacted before it came out &amp; the journalist told me he was so sorry, but he wouldn’t tell me why. The article had been forced down to a generic story about disputes &amp; the aging “boomer population”. Even in this article it’s admitted that they forced an illegal self-eviction on us. I finally was able to find 1 person willing to represent us, but he said I would have to file that I was taking K to court &amp; suing her for breach of contract, because “tort law litigation will cost you $20k minimum”. ***I refuse to do things this way, I refuse to drag her &amp; her fragile mind through undeserved proceedings and be a part of her abuse when she is the victim as well. - That's just not right! If this means I will never see justice or have what is mine returned, then so be it. I won’t compromise my values and beliefs for any reason. I have to live with myself.***

In the midst of all of this I learned that our security system was accessed, and we were watched and recorded us for months; this is something I've verified through the company Wisenet. That means he has footage of my young daughter; this is something that is slowly killing me. I’m supposed to be her protector! – Why are we undeserving of the same protections as the rest of the population?

At one point I thought I would be able to get my daughter’s Christmas presents and that he was going to start cooperating. This was a lie &amp; in the end I was only able to strangely get a few boxes of random items. In this, he had put chemicals that burned me into a shampoo bottle. This burned my scalp &amp; where the suds came into contact with my face. In the panic of pain, it came into contact with my lower gums &amp; ate the tissue away. The root of my front tooth is now exposed, and I stay in pain. M’s son was my real estate agent, so my life savings was also stolen. – I had been shown a house just days before this all happened.

What I came to learn was this all was a fraud, a ruse, a scam, a scheme. I was told information after these acts that lead me to presume this was done to get control of &amp; steal K’s money by her own selfish siblings. Where I failed was in my choice/area to be transparent, as one would think everyone should be by telling them of the power of attorney &amp; other details in our life. I always was truthful with them. Their actions were fueled by their own unnecessary fear that by caring for her I was somehow secretly gaining from my best friend which then resulted in the illegal intervention, hijacking &amp; destruction of our lives. Maybe it was just to steal my savings, or perhaps they knew she kept over $100k+ in cash? I don't know for sure. But they would eventually learn I had no idea K was a very wealthy multi-millionaire until after this happened. Why? Because I never turned that power of attorney into any financial institutions or did anything financial. If I would have it would have felt too much like giving up on her recovering, which I wasn’t anywhere near considering. That POA sat in a file, the same as it did from day one. I had performed tireless research &amp; had just found &amp; seen K accepted into a breakthrough drug trial that was a perfect match as if it were tailored to her exact needs. She was accepted but hadn’t yet started and the intake nurse would frequently ask her “how it felt to be a part of the 1st breakthrough medicine of its kind”. In my heart I was going to see my best friend return to herself &amp; no one could make me believe otherwise.

Even if I'd known about her money, I wouldn’t have cared. I grew up in one of the wealthiest households in my childhood home state. This is fact her family knew nothing of, &amp; one that shouldn’t have mattered. My biological father owns a chain of doctors’ offices, open MRI offices &amp; pharmacies, but he was abusive &amp; controlling. My life with wealth had been miserable and when I turned of age I was given a choice: 1. Do what my father said, walk his straight line, oust my mother and siblings, continue to live with him, do as he said without question and let him plan out my education, or 2. Give him back everything and get out of his life, go get my “shit arts degree”, &amp; don’t come back unless I was prepared to become a doctor &amp; tell him he was right &amp; to be told “I told you so”. When I left, I was so naïve, there was so much about life I had no clue about because no one ever taught me (including the prep school I attended) vital things in life things in life that needed to be known. I was in my 20’s, yet had no clue that when you bought a house that it didn’t just come with power, water, etc. or that these were referred to as “utilities”. I had no idea about insurance or taxes, credit, investments or any of the life necessities that parents make sure their children know so they won’t fail in life before even starting. He made sure my life was made hard, near impossible at times. I was scared, alone &amp; didn’t know what to do, but I was determined to make my path &amp; succeed. I accomplished everything myself &amp; through the years I recovered from the extreme pain he caused me. I battled life without him and I moved on and made a happy life. I adopted different ideals, beliefs &amp; morals that didn’t exist in his life that I was raised in. I became my own person &amp; in recent years I even changed my name on my birth certificate, taking my stepfather’s last name. My life was fulfilling &amp; always has consisted of helping others above all. Money, while a necessity is not a factor that drives me &amp; never will be. 

Because I made it a goal to always help others, that meant this act of fraud hurt even more people, too. At the time this happened I was helping eight other mothers going through hard times who couldn’t afford what they needed for their children. In addition, after having my daughter, I became a massive overproducer of breastmilk &amp; instead of profiting from this, I bought 2 freezers &amp; helped feed 9 other children (3 at a time), in addition to my own. These babies were preemies, had GI troubles or issues caused or worsened by formula &amp; they all were diagnosed with failure to thrive. I did this at absolutely no cost to these mothers, who were either foster mothers or had no way to afford anything &amp; no one to help them. I feel like I let these mothers down after promising to help them. No apologies or anything will ever make that okay &amp; I hurt for them so badly.

Because my business, work &amp; creations were taken in these acts I have no way to provide now. Books I've worked on, children's books near completion, a novel I’ve written for almost ten years, their loss feels more like the death of a loved one than an intellectual, material loss. Art &amp; unfinished pieces I'd been paid for had to be paid back. Even more crushing is the fact that before this, I was very much not a social media user or even a tech user in general. I’m a pen-to-paper individual. I poured myself into my work &amp; what I created, I largely viewed as extensions of myself; they were cared for &amp; loved. Others were extensively documented &amp; photographed, techniques after countless trials &amp; errors were meticulously recorded for reference. What I did not ever do was back these up onto a ""cloud"" or upload to social media. I had external hard drives, plug-ins, memory chips, etc. &amp; was always careful to back-up multiple times, but this also means everything I have is gone. I feel as if I were Pharaoh Amenhotep IV or Emperor Geta, my accomplishments, life efforts and what I had pride in have been Damnatio memoriae. 

I’ve lived off of what little I have in an emergency fund to afford our monthly medical care expenses &amp; to feed us while living with my parents. Those funds are almost depleted. Knowing this was done and that help never came in any form, that no one cared to help us is in 14 months is changing me in ways I never thought anything could. I’m angry, upset all the time. I’m unable to enjoy being here &amp; move on from this.  

Stacked on this numbing presence of darkness is the weight of having no one I can talk to about this. Never have I just needed to talk to my best friend so badly. 

One day earlier this year, I was shocked when K was able to call me. She had ""earned"" her phone back only to find the number changed and contacts wiped. But she eventually found a way &amp; one day, the phone rang. She’d been told that I abandoned her &amp; that because of this reason she could not return home. She had beaten herself up over this tremendously &amp; her family just let it happen. She wondered that whole time what it was she could have done to make me leave her like this and not even say goodbye. This was soon followed by anger, then rage. She wanted to plan a rendezvous to leave, but I had to refuse because I believe her brother really would kill me, and I have to be here for my daughter, even if our life &amp; everything I had to once offer her was now gone. K went to confront this upon hearing my fears. When she did the background quickly got loud &amp; the phone was cut-off. I haven't spoken to my dear friend since. She told me she was lonely, limited in all aspects &amp; hopes to leave this earth soon if this is how her last years of her life will be spent. 

I am a shell of my former self that somehow is still trying to hang on because I’m left with no options that haven’t failed. I’m still trying to provide for my daughter in a way that offers her a stable platform that she may one day start her own life from, which is something I didn’t have.

If there is one thing this has taught me, it’s that people aren’t as inherently “good” as I thought, so now more than ever I expect no one to believe me for my word alone. I could only accept an offer for help if thorough steps were made to deeply fact-check my story entirely, so I know the person helping us has no doubts whatsoever that this is true.

I cannot accept that no one exists who wouldn't want to at least look over details &amp; (if comfortable) make this necessary fight attainable. Someone will want to help us, will want to see us get our lives back &amp; know they made that possible. Someone who has a firm interest in seeing what is right and truthful prevail &amp; believes those who have suffered through complicated, fraudulent situations like this are deserving cases that require assistance. Someone who carries the belief that one doesn't always have to fit the traditional poverty profile to be in a desperate, dire situation &amp; deserving of help. I have exhausted all options, yet I won’t stop. I can't stop, I have no other options &amp; I’m scared for what the near future holds.

I only want to return to where I already was. My accomplishments &amp; goals shouldn't be lost to someone else's greed &amp; lies. My daughter shouldn’t have to be taken off of enrollment to her school that she’s been excited about attending just because of grown-up greed either. Yet the reason I'm currently below my lowest imaginable point isn't wholly due to the crimes against me &amp; my loved ones. It has more to do with the inability to find anyone even willing to entertain a though of helping us. To this day, not one person has even looked at anywhere near all of the evidence that I have, evidence that speaks for itself. This is something I know could be easily stopped well before it got anywhere near a courtroom because I don't need a law degree to know this isn't something the guilty side wants to take anywhere near a courtroom to be handled by a judge. 

It terrifies me that if I were to die tomorrow that this would be the last thing my life was focused on. All I want is for my feet to hit the floor everyday with the purpose, drive &amp; determination &amp; happiness that they did before this happened. I just want our lives back &amp; the ability to have an unweighted, unburdened mind. I want to regain my creativity &amp; be able to get lost in imagination while playing with my daughter. I want to talk to my friend again and know she’s okay.

1830,yqtyke,FatEvolutionist,"Hey, guys. I don't know if this is the right place. I don't have anybody to talk with so I'll just post this here. Btw, sorry for any grammar mistakes since English isn't my first language.

Lately I've been feeling extremely lonely. Heck, I’ve been feeling lonely my whole fucking life. My ex broke up with me for half a year ago because of long distance problems. Our second anniversary was only 2 months away. I've already moved on and deleted all our chats and pictures and her number as well. Although a small part of me still misses her, but I don't want to go back. Like ever. I'm done with her. 

Now just two weeks ago I ended a friendship with my best childhood friend (let’s call him David). The reasons are many, and it's too complicated to list them all here. So just keep it short, he has basically turned into a toxic, mildly misogynistic and insecure person who doesn't seem to be able of taking care of his own life, who mocks the way you laugh and who likes to create drama. I don't want to have that kind of negativity in my life. That's just one of the many reasons. So I ended our friendship without giving a disclosure, and I don't regret it.

So I don't really have any friends now expect for one that is also friend with David. The three of us almost always hung out with each other. He's kinda disappointed in my decision, but I believe it was necessary for my mental health because it wasn't something spontaneous. It was something I have been considering for months. It was last year that I started to distance myself from David and felt resentment every time we met. I realised I have grown as a person and that I definitely needed new friends.

I live alone. I'm an introvert as well, but I'm deeply motivated to be way more socially outgoing. I just don't know where and how to start, particularly how to socialise because I didn't have much friends in school. I'm currently studying at university. My class is very small and very mixed in age. I tried to socialise with classmates in my age, but all of them seem to be in such a hurry going home after the lectures of the day. My life feels empty as fuck, even though I try fill it with gym, reading books, photography, and walking. Omfg, I have been walking so much lately, like 15-20,000 steps a day in the same fucking park and visiting the same fucking observation deck, mostly because it's the only activity that makes me forget everything about this world. Anyways, I don't want to rant too much. I just need some advice. I really want to break this shit because I can't deal with another second of this soul-crushing loneliness.

This constant getting to know the same things about different people is so aged. The need to cover what you want to talk about in ice breakers or impersonal questions. What does it matter?

We are two strangers online that unless the stars align are probably never going to meet - be real with me. What are you into? What are your fears? What turns you on or off? What is the side of yourself your embarrassed to show? 

Let’s have a real conversation - whether it be fun, serious or upsetting. Let’s chat aliens, let’s chat filth to each other, let’s let our guard down and talk about things that actually matter to us personally? Not just things we feel obliged to ask because we have to break the ice first. 

I want real, I want unfiltered and unapologetic conversations and if I can’t find that here? Where will it be?

1838,yquk2y,FairFood1668,"I think a comedian once said, ""Married men don't have friends. Their wives have friends, and those friends have husbands.""

It's so true. I have a handful of friends I used to be close to, but they've all drifted off into serious relationships. It takes a while to change, but it feels like once they hit the 1 year mark, that girl becomes their only social outlet. Like I get that everyone's life is busier now that we've moved further apart, gotten careers, gotten obligations, but women just seem to make more room for their friends.

I was in a serious relationship for a while. I told myself that I would make an effort to keep in touch with my friends, especially my single friends, because I didn't want to be ""that guy."" Honestly it saved my ass when we broke up because I still had a few bros I could rely on. But now those friends are in relationships, and they aren't putting in the effort with me.

When you're in a serious relationship, you get to hang out ""as couples"" with your friends and their gfs/wives. When you break up, suddenly you don't get invited to couples hangouts anymore. What's interesting is that the gfs/wives invite their single female friends to couples hangouts, but the guys never do the same.

One of my friends tried to set me up with his gf's friend. We went on a couple dates but mutually didn't feel a spark. He said, ""That sucks, I was hoping we could hang out more."" Like dude, you don't need me to be dating someone to hang out with me. It's extra funny because me and that girl still text and hang out platonically from time to time. She literally puts more effort into our friendship than a guy I went to war (Afghanistan) with and have known for 10+ years.

And I'm not even talking about people with kids. I get that makes everything crazier and you don't have time for anything else. But you know what's weird? When my friends have kids, I start to hear from them more. We don't necessarily hang out often, but we text or game together more because when they have a break from family stuff, they don't glue themselves to their wives.

I don't mean to sound bitter about women. Us guys need to learn from you. I don't blame ""controlling women"" or whatever for my friends drifting. Most of their wives/gfs are awesome. They keep in touch with their single friends, and I get the feeling they wished their husbands/bfs would be a bit less socially dependent. Movies always portray guys begging to get away and have poker nights or whatever to get away from their wives, but in reality, it seems more like the wives are buying the beer and asking their husbands to bring some people over.

Has anyone else dealt with this? (Context--I'm early 30s M, ex-military, mid-sized US city.)",2022-11-09 20:26:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668023984,4,/r/lonely/comments/yquk2y/guyswhy_do_we_disappear_into_relationships/,,0,2,Guys--why do we disappear into relationships?

1851,yqwfwm,[deleted],"There were a few days where I had enough energy to be happy or if I wasn’t happy at least fake like I was. It was bliss, people were so nice to me, I had so much fun and I didn’t feel lonely or like a burden. Last night I felt my depression creeping back in though and I’m terrified now. I know how they’re going to be if I’m not happy and teasing and chill. They’re going to withdraw again, tell me I’m draining and not give me the affection and support that would help intensely with my depression. I’ve already started fucking it up already and it’s only the morning after. Im so tired of having only people who will tolerate me or be nice when I’m being happy and bringing the mood up. Why’s it always gotta be me who’s gotta do the cheering up and be understanding and patient? I’m always stuck dragging my emotions up to a place where I can be good company to whoever’s upset. But the second I’m upset, whether the other person is in a good mood or a bad mood I get shoved to the side. “Too emotional” “too sensitive” “a burden, exhausting to be around”. I get no wiggle room. It’s either “happy, chill, understanding, patient” and company or alone. Got yelled at last night for answering the question “what are you going to do on the weekend?” With “probably just existing in my room”, in a completely normal voice too. Just a slightly happier than neutral kind of voice. It all makes me feel so fucking angry and helpless and alone. 
Also, sorry you read this far. It’s all really unimportant fr. I’m not looking to make friends or get sympathy or anything. Just felt like documenting my drowning, so when I eventually give up on living there can at least be proof that I tried or maybe that I feel less alone knowing at least someone saw.

I get so depressed that I deep dive into the cast’s life and follow the fandoms of that show hoping for more fulfilling content. 

   It's as if my heart has an empty hole and these shows and movies fill it for a tiny moment and then it goes away again.

So after she rejected me I said to myself that I was done chasing. I got rid of all the dating apps. And I changed the way I dress to be more how I want it and less how I think other people would find attractive. and I guess I feel a little better for that. But I feel it still. This deep, burning empty feeling inside me that constantly reminds me how badly I wish I had a special someone who was there for me. Who I enjoyed spending my time around. Someone I could come to after a long day at work and just cuddle and feel safe and supported. but I don't have someone like that. But I have lost the fight to seek someone now. So now I am just miserable and alone. Nothing but me and that strange painful feeling when I think about how I don't have someone.   
I wish I could just strip this feeling away. I wanna just be happy being alone. but I don't know how to get rid of this feeling.   


This part is gonna sound really up my own ass but part of the reason I wish I had someone now instead of later in life is because I think to myself that in all likelihood if I keep my head straight Ill probably end up with my own place and a car when I'm older. I don't think ill be rich. But I'm hoping to at least be stable. but I don't like the idea that only then will I find someone. I wanna know that if I did find someone it would be genuine. I guess I'm just kinda rambling now.   


But yeah, dose anyone else feel like this? I wanna know if you are out there. Just so I can feel less alone.  


TL;DR: I got rejected, struggle forming relationships, lost the fight to seek a relationship and feel hopelessly alone all the time.",2022-11-10 00:37:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606335231,3,/r/lonely/comments/yr0jt9/i_hate_that_i_want_a_partner/,,0,12,I hate that I want a partner.

1909,yr37g5,[deleted],"Yo. I’m currently sophomore in college, and I feel lonely every day. I have struggled watching porn since I was in high school and I have been trying to stop, but my dumbass decides to relapse over and over no matter how many times I promise myself that it’s the last time. I know it takes a lot of discipline to stop this habit. Idk why I am talking about this at this point… I like to workout and I used to play video games, but I lost enjoyment since I have been in college. I decided to take slightly early classes this year, one of which is at another campus which I take a 50 minute shuttle to (I did this because the professor had good ratings compared to the other professor at my campus). Every morning that I wake up I am tired and have no motivation to go to the classes. I am still doing fairly well in the classes since I do all the online assignments and show up for the quizzes/exams. The only classes I actually attend are the labs because attendance is required. 

I’ll start by saying that I do have a couple of friends with a couple mutual interests from high-school, but I feel like we are very different people and I don’t agree with some of the things they do sometimes. I wish that I could make new friends in college, but I have never been good at turning classroom acquaintances into friends. The only reason I met any of my high-school friends was through soccer… That being said I have never been friends with a girl or even had any interactions/meetups with girls other than in school. I wouldn’t consider myself to be an awkward person or anything, but I struggle to make any relationships with people and I feel so alone everyday. I took a bunch of AP/Honors classes for the sake of getting some college credits done, but that was full of all the smart kids who already had their friends groups, not to mention I didn’t share many interests with them.

Nowadays all that I do in college is do my online assignments, go to required classes, eat food, and workout occasionally. I have lost motivation to go some days because I feel so sad and lonely. I really wish I could talk to a girl my age and have a meaningful conversation. I wish I could just look into another girls eyes or cuddle. I tell myself that all my problems and lack of motivation would go away if I just had that, but that is probably not the case at all. At this point I feel like I am just waiting for the semester to end so I can go back home, but every day is just so long and boring.

1910,yr3b1l,Duffy_Boi,"Hi everyone, I'm new here, so don't expect expertly crafted think pieces yet. Though I knew from the minute I heard about this place on this site. I had to join because it's a fine line between the SJWs and Incels of the world. Both sides of which seem to have done everything in their power to make sure that normal people like me can't simply hold another human being and tell them, ""I love you.""

Every time I try to hit on a girl at a club, restaurant, or college classroom. I'm either met with one of two looks. The look of distain, where they think I'm creepy and try to avoid me. Or the look of processing, one where they consider me a decent pick. Though they really have to think about it. I don't count the girls with boyfriends. They're already taken and don't need another creep flirting with them. Yet it seems that more and more women are likely to look at me with distain.

I've asked my female friends if I don't look the part. If I look too nerdy or too freaky looking. And they tell me I'm fine, it's honestly just that girls are scared of guys these days. And who can blame them? Every day, as the world burns down due to politics and social anxiety. More and more people isolate themselves and don't want to talk to people about things like sex and relationships. Even though it's something that humans need to survive.

I'm not an old conservative who says that people need to get married. Yet, I'm not some new age Twitter philopher who thinks that women are simply suppressing their urges because they're told too. It's because all of these factors exist that seem to try and scare people into curling up into their shells. And if there is any chance at change. There needs to be more places like this where we can get our frustration out. And not become a hot bed for mass shooters. 

Hell, if anyone has any tips for how to go forward and actually get women without looking like an Incel. I'd love to hear it, though I doubt it's going to be any good.

1926,yr4quc,LostArkFearless,"Context: 24M North America

For most of my life I have primary had girl-friends. However, this all changed once I hit about 20. And I’ve come to the conclusion I will likely not have girl-friends the way I used to again. I’ve recently noticed that once women hit about 20-24 some develop a strong aversion to men. And I’m guessing over the years, being harassed takes its toll.  So then I’ve tried to make friends with other men, however, men are thirsty. 

It’s so annoying that I cannot make friends with girls because they tend to want to make friends with other girls and men only try to make friends with girls as well. This leads to men DMing women which leads women to ignore men more which causes men to message more. It’s a vicious cycle. I see posts here all the time and other subreddits where it’s just men looking for women or when a woman posts that they are looking for friends they get so many men commenting compared to if a male posted. And it’s fucking pathetic. Women are not gonna send you random nudes or magically want to be your girlfriend because you message them online. Stop harassing women, not only because it’s pointless and it’s part of the vicious cycle, but also because it makes women treat men badly because they know there’s always other thirsty men who they can choose from. You’re a 35M asking to hangout with a 21F? Grow the fuck up.

1931,yr5b13,fake_friends_please,"TL;WR - How can I accelerate a relationship's path to friendship without being creepy?



I've been at a new job, and I'm starting to settle in. First job in years, first time in years I've talked to people outside my family intentionally. Its been nice. I've been feeling OK more often than not. And thinking I could get used to this.

But semester's almost over, and one of my favorite coworkers is leaving next summer. Hell, I'm gonna have to leave next fall. I'm scared of the change. It feels like no good thing never lasts.

What's got me fucked up most though is my crush. I cannot stand the thought of letting another chance go by. I don't even really believe its a chance that I have with her, but still. We could at least be friends, ffs. I dont want to have to say goodbye to here in a year or two and then just never see her again. I'm so fucking tired of not having roots. I feel like I have nothing, that everything I think I have is just liquid in trying to hold in my hands. I need something more solid and tangible and permanent.

Anyways, I'm kicking myself in particular for not talking to her more today when I saw her, cuz I won't see her again until Monday. It feels like an eternity to wait. And its got me thinking I dont wanna have to do it anymore. Like, wouldn't it be great if I could just text her when I start thinking about her? Wouldn't that just be swell?  I'd love to be able to talk to her not only at work. If I could, I'd fuckin love to do something with her. Idk what, idk that I even care what. But I have no idea how to socialize. I just have this idea of what I wish my life looked like, I have no idea how to get there.

I'm terrified that if I try at all, it'll just be creepy and ruin whatever chances at befriending her I had due to just being around each other a lot.

She'll leave or I'll leave and I'll never get to see her again, and she'll be just another ghost haunting me every night. It feels terrible, I'm petrified with fear, and I dont know what to do.

1938,yr603g,JagVillBliFull,"Hi guys, I am a 2nd-year college student who had to move back home and commute because my assigned roommate was a violent criminal who committed multiple felonies during the week I lived with him. My commute is not that bad, with normal traffic it is about 25 minutes. However, I am now stuck living in an incredibly isolating neighborhood. I love going out and being where all the excitement is, so obviously being forced to live in this secluded suburb is quite depressing. 

There is literally nobody my age here. All the neighbors are either retired folks or families raising children. Their idea of a good time is shopping at Costco, watching television, painting the house, and doing yard work. Most of my college classmates and friends hang out by going to parties together, but I can't do that unless I pay $40 plus tip for a round-trip Uber (driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous). I have been invited to parties but I didn't go because I couldn't justify spending $50 just on transportation.

 I also met some people through my church's youth group, but lately, they have been really scared of the coronavirus and don't want to go out with people they don't live with. I guess it's easy to do that when your housemates are your close friends. 

I did meet a girl on Tinder a while ago and we have been going out together for a while now. We try to go out every week and have fun together. 

There are meetup groups in the nearest legitimate city, but they mostly cater to people in their late 20s and early 30s. As an undergraduate student, it would be hard to form connections with them because we're in different life stages. 

Every Friday and Saturday night I often find myself forced to decide between spending $50 plus food and drinks to have a fun night out or being lonely by myself. I guess I can always get drunk alone but that's not fun, it's alcohol abuse.

I hate that piece of shit drug dealer assigned roommate so much for forcing me to move back home. I hope he gets caught and sentenced to prison. He threw away my food to store his drug-manufacturing chemicals in the freezer, tried to steal my car keys, got a girl under the influence and sexually assaulted her on my bed, made criminal threats, and destroyed my property. He also would make phone calls to his friends and talk about ways to beat me up or steal my property. I reported him to the police and left, but he found out and cleaned out the place, destroying all evidence. 

Just for fun, here is a list of his crimes that I witnessed: 

Possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute 

Conspiracy 

Sexual Assault

Criminal Threats

Drugging a Victim to Commit a Felony 

Destroying or Concealing Evidence

Possession of Drug Paraphernalia

1948,yr7mt7,glandgames,"This is a subreddit for people who are lonely, but that doesn't mean what you might think it does. 

If you are depressed and lonely and think that a girlfriend is all you need to be happy, YOU'RE WRONG.   

  First off, nobody goes out with the mindset of *""who is the lonliest, saddest person i can fix?""*   It's not personal, it just isn't what anyone is looking for.  EVER.  (and if you do happen to find someone with that mentality, RUN)   
Misery is not the attractive quality that ""chicks dig.""    Work on yourself.  Be something people want to be a part of.  Life is tough, and sad.  Nobody wants more sad. Not saying be a happy go lucky buffoon, but even Kurt Cobain was funny when he wanted to be.  

People like people who have their head *at least somewhat* together.  Nobody rolls out of bed needing a sad sack to be miserable with.  If you are all messed up inside, GET THERAPY.  WOMEN ARE NOT BORN PSYCHOLOGISTS. 

Honestly, what are you offering? Sadness? Do you know how *selfish* it is to say ""woe is me, I need girlfriend""?   *""I'm touch starved and only a girlfriend can satisfy what I'm missing"" means women are just pills for you, and it's GROSS.  News flash, women are PEOPLE TOO.  

Lastly, and I can't believe this needs to be said, but this ain't a subreddit for hooking up. Jesus freaking Christ. 

  

This may come off mean spirited, and I hope it doesn't get me banned, but there is WAY too many posts from dudes thinking women are the answer to depression.  Dudes, hear this: relationships often make stuff worse when you aren't ready for one.  Only now you're bringing someone else into your depression.



EDIT-   And now it's locked.     Great.     

For anyone who thinks what I'm saying is bullshit, literally go ask ANYONE who is in a healthy relationship who they agree with.

A couple of months ago, I got paired up with a girl who was way out of my league to analyze a writing. That day she looked angelic and beautiful to me, and I developed a little childish crush. She’s probably the nicest person I’ve ever met, and she was intelligent. We had a decent conversation while working on the writing, and I think we might’ve clicked (maybe). Funny enough, I caught her having porn open in her browser which led to a awkward and cute response from her, while searching up a word up we didn’t know. Week after week I looked forward to seeing her in class, even after she had just came from work and looked like an mess; she’s beautiful in every way. Every single class I had the chance to express my feelings, I didn’t because I didn’t want to make things weird in the classroom. I found out that she dropped the class a couple of weeks ago, which just erased every bit of motivation I had in this class.

I tried a lot of times telling my family that I'm not smart, that I'm dumb but every time I explain to them that I'm not smart and that I like certain skill to do x they will just completely disregard what I said

With that in mind and with some other things I overheard about me recently I've come to the conclusion that maybe people just fears me because they think I'm somehow smarter than them and that really sucks

Ever since I was little I wanted friends and at some point when I was 6-9yo I had some but they had to move out of the neighborhood and eventually I also moved out, when I was little I did have a lot of people that called themselves my friends or wanted to be friends with me but I wasn't interested in being friends with them because they just wanted o use me to reach my family

Also I usually don't even talk about anything because my tastes are really weird specially for my country and more so then I was little and almost no one had internet here

Also one of my daily issues is the fact that I don't know how to tell my family that in the last few years I started liking music ( yeah I know I'm weird) and that I like basically every gender there is exempt the ones they listen to

And that's everything probably...

People who believe that need this advice of course, it won't and people are more than their ability to make you feel better. But to say through implication a relationship won't radically improve your life if that's what's missing is daft. Whether it's the only thing that's missing, in which case it's the most natural thing in the world to want that, or everything generally sucks but would be made better with a supportive partner, it's perfectly valid to want it and even despair at not having it. We never hear, friends won't fix your life, a good career won't fix your life, eating well won't fix your life. Because it's absolutely insane. Anything good will enhance your quality of living. You just have to hold out for good things and not settle in their absence or difficulty in obtainability. 

As a perpetually unhappy single woman, you want to know what probably sucks more than the status itself? People telling me I should be happy being independent. Ignoring how I feel on the matter. As if I'd need to sacrifice independence in a relationship. The condescension is *insulting*. Hating being unlucky in love is normal. Not everybody finds meaning in being single, or great mental health even if it's always important to make the attempt. Stop trying to convince us this is an epidemic that needs to be quelled with cliche affirmations like ""You can't love others until you love yourself"" or ""Nobody can fix you.""

2036,yrot6n,wet-rats-smell-good,"When I was in junior high (middle school) everybody knew everybody. Even though there were many people, everybody knew and talked to each other.
I’m now in high school, an even though I like the freedom of choosing classes and what not, I’ve never felt so broken. 
I’ve had one consistent friend all of my childhood, and we’ve been friends for 11 years. Now he has gotten really popular at school because he is really strong, good looking, and outgoing. Him and I are still good friends and consistently talk, but he has kinda pushed me aside for his new, cooler friends. It’s okay though, it’s not like he doesn’t talk to me, and I really value that. 
When I’m not with my friend, I feel miserable. I never have anybody to talk to except in my art class. There is one girl from my old school who I have been extremely close friends with for about 4-5 years. You’ve probably already noticed by now, but I have had an intense crush on her ever since I met her. I literally can’t go a few hours without thinking of her. She is basically the only thing keeping me going. For the longest time I thought that I have been her best friend, but I’ve only really just realized that now for about a year and a half, she’s viewed me as an acquaintance. 
I sometimes, I’ll lie to myself and say that she is still good friends with me, and I’ll say to myself that I am the closest friend, but then she’ll talk to her better friend beside her (I sit beside her aswell) about how great it was to go out with all her better, cooler friends.

My friend that I’ve had for 11 years (we’ll call him Sebastian) is the only person I really have left. Thing is, though him and I have been great friends, the people that he is friends with seem to want to shake me off of him. Soon enough I’ll be cut off. It’s already clear that he likes his other friends a lot more. And it’s funny because I have literally changed myself to be more like him so I don’t lose him. When it’s the weekend, I’m alone. My phone never buzz’s.
At school, nobody talks to me. I’m always just kinda there, and whoever talks to me seems so damn disinterested. I’ve never really let out my emotions, even when my dog (who’s been alive my whole life) died. I can’t trust anybody to confide in because nobody wants to talk to me. They always try to end the conversation as quickly as possible, and they never, start conversations with me. 
I’m legit so starved of love that I talk to my pillow and hug it to pretend that it is somebody that loves me. Everybody in my family hates me and dumps all their baggage on me because I’m there. My family berates me and yells at me for the smallest things. They see me as this thing they can dump all their problems on to because I’ll just take it. 
I’m reality’s the only thing I want in life is a girl I can hold in my arms. Some one who really trust and happiness in me. Somebody who genuinely loves me. I’ve never had anybody tell me that they like me. Literally any girl that is nice to me, I fall in love with. I know that nobody loves or has ever loved me, and that’s what hurts the most. Basically my friends see me as a loser and don’t really want me there, and my family sees me as an emotional dumping ground. The only feeling of happiness that I get is from watching YouTube and hugging my pillow. Nobody has ever, does, or will love me, all because I am just a person that exist in he background. Never acknowledged, never seen, and never cared for.",2022-11-10 19:13:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1575814691,3,/r/lonely/comments/yrot6n/i_feel_like_a_background_character_nobody_cares/,,0,0,I feel like a background character.

2041,yrp4tv,EvilFloopyD6,"I have not been on this sub for long but in my time here I have seen people post similar problems to mine, now that is not to say that some people don't have it worse then I have but this letter is to those people who post about killing themselves, who don't see themselves coming out this to them all I have to say is it's not worth it. 

Now for some back story. In the past I was much lonelier didn't have any friends or much of a social life and at some point I had even decided to kill myself just to end the pain and misery that I was feeling because at that time it looked liked the only logical and attainable solution luckily being drunk I realized that I have lived with this for so long what is another day and that has made all the difference. I realized that yes my life is not what I want it to be but if I have the strength to survive it then I have the strength to improve it. 

This was some 5 years ago and since then I have tried to make my life better even though I don't always succeed and at times I have regressed but I try not to go back to that dark place again because that place isn't real and if I give up now it would have all been for nothing and maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe that's my advantage I have always been a curious person and the curiosity of wanting to know what tomorrow will be like has kept me alive. 

So I would say to all the lonely people of this sub Reddit you have survived your lonelyness for so long why not another day because I believe you can.

She even even kept the conversation going with a fresh new topic of her own once mine had ran dry, so I guess that means she was having fun, too? Idk, but that's how I'm choosing to look at it.

Its still really weird to me how I can feel both incredibly nervous and yet so at peace talking to her. Its both at once, but its nice, I think.

Oh, and she called me smart, so that was... weird? I mean, I recognize its a good thing, but I kinda hate being identified as smart. Feels like I've got an expectation to live up to after that, and I never do. Even so, knowing that at least one facet of her internal model of me is positive feels nice.

I haven't really dated since then, ans making new friendships has been hard because I feel insecure about not having close friends and I get awkward around people because I haven't been practicing socializing as much lately. This summer, I thought I met a few friendly people, but they kept leaving me out of plans so they're just people I see around now. I just keep everything in now and I try to forget by keeping busy.

Why did she even message if she didn't want my response??? This is not even the first time this has happened to me.

At least he's happy... that's all that matters right? Why do I need happiness when he is happy. All I wanted to do is fill the void inside me and give my love to someone that loves me back. Not seeing me as a friend but as someone more

2188,ys9zsl,cutehotmess,"I have one friend, and he’s the first friend I’ve had after about 6 years of having no one. I got used to being lonely, but then, once I got over the “this is too good to be true” thing, I became a little dependent on him. I think I realized that I felt better when I had support from another human and I don’t want to go back to the lonely feeling again.

The problem is, he’s going through a lot right now, his mental health is also in the toilet. He’s not always available to support me, and when he is, it’s not as much as he has in the past. Which is completely understandable, I’m not mad at him for it and I don’t expect him to pay attention to me when he’s feeling bad.

My therapist told me that I need to grow my support system, yknow have multiple people that I can go to if I need help. But this friendship alone took at least 6 months to get to where it is now. Whenever I try to make friends, they either straight up ignore me or ghost me. I’ve had people irl look me up and down and in the eyes, then completely ignore me and start talking to someone else. Part of it definitely has to do with me being fat, the fatphobia in this world is insane. I don’t know why else someone who’s never met me would look me up and down and not acknowledge me.

But how am I supposed to grow my support system if people won’t give me a chance? I need help sooner than the 6 months it’s gonna take me to get to a comfortable enough place with someone where I can be this vulnerable. I realize it’s unfair to put all of my problems on one person. It’s unfair to do that at all tbh. I just need more support from different people but I can’t find it because no one cares enough to be my friend. And if they do and I start being vulnerable, that’s when they ghost me. Like when they agreed to be my friend, supporting me emotionally wasn’t what they signed up for, so they left.

I also realize I need to learn new ways to support myself, and I do have some. Just some days are bad to the point where those things don’t work.",2022-11-11 13:08:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649103422,3,/r/lonely/comments/ys9zsl/i_need_a_bigger_support_system/,,0,2,I need a bigger support system

I got.....absolutely nothing.....We did go out to eat, she said the day before our anniversary that we were going to go out to eat. I assumed she would pay, out of her discretionary funds as she invited me, but, no. I paid. Oh, I also had to come home and get her car gassed up.

2230,ysiy95,ottomanking02,"Hi everyone! I just wanna tell you guys some of my story, just to see if anybody ever found him/herself in a similar situation. So i always grew up in a little town were forming a group inside the catholic community was very usual, but i always hung out with my cousins, who lived about 30 minutes away from my home. When i turned 14 they moved to Switzerland and was left alone in my country, since i never really invested in human relations with people in my town. I then decided to take action and really connect with people there. So i formed a group of about 30 people i had known from my local church (i live Italy so many people came and went from there) and i created a lot of memories for about 4 years. I myself never had any difficulty in finding friends, even i high school i can confidently say i never felt alone and i always had someone to hang out with. I had my first girlfriend during that period of time and my second one, when things started to take a bad turn. At the time of my second girlfriend i was about 19, so i had just started uni and i can't understand what happened. During that time was always either studying or working and i guess i became kinda sad (not depressed, i just wasn't as motivated to do stuff as usual) and i kinda lost contacts whit people around me. I then realized i was alone only with my gf and i decided to break up with her because the thought of being a sad burden to her was too much for me. Then she kinda went crazy from there and started telling people i was a moron and kind of an asshole, so i lost many of the friends we had in common (we live in a small city so they were numerous) and now i feel like i am completely alone. My last friends either found a gf so they have much less time to hang out with me (which i'm really not angry about, i'm happy for them) or they smoke a lot of pot, which after some time becomes boring. Now the only wish i have is to get out of my town and go study abroad, just to give my life some big changes, i feel like i might go crazy if i don't. It's gonna be at least a year from now though, if i get even accepted, i just don't know if i can make it i'm not very used to be this lonely.",2022-11-11 18:38:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666868639,1,/r/lonely/comments/ysiy95/just_need_someone_in_my_situations_to_tell_me/,,0,5,Just need someone in my situations to tell me everything's fine

I would have so much more respect and understanding if a homie reached out saying there not ok. I don't know any of you but my dms are open if needed I'll give a phone number we can talk. You are Soo much more than you give yourself credit. Each one of you are something special and I would go 100 nights with out sleep over talking to you than lose one night of sleep learning of your death. I guess my point is reach out. To me a friend a family member get help don't give into the statistic of male suicide.

and wall of text i got like a 5 in english and coasted

ive never really had any friends since year 10 or 9. i usually just sat at home playing games all day and coped somewhat, even if it was lonely. i was hoping sixth form would be a fresh new start but its just gone off the deep end. i have nobody to talk to, knock around with or do owt with really. i dont know why but now nothing feels the same, and the quick coping dopamine anything gave me before barely works, so i just lie down in my room and listen to music while i wallow in my own self pity. i feel jealous all the time. jealous of how everyone else seems to have atleast one person just to even stand with but im stuck on my own all the time. it gets better with family but even then and i know it sounds rude but i want something more. im thinking of getting a dog and itd help alot but even then i want friends my age to go out with for once. but the problem is i dunno how. ive always been a bit shy since i was little but its developed like plaque and now i can barely converse with people. and its not like i dont want to, id love to go out with mates all the time but i feel like now it might be too late. i see people i recognize from secondary with loads of friends and its honestly a bit embarassing when ur on ur own. theres 1 person i could talk to in one lesson from my old school but i think hes just disinterested in me, and only ever really asks for help. ive started hearing my name in whispers now, seeing people glancing at me then back with their friends. i know its childish and im probablys being paranoid and pathetic but i feel like it's pushing me further and further off the deep end each day im there. last tuesday i had to be paired with someone from a different class (they were off on wednesday so were doing the lesson early) and im honestly trying to block it out my mind i embarassed myself so badly. they had zero interest in their voice at all and i dont know why i kept talking. maybes i was being jealous of every other pair being able to just conversate with eachother and trying myself but i ran out of simple topics to talk about and it ended up silent the 2nd half other than awkwardly talking about the practical. i know everyone says ""not everyones going to like you"" but honestly it feels like the not and everyone is swapped for me haha. im failing in my classes too because im stupidly stuck worrying about this.

i also think i might be undiagnosed autism or something because my little brother is diagnosed and littler ones getting his but i had a check at the doctors like 2 years ago and he said no, but my mam still insists. maybes that could explain feeling like an imposter at the school and not being able to socialize properly but it means nothing unless i know for sure i have it if i do.

but overall i feel like my loneliness is hurtling me towards a dark place im already knee deep in and im sinking every day. i know for someone my age crying about having no friends at school or college is pathetic but i just cant help it... i never had any really. i was always weird and unliked in both primary and secondary but here it feels crushing.

sorry for going in circles and contradicting self probably. i just have too much on my mind and dont know where to offload haha",2022-11-11 19:56:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668185777,1,/r/lonely/comments/ysl6gd/feel_unwanted_and_unloved_not_sure_whether_i/,,0,1,"feel unwanted and unloved, not sure whether i deserve to be anywhere"

Anyway tonight I decided to stay at home watching YouTube videos and listen to music while drinking 🤫!

I have been averaging 6 hours sleep a night (since Saturday) in a demanding job. I do enjoy my career, but it’s mentally demanding. Hence respite is necessary!

Fridays are somewhat special, as I can more easily socialise with people (strangers) than Saturday or Sunday as people are more difficult IMO, as I find people less appropriable. Friday people are intoxicated and wanna talk with strangers by comparison to Saturday and Sunday 🤷‍♂️

Now I also tend to dress in more appealing clothing (not as warm) 🥶 

With context I’m asking am I burnt out or just unwinding from lack of sleep and it being cold (8C tonight) outdoors?

2263,ysnmyr,sunnyziggy,"I used to love the holidays. It’s festive, and snowy, and my birthday is right before the whole thing (Dec. 18). It genuinely was the best time of the year. 

For the first time in my life though, I am dreading it. I don’t want them to come. I’m going to most likely be spending them alone. And it hurts. 

My parents are going down to North Carolina to visit my mother’s cousin. I am 100% invited, my mom even made a point of it. And don’t get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate it. But as a soon to be 23 year old that (unfortunately) still lives at home, I’m emotionally exhausted from the amount of time I spend with them. So yes, I don’t have to be alone, but I just cannot spend anymore time with my parents or else it will start degrading my mental health even more. 

But my other option is staying back home, alone. I don’t have any friends I could spend it with. I guess this whole situation is my own fault. I could just suck it up go down to NC, and deal with it. But knowing the barrage of questions about why I still don’t have a job, what my plans are, why I’m not dating, it’s just too much. I know for a fact that if I go with them, even though I’ll be surrounded by people I’ll still feel terribly alone. Most likely holed up in some corner reading.

I guess all of this is a symptom of a larger problem. I am working on it, I’ve started therapy, I’m endlessly job hunting. And I know this sounds petty and entitled, I do get it. I just wish I had a group of friends (not even gonna open the can of worms that is wishing for a partner) to spend this time with. 

I don’t know, guess I’m just bummed and dreading it and needed to vent.

There’s no perfect solution. What do you guys do during the holidays so they don’t feel as lonely?",2022-11-11 21:25:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1576998442,1,/r/lonely/comments/ysnmyr/dreading_the_holiday_season/,,0,2,Dreading the Holiday season

Then when he got here he just was focused on her and he knows how bad am I doing so physically and mentally sick and that I tried killing myself less than 2 months ago. And I told him I'm not ok either. Because I feel always in my family that you have to throw a big tantrum to get any attention at all. But even all my life if I've done this my father has ignored me. He's a narcissist. But like, the month before when I was in the hospital he seemed very strangely nicer. And like today then told me kinda implied that it's my fault that my mom's like that. That it's my fault that I'm alone. And I was trying to make him see since he was well enough to see my mom wasn't ok that I'm not ok either I just don't throw a tantrum, but then I try kill myself or hurt myself. And he said that I'll go to hell. ""Do you know what do they did with suicidal people back then...?""That that's the pure truth. And repeated it again and again. And I told him he's not right and he told me that's the truth even again ""do you know what they did with suicidal people, they put them in the square and ""

I literally can't take care of myself anymore. I've been dealing with everything by myself because other people just make things worse for 3+ years. Literally I don't talk or see anyone. And like I just ask my mother to bring me food because I have chronic pain and fatigue and I'm broke with no benefits and I'm losing it and I can't anymore and she's been bringin me food for a year or so and when she comes is almost always a disaster. But today was another level. She yelling all the neighbors listening. I couldn't keep it together then I'm treated like I'm ok because I'm not throwing a tantrum like her or idk. She's probably not ok. But anyway Im not ok either and never was I allowed to do stuff like that. She'd yell at me tell me to call down or stop it as if I was choosing it. Then my father says she didn't decide that and that she's out of herself but can't understand me nor when I'm out of myself.

Later my mom told me she's losing it because if my father. That he's telling her that she'll go to hell too and stuff like that. And that he's the usual abusive asshole with her. I feel like my father wants to blame me tho for how my mother's doing. I know I'm partially to blame since I treat her not so great sometimes but honestly she's always been like that with me and worse for my whole life and I'm just over saying poor mom father's so bad with her then she does this and that. Like I'm gonna hold her responsible. And start confronting all the trauma I have with her and not burying it or looking the other way and I'm doing so bad and hurt by all the trauma with her that I treat her bad sometimes but. And I hold myself responsible for that but I feel as my father wants me to be reasponsible for she doing bad.

I was suicidal from before. So much more stuff is going on and I really can't do this anymore This is all I have, and you can see I'm truly alone. It's better starving or fainting from hunger as I used to do. I literally can't do it anymore.",2022-11-11 23:24:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668206349,1,/r/lonely/comments/ysqhj7/i_cant_do_it_anymore/,,0,2,I can't do it anymore

2290,ysr022,AfterStart," 25M. In terms of career, I feel I'm doing ok. Got a new job in a hospital and I honestly feel good about it. But for relationships, fuck it. I'm just done.

I've always had this feeling that I'm just that random person people just put up with because I'm there. For the longest time, I never really cared. Sure, it was frustrating when I took the time to think about it, but that was just the way it was. Went through my year on campus being that person who didn't go out, and while people were hooking up left and right, I was just there. Found out the people I was living with had all gotten a house for the next year, didn't tell me, and didn't ask what I was doing.

The only people I've gotten close to are the people I worked with at my old job. We have a laugh and a joke whenever we see each other now, but there's simply no time anymore. They're moving on in the job without me, and they're all busy with their own lives whenever I have time for a meetup.

About 2 years ago I finally started caring about this. Got feelings for a girl I worked with. About a week later, she's met a guy on a dating app and it just goes from strength to strength. I don't tell her anything because I don't want to get in the way of her happiness, so I let her talk about all the things they've done together, how great it is, how happy they make her feel. Eventually she left about a year ago. I still think about her even now, even though I know I'm just a guy from another job for her.

I've tried to get my mind off her. Tried Tinder, Bumble, Hinge. It's been a year and a half since I've started doing that, and I've had one date. She was nice, but there just wasn't a spark. I've also tried the bar/club scene, and nothing has happened there.

Reason I'm here tonight is because for the past 2 nights, I've had a drink at a local pub. And I feel like I'm just this awkward guy standing about, trying to find a way to ingratiate into a convo with whoever's there. Still, this girl is there, and we talk both nights. It's going good. Have a few smokes, some drinks, but tonight, she chats to one guy, and 10 minutes after, they're on the dancefloor and then leaving together. I know I shouldn't feel bad for her having good time with someone else when we were just 2 people who crossed paths for 2 nights, but damn.

Look, if this is a case of AITA, then fine. But honestly, I just don't know anymore. Maybe I should just bury myself in my job and focus on that. I just give up.",2022-11-11 23:48:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582673820,3,/r/lonely/comments/ysr022/i_just_give_up_on_finding_relationships/,,0,5,I just give up on finding relationships

So I find myself constantly begging for his attention but not literally because I don’t wanna scare him off. He’s an actually nice guy too with a lower libido than mine so I can’t just sexualize myself like I’m used to, to get his attention either. It literally doesn’t work lol. 

I guess this just confirms I’m the problem , which I’ve always known. Idk how to be happy on my own and not need external validation. Oh boy. I probably just need to manage to detach myself.

UPDATE: I kind of mentioned it in passing while we were on the phone last night and he said he needed introvert time yesterday, plus he was busy with homework.

I think I’m gonna talk to him about it today and say I totally understand I just need him to communicate that in the moment cause ya know I really like him and I need attention.",2022-11-12 00:00:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1537585394,161,/r/lonely/comments/ysr9bk/idk_why_i_thought_having_a_bf_would_make_me_happy/,,0,56,Idk why I thought having a bf would make me happy

I'm a college student in my 20s, I have no friends in my college, I like socializing with people but am not able to, I'm really scared to talk to girls, I sit in my room all day watching shit tons of porn and jerking of non stop, which has led to me having a weird and unconfortable relationship with my mom and my sister, I'm scared to hug them, talk to them or tell them I love them, because all this porn has polluted my mind so much.

I sleep all day for 12 hours, fail exams, Jerk off, Blow away all my money, and don't interact with any humans, this is the types of people I used to hate and feel pity for and now I am one of them, this just makes me feel less confident and anxious all day, I sit alone in my room and cry about how messed my life is but can't seem to do anything about it.

When ever I open up to people regarding this they either laugh at me, look at me with disgust and tell me I have no achievements, no freinds, no grades, can't gym properly, scared of women and parents hate me, why don't consider my self a failure and accept my fate.

2336,ysxl3f,throwaway-imp,"
I have never really had any friends in real life and I’ve always struggled with social anxiety as well as low confidence because I grew up in an abusive home. The few friends I did have usually mistreated me in some way for being unpopular or we just naturally drifted. 

This led me to being an outcast and finding very toxic, misogynistic online spaces where I naively believed people would be understanding because they were spaces for other outcasts. I stuck around because I found the memes funny, it was interesting, I didn’t know that guys struggled with loneliness and insecurities about appearance like I did.

Getting to the point, I found one interactive space linked to such communities where there was a group of people who were nice to me at first, called me funny and smart for the first few months. I ended up talking to a guy and we got into a toxic friendship thing because I’d call him up on sexualising underage girls and he’d tell me it’s a joke and that I don’t understand humour but then he’d keep making the same posts and they were serious. Sometimes he’d admit that he preferred underage girls, then when I’d say he liked them he’d say I’m accusing him of committing a crime and would say he doesn’t like me viewing him in a bad light. (He ended up dating an underage girl a year later too, when he would tell me that he’d never date an underage girl.) He would also encourage me to act overly attached to him, for ex I made accounts to contact him when he’d block me during arguments (which  I know is wrong, I regret it and will never do something like that again) and I’d beg for him not to cut contact with me and then the next day I’d ask if he wants me to stop being so clingy, if he finds me creepy and he’d say no, he liked what I did and found it sweet and that it showed I genuinely did like him. This happened multiple times. We then stopped talking and he told the group everything that had happened but instead spun it into me being obsessive and him having never liked me (even though we spoke regularly, he told me he spoke to other girls but I was the only close female friend he had, he tried to meet with me many times and I’d be the one putting it off, he’s the one who introduced the idea of us having sex, he told me he wanted to meet even if I didn’t want to have sex), I was sexually obsessed with him and he rejected it (he’s the one who’d initiate all conversations about sex), he showed them all screenshots of the accounts I made. He told them details about my personal life and trauma and laughed about It to them too. He also reached out to me months later, apologised for everything and said he wanted to be friends but he’d continue to lie to me when I’d ask if he’d been talking about me (he had) negatively and why he does or says certain things, so he just called me crazy for noticing his lies. 

The group bullied me, they’d all constantly be talking about me in voice recordings and group chats (other people told me about this), they’d spam pictures of me, they kept calling me insane when I’d respond (I would just keep repeating the same argument that they didn’t know anything about me and were targeting me for no reason), they would even start talking about me to new members who joined the group and those people would hate me and start attacking me too. They’d also claim that I take things too seriously and that it’s a joke but they were needlessly and relentlessly bullying me when I hadn’t done anything to them. I can see the difference between a joke and evil behaviour. They also would save and post girl’s nudes, post people’s pictures without permission, obsess over underage girls (they’d done this from the start, yet they’d say they only did it as a joke because I would call them out on it and they wanted to annoy me, when in reality these men genuinely did find underage girls attractive and had been saying so before I’d ever even spoke out against it), dox people, they’d target other members of the group too but not as severely as they did to me. They would call me paranoid because I’d tell them to stop talking about me (they’d claim they weren’t even though other people showed me evidence they were.) They’d call me obsessive, yes I was obsessed with the guy but I was not obsessed with any of them as individuals, I’d only interact with them if they started on me for no reason. 

I know that these people are just losers but it still gets to me that they’d believe the lies from that guy and that they’d call me insane when they’d do a lot worse things than me and all I did was get upset and defend myself when I was being attacked. I never did any of the weird things they did, I simply tried to use logical arguments against them. There are even people who weren’t directly in the group who had originally liked me who started insinuating I was some crazy, ugly freak when again I hadn’t done anything. Not everyone thought this way though, I did have a handful of people tell me that they targeted me for no reason and I wasn’t the problem and they were weirdos. I also went to a few other communities where people had interacted with these same people and they called them insufferable too. I’d only stay in the community and keep going back because I wanted to defend myself and I thought eventually they’d see how weird they were being, and because originally I just liked posting my own content there because I was viewed as funny.

It just makes me cringe that I even care about this stuff and I want my brain to turn it off but I can’t. I just keep going over it all in my head, thinking about specific arguments and how I wasn’t even wrong at all (there was even one occasion where a girl had targeted me for giving her advice and then months later said that I was right) and there was nothing I could’ve said differently, how it’s unfair and weird that I was treated insane when I just hadn’t done much and there were other girls in that same community who were extremely malicious and cruel for no reason. I also hate that the guy lied about me and would act like I was the problem. He also spread lies about me, saying I’m a derogatory term for promiscuous women and I just want to be used by a random guy for sex (I’m an adult virgin), that My family are poor (my dad makes over 120k a year), I’m from a different county that I claim to be because he’d met one other girl from the same county who had a different accent? All the people there were extremely deranged yet they viewed themselves as normal and called me deranged it was weird 

**TLDR: I was unfairly targeted by a group of people online, because I made a mistake and I always took the bait, my brain is now obsessed with it. I left the group months ago but sometimes I can’t pursue my interests or hobbies because I think about everything that happened.**",2022-11-12 05:32:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667630969,9,/r/lonely/comments/ysxl3f/i_cant_stop_obsessing_over_having_been_unfairly/,,0,4,"I can’t stop obsessing over having been unfairly targeted by a group of cruel people.

Every memory that isn't a childhood memory, every object I own, almost everywhere I've lived, all my interests and activities in the world are deeply, deeply connected to her. My whole life is her.

The social world just wasn't important next to life with her, and other people feel so superficial and alien by comparison that it makes me feel nauseous.

I'm dead but living. I have family, but they are old and the fact this hurts them too, to see their son reduced like this, it is so tragic, being round them like a traumatised child at 35.

I'll glance around and look at the stuff I've accumulated as I've grown. Deliberating on what words to use, so that maybe someone will find what I have to say interesting.

I can be blunt in any situation, except when it has to deal with myself. I'm making a attempt. I'm not sure how complex of an individual I am. I feel like I have miss out on so much. I use to have a close family, but we've all drifted apart. They'll talk to me when they want to, but don't really care. I don't talk to my mother. Because I'm a disappointment. My father has been in and out of prison since I was 12, met him when I was 10. My brother has been in and out of prison since I was 18. I'm 36 years old now. My step-dad who raised me from a baby, and who my mother divorced by surprise when I was 16. Passed away a little over eight years ago. One of the only people I really felt like I could be myself around.

The few friends that I have tried to talk to. Feels like it falls on deaf ears. Then when those same friends start posting pictures of gatherings with friends and family. That some how excluded me, on multiple occasions. Knowing full well I was sitting at home alone, just wanting to be included. What are friends? I'm not sure anymore.

And to be at such a point, where you can't reach out. Cause you feel like nobody in the world will ever take the time to truly understand you. Some people will say, you are strong, you made through the worst. You can reach out and talk to me. I think to myself, I'm not strong, the worst is never over. Because it will never be the same. I am alone. Talking to someone about it, who will never be a part of my life. Doesn't help. It took me hours to find the words just to try and express what I'm feeling.

When I say it, I mean it because I been there for people so many times when they felt that way because when people who doesn't feel that way say it, they break their word and just say it to make you feel better. I had many ""friends"" throughout my life tell me that phrase just to lie to me about it because when I reach out to them for help or guidance, they don't reciprocate the feedback.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a childhood friend who knows my life and how badly I want to end it all and he told me ""i am always here for you bro, you can always reach out to me"" I felt happy to hear that from an old friend but every time I try reaching out to this friend to hangout because I feel its best to talk in person, I am always being left in the dust. Like on one of the days I tried hanging out with him because I wanted to ""reach"" out to him, he told me ""maybe bro, I might be busy with work"" which I understood because he has 2 jobs now and is trying to get his own house. But when the day I wanted to hang out came, he posted on his story about being at a party with his girlfriend... I mean I would have understood if you wanted to be with your partner because being in love is a beautiful thing in this world but to lie to me and then tell me you will always be there for me and if I need someone to reach out too then you would be that person just to keep declining me to reach out to you is ridiculous. 

I made a friend on reddit who also shared the same phrase with me and told me to reach out to her if I ever needed here...Well this ""friend"" eventually blocked me on snapchat then discord then reddit without telling me why... I even bought this ""friend"" a gift for their birthday because she claimed she never gotten a gift on her birthday especially from a friend, now it just sounds like bullshit to me after being blocked on the only communications I had with this friend. 

My ex even said this phrase and said that she will be with me no matter what. Whether its a crime or not.... just to find out I been cheated on and used....

From my experience, A lot of people use this phrase to take advantage of me and what I feel, its despicable and I hate the the bullshit behind it. 

But I am also happy to learn from these experiences, it keeps lonely people like me a reality check that 95% of the people in this world are like these people and keep their bullshit behind this phrase but a rare 5% of people in  this world actually mean their phrase. 

In the end I will die alone, I already know I will. I just want to isolate myself from family and friends and live in alone in another place just to die alone. I feel its better this way, I reach out to people and I am always being declined so what's the point of me to keep trying?

2372,yt3o0a,Curious-Leg2486,"I decided to share here too bc alone ppl could be use easier than ppl who has friends.

When i was just a teen girl was fan of a celebrity in my country he was most famous, don't ask me how, we (me and my sister) found his number, i was so excited to talk w him and nervous. First he answered i told i'm fan of him and just wanted to talk w him ... he told me i'm at studio will call later to talk more. I thought that's so amazing, i was pure teen never had boyfriend and no FRIENDS too, my only friend was my sister. I had no idea what will happen. Then after hours he called me back, he asked me ""What desire do u have of me?"" I was surprised, don't know what he means, so i told ""maybe teaching me some guitar"" and he replyed ""ok, but i mean something else"". I was under age just 14, and he realy wanted me to sex w him. Bc i was living in little city far away of him, he did sext. As i told i didn't have anyone to share what's going on, there was nobody tell me that's not healthy, that's not good in addition the most worse part was he called me his girlfriend but changed his number doesn't give me his new number while i never called him myself or text him too much, in other world ghosted me then after mounths called me but w a number that was off most of the time and asked me for sext. Once he came our city, told me he is in hotel and wait for me, i have so strict family and couldn't go out without them, just thankful bc of this for once, i asked for going to concert but idk what i thought didn't have any courage to skip school and go to hotel, maybe i felt it's not good, my family told the tickets of concert is expensive, but always sad i was just fan of his musics and couldn't hear live till in pandemic he had free concert live in IG and i saw his voice is awful (i was his fan till first year of pandemic). Then i heared he is going to marry a DJ's friend. The next time he called i asked him what do u call this relationship and he didn't call me girlfriend, they denied his marriage, whereas uncle's of  the only friend i had by chance know him. The next time he called i didn't pick the phone even turned it off!
He is not famous now and i just know they play innocent, hide their reality, show something else.... they are good liers!  It made me be used by many other men. Also using someone who has daddy issue, parents don't try to understand her/his, never attention to mentl health and doesn't have any friend!!

The next one was most famous one and bc of my exprience i've never liked any celebrity. It was in pandemic and i decided to suicide. Idk what happened i found myself in his DM was wrinting about myself. I just wanted someone listen and he was only one realy listened. I thought it was accident, not true, many other negative things... till last year i asked something and he replyed. He was super polite and at the same time friendly, but bc of my exprience i had, panicked! That was shitest thing. He never crossed lines, even i told after a while i told about sexual atraction and he perefered to say nothing. Unlike all call him ass hole, all say he is shity person just bc he show realy how he is living, parties he is going even sometimes by accident u see popular celebs act they are so good ppl but actualy they are not. I think they don't know what actualy an ass hole looks like. Once i asked one why u calle him ass hole she told ""he treat girls around him like slut"" and i wondered bc girls around him hire by him to spend time and he never goes out of girls he hire. I think ppl like the one i asked never met an ass hole, user mf! They just compare him w a regular guy and what we expect of a regular guy.

particularly as my issues with food and body image can be triggered easily on a daily basis, waiting to talk to my therapist isn’t going to help me in the moment.

2393,yt823v,Introflective,"About a month ago I broke up with my gf of 5 years. 3 months before we broke up she went to another country for work and to fulfill her dreams. I was planning on proposing when I visit her. But that won't happen anymore, because she felt like I was holding her back; despite giving her everything I got for her happiness and fulfillment. During that time I also lost my job due to company budget cuts. I was just about to be promoted and started to get really close with my co-workers. Fuckin lucky aren't I? 

 All of my plans and vision for the future just went *poof* in only a few months. I had to go back to my home town because I couldn't afford to live in a big city anymore. Long story short I'm back to being lost, aimless, and feeling alone. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty fucking blessed. I've got a loving family and 2 friends (yes I only have 2, but they're the best) that love me very much, but I can't help feel lonely. I've got so much, but can't help but focus on what I've lost. But I am doing my best to be better.

I got a new job in a new town just recently. Doesn't pay as much and work is pretty dull, but I'm at least I'm not sitting on the couch and doing nothing. I also live alone which kinda sucks after living with someone you love for yeats. But I am doing better.

I've started working out, meditating, and praying more. Which keeps me from going insane. Keeping a journal also helps a lot! I'm starting to feel better and am gaining more hope for a better future. Anyway, just wanted to get this out of my chest and hope that if someone is going through the same thing I'm going through, that you wouldn't feel so alone. I'm here. Feel free to talk to me about what troubles you and hope that you'll do better. We can get out of the pit of loneliness together!

2395,yt8i8k,Rantscallion,"No, nothing sexual, okay.

My back was hurting all the time so I had to get it checked. It felt like a normal lazy bum back pain but it's only on my right side lower back area and even doing mundane things hurt.

I never had that before so it scared me (I used to regularly lift weights, eat right and sleep 8 hrs when I was in college ok) Turns out my spine is straight but tilted a bit to the right because my hips aren't symmetrical. 

Anyways, I threw money at it because why the fuck not I'm sick of the pain and well got into the whole physical therapy session.

My physical therapist was a nice woman. Like, very polite and seems to love what she does. She seems to know all the names of the stretches word for word and is very careful and considerate all the time. 

She always tried to converse but at the same time she seems to understand I'm one of those silent types that like to keep distance and she respected that.

I find that very charming, I wish I wasn't such a weirdo but I am so god damn miserable I wish I could be with someone like that.

Now I think to myself

I've gone did it

This has to be close if not already rock bottom for my mental health. I don't know.

The woman was only doing her job and she's amazing at it. I hope she gets promoted soon or whatever but anyway the point is

I am so deprived of affection that being exposed to a stranger that cares for my health due to her profession reminded me of what it's like to matter.

And it irks me to know that it's such a parasitic behavior and I feel it.

Where do you even go from here?
I am so lonely. I'm financially stable enough to live but emotionally stupid to make it work and I carry with me a bag of traumas that came from events I have long forgotten.

Instances like this reminds me of why I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life.


I wish I could just find someone wonderful that maybe thinks the same way of me and I just want to give em all the affection and love I could give.

I'd gladly give 60 years of my remaining life just to experience real love for a year and then I die afterwards.

2428,ytenx9,Atanion,"I (32M) don't understand how people get to know people. I have a few “friends” in the area, but they never are free to do anything if I try to make plans. They invite me to things about once or twice a year. We never talk.

I have friends online, some of whom I talk to daily. But nobody in real life. I don't know how to find people who want to socialize. I'm insecure about that, but it's more than just due to insecurity.

I observe _constantly_. I'm nearly always aware of the people and conversations around me, but I don't know how or when it's appropriate to join in. They aren't talking to me.

This also extends to dating, especially so. I haven't dated anyone since 2014. I've asked a few women out, but none have been interested. I think I have good qualities for a romantic partner, but I'm so fucking cerebral that I have no idea how to get out of my head and enjoy interacting in the moment. I attach so much weight to everything that any interaction is a huge deal. And no one ever approaches me to talk. No one ever indicates any interest in me. I'm just not interesting, I guess.

I work from home and am not religious. (I have a lot of religious trauma which contributes to much of this.) I don't know where to go to meet people and make meaningful relationships. Even when I was a Christian, though, I had all these same problems trying to meet people, whether for friendships or for dating.

For probably 49 weeks out of the year, I'm content with this. Not exactly happy, but not really sad. I don't need people around me to be content. But then the seasons change and the melancholy washes over me. Or I watch some adorable romantic drama (in this case, _Extraordinary Attorney Woo_) and fall in love with the characters—and with the false hope that someone might be out there who can see my worth like that.

I feel a bit silly writing this post, but I don't want to burden my online friends with this, and there's no one to talk to IRL. I've gone to therapy off and on, but it doesn't substitute for friendships or manifest a girlfriend for me. I just need to vent.",2022-11-12 18:26:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1506696416,1,/r/lonely/comments/ytenx9/i_dont_understand_how_people_have_friends/,,0,0,I don't understand how people have friends

Downsides: would probably look uncool if I start coughing. Also lung cancer.

If you saw my post yesterday morning about being crazy lonely and day drinking you know I was pushing hard to find a good headspace. 
I had two tickets to a concert last night, but never found anyone to go with me. I had almost convinced myself to just blow it and stay home alone and feel sorry for myself. I ended convincing myself to get dressed for the concert and drive an hour and 20 to the venue.  
I scanned my ticket and found my seats. I opted not get a wristband that would have allowed me access to the bar area in the venue. 
When the opening act took the stage I had just about convinced myself that I didn’t belong and looking around seeing everyone there all paired off. I felt as if everyone in the venue was looking at me being there all alone I could feel their eyes and sense their judgement. Every time I looked up nobody was even looking at me.  After the opening act finished I sat down in my chair and gave myself a list of reasons I needed to leave. 
The lights went down and that first chord from the guitar rang out and I could feel that chord like a laser beam into my soul halfway through the first verse I was on my feet with my hands on the air singing at the top of my lungs with 20k other people. 
I stood and sang and hollered for two hours getting lost in the music and the moment and for the first time in months I felt alive and happy and healed.

The thing is... I self medicate with alcohol. People seem to love me when I'm drunk. My social anxiety is gone, I become outgoing, happy and affectionate.

The result is that after the last 10 years I'm almost exclusively invited to birthday parties and similar events. It breaks my fucking heart that my mind is so broken and I am unable to have a normal relationship, not even mentioning romance.

I have gone through therapies, was hospitalised for some time and am still on medication.

2464,ytk3s1,NotEvenBeyond,"I used to be alone for years, I was a quiet kid. I'm 21 now and I got another job finally after 2 years of being unemployed due to work trauma and other problems in my life. I got a good job, I work at a courtesy clerk at a grocery store and I'm really good at it, I'm more advanced than most of the courtesy clerks, I know how to use zebra scanner's and I am really good at customer service. Customers don't bother me at all. And all the managers trust me for reliable help.

But deep down I'm incredibly lonely. All I want now is to have a girlfriend or a partner to love and to hold in my arms. To make someone feel loved and special, of course I want the same thing from them which makes finding someone even harder. I want that feeling of vulnerability I deeply want to share with someone, I actually really value emotions and feelings, its the most nurturing thing a person can get, its powerful! Its what makes commitment beautiful. I just wish I could find someone who wants the same thing. 

You could say that I can just work on myself but in all honesty I've done alot for myself already, I have better self esteem, I lost weight and looking good,  I have a job, almost everyone I meet ends up liking me because of my charm and respectful kindness. I have pretty eyes and great hair, I'm 5'10 and very strong, I'm funny and smart, wiser and more logical than most 21 year olds. I'm loving, compassionate, empathetic, sympathetic, self aware, good natured, honest, charming, trusting, calm and I don't get angry at most things. I have a decently nice house to hang out at. Its just really baffling how I don't have a partner yet. I'm just tired working on myself because I've done so much already and I just want to move on from this chapter of my life and have a new chapter to spend it with someone new.

Its getting to the point where having a job is just kinda meaningless in my eyes, I have fun with my coworkers but I never hang out with them on my days off, I wish I could but never did.  I'm a private landlord on my property and making money at work is just money I have all for my pocket. Money isn't a motivator for me, which sucks. And no matter how many friends that I have, they never fill that hole in my heart for love, we can't hold each other in bed at night. I remember I had a long distance relationship that made me feel happy despite it being long distanced, I could go to work for as many hours as needed and the hours would go by fast by just thinking about them. But it being a long distance relationship just made it hard for her, despite her messaging me every other month for my affection which at this point just feels saddening for me because it always ends in a few weeks to a month, then the cycle continues until at this point now that I don't want heartbreak anymore. I've missed days from my job due to the loneliness and I don't know if I even want to keep working at this job anymore, but if I do quit, I'll lose a good source for a potential chance in finding a partner. But at the same time, I just want to hide at work at this point because really, I just kinda accepted that I probably won't find a partner at work

tldr: I'm a good worker and a good potential boyfriend, but been feeling really lonely and baffled because I can't find a partner, its getting to the point where the loneliness is making me want to just quit my job. I need help or guidance of what to do, or just maybe affirmations from others at this point.",2022-11-12 22:19:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1568003249,4,/r/lonely/comments/ytk3s1/i_cant_work_because_im_bored_tired_and_just/,,0,3,"I can't work because I'm bored, tired and just painfully lonely for love"

2470,ytkrfy,cow-with-a-phd,"I feel I've been a negative influence in the lives of anybody I've ever met. Even my parents, my family and anybody who ever dared to call me a friend.
At the moment I don't have anyone to share my feelings with, so I'm writing here. I'm not suicidal/at risk, please assist someone else if you have to choose.

Physically, I make people uncomfortable when I'm around them. I don't make them feel welcome. I'm not sure why that is, but it happens 100%. I'm above average in looks but it might be due to posture. I have nobody to talk to here so unsure how to get this settled and work on it. I live in my college, more than a thousand km from my home. I also don't have anyone beyond my 3 family members at home to talk to.

People I've met with have gone on to develop strong personalities and achieve greatness in many aspects. But that's only once they've left me. And I feel they were at their lowest when they knew me.
Once people start feeling a little bit closer to me, I become cold and start pushing away. I tend to prioritize work over relationships. So I'm not asked out after a couple of attempts. And being in the same place for a while now, I've reached the point where no one tries.

People have always had high expectations from me. And I'm stereotyped as the quiet kid who studies all the time. I don't - I have a good track record, but the cracks have begun to show and that doesn't define me anymore - I'm dumb. The discomfort used to be acceptable to people as a tradeoff for what they considered was intellect.

I don't follow up with people or tell them random things or ask them out. I feel I'm not genuine when I talk with them. I find myself constantly analyzing what they're saying to best ""react"" to it (not even act in self interest, just trying to please). So it feels like some sort of a public persona takes over when I talk to most people.

I don't want to be cold. I want to hang out and talk. Dine with people. Play a single player videogame. Or decipher the meaning of some composition. Talk about ambition and the trends of the legs of a millipede. And create lore about our college or build something together. In particular, I feel I lack on caring about people, so I fail to understand their problems and their feelings. Please let me know if you have some advice.

I also have trouble picking people - people approach me and it's not the other way round. Does it matter, choosing your company? How do you go about it?

I've begun journalling and that seems to be helping understand what I do a bit but I fail on the people part at the end of the day.

========

I typed this for no reason, you can skip it. It's what I think of my interactions with people who've stuck for a while in my life.

S: my showing him things I do causes him to lose focus every time in his life and try and do the same thing eventually which hurts his long term progress

A: i was never a good brother to him. We have many memories together but at some point we drifted apart and I think it was my anger and my need for control that caused it. I've ignored his feelings through most of my life. I miss him dearly, but a decade ago back when he was in my company, I wonder how my coldness would've made him feel every single day of his life. I remember how much he cared for me.

My parents: they seem to have had fun back in their time, but since I've grown up I feel my personality and laze has rubbed off on them. I feel their lives don't have much going on, I can count Mom having one friend outside of family. And Dad having 3. My grandmother calls me every once in a while and most of that conversation is either silence or her asking me the usual questions. She really cares for me. But I've never been able to reciprocate it. I'm afraid career wise by the time I'm ready she might be no more.

A': he's given me advice through the years in college but the first thing that I did when he discovered that he smoked was run away, I could not figure out how to process it.

S': he was the coolest friend I had, but I never treated him like one. He shared his emotions with me many times but I never shared mine, except anger in the second year when his priorities differed and I set too high expectations for him to meet. When he didn't I was angry and ignorant. In first year, I mistook his attempts at humor as bullying.

I'm a bad judge of character. The people I think are good end up treating me like a blackbox for their purposes, the ones that I think are bad end up being textbook good people on the surface.

V, Y: he used to imitate me and my habits. I had problems with this back then since ""I valued my individuality"" (I was a prick). I eventually developed a negative emotion towards them. (V: And mentioned this to a person I thought was good, who twisted and relayed this back to them for their gains.)

S': we used to talk for hours. But I treated her like a blackbox, as someone I had to amuse than someone with feelings and ambitions. We haven't talked for 2 years. We pretend we don't recognize each other anymore.

R: he calls me every few months and has shared his life's happenings with me. It's always him that calls and I have no idea why. I try to take notes but I don't remember things about him. Or think about him. I thought of asking him why he bothers but haven't yet.

P: I withheld what I thought back when it mattered about a life decision he took. I tend to sway people's opinions so I'm not sure whether that is a good thing since he wouldn't have thought rationally (on his own). I hurt him also physically a couple of times, unintentionally, when we were in school, though he would not have realized it then - so I'm unsure why he stayed in company with me. Him with the 2 others I meet once a year with, there is no commonality between us. So I don't know how we ended up still in touch.

Women I've talked to, even fleetingly, have tended to be insightful about my life. One spotted my tendency to be selfish (childhood), another about my lack of self esteem, another about not savoring success, one about my loneliness - the first three after observing a couple of times, the last one - she never even talked to me, just heard about me from my roommate. With any of them, I never talked again however.

“I’m hard to love”
“I’ll be forever alone”
“I don’t want much”

After I did my short timeout from Reddit, I realized that I don’t even know how to love myself and I wonder where I got these thought processes from…

From TikTok to Reddit, everyone complains about being lonely (and I don’t blame them shit sucks) but you are what you consume. If you read about everyone’s lonely endeavors regularly, you start to dwell in thoughts that don’t belong to you. Social media has put way too many thoughts in my head that just damage my self image.

Idk I’m just ranting and don’t know any of your situations (so who tf am I to say) but find ways to love yourself. I know thats cliche but it’s true. If you believe loving yourself depends on how others love/perceive you, then shit :/ there’s the issue I guess.



Edit: I know internal issues exist because I have crazy mad trust and abandonment issues, but those shouldn’t define you. Trauma sucks but you have to walk with it. I let past experiences define my new ones and now I have no one to share memories with. I don’t know if I ever will but when I find someone, my bad days will mean so much more and the new ones will be priceless.",2022-11-12 23:51:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603346223,258,/r/lonely/comments/ytm797/this_sub_is_nothing_but_a_downward_spiral/,,2,78,This sub is nothing but a downward spiral.

But recently I’ve been going on dates and getting stood up, or blankly just blocked with no explanation after what I think is a fantastic conversation. This last time hit me harder because I take fwb  seriously. I value my friendships to the extent where I drop what I’m doing that’s making me happy for the happiness of my friends. This one guy in particular became a great friend of mine and recently just blocked me on everything. I don’t understand why I didn’t do anything wrong or out of the ordinary at all. After he blocked me I took a look at my actual friends list and realized I had two friends left… and I began looking at all the other “friends” that had blocked me that I had agreed to be fwb with and honestly idk what’s wrong with me. I know it’s bad to give in to fwb but I do it way too often and I get blocked right after way too often. I don’t understand why I can’t just be told what’s wrong with me instead of just being blocked.

Now, that chasm is smaller but I still feel an almost painful emptiness because I still am having a hard time finding friends.

My family tells me that if I ignore the painful emptiness, stop talking about it, and stop dwelling on it; it would go away and I would have the friends I seek. This hasn't happened.

I also feel like it's kinda my fault cause I vent really frequently (mostly in a channel that's meant for venting) and I wonder if people just got tired of putting up with me. Apart from that, I just have a general sense that my friends are getting distant from me, or moving on without me, or worse, that they... just don't like me that much anymore.

I don't know, my friends have their own lives and I'm really happy that they're growing up and becoming themselves. But... the pessimistic part of me can't help but think bleak stuff like this, that the people in my life are getting bored of me and are drifting away, that new friends I make would like me and stick around for a while, but then they'll get bored too. I feel like I need to critique myself as well here, cause I've noticed a tendency to feel bored with new friends I've been making.

The worst part of me writing this is that I don't even want advice, I just want people to hugbox me like the fragile narcissist that I am. My friends are wonderful, and I'm so thankful they're in my life and for being there for me. I just... get sad about this stuff. Maybe I just want to believe that I'm likable, that I'm worth sticking around for, that people who are important in my life continue  to want me in theirs. I kinda want all my friends to give me a group hug and tell me how much they appreciate me and how much they want to keep me in their lives.",2022-11-13 05:40:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1501042419,2,/r/lonely/comments/ytt0ci/are_people_tired_of_me_vent/,,0,1,Are people tired of me?

Not sure if I'm lonley or depressed. Maybe both. Maybe loneliness is causing  depression. I'm single but I'm okay with that. I have friends but most of them are in another state. I'm close with my family and I see them everyday. Sometimes I just want someone to talk to. But it seems like everyone I meet has ulterior motives. I know there are genuine people out there. Some might say ""well maybe your just bored"". Im not bored, I keep busy and I have hobbies. I enjoy my own company.  Most likely it's depression creeping up on me. I just needed to vent a little.

I keep on having these angry thoughts. I'm angry that I got taken advantage of by someone that i cared so much for. It ruined my whole trust and feeling of safety that it's so hard to be the same way again even with the people in my life who didnt do anything to hurt me.

I don't wanna be this negative or bitter, but it's all that I'm feeling and I can't control it. I wish I never met him.

I’m 15 and I know I’m very lucky, I have quite a few friends at school who I talk to when I’m there and sometimes they let me go out to places with them. They often use me for school work And I think that’s mostly why they let me stay but everything considered it’s understandable of them. Recently I was walking home with two of them and I realised how they had quite a few people who they were really close to and trusted and had mutual care for. I realised I don’t really have that, I used to be quite close to my father, I was probably closer to him than anyone else throughout my life since my mother and siblings have always been quite emotionally distant and I hardly had any social interaction when I was younger. But around two years ago my father started to hallucinate from stimulant abuse, mostly meth, and he would always accuse me of lying to him and planning to kill him. We were separated by social services about one year ago.
At school, most of my friends are girls and are quite emotionally mature but I still often feel distant from them. I understand that I could do a lot more to improve this and I’m trying my best but it still hurts to feel so alienated from other people. This isn’t that bad of an issue that I have compared to many other people here  but I still wanted to just say something and express how I feel. I’m trying to do better and I know this will probably sound stupid but I honestly often feel like there isn’t really any hope and that there’s something innately off putting about me and so I’ll always feel like this.

There are a lot of people here with much more or much less serious issues with loneliness, and I admit I can sometimes feel a sense of bitterness with more fortunate people. So please understand that experiencing loneliness is quite relative and it can be difficult to make an accurate judgement with just superficial info like what I’ve said here.",2022-11-13 06:50:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660831457,8,/r/lonely/comments/ytu725/i_realised_im_not_that_really_close_to_anyone/,,0,0,I realised I’m not that really close to anyone.

I'm not normally a very lonely person, but my life has gotten really screwy lately. About a week ago, I was admitted to the hospital for an emergency vascular problem. At first, my long-time girlfriend stayed with me in the hospital and took care of me as my strength came back and my pain medications were worked out. The situation and the uncertainty were really stressful for both of us though and we started to argue a lot. Today, she decided to leave (maybe for good; I don't know), which is probably the right decision. Also today, though, I learned that my medication isn't working very well and I'll need to stay here for at least another week to adjust dosage. I don't have many friends and I haven't told anyone else that I'm in the hospital. Don't want people to worry about me or feel sorry me.

I'm feeling so lonely just lying here in the bed not knowing how long I'll be here or even what's going on outside. Depression is starting to set in and I'm beginning to feel hopeless and having some dark thoughts. Does anyone have any advice about how to deal? I know I'll be discharged eventually and while a few days ago I was looking forward to being discharged, right now it's just not even something that brings me any happiness or hope.",2022-11-13 08:24:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1668327212,5,/r/lonely/comments/ytvopm/lonely_in_the_hospital/,,0,3,Lonely in the Hospital

I would be out of the cycle see everyone around me struggle and I will feel motivated to try it myself. I loved it at first and the first 4 months went smoothly I was good I didn't have my dark thoughts and even if they intervened I took a day out and re focussed again but in August I went on a two week vacation with my family and then suddenly everything changed they got accustomed to my absence and thought it was better that way. I saw my smoking buddy walk away from me and when I asked he replied he just wanted to be alone and I gave him time but he stopped getting involved with me. I heard later from other common circles that he thinks I am different person than he originally thought I was and when I confronted him he just said ""Idon't know lemme be myself"", and I stopped bothering everyone. Both of my roommates can care less if I dropped dead right now. My family is something I don't wanna return to I am taking my term-break off and staying here and not returning home.

 His name is not actually Luke, but it helps me write down my thoughts. I read it out loud, just to vocalize it, and that version is attached at the bottom. 

—

Dear Luke, 

Hi. I hope your day is going well and you’re feeling happy. 

I don’t really know how to communicate my thoughts verbally. I think it’s something I’ve always struggled with, but you already know that. I think it’s why we get along so well. Because we both just ramble and somehow piece the little fragments together into whole thoughts and we understand each other completely.

This is never going to reach you. I’m not going to let it. But I need to voice it out loud, at least once, to someone or something other than myself because I just can’t do this anymore. I can’t do this to myself for much longer. 

I want you. I know I shouldn’t want you. Because that’s selfish of me and it’s the last thing you need in your life right now. But every time I hear your voice, every time I look into your ocean blue eyes, I hear the waves crashing into my heart and sweeping away any sense and it takes everything within me to keep it together. And every time, I feel so guilty for feeling this way because I know you didn’t ask for this. But neither did I. 

 Maybe it’s because you’re the first person in four years that I just understand completely, that you’re the only person I’ve been thinking of this much ever since I gave up on relationships. I’ve been trying really hard to just be a good friend, to be there for you when you need someone to pull you back from that dark void, but gosh I think about you so much it hurts. Whenever I check up on you and you don’t respond for hours, I get so worried about you and I want to drive over to make sure you’re okay. I want to kiss your cheek, to take you in my arms and hold you until you’re okay, to make everything go away until it’s just us in the world. 

That one night that everything fell apart, I just wanted to hold your hand and wait it out with you. But that felt so selfish, and I feel guilty for even feeling this way when you’re at such a low point in your life. It kills me to see you in so much pain, and it hurts even more to pretend that I’m okay when I’m helping you get through it. Because I have no right to hurt this much when you’re going through so much. I have no reason to feel so strongly for you. 

You haunt every corner of my life. I’ll be grocery shopping and next thing I know, I’ll be adding candy to my cart because it’s your favorite and you always perk up at the sight of candy. Every night before I fall asleep, I touch the beanie you gave me that’s always on my night stand. And every day I wake up, I find myself wondering what it would feel like to have your arms around me with your sleepy breath tickling my cheek. 

Every time your name pops up on my phone, my heart skips a beat and I have to make sure nobody noticed. Because if people start picking up on my feelings, I know you’d just get more anxious and stressed and you don’t deserve any more negativity in your life. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is I feel guilty for wanting us to be more than this when I know what you’re going through. And I know the best thing I can be for you is Friend A, the person who’s there for you when you have those dark nights where you feel suffocated by this city and you just need to leave. I know nothing I say to you gets through to you. And still, I want to say the nicest, most comforting things to you in hopes that maybe a tiny sliver of it will get through and you’ll feel at least a tiny bit better. Better enough to eat, to brush your teeth, to go to bed. 

Maybe I’m being selfish. And maybe it was never meant to work out in the first place. I mean, you’re a soft speaker and I have a hard time hearing what anyone says the first three times they repeat it. But still, I want it to work even though I won’t allow it to happen. I don’t want to influence your decisions in any way when you’re so vulnerable. 

But I care about you. I care about you too much for someone who’s just playing Friend A in your life.
I want, more than anything, for you to be happy. And if it means I have to play Friend A for the rest of our friendship, I’m more than happy to do that for you. But I care about you, and I need to say it. 

I just got a text from you. You’re doing okay, your day is better than yesterday. I can go to sleep relieved now. Good night, sweet dreams. I’ll see you tomorrow.

Recently I had a break up after a relationship of 5 years. And now I find myself alone, with no family, no one to talk for months...  
My birthday was last week and I got not a single call from anyone.

The days are just a cycle of work and sleep. I find no joy on anything anymore.

  
I don't know what to do. I tried Discord, but I can't make friends there either, I feel too old.

I have really nerds hobbies: Videogames, anime, manga, etc... Finding IRL a girl my age who shares those hobbies looks almost impossible and makes me despair about the future.  


If anyone is in a similar situation or just who wants to chat a bit, it would be really appreciated.

Can't blame them because I have never shared a single problem completely so they might think it happens with them also because I just can't bring myself to share such personal things with anyone. I don't trust anyone because I have seen people sharing others secrets to me so how can I trust them with mine. Maybe you won't share something now because I'm your friend. But will you respect my secrets when we got into a bad fight?. That's what stops me to open up . I'm no Saint. I have hurt people. I have left them, ignored them without any reason. I haven't been a good kid to my parents and family. Looking back I'm good for nothing. Recently I did try to make some desperate attempt it didn't get me anything than humiliation to myself. It's just bad and terrible. Even while writing this, I'm not happy with myself. Writing this makes me feel like a loser who can't Live happily like everyone else. Looking at the mirror I can only see a failure who keeps failing at everything.
 It's not new to but before people didn't knew I was miserable. I was good at hiding my emotions. As I grew older and with the help of alcohol. My control on these emotions grew weak. Now most of the people around me knew things that I was trying to hide
Now the damage is done. what can I do know? Still sit around and cry like a fucking pussy or stand up and move forward. Give up my potential because of what I and others think. 
I have given many thoughts on things and one of them was nothing matters in this universe. Just look at this universe it's infinite. We are nothing on cosmic level. Other was : I got in this world without my will. In this place where I found nothing but suffering of me and others around me. People full of hatred and never ending conflicts. All these years and humanity learnt nothing from its history and experience. the list Never ends. But what can I do? I have no control over all of this. I can only ignore all of it and make peace with suffering of me and everything that makes this place like hell. 
I have to get out of it and I need someone who understands what I'm talking about. I need someone who wants to change like me. Who wants to fight and not give yet. I don't want to give up. I atleast want to put a fight with all of this and win. If you feel the same as me. Lets help eachother to get over this phase of life and change ourselves. Dm me. I'm really looking forward to make a friend. We can help eachother out.",2022-11-13 17:58:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1578665221,3,/r/lonely/comments/yu8wkc/im_lonely_just_like_everyone_else_here/,,0,1,I'm lonely Just like everyone else here.

They left me on the street to die and they didn't care one damn bit about what was going on with me and no one ever cared to ask.

I never had a girlfriend or even someone besides my family, that just holds me in their arms, just to get rid of my armor and mask I put on every day. I tried going out and interacting with girls, inviting them to grab a coffee and have a chill talk in the city and stuff but there was never a very serious ending with it. Last thing I was told by a girl was: “You really don’t fit in this world, huh?” What does that mean? What does it need for people to see, that not every man is that instinct driven mental monster that gets everything done he wants to?

We didn't talk for a long time, probably a little over 2 months. But we would be talking for literally hours straight. And we told each other everything and we used to be there for each other. He was one of the funniest people I met and he gave the best advices. We truly knew so much about each other. 

He just stopped replying mid conversation. I have no idea what I did wrong. I lost another aunt a couple weeks after my older aunt passed away and I really wanted to text him and vent to him, but I know he will end up ghosting me again. I really hope I can find something just as kind and funny like him. Unfortunately most of the people I met here were pervs

Today I finally blocked him and removed his contact information, because I would be constantly checking when he was last online so I at least knew he was ""alright"" (alive).

2682,yuh4aq,Baridi,"So recap. I live in a homeless shelter in rural Kentucky. It's gotten better as some of the addicts have left but as I discovered the other night there was a hidden darkness in a lot of the residents. So the other night I was passing through the kitchen and another resident is repeatedly yelling that he's nobody's -Insert racial slur here that I will not repeat- because there were a few dishes in the sink left unclean. What I don't get is that he was yelling this to nobody in an empty kitchen and he was under no obligation to do the dishes. Well, I ask him politely to stop. He is the type of person, who if he finds something that bothers you becomes his favorite thing. So he not only continues but starts going up and down the halls yelling the obscenity over and over. Security has to come out and get him to stop.

Fast forward to yesterday. This particular dumbass works at the same grocery store as me. I was suffering from a bout of stomach bug and well let's just say I didn't want to wander far from the bathroom. So I called my boss. He told me to take it easy. I had the next day, today, off and I had plenty of time to recover. Well, the idiot in question proceeds to go in and go to the store manager, my boss's boss, and tells him I was faking or something along those lines. So I get notified I need to acquire a doctor's note or I am fired. Which, lacking health insurance I am unable to acquire without putting myself in debt. So I am effectively fired. 

Moving along to today. The same person has made it a point to bring up an extremely racist topic whenever I come out to the common room and I am just appalled at all the residents showing their bigotry so openly. I am not even sure any of them have even interacted with any minority at any length. I am pretty close to Corbin which was famously one of those Sundown towns. He made sure I feel isolated and alone in my complete lack of bigotry. I grew up in a pretty rural area of Iowa. Which was surprisingly multicultural and I grew up knowing that no matter who you were we're all coming from the same place. I will die on that hill. I guess I am just going to have to keep to myself and spend the rest of my time here as such.

2683,yuhb5x,Krupis69,"I (19M) am in love with my best friend (18F). She is pretty much the only friend that I have so she also is the only person with who I can talk about everything, but not about love. I can’t really talk about love with the person who I love knowing that she doesn’t feel the same way about me. That’s why I’m writing here. 

We’ve been each other’s best friend for the past 3 years now. For the first year we were together and we loved each other. But suddenly she broke up with me because she fell out of love. I didn’t even do anything wrong, I always did so much for her out of love, I always went out of my way to do something extra just to make her feel the happiest that she ever could. Even after the breakup she always said that I was perfect and that I didn’t do anything wrong. Yet she still lost the love for me. After that we remained as best friends. It was very hard for me, but it got better with time. I know that she moved on, but I never did. I never fell out of love like she did. I still love her just as much as i did two years ago. She always said that she still has some feelings towards be and that maybe in the future we could try again, but not now because she doesn’t have time for a relationship. She actually said this pretty recently, like a month ago. But then today happened. We hanged out and she said that she has been talking with some guy who she likes a lot. So I asked if her thoughts about being in a relationship have changed. She said that she doesn’t know. The guy is studying in Germany and when he comes back to Latvia (our home country) then maybe the would be in a relationship as she said. Hearing that just breaks my heart. If she’s happy then of course that’s the most important… but I still love her so so much and I just can’t bear thinking about her being with someone else. I know that it’s selfish but what can i do. I’ve been in love with her for three years now and sometimes I just hate it. It has been really painful being in love with her and it still continues to be painful. She perfectly knows that I still love her so i’m not really hiding anything.

I don’t understand why do I deserve this. Why does love hurt so much?

2717,yuln7f,boniie214,"First little thing/disclaimer before reading. I am not looking for pity or re-assurance, but besides that, lets get to it.

Hi, I am someone who is a young and still growing up but considering that, I have learned to much and have many feelings. I have been pretty messed up for a while ranging from friends straight up betraying me to my closest friend telling me to go kill myself and some stuff with my family when I was super young which in a way was the beginning of it all. I have been battling so much throughout my entire life so far and fighting depression without people knowing since I hide it to well (sadly). Due to this I often never seek help which just furthers to kill me from the inside out. I have never had someone to reach out to and whenever I find someone I push them away fearing I will hurt them, they will figure out to much, or we just drift away.

I have also been feeling very lonely. I often find myself sometimes listening to a song I have and when I think too much I will just curl in my bed and shed ghost tears. Whenever I see my friends with their girlfriend's or boyfriends I will often find myself messing around and having a ""jolly"" time when in reality I just want to walk out, go home, and curl into my bed. It makes me feel so sick to my stomach from this and not out of jealousy but just out of pure loneliness. It will usually lead to me going blank face and whenever someone asks me if I am alright I will automatically find myself saying ""Yeah, just thinking about life."" and flash the usually awkward smile of mine since people don't ask anymore questions.

I don't have many friends in my life. At least close friends anyway. My true friends are long gone and the current one I would have to say, I barley trust them and have just given them little hints and stuff like that. The closest person to me though is my brother and I haven't even told him anything in the slightest. Right now if I had to ask for anything, it would be to take my sorrows and mistakes away from me. I can't bear this weight anymore. Soon I will collapse if I am not rescued soon and when that happens, there is truly no return for me anymore.

If you have made it this far I would like to say something. I love making quotes and would like too share 2 out of the many I have made. This isn't an advertisement but if you would like me to make you one, I would be glad to :)

1. ""I am lonely, I am depressed, I am mentally fucked. But all is such and I have accepted it. Helping is useless, I am already to far gone.""
2. ""The simple things in life are what keep people going. No matter how big of a dream they have or small of a problem, we humans by nature find joy in the simplest of stuff.""",2022-11-14 01:55:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641900820,1,/r/lonely/comments/yuln7f/too_young_but_too_many_feelings/,,0,0,"Too young, but too many feelings."

2725,yumwoj,Fair-Elevator-1839,"I have never pursued a relationship in my life. Are they worth it? I honestly have not seen too much of an appeal until as of late. I have found someone in perhaps a similar position to myself. We grew up in the same area, but were separated by an expansive concrete jungle. We also have similar tastes and some similar personality traits. That said, she did pursue a relationship once and was wronged horribly (the person who this individual was dating was a hedonist; it is a long story how I know, you can ask in the comments if you wish).

These things take a while to heal, I know that much. It has been going on three months since the breakup. But before I even decide to go along with it, should I no longer be lonely. Is it right to do so. I feel that I am extremely unappealing (uneven shoulders, overweight, food allergies, oily complexion and a fungus that causes red patches on my face \[not even my mother loves this face, ha-ha\]). My only saving grace would be my academic performance, but in contrast, I have a poor grasp on emotions (an undescribed autistic condition that was recorded when I was a toddler, alongside observed dygraphia), so I would guess this is a scenario where E.Q trumps I.Q.

Again, I must repeat myself, is this worth it? It does not seem like I am capable of being a stable enough individual. I have never seen much of a point in relationships prior to now either, but I am sure it is just a passing thing.

Maybe it’s because it’s closer to finals but i just keep screaming at everyone and I cry randomly. In the past ive only had to seclude myself slightly from my friends and family so i don’t get overstimulated but now it’s every time i go around them I become very reactive and upset. Words can’t explain the guilt i feel because of how i act and unfortunately i think myself and everyone in my life is getting used my actions.

I do not like the church because I grew up seeing the church turn away people who needed help (Catholic and christian churches). However ever since I left the religion I don't feel complete because I do believe in a God but I did not like how the Priests acted towards those in need. As a child I always wanted to travel the world, not for pleasure and see its beauty (well kinda) but to learn different languages and speak to those who have different religions like the Buddhists, synagogues, Mosques etc. Because I always enjoyed how different viewpoints can differ but all stem from a main aspect of being a good human being.

My life has been a really difficult Journey that I wouldn't wish on any I don't know how I made it this far or why but if I'm supposed to be a pawn in God's games I wish he'd hurry up and let me play my part so I could be done I'm trying to play along I'm trying to be patient but I'm so miserable. Why couldn't I be loved what was wrong with me why am I so dysfunctional why do I try so hard? I really don't understand all this I'm sure I'm not really supposed to, but I'm trying to at least deal with it and I'm not doing so well I'm done everything in my life and I've been good at 80% of it but I'm not good at I'm at least good enough to get through it but my time is up here I don't have friends I don't have family the closest thing I've had to love I either pushed away or ran away from even though it's what I want more than anything. I guess I just want to go as far away from people as possible and just die peacefully it hurts so bad and I'm so lonely and I just wish I'd never happened my mom did not understand when I asked her why she did this to me and her only answer was I wanted a kid why did she have me and then give me up to a man that all he saw when he looked at me was her why would you do that to somebody why would you take somebody with a little baby that they don't even want and then have them raise the kid it's like being born to a pack of coyotes you weren't really born from the coyotes they just ate your mom directly after the birth so you never even knew she was there and from the very first day you can remember coyotes are all that's ever been there for you and I guess that's kind of the story of me except for they were wolves not coyotes. In love? Is there such thing what I found out is that when I give my all nobody cares and that's okay I guess I only have one real thought if I'm supposed to be alone why does my heart feel so empty? I mean what exactly did I do to deserve this? I know everybody can't go through this this is just too good for me and a lifetime of misery and torture isn't enough then what's next what do I have to look forward to and Eternity of being alone? Just saying that cuts Me Like a Knife it makes my heart hurt I wish there was a medication I could take to just never be here again my first marriage was too much of an evil woman who stabbed my heart over and over and over and still to this day says I'm the bad guy? My second marriage I was the bad guy, take it out everything from the first marriage on the second one. And my second wife was the best woman I've ever known, but I was in a 13-year alcohol induced a coma you know walking dumbass syndrome, and I should have gotten over the first one first. But I'm dysfunctional and I don't know how to properly separate things in my head. No one ever taught me and no one ever took the time to care. Now my third marriage never happened and she was a pretty damn good woman too and she was a lot like me she was damaged from her marriage as well and she had a big heart that loved everybody but she didn't feel like she was good enough even though she was. But I would never blame We can big hugs daddy loves this big hug from his big guy her for my dysfunctions it's not her fault that my family did this to me it's not her fault in an end that was fairy tale we would have been there for each other. But it turns out in a relationship between two damaged Souls is doomed to fail. I might not be the case but anything to do with me has failure at the end. I'm going to do the best I can to stay alive till my natural end but as I sit here with a locked and loaded 9 mm the only question that keeps going through my head is what company makes the best tasting bullet. And I wonder if I can take everybody's pain and misery into myself first so that at least once I'm gone everybody else will be free from the pain and the suffering of this world.
I guess in the end as I let you go I only have one real big thought does anybody anybody out there nowhere a dysfunctional guy can find a place where he fits in and maybe one day know what it's like to truly be loved and to not be alone or is this dragon of myth that hundreds of men over the years have Journey to the ends of the Earth to just disappear alone unfulfilled and unhappy? I mean should I hope and pray that there is a place out there for me I just haven't found it yet? Will I ever be loved? Will that day ever come that I notice that I'm not alone anymore? Did I do whatever it was that has brought this punishment was I evil was I just an a****** cuz I maybe was not there? Is this torture in pain to make up for a past wrong that I don't even know about or may I didn't remember? Is my heart or my head broken or are they both broken? Give anything to go back in time and that's funny because I'm always been one that said I didn't want to go back and change anything cuz I'm truly blessed and I didn't want to take the chance of losing what I'd have but that was before and now I can't look at myself in the mirror.

I just failed my life. It was all because of my decisions, actions and lack there of. I cut off from my friends and society and spending time in my room most of the time. This is in part because I couldn't face it. Whenever I see other people and society at large, all I see is a manifestation of my own failures in life.

2789,yuwau1,Suunfoxxx,"I've dealt with my fair share of loneliness and as you all know, it's just sad. Recently, however, I've been thinking about having a large group of friends and how that would go for me? 

To be honest, it would drain me. It's been really hard to accept because throughout my life I always wanted popularity and to be known and liked. Instead, currently in my mid 20's I'm realizing that having very few friends is what really works for me. It allows me to be invested in people at a capacity I can handle. 

I wanted to ask, could this be a thing people who've dealt or are dealing with loneliness go through?? We want community, and people to talk to and friendship, but we also want the ability ( or is it convenience) to still have a part of ourselves to and for ourselves? 

I was scared of it for a while but I think embracing loneliness can work. That way any friendships formed are meaningful, and there's a sort of confidence that can come from it. 

If you have any experience with accepting loneliness, I'd love to hear how it's gone for you.",2022-11-14 11:19:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637331339,7,/r/lonely/comments/yuwau1/lonely_but_learning_to_like_it/,,0,1,"Lonely, but learning to like it??"

It’s a girls’ school prom, people are having fun dancing out there but I feel like I don’t really fit in. It feels awkward when I stand in the ballroom while everyone else is dancing and jumping, and I don’t really want to ruin the mood.

I’m in a table with my friends, or so I think are friends, since I don’t really feel much of a connection with them or anything more than people to talk to for a bit. 

Perhaps they are my friends but maybe I’m just really introverted. So far, I’ve never felt a really bonded relationship with anyone, if that’s possible in the first place, like shown in anime. 

So what should I do? I feel lonely. Should I pursue new hobbies? Find new friends? Has anyone gotten by without having friends? Is that ok? Is there something wrong with me? Maybe I’m not putting enough effort.

2811,yv2hpx,Illustrious-Pack7113,"I have family, a partner, kids and coworkers, all sorts of people around me. I have a career and a place to live and car and the means to mostly do things I want to do. But my marriage is a joke and I can't talk to anybody. For as long as I live I felt like I just thought differently, I felt like I was wired differently. Recently I found out that I'm likely autistic and that's probably a reason.

People come to me when they have something that bothers them or that they need help with. But when I try to go to them for help, they just don't know, or worse, they give the obvious answers that go nowhere or even worse than that, they just tell me to ""hang on there."" Even going to counseling, focus is on my partner, I'm just there on the sideline, told to let them go through the process, they didn't even know I had a sibling 6 months in, cause there wasn't that much reason to discuss my needs. I've seen several therapists to try and figure stuff out, the answer is always, ""you're doing all the right stuff."" Or the worst one made me feel like a guinea pig, they wanted to continue the therapy just because I was such an interesting case.

All in all, there's barely anybody that will give me the time of day. People are nice enough, don't get me wrong, but when I'm in trouble, that's just my problem. In the end, I can't have an off day. My partner goes off saying what the hell is wrong with my. My parents tell me that I should just keep soldiering on. Everybody wants something or wants to tell me how to do things.

Then when I'm down, there's nobody to listen. Nobody that asks how I am. Nobody that takes the time, gives me a hug. Genuinely is there. Nobody that understands me or even attempts to understand me. I'm surrounded by those that claim they love me, yet here I stand, completely not understood, not acknowledged, not seen.

I know I don't have it a fraction of the trouble of others that deal with much more serious issues. But I'm just so tired of making room for everybody else. It feel at times that things would be no different if I were just replaced with an soulless empty robot, 'cause that's what I feel I am in the end.",2022-11-14 15:20:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629233373,6,/r/lonely/comments/yv2hpx/im_surrounded_by_people_and_yet_i_feel_hopelessly/,,0,25,I'm surrounded by people and yet I feel hopelessly alone

2834,yv7wy4,The_Heef,"41, male, haven’t been in a serious relationship since before Covid was a thing.  
  
I keep going through this cycle of wanting to get back out there and then getting no matches, or just rejections, or maybe in a blue moon I match long enough to introduce myself before I’m ghosted. I joined running groups with the hope of meeting someone that way, but of course most of them are already in relationships. Managed one date, but now she and I don’t talk much because her work schedule is so bad. As if it isn’t bad enough that I’m too slow to keep up with the group.
  
I deal with some pretty serious mental health issues, and I try to work on them, but sometimes life just gets in the way and takes all of your money and leaves you with shitty insurance. I don’t think I’m a bad person, I just believe more and more that I don’t think I deserve love. And all I hear is “you have to work on yourself before you can be with someone.” If I see it in the comments I’m going to put one in my head here at work. The fuck you think I’ve been doing for the last decade? Miss me with that. But it makes me feel like I can’t be with someone until I’m basically cured. It doesn’t matter that I work on myself, women only want a finished product.  
  
So then I give up, and my depression gets worse, and then the cops show up at my door for a wellness check.

We are two strangers online that unless the stars align are probably never going to meet - be real with me. What are you into? What are your fears? What turns you on or off? What is the side of yourself your embarrassed to show? 

Let’s have a real conversation - whether it be fun, serious or upsetting. Let’s chat aliens, let’s chat filth to each other, let’s let our guard down and talk about things that actually matter to us personally? Not just things we feel obliged to ask because we have to break the ice first. 

I want real, I want unfiltered and unapologetic conversations and if I can’t find that here? Where will it be? 

Throw hate in the comments if I’ve posted to the wrong subreddit. I’m here because it’s an attempt to meet new people and I don’t know where I can and can’t post with no karma.

I'm taller, bigger, good looking, all the usual benefits of a sudden glow up within the last year. I even became very extroverted and I seem to be liked by people when with them, hell I even pick up girls and hookup somewhat regularly.

I am not happy though. I'm in an awkward position where I am still legally a child, but in an adult setting constantly.

I do adult jobs, I weld, work with wood, plumbing, etc since my family is in trades so I make good money and have good skills being learned.

The problem is that I'm a kid working with adults. Adults are cool with being friends with me but there is definitely a barrier since im underage not even 18 yet.

You'd think this is an easy fix, just work part time somewhere where kids my age work, but even then no there is a barrier.

By default their school friends take priority, im only the guy at work they like. Another barrier is I cannot relate to them at all anymore. All I have for responsibilities atm is my car, and make more money. They've got school, clubs, college, etc to think about, while I'm already kind of secure where I am.

It’s been I don’t I’ll say about it almost 1 year sense our relationship ended, we still talk from time to time but I was just spoiled by talking to her so much in a daily basis, but now it’s just a message per day or 6 hours. I know that she’s busy with her life, but I’m just so afraid of telling her how lonely I am, just so she wouldn’t have a interest in talking to me more ( she most likely knows because she said I should’ve had friends, and that at least one of the guys she’s interested in had a future ) but even as  keep telling her that I don’t like her nor want to ever start a relationship, and that I just wanted a message from her ( sorry if it sound selfish ) but it’s just I’m taking to a brick wall, she’ll say that she understands than the next day do the same thing again.

My phone stays quiet, if I don’t text first. My calendar would be empty besides Uni, if I wouldn’t use volunteering as a cooping mechanism. Volunteering gives me the feeling of being needed, wanted and desired.
Just today I had small talk with someone talking about looking forward to an upcoming event. In answering, I implied, that I was also interested. But with no success. I believe, I am not thought of, I am not wanted. Even direct approaches failed. If I am lucky, something is planned in a group chat, that I am in. Then I can do something with my spare time. But in the end, I always come home to my lonely dorm room with a quiet smartphone nothing else to do then working for uni or wasting my time on social media.

No comments, no ‘how are you doing’ no ‘what you do is amazing’ no compliments, no worrying. Nothing.

I need a place where I can unleash it, maybe it’s here…

Who nearly made me hate my best friend. Who nearly made me… you know… because she blamed me for something I didn’t do. Who thought I could read her thoughts so I could help her in her ‘problems’. Who never told me about any of her life. Who said I was to blame. Who said I was killing her because I said she was killing me. Who completely ignored anything about me. Who ignored me for so long. Who used my mental health against me. Who didn’t care about me. Who made me scared that I would loose important friends because of her.

2937,yvnpw1,ImThyg,"Hey there friends!  


I found out about this subreddit and after looking at some posts, I decided that I should vent myself too.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I am a Male 20, and also a college student. Since 2020 a lot of shit happened to me and my family, my dad passed away, my mom and I shut down the restaurant we had, and we are in a family dispute because of my father's heritage...

&amp;#x200B;

But this year has been so much worst when I thought things were getting better. Since the pandemic, the college went back to in-campus classes and I started doing friends I got a job and things were doing well... meet someone I thought was my best friend too, or so I thought, but since summer things went downhill, I got kick out of my job, the friends I thought I had left me and my best friend started ghosting me to now ignore me and just vanished for no reason, last time we spoke she said was having things hard and needed space and vanished.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a family fight with both sides since they started attacking my mom behind my back, I heard her crying in her room wishing she died already, and that was it for me, I fought with my grandparents the ones attacking my mom, and younger sister...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I only have them two, still unemployed and with no friends... funny because I am a caring and friendly person, always helping people, now I think people were just using me since I got 2 friends, especially my best friend jobs when they needed the most and like carried them throw college last semester... Now I changed classes but the people in my class... they are nice, but after all that I can trust no one, and now I just spend all my days alone at home or at the gym... the feeling is of defeat and just wished someone stayed by my side like I was when they needed.

everyone always left me, but he stayed

2939,yvnvql,Giron391,"I moved countries recently looking for better opportunities, of course. 5 months in I get this call from my best friend’s mom telling me to catch a fly to NY. I do. He dies within 3 days of me being there. I hadn’t seen him in 2y and this happens. I never knew his cancer had advanced that much. I thought I had something to look up to but nope, not anymore. No family, no friends. I went back to my stupid dorm in Canada to think about what the fuck just happened. 

I’m tired of having people tell me that they know how I feel and to just keep going. I CAN’T KEEP FUCKING GOING. 

I think it’s real easy for people that have things to look up for to keep going. 

I left everything and everyone to come here. Everything snowballed. I deserved this? Sure. I chose this. Blame me for leaving a place where I can’t be the musician I’ve always wanted to be since I will die of starvation before earning a penny. 

I gave it all and I have nothing left either here or there. I don’t know anyone. I don’t know what to do when I’m sad, or excited. I don’t know who to tell. I don’t know where to look at when I wanna game with a friend. I don’t know who to look for when I wanna have a drink. I don’t have nobody. 

Should this person be me? Fuck that. I haven’t went through all this to just sit there and let my own thoughts talk to each other. It’s not like every single flimsy friendship out there wasn’t killed by Covid anyways. 

What am I supposed to do when I was already so used to be so happy with this person and then they and everything I knew them for and from disappears?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired. I'm not just sleepy and need a good nights rest, however I do need that too. No, it's my soul that is tired. I have been through so much in the last 8 years that it changed who I am a few times over. The last 4 years have been the hardest. 

I fell in love with a woman and it's so hard to explain how much she meant to me. We grew up missing each other for years. She was a year older than me and we shared so much history without ever meeting. So when we finally did meet it was explosive. However, the relationship was shrouded in grief from her sister dying, and chaos from us both being addicts. She left and moved with her boyfriend across the country. She told me she had broken up with him months before this and even asked me to move with her. I wanted to so badly, but I had just found out my dad had cancer. 

She left me when I needed her most. I tried to move on but I was actively using everyday and then covid hit. Things got worse for me and I nearly died in a car crash where I flipped my car two and a half times. I decided to get my life back and put in the work. I got sober and got back in school. I was actually doing really well, and then my sister died. I fell apart for a while and took a semester off to grieve. I didn't start using again, and some good news my dad had all but beaten stage 4 cancer and is still in remission to this day. 

I found a counselor at school and she really helped me get back on track, and move forward again. I got all A's that semester. During the summer I did something I always wanted to do and worked as a lifeguard after getting my certification. It would've been better as a teen, as an adult it's kind of weird working with a bunch of barely postpubescent teens that still love gossip and laugh at sex jokes because half of them are still virgins. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sex joke, but they laugh for more childish reasons. Hell they still care about popularity and getting totally wrecked and all the drama of fucking high school. I guess I'm saying I had aged out of the whole thing. 

Anyways, this semester was quick to start but on track to be another great semester. I was doing well until a friend from the old days got out of jail and needed a place to stay. I said he could crash on my couch for a couple few days, but ended up kicking him out over a month later after mid terms because I was starting to be very effected by him staying with me. I also started a new anti depressant this year and it's made things better in some ways but my depression came back recently with a vengeance. 

One of the goals I've been working towards is being happy alone. I'm doing this for myself, but also so I can have a healthy relationship in the future. I accomplished this and for six months or so I was growing as a person and happy with spending my time by myself. The thing is that I started to get lonely. I've come to realize that I am okay by myself but its also okay to want to be with someone. I want a girlfriend and friends that don't use me or do hard drugs. I'm tired of being alone and after everything I've been through in the last four years I'm just ready to settle down with someone. 

My ex that I was talking about at the beginning may have lied to and manipulated me, but she was the closest I've ever come to true love. Seriously, putting aside all the fucked up shit that happened she set the bar really high. She was bright, funny, intelligent, and beautiful. She was the only one of my ex's that said I love you to me first. She was the only one that used the term boyfriend/girlfriend first. She made sure I felt loved. She understood how fucked up the world was and had been through hell, an yet she still had this spark of life in her that amazed me. She ended up going back to school to and became an advocate for addicts and is a professional drug counselor. I hate admitting this after four fucking years but I still love her. I'm terrified she might see this somehow, because she'd definitely know it was me, but it's true. Even though I know it's never going to happen, I still dream about her and I mean that literally.

I'm trying, I'm trying to do better but this semester hasn't gone well and I'll be lucky to pass all my classes which I have to in order to keep my financial aid. If I do I am doubling down on my effort in school, I refuse to fail. I know I need to stop thinking about my ex so much, and try to keep learning how to be happy with myself. I know the healthy thing to do would be to stop talking to her and be patient and I'll eventually meet someone else, but I'm not as social as I used to be. I feel so different than the people around me. I want someone like her that understands me and has a lot of things in common with me. I can't replace her, but it would be nice to meet a woman that could make me feel that love again. Like I said, I'm tired. I feel like I'm at a really weird point in my life and I'm scared and alone. I kind of feel the same way I felt when she left with no one to go to and a mess that only I can clean up with no support. I'm sorry this was so long.

2982,yvt9r1,Arimelldansen,"last night was a surprise party for one of the housemates in the place I'm staying at and about 30 people were here

I baked cupcakes and got the ingredients even though I'm currently out of work and have no home to go to (hence saying the place I'm staying at) and spent time beforehand making them and decorating them

When people arrived, nobody said hi to me, nobody thanked me, people would talk to the person I was next to and not even act as if I existed I felt like a ghost I felt so dehumanised, I can't understand why it is so hard for people to be polite and nice and just say hello.. I've never felt so alienated and alone, I didn't exist, I was in a crowded room of people and nobody could see me

I've just moved to this country and I left my entire life, family and friends behind because my home life was bad in my original country and my job made me miserable and unfulfilled so i moved with my little savings and search for work to try get a second chance to make life okay.. and the people at the party know of me, they know I've moved and could see I was alone.. 

It hurts so much. Why does nobody talk to me? Why am I so alone? I try my best to include others and be kind but get nothing like that towards me. I don't understand. I don't feel like I belong anywhere anymore.

2991,yvuc5t,Tzuyari,"I’ve always kind of gone with the flow. I never aspired to be anything great or amazing or out of the ordinary. I’ve always just focused on what was put in front of me. And that’s all I ever cared about. Just getting by. 

I never had any real interest in careers or longterm goals. I would make up goals just to tell people that ask, but they’d be nothing real, nothing I’m actually working towards or putting any sort of effort into going towards because I simply just didn’t care about that.

My life has been simple but full of trauma. The usual absent parent while the other is emotionally and physically abusive was my childhood. Hated going to school. Developed antisocial tendencies. Rarely had peers express the same interests as me. Got ridiculed, ignored. Got quiet. It snuffed my light out. Stopped talking to people. Isolated myself and got addicted to videogames. Graduated, had no interest in college while all my close friends were preparing for formal education. I worked a few jobs I hated, then went full NEET for years.

Adulthood. Lots of things changed but simultaneously nothing did. Things around me started to move. People were moving, friends were moving, everyone else’s lives were moving while I stayed stagnant. I was aware of it. I just didn’t care to try moving. Responsibilities and expectations of me were starting to grow and I had no idea how to handle it, I was confused, I was almost offended. I have to do more? I thought I was done after High School. There’s more? Of course there was more. Job hopped, made money, wasted money, burned bridges, muddied waters.

At some point, I wanted love. I never cared about relationships until my late 20’s. I had never been with anyone, I had missed that ship, although there’s something I’ve observed. People want different things out of a partner the older you get. If I dated in my early teens, I’d have had the experience before expectations. I would have learned more about myself sooner. Maybe it would have influenced me in a way I will never know. Now, all of a sudden, it just doesn’t cut it. People want someone with goals, aspirations, a plan, a career, and I just don’t cut it. I’m content with finding a cushy job, and just living with my partner. No kids, no going to college. Just working, saving, going on dates, and traveling together during vacations. But this doesn’t seem to cut it. I feel punished for wanting a life like this. A life of just getting by. Why should I be great for any reason other than me wanting it?

Society makes me feel like something is wrong with me. I’m with someone who I love very much, but even they want more drive and ambition from me when I just don’t have it. And I know I don’t. I would be faking it if I did. I don’t want to fake anything. I don’t care about being extraordinary. I just don’t care.

As a kid I basically loved christmas, and was waiting for it since September, but as I got older, and loneliness finally started taking its toll on me I just can't stand it. I'm going to college, so right now it's the only time I get to talk to anyone, but still no friends, just acquaintances, and I don't text or call anyone after I get home from university. Also from the middle of December to the beginning of February we're gonna have a break from college, which means 1 and a half month of crippling loneliness. I don't have any close friends in college, but it's still better to have even small talks than nothing. Back to christmas:I dread it so much. I know it's gonna be lonely. I'll go to my grandparents with my family, but I'm at the age(21) when it would finally be nice not to be so alone, and have someone else to spend this time with instead of just family. New Year's Eve? Even worse. Never been invited to New Year Eve's party, and was always going somewhere with my parents. But last year? My sister was going to her friend, my parents were going somewhere too, and I was the only one with no plans, so I had a choice: staying at home all alone or going to my grandma. I was fucking 20 last year, and had to go to my grandma instead of partying with some friends or partner, cause even tho I'm an adult my social life is like I'm 80 or a kid. You always have to take me somewhere with you or I'm gonna stay at home with no plans. I'm getting sick of it. I tried asking some ""friends"" if they wanted to hang out with me on New Year's party(It was last year), They said it was ok, but never reached out to me. Christmas oh Christmas. I always go to my grandparents meanwhile cousins who are the same age with me already live with their partners or at least have a partner or friends they can spend time with. I'm so fed up with it. If I don't reach out I don't exist, and if I ever reach out no one gives a damn about me, and the conversation feels forced. Let alone my lovely Valentine's day that's getting closer and closer. Basically everything is a reminder of how lonely I am, and how behind I am compared to my peers or cousins. Each of my cousins who are my age, or a bit older already have a partner who they either live with or spend the majority of their time with. And there's me:I could turn my phone off for 1 year, and get no messages, and 0 calls.I've tried to improve my social life, but it left me feeling even more miserable.

I feel so useless.
Why would anyone give me a chance? Why should I even let them make that mistake?
I know I am just a facade hiding a lazy, depressed, nobody.

I only want attention. Someone who would ask me about my day, someone I could listen to talk about their passions, someone who loved me.
But at the same time I wouldn't want anyone to have to put up with me.

I don't have the energy to dig myself up from this hole I've created.

So this is gross. Feel free to skip this paragraph. I got into posting images of myself on an adult forum. I got a lot of positive interaction out of it! Sure I got called a slut but it was okay. I got people calling me beautiful and it felt nice. In the moment. Afterwards I felt filthy and empty and worthless. Nothing more than parts. So much for sexual freedom. Thing is I was looking forward to this forever. Now there's nothing. 

I'm feeling an impulse to return to a bad cutting habit I had. I've been clean for 6 months and I don't want to break that.

You Always thought you were above me

Dead to you but that's OK your heart never touched me!

And now I do realize that there's loads of people out there that had their first relationship even later than me, but I'm definitely at a point where I'm the odd one out for never having dated among my peers, and that is just really getting to me lately. Not even because I want to keep up with others or because I think that you should be in a relationship at a certain age. But it really ruins my self esteem, because I'm genuinely starting to feel like I'm not attractive or interesting at all to the opposite gender. I'm a pretty introverted guy, so I never really met that many people, which is definitely a big part of the problem. But after Covid I made quite an effort to go out more, talk to people, go to social gatherings, I made a few dating profiles in which I actually put in some effort and what I thought were some decent pictures of me. But none of those things got me closer to actually connecting with people. Even though I had some days where I felt like I had some nice conversations with people, it just never got further than that. I met a few more people I'm friendly with, that seem to enjoy my company enough to invite me to social gatherings and stuff, but even then I have a hard time actually feeling like I'm connecting with anyone. Everybody just seems to be friendly, but there's never anybody showing interest in me or approaching me. I tried taking matters into my own hands a few times and tried to approach people myself, but that also didn't really change anything. A few weeks ago I even asked out a girl that seemed nice, she actually agreed to meet up and sounded quite enthusiastic about it, but told me she didn't have time and would text me when she's free, and then I never heard from her again. Which I'm not even mad about, it's whatever, but it's just further and further giving me this feeling that while people might find me nice enough to hang out with occasionally, it seems like I'm just not interesting enough for people to want to get to know me more closely. And I really don't know how to deal with that anymore. I'm about to give up my adventure of going out more, because it's just really exhausting to me, and honestly, going to social gatherings but still feeling alone in the midst of it all makes me feel way more lonely than spending weeks in my room talking to nobody. I just can't keep this up, because my mental health is really suffering from this.

3061,ywb6b9,TwinSong,"I'm doing a Masters online and basically it means very little interaction with anyone. Maybe I'll have a meeting with lecturer once a week or so but that's about the extent of it. I'm 3hrs away from campus so can't exactly pop over easily. Any extracurricular activities are just not practical given the travel time. I think there is one other student in the class and we have rare contact on Skype (she's in another country).

The course is fairly unstructured, just ""here's the brief, which you mostly have to invent yourself. Bye"". There aren't classes as such or formal lessons. We had more lectures (Zoom) a few months ago, now it's just 1:1 meetings with the tutor.

I'm often left feeling a bit directionless. At least at College (UK meaning) I actually had lessons where we were directly taught things rather than just told to research xyz. Yes in theory the looseness of the assignments is freeing but I tend to end up feeling more lost and the research alone at home makes it feel like exam revision, less the repetition. I can end up going through a day with little to no meaningful interaction in-person with anyone.

At this stage I feel like I'm doing the course more out of obligation than actual interest/passion.

Undergrad degree was isolating also. I was on campus but didn't fit in anywhere mostly.",2022-11-15 22:10:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1582472936,0,/r/lonely/comments/ywb6b9/i_kinda_miss_school/,,0,3,I kinda miss school

3075,ywcvjd,Shojon_sym,"So I was wondering in YouTube as I usually do, you know the usual wasting time lol. And I found this video about how you should fix loneliness before doing etc... and I found it relatable to an extent so basically its a random girl that talks about her opinions and shares her personal experiences. I don't agree with her on somethings, but on the other hands and relatable (at least to me). 
MY MAIN reason here is to hear opinions on what is said in the vid, because i do have mine since i moved away for college and can relate to some of the things mentioned here.

● SO I'd like to hear other opinions on this. If you are interested of course!!!!!

Also the vibe of the channel is good. So I just wanted to share it with you guys. Idk I really felt that I gotta you know support her and stuff. Most communities have no-self promotions rule which is a bummer. And technically it's not self-promotion I'm not gonna get anything from it (rather than feeling good about it ig) LOL. Anyway yeah just wanted to share the vid and if you like the vibes support her ig.

3077,ywczmk,WookieWithABigPP,"I’m 16M and I really don’t know what to do with my life right now, all I want is a completely fresh start, I’m not officially diagnosed but I’m 100% sure I have depression and anxiety and I think starting a new life will be great for my mental health but obviously my age kinda fucks it up. I live in a rural area in the South West of England and public transport here is utter shite so my choice of education (which legally I still have to do) is very limited, I have 3 choices.

The first is a 6th form which is a definite no, it’s full of assholes that bullied me and are half the cause for my bad mental health, I also found the school setting incredibly hard and draining and considering 6th form is just an extension of school I don’t see it as a possibility.

The second is a college, it’s pretty decent apparently but the biggest problem is that my ex goes there. Our 2 year relationship ended in a very toxic way and after about a month of breaking up I found she had been with this other guy when we were together, she was perfect and seemed so happy with me until one day when she just completely changed, about the same time she met this guy so I’m guessing that’s the reason it happened, I feel like I wasn’t good enough and that everything she said to me were complete lies. I still love her but also hate her, she completely broke me, which hurts so much, her and her friend sent pictures to me of her with her new boyfriend a few weeks back, trying to mock and upset me I guess; honestly, at the time it felt like a turning point for me, I was really happy as I realised that she was an asshole and not the same person I had fallen in love with, but soon after I went back to how I was before. We live in the same small village so I see her every now and again, and every time I feel so sick and get a massive amount of dread. Then as soon as I get home I break down and cry for the next 3+ hours. I’m too scared to leave the house at this point. They also have meerkats at this college as they do animal care, and I know it sounds pathetic but I took my niece to the zoo for her birthday a few weeks ago and as soon as I saw they meerkats I started crying because they reminded me of her. So obviously getting on the same bus as her every day isn’t a option either. 

So I’m left with the final choice of going to the college that I’m at now, when I applied I didn’t really have a passion or goal, and I was still with my ex so I wasn’t even planning on going here so I chose something I was mildly interested in, that being creative media, I do have a dream to be a hollywood director but being realistic that isn’t going to happen. I’m really not enjoying the course, the main lecturer is a twat and he always seems to target me to make me look stupid. And I’m pretty sure it’s too late for me to change course. 

However my biggest problem about going here, though it sounds good, is that i’m here with 3/4 of my high school friend group. Honestly, since my ex left me and my only social life has been with them, I’ve realised they’re all kinda assholes. I’ve been friends with 2 of them for 5 years, and the last one for 13, we’ll call them A, B and C respectively for story purposes. 

I rarely see A now, he’s in a relationship with this girl and basically just completely blanks me all the time since they’ve been together, B I spend the most time with as they take the same course as me, they’re ok I guess they just seem to have so many secrets with C and other people that I’d kinda call my friends and it feels like I mean nothing to any of them because of it. C has been my best friend since playgroup (or kindergarten for the Americans who got this far), we literally grew up together and now they just seem to be drifting away, I haven’t seen or spoken to them in 2 weeks. B always seems to be texting them and I just feel replaced. They’re all so boring as well, we never do anything outside of college, I hardly know if i should even call them friends at this point. On my last birthday I didn’t get a single birthday wish from any of them, we were staying the night at Bs place, I didn’t really want to go, it’s usually boring asf, but I went in order to not feel left out. I spent the night sat on the hard ass floor because three of them some how took up a 6 seater sofa, I didn’t sleep, they were still awake until 3 and knew it was my birthday because when we had planned it the one mentioned it would be the night before, the only wish I got was from my ex, she messaged me at midnight and at the time it felt like the most amazing thing anyone had ever done for me, I got my dad to pick me up at 6am because I just wanted to go to bed. They all have other friend groups they seem to be in and that they seem to prefer. Yet they are the only friends i have. None of them ever choose to talk to me, if we have time off they only contact I have with them is if I start a conversation and that usually lasts less than 10 minutes.

I wish I could just completely cut them off and start off with a completely fresh set of friends. My family are amazing I love them all but no other aspect of my life is worth anything so if there was I was a way that I could go to a college a decent way away and completely forget about my past life outside of my family I would do it in a heartbeat.

I actually have a realistic goal now, I want to become a maths, english or physics teacher. I’m lucky enough to be quite smart, I got 9 and two 8s in those subjects for my GCSEs, the equivalent to an A* or higher and I love the idea of teaching, I already love spreading my knowledge and considering I had a tough time at school I want nothing more than to make other peoples’ experiences better than what I had. With the course I’m doing now I feel like I’m wasting my potential.

So my ideal plan, is to go a college not to far and study those A level subjects, and then move to Bristol take a teaching degree and whatever else I need. I think it could do me really good, I’d be able to have a new start in ode and be away from every worry and factor holding me back, I think the city is a great place to do that. There’s tons of things to do and plenty of ways to meet new people, all of them different. It’s busy enough to take your mind off things and everyone you walk past is someone you don’t know so the likelihood of seeing someone to remind you of a bad memory whereas where i am now, that is literally every other person you see. Bristol is ideal, it has a decent uni and is far enough away from me. for an escape from my current life but close enough that I can still visit my family regularly. 

However, right now the college I want to go to isn’t on the shitty PT routes  and I’m to young to drive, so for the next year or so I’m pretty much trapped in this tedious, draining, pointless and lonely waste of life surrounded by boring assholes, weirdos and drug dealers (literally 99% of the people in my college), I hate everyone and every aspect of my life, outside my family and this plan I have is the only thing keeping me going.

   I am extremely lonely and depressed. I want to find a girlfriend so I’m trying to lose weight to be more attractive(that’s only one of the reasons why) I eat my feelings and I usually don’t drink but I like getting drunk or buzzed because it takes my mind of stuff. I much rather smoke pot but I’ll get sick if I smoke to much so I’ve been interchanging them to escape reality. I’m in college and I’m jealous when I see people with groups because I’m always alone. I have family and a group of friends but I want to branch out but I’m terrified of going up to people just because I’m shy and scared of rejection. Idk what to do because everyday I wake up I feel like it’s a struggle. My ex has a bf someone told me and I’m jealous that I can’t get a girlfriend. I have one semester to go to get my bachelors. I’m just stuck and sad. I’ve been to counseling at school and it didn’t help. She gave me no advice. I eat my feelings.

I can't take it. I can't take it anymore. I'm trying to find a job so I can move out, I have a degree but despite that no one seems to want to hire me. I'm applying to retail positions, anything. I don't care that she is sick anymore, I have got to get away. 

Everything I say, everything I do, is wrong. I can't say anything without her in some way indicating that its wrong. I'm tired of constantly being love bombed, gaslight, and manipulated. I'm tired of getting emotionally sucker punched multiple times a day. I'm tired , just so fucking tired. 

Drapped over all of it is loneliness. The lonliness I have of having health problems, the lonliness of trying to take care of someone who is deeply toxic, the lonlinesss of seeking a job when no one wants to hire me.

3129,ywl2w9,guidofrisbee,"I’m sorry my thoughts will probably sound very disjointed and incoherent, I’m having a major emotional and mental breakdown right now and I’m dissociating quite badly.

I’ve been seeing my therapist since early 2017. My main issues for going were trauma caused by a breakup and childhood abandonment by my alcoholic mother when I was 12.

My therapist has been a really kind and caring person for as long as I’ve been working with her. I trusted her more than probably anyone else I knew for most of my life. I formed a very strong attachment with her. There ended up being strong transference, maternal and other kinds on my part. She suggested early on that we lean into it and use it as an experience to help heal from the past traumas.

She was always very caring expressively and outwards and was always supportive. We always had a very strong bond. 

A few months ago I started feeling disconnected and as though my therapist was not showing that she cared about me very often. I brought this up and we sort of talked it out a couple months ago and she said she was not emotionally abandoning me. I thought it would get better from there but nothing really changed and I still have been struggling with feeling disconnected.

My apologies as my thoughts will likely seem more disjointed from here so I will try to organize them as best I can.

\-she said she has been purposely being less expressive and less emotional in sessions. She said this is to be more objective and to better do her job. 

\-she also said she had set that as a boundary because that’s what is best for her. I assume this is because she used to take on clients problems too much and feel burned out. She explained to me at one point a few years ago that she used to feel like it was her job to take care of her friends and essentially “save” them and would feel overwhelmed. I’m assuming the same thing was playing out with me/her clients.

\-examples I gave of how she seems detached is that she rarely ever shows much emotion at all anymore. She doesn’t offer supportive comments or praise like she used to, things like “I’m here for you” “I’m proud of you” etc.

\-more examples – things feeling very mechanical and detached. She doesn’t ask me about my life or how things that are important to me went that we’ve discussed. Basically there’s no kind of rapport anymore at all. I said it feels like she doesn’t talk to me like I’m a person anymore. She doesn’t show much empathy. I said it feels like I’m talking to a dentist.   
   
 

\-she said she was not willing to do anything to come to a solution or resolve those issues, or adjust at all or change in anyway to make those things better. She said that was her boundary and she could not be flexible about it. To me this seems like a misuse of what the nature of “boundaries” actually are and is just an excuse to not work together or even see if a solution is possible. 

\-she told me a couple months ago she wasn’t emotionally abandoning me or shutting me out. I told her it seems like that actually is happening and that she has a complete wall up and that she has completely withdrawn showing that she cares for me and etc

\-in the past when we’ve had issues connecting, I told her we used to talk things out and see if we could come to a mutual understanding and balance things out.

\-she said she was not willing to change her boundary. She said there was nothing to balance out or discuss. She even said I wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable, but that she had to do what was best for her. She was not willing to discuss potential solutions or ways to resolve this. She basically said “yeah I’m more disconnected now, that’s how it is. Sorry it hurts you.”

I trusted her so much. She was supposed to be the one safe person who wouldn’t do this to me. Instead she’s recreating the exact same dynamic that my mom and ex girlfriend did, abandoning me emotionally through no fault of my own, and without much of an explanation. Because she even said she didn’t think she should explain why she set that boundary.

I hate myself so much for allowing this to happen to me. I trusted her that she would never hurt me like this. Instead I’m reliving the most painful experience of my life yet again, after she assured me that she would never hurt me or abandon me or do what the people who hurt me and broke my trust did to me. I don’t know what to do and I can’t take this.",2022-11-16 05:39:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667493417,5,/r/lonely/comments/ywl2w9/my_therapist_encouraged_me_to_be_attached_to_her/,,0,1,My therapist encouraged me to be attached to her as a way to heal my traumatic experiences.

I tried so so hard to compromise with her, but everything she didn’t like about me had to be changed and she would threaten to break up with me if I didn’t. She couldn’t give me empathy, constantly “jokingly” say I wasn’t smart. Whenever I opened up to her about what I was struggling with, she’d tell me what I did wrong, what I need to do to fix it. I would tell her over and over that wasn’t what I needed and I just wanted her to listen. Whenever I’d bring up something that was bothering me that she was doing, she’s flip it on me and make it why it’s my fault, and what I’m not doing. I stopped opening up to her for fear of being ridiculed. I asked her if she loved me or the person she wanted me to be. And she told me “I love the potential of the person you’re going to be”. She didn’t care about any of my interests except for the ones we shared (which I always took an interest in hers) and she would undermine things I was excited about, (tune out, go on her phone or do the “mhm” thing) so we ended things after 2 years.

I’m now in a new university, meeting new people, doing the things I love. But I can’t shake this feeling of wanting to be seen by someone. See me for me, love me for me. I keep getting manipulated, and hurt and walked all over but I just want someone to see me. Is that too much to ask? Like I’m talking to this girl, and things really clicked but she hardly ever responds even if we’re in the middle of a conversation and I just can’t tell if she’s busy or maybe I’m falling and she doesn’t see me as anything like that. I just think of the worst because it’s what I’m used to. I just want to be held and told it’s gonna be okay. I can’t even cry anymore. I just shut down, I just stare at the wall for hours wishing I could just force at least one tear to come out. 

I don’t expect any person to read this I just needed a place to vent and just get all my thoughts and feelings out so I can fall asleep. If miraculously you are someone that read this, thank you for listening. I hope you’re doing okay &lt;3",2022-11-16 06:49:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645822430,3,/r/lonely/comments/ywmctt/struggling_with_loneliness/,,0,2,Struggling with loneliness

3165,ywok5o,sho3gazezzastroknott,"I wanna just flip the switch i think this will be so much easier for me and everyone if i just stop feeling this shit

I wanna not be a crappy person just because most everyone else in the world is, i dont wanna let them drag me to the bottom with them too...

But jealousy, envy and bitterness have started to develope in me to the point where they're starting to show through and i cant disguise them anymore but i wanna get rid of them, i wanna not feel really anything i just wanna get through my day to day with out the running dialogue in the back of my mind 

I wanna feel completey fine under the context of the reality that i'll be alone forever, ive come to terms with the fact that its just in the cards for some people.

Ive kinda consciously cut ties with my friends and family over this past year ive moved to a town where no one knows me and im sharing a house with people that dont know me at all i keep to myself ive kinda turned myself in to one of those invisible people who could be anywhere and nowhere and no one would notice and i shouldn't complain cause this is all something that ive brought upon myself, according to whatever plan i tell myself ive formulated to give me the sense of having some level of control over my self inflicted isolation??? But i dont piss anyone off now and i have no real issues other than taking care of myself

The phone calls are starting to get more and more sparse and im not reaching out, im starting to plan trips for myself ill be going on my own, its kind of a blessing and a curse cause i can do whatever i want with no objections or reservations or compromise but have no one to share any of it with or remember anything with which i should be used to by now but i wanna stamp out that last withering flame of hope that i may meet someone who i can have that type of relationship ive been wanting for as long as i can rememeber 

But i also worry how id come across cause the whole world is obsessed with who is with who in the form of relationships as if we were in highschool and it all just has to be attached to our egos and sense of self which ive always thought of as somewhat pitiful and narcissistic 

Like if i came off that i haven't had a single relationship in years and I genuinely dont seem to care people regardless of whether i want them around me or not will instantly think im strange (especially women as they're usually the ones that mostly obsess over this shit and can cause issues over it if they dislike a person for whatever reason) 

I went to a town the other day i like to visit in my free time, for no reason other than i love this town and the feel of it, its small and commune 
Its has a beautiful little new england type of feel and all the houses and neighbourhoods are so idealic, if i had the cash id by one of em to stay in just to feel apart of this town whenever i could, again mostly no one knows me there other than apparently this one elderly women 

She came up to me and asked if i was looking for something 
She told me she often sees me there wandering around the streets evidently not blending in as much as i perhaps thought i had been this whole time.
She said i always look lost as if im looking for something and she often watches me looking around.
I told her why i come there so often and im not looking for anything i just listen to music and walk she kind of smiled and put her hand on my shoulder and told me to have a good day and she stumbled away on to a bus. This kinda stuck with me. It kinda made me feel like i wanted to disappear, probably because it made me feel really seen for the first time in a long time, but inspite of my current best efforts to distance myself i cant seem to atleast enough to be invisible in the way that i want. I wish there was like a pill to stop me feeling this way or to turn the thoughts off.

Condemned alike to groan,

The unfeeling for his own.

And happiness too swiftly flies.  
Thought would destroy their paradise.

3191,ywsj6n,Lilylolo88,"All my life I have been lonely. I remember from childhood not fitting in with my peers. In high-school it was pretty much the same scenario. I've always been very introverted and socially awkward.

Now that I'm 34, I've realised that I wasn't socially awkward at all. I was afraid. I had a deep seeded fear of rejection and being disliked. I always felt like an alien amongst humans. This isn't the case at all. 

I have been on a journey of self development and have come to see that I was the very thing holding me back from making connections with other people. I had it in my head that people wouldn't like me and that people would automatically think I'm weird. I truly believed this.

Recently I have pushed my self out of my comfort zone and into more social situations. The more I make myself go out amongst others, the more comfortable I feel around people. I'm still an introvert and enjoy my own space but being around people is really starting to bring me joy. 

Last year I joined a gym and when I started. I remember having to take Diazepam just so I could walk into the gym. My anxiety of being judged and looked at was at it peak. One year later and I regularly chat to to other gym goers including my gym crush... I know... crazy! This would have been unheard of last year.

So what I want to say to other lonely people is that you're not alone. If you truly want to connect with other people, get out there and start socialising. I know it's scary because I used to take medication for social anxiety. Making connections online is just not the same as seeing people face to face. Humans are social creatures, we thive in community and connections. I promise you that once you start acting and stop making excuses, like will feel so much better.

I truly feel as though life is really good now and talking to people is getting easier and easier.

Get out there folks and talk to people! Xx",2022-11-16 12:51:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1467813018,48,/r/lonely/comments/ywsj6n/the_path_out_of_loneliness/,,0,25,The path out of loneliness

Ever since I moved countries 4 years ago, almost every friend I've ever made has left me feeling only emptier than I was before. I've barely ever been able to really connect with the people I meet, and maybe that's my fault, but I have no idea where I would even start.

For a moment almost 2 years ago I almost felt happy. I was fairly popular in school, was succeeding in sport at a national level, and had made a good friend who seemed to maybe understand how I felt. Then, my friend moved back to his home country, and I had an injury that ruined my chances of pursuing sports in the future. I have a kid as well now, who I'm working full-time to try support, and whose mother told me to my face she resents ever meeting me, not that I blame her.

I have no proper friends who like me for me, and I'm living in a garage I'm renting at my old gym.

To give a little context, I’m about to turn 19 and in all honesty I haven’t got much to show for my life. I know many eyes probably rolled at me saying that at such a young age but seeing everyone around me succeed with their careers, generally being happy and especially finding relationships isn’t exactly very motivating when all I do is come home and sleep through most of the day.

I understand that in order to have a good relationship you must first have a life that someone would actually want to be a part of so I’m making efforts to combat things like my depression and trying to keep myself occupied. But something I have zero idea on how to progress on is finding a relationship.

I’ve always been on the quiet side which doesn’t exactly make meeting people easy, couple that with plenty of anxiety and the fact I’m never really in the situation to meet new folk even when in college and it’s a tough one for me. I don’t want to look back in say 10 years time and regret my choices like I already do now so my question to anyone who has read this long is what do you think I should do?

How does a reserved person who doesn’t really get the opportunity to meet new people change that?

From not visiting a single country to visiting 9 countries in a span of 2 months can teach you so much more about life than I could have ever imagined, its definitely life changing! 

I can relate so much more to the quote ""The night is darkest just before the dawn"", when you feel like there's no way you can get yourself up, theres nothing left to live for and nothing is worth it, just remember its a phase, you will overcome it and there are better times always waiting on the other side even though it may take a LONG time and the fight/struggle will be worth it! You will come out shining and a much better human being on the other side!

I was supposed to be engaged by the end of the year (I’m Indian, so it isn’t really a surprise), but found out my boyfriend was dming women to have sex. Months of therapy later, I thought we were in a better place, only to find him doing the same with his colleagues. We broke up.

I worked my a** off for a role in my job that I was promised and not given when it came to it. 
My parents at this point have given up on me and feel nothing but embarrassment/disappointment that I’m single at 31. I tried dating online and I seem to only find men who only want one thing and it’s not a long term/monogamous relationship.

Gained weight, with my life going down the crapper. Friends mostly are married and busy with their own life.

I decided to turn my life around. Worked out and got in shape, I have the body I always dreamed off. Got my dream role in a different company. Nothing in the relationship front.

I just scroll through my socials and keep expecting him to text me which is not happening ( obviously. I used to have panic attacks during the night time few months back but now it's very constant. (Shivering rn lol) Members of my family are toxic and got 0 friends so ya got no one to talk to either. I have attempted doing dumb shit like hurting myself and i have this thought of doing something to myself constantly but i don't have the courage yet. Now i fear attachments or even giving attention to others. Legit fucked in the head. Don't know what to do or what will happen in the coming days.

That this is who I am when I'm feeling low...

We want to break free and live before we die.

It's hard to accept that we are living a lie.

I cant even afford to be on my own entirely, it just feels like everything is being rubbed in my face about how defected I am as a person? idk but it does hurt my heart, I can’t even go outside when I want to, but I can’t take up space either

3296,yxbhoe,epicsimitt,"TW: mention of self-harm, no details

Hi,
I'm going through a bit of a deep valley right now, I was coping fine with certain issues but the dam broke a couple nights ago and I haven't been able to do anything without a knot forming at my throat. 

I've always struggled with making connections with people, I see others talking after knowing each other for 3 weeks with more friendliness that I have with people in over a year. I tried to do the things I dont normally do, tried to go to clubs and have a good time, joined societies, tried to meet new people yk? But either I just end up by myself anyways or I see people having fun while I'm not and that hurts so much. I am no longer sad about it its more of a deep frustration and Im ashamed to say its envy. 

I cry because I feel so out of my depth I feel like everyone has it down to a T, its so easy for other people oncluding friends to be intetested in someone who's also interested in them. I can't do that, I can't feel that for anyone because I wouldnt even know what that is. And no one has ever felt that for me and I'm scared no one ever will. 

I've been told I need to accept myself, the good and the bad, but how can I accept myself when I can see clear as day I'm so far behind everyone by any standard. I self-harmed as a way to distract myself but I now realize it just makes it worse. I'm so scared that I will never get out of this. And the bonds that do form either fade or are so far removed from this real me that it doesnt even matter.

I see people have fun when I can't, see them texting someone else when they're with me, just be happier than me. How can I accept myself if I see the happier option is ""not being me""

Im scared because I feel stuck, idk what to do to feel better, idk who could even relate to how I feel, idk who could love someone that feels this way, idk how to stop feeling this way, but I can't bear it anymore.

So that's that

I also don’t have a good story, it’s mostly trials and tribulations. I recapped my story by dodging the depressing parts but I know the energy of the conversation went south when I started answering, because I don’t like talking about myself. It was stressful. When I got home I felt so anxious and just started crying. The reality of my life makes me feel like nothing good will ever happen. It’s good to be realistic but my reality makes my current efforts feel fruitless and dumb. I used to feel this deeply and was suicidal for a long time. I’m not anymore (at the moment) but I feel like the things I said about what jobs I could see myself doing in the future sound dumb and delusional because my life has been a series of unfortunate events for the most part — a loooong while anyway. Beyond a childhood full of emotional and some physical abuse (I was raised by 2 narcissists — at least one because my dad definitely is, but my submissive mom would laugh in my face when I cried… so yeah probably a narc too). 17-22 was full of my hardest trials and tribulations. Different aspects of my life went up in flames and burned to the ground. I spent those years putting out fires. Something pretty devastating happened a couple weeks after my 22nd birthday. 22-25 was stabilizing psychologically,emotionally, and financially — failing at that last part repeatedly, plus failing at pursuing higher education again. 25-26 has just been survival mode. I will be 27 next month. I’ve fallen into a financial hole that I have to work 2-3 jobs to get out of (3 months behind on rent). It’s literally the only way. I only have 1 FT job at the moment. I can’t get a job that pays more than it does now. And I don’t have time to look for that if I could so I just need more hours worked each week. 
Ugh I just needed to get this off my chest. I have no one to talk to. When I come home to my apartment, I’m cold and alone. No pets (I wish but I can’t afford one), no family to talk to, no friends to talk to (maybe one or two that I talk to every few months). Just alone. No one to celebrate with, complain to, brainstorm with, to encourage me, to see the progress I’m making and remind me of it when I forget, or to give me feedback/reflect back to me how I come off to others as I navigate the world.

3350,yxhqn0,LovelessLombax,"TL;DR: Title, pretty much. Looking for someone to talk to on a daily basis, even through voice chat on Discord. I feel so lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'll save you my story as I'm quite tired but if you wanna know more about me there's past posts which explain quite a lot i think. Feel free to ask me anything anyway.

\---

I can't go on anymore. I feel like the entire world is collapsing. I mean I've always had bad luck in my life but this autumn it hit so hard it's like some superior entity is telling me ""there's no reason for you to go on, everything will fall apart""

&amp;#x200B;

Last month my group of friends turned against me as I was getting ""too emotionally attached"" for their taste and they basically told me they never liked me. Not a chance to rework the bond. Nothing. Just ""left outside alone"", as a popular song from 2 decades ago says.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I also met an ENFP (I'm INFP, these two I mentioned are MBTI types which, for those who don't know, basically explain your personality traits. There are tests online, just google ""MBTI test"" if you wanna know yours) which made me have the best summer ever, we were basically chatting in voice chat on Discord all night, watching anime/tv serieses and talking about our lives. Now she changed because some weirdos online traumatized her and since her irl interactions are solid, she decided to pretty much focus on them now. It was great because I have difficulty opening up to people and she pretty much had this ""mommy"" attitude that melted my heart and made me trust her a lot. None of us really catched a love interest even though she was being super flirty, but I know now it was just jokes and I'm not mad, I enjoyed that and I kinda miss it to tell you the truth. It was bringing joy to my life. I was feeling happiness again.

&amp;#x200B;

I have LITERALLY no one now. Exactly a week ago it was my birthday and, aside from a small family celebration (forced, I don't get along well with them) I spent the rest of the night crying. For comparison, last year, I was spending my birthday with that same group of friends having fun on VRChat and talking also through Discord.

no one likes me romantically. no one has ever really like me like that. one girl said i was one of her “weird” crushes, which i know is Not a compliment especially since i know she thinks i’m ugly. 


anyways. i’ve had two guys in my life who were semi interested in me, but both of them were kind of creeps. one kept asking for too much from me and the other disrespected my boundaries a few times, like touching me where i didn’t want to be touched and then trying to convince me that he hadn’t. 

it’s awful but i’m so lonely sometimes, especially now that two of my close friends are in new relationships, that i wish i had stayed in contact with those people. i just want to feel wanted and staying with them, even though i was uncomfortable probably would’ve meant that id get to feel that way and id get to experience what everyone my age seems to have already done ages ago. 


i know romantic relationships aren’t needed to live a fulfilled life but jesus do i wish i could experience one. i’m so touch starved. i would kill for a long hug. my coworker made the slightest physical contact with me and i keep thinking about it. i just want attention i want people to like me. doesn’t help that i have a work crush on that coworker too lmao


the worst part is despite wanting to date so badly is the fact that i know i’m emotionally unavailable and would probably be a horrible boyfriend. i want a relationship so bad but i’m just not built for one. i’m doomed. 

i daydream a lot as a substitute for real human interaction and i try to convince myself that i’ll be fine as long as i can do that but i’m just so sad. all i fucking do is go to work and then home and then work and home.

my friends all go to school where they’re making new friends and i’m just working right now and it’s not like i hangout with my coworkers or even talk to them outside of work because i’ve tried and i just know they don’t see me as someone who could become a real friend. i’m scared i’ll be replaced.

While you’re at these places, you might or might not be lucky enough to make friends.

In my school experiences, I was bullied for a long time. Then had “friends” who weren’t really friends, just people I talked to in school. 
And now, I am not even in college but I don’t know how different that will be. 

The thing is, whenever I search or ask “how to make friends” they always say it’s at school or college or work. 

Well, now I came across a video on YouTube about how co-workers aren’t supposed to be your friends, or more so shouldn’t be your friends. It seemed like 90% of people commenting on that video agree. With few people saying they were lucky to have a friend from work, but agreed that it was hard &amp; rare. Everyone was talking about “just work and keep it professional” or “just go there to work that’s it” “it’s easy just go work and then go to your home and family”. 

But this go me thinking, what about those who don’t have any of that??? What if I am so fucking lonely and tired of existing and I am only talking to my family because I have to (it’s complicated). Then what??? I am supposed to just exist to work and then fking die?. 

I mean I can’t even be mad at these people; it’s of course not their fault that I feel so depressed about this, but this genuinely crushes me. I am mostly mad about how sad and pathetic life is, and how hard everything is. And even when you think you have friends, you’re probably dealing with some very fucking nasty people. It’s so sad man. So sad. 

I don’t think I’ll ever love something more than connecting with someone. I am not really passionate about anything. I have one idea in mind that I am excited about, and I would love to work in, but, I am not so crazy about work. It’s just something I would love to try. 

But I still want to find friends. I want to have fun and chat with someone who wouldn’t stab me in the back. Why is life so fucking awful like that…. I wish nobody was fake and pretentious. But sadly, I am mad at nothing. That’s life. A very disgusting thing I didn’t consent to.

Edit : thank you for the people that commented on this post. I appreciate all of you, and your perspective and opinions.. and also for showing me support 💜💜

Also, I was feeling very emotional/overwhelmed at the time of writing this post… so… it was a bit exaggerated/dramatic but it still is the way I feel. Anyways, I am okay now if anyways is curious. Also, I hope everyone who’s struggling with this finds friends/companionship.. it’s not late and nobody knows what will happen… stay positive 💜💜",2022-11-17 11:50:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636571606,78,/r/lonely/comments/yxo9bt/it_seems_like_you_can_only_exist_for_work_thats_it/,,0,33,It seems like you can only exist for work.

3399,yxsgkw,[deleted],"Hi all

So I'm m, in my early 40's, fit, healthy, married, kids, good job etc, so everything should be good, but I'm really lonely.

Like a lot of people I guess, everyday is the same, interactions outside work become less and less and suddenly you realise you've done the same thing everyday and every weekend for the last week, month, day, year and not really shared it with anyone!

It's hard feeling to explain because on the surface everything looks good, but inside its just makes me a feel sad and I don't really have anyone to share this feeling with or open up about it with. I know a lot of people, but I have no real friends at this point, which is also very hard to accept.

Kinda unsure why I'm posting this, but it feels OK to be writing this and saying aloud it as I type, perhaps just owning it will help me do something about it!",2022-11-17 15:00:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/yxsgkw/lonely_and_trying_to_fix_this/,,0,0,Lonely and trying to fix this!

Worked every shift last week, I was on the roster for this week but the manager texted that there's no shift  anymore and cancelled shifts.  So I got fired.

I played them a while back and i think they are great for lonely peeps. You essentially get contacted by someone and you sort of guide them through a story.

You don't get much say (got 2 options to pick from usually) but the games have plenty of endings and I believe over the course of the game it's very easy to consider the person a friend.

In real time mode the ingame actions actually take time. If you send them on a path they might take couple hours to message you again, giving the illusion that it's all real. You get a notification each time so it's almost as if an actual human is texting you.

3409,yxu530,[deleted],"In short it’s because males are chasing women hoping to take advantage of Women’s loneliness to get something sexual out of it. 

And because males are not reaching out to males - they’d rather look for something sexual from women.  

Women don’t reach out to males because at some point (through trial and error) we realize that males don’t give a shit about us and only want something sexual. 

It’s fucking exhausting to think that someone gives a shit about you and then somewhere down the road you realize that he’s just like every other male who wanted to talk to you trying to sexually exploit your loneliness. It happens enough to just not want male interaction at all. It’s always the same.

I encourage you TRY it. If you’re a male, post as a woman and see all the piranhas (men) show up and try to manipulate you and try to take advantage of your loneliness. And talk for an extended amount of time too, so you can see how they start off with a mask and slowly you start seeing the manipulation and the pretending to give a fuck but only in exchange for something sexual.

My 'family' dont love me. I'm nothing but the unwanted daughter when they wanted a son.  I got beat up, and treated like absolute shit. sometimes i wasnt allowed to eat, other times if i cried too loud i got beat up again. They hate having me. 
My 'friends' arent even close to me. I try so hard and all that happens is my efforts arent reciprocated. 
My ex i did everything for him. I loved him so hard i had so many plans i was so supportive of him and he still dropped me like I wasnt shit.

3414,yxv551,parampampampampampam,"I hate where I am in my life right now. I don't like the person I am or the person I've been for the biggest part of my life. I don't have many people around me and even the connections that I have are dying down. I am in my mid 20s and it seems like other people my age are living their best lives doing things, while I am at the lowest point I've ever been in socially. 

I think my problem is that I've been a shy, introverted and ""good"" kid back when I was in school. I wouldn't take any risks, I wouldn't go out of my way to meet new people, so I always had a very small social circle around me and never really built up good social skills. I only really started to actually try and be more active socially and do more 'fun' things when I went to uni and that was honestly the best time of my life when I did meet cool people. It didn't last long though, because then the lockdown happened and when it ended, we graduated, so we no longer had anything to further build our connections on. Now those few people that I can actually call my friends are living abroad and those who are still here, I am not that close with (and with those 'local' connections the relationship is kind of one-sided because I am usually the one who initiates the conversations or tries to make plans , because they don't really bother that often. I don't blame them, I am not an interesting person, I suck at making interesting conversations and I never really know what to say).

I am the loneliest I've ever been in my life because I (usually) have no one to spend my time with. No one to go out for a coffee or a beer with. No one to actually talk to (I don't mean texting (which is not bad in any way, just not what I need at the moment), I mean 'actual' conversations). If I do manage to make any plans, I will be looking forward to them like nothing else, I will be super happy when I do actually go out and then I will feel miserable when I am alone again (which is most of the time). I hate the weekends because I feel pressure to do something fun with others but I have nothing. I absolutely dread the upcoming New Years Eve, because everyone will do things and I will be alone. 

 I feel like I don't even know how to speak to people my age anymore. How to be fun. How to relate to others. I do have hobbies and interests (or I used to have them), but nothing really brings joy anymore, so I don't really know who I am anymore. I do have a decent job, but it's not really my thing and I don't have much in common with the people I work with. I have started volunteering, but it doesn't require much team work or anything, so it doesn't really help to meet new people, I am mostly doing that to pass the free time that I have on my hands. I am just scared that this is my life forever now. Not even life, just mere existing. And I don't really know what the problem is with me. Is it possible to get out of this loop?

My issue now is....I just dont know how to meet people. And specifically meet people to find a relationship. All I ever hear is it'll happen when you arent looking for it, or give it time, etc. But I never hear any decent advice.

All I do for the most part is go to work, and come home. Unfortunately I live with my parents atm, so its not the easiest situation. But still. I dont do much outside of work. But I just dont know where to go. Clubs/bars have never been my thing. I dont really drink. I went to a convention a few weeks back, but it was a really isolating event because no one seemed to really be doing anything actually social. 

The only thing I have outside of work and home is Im apart of a small meetup group focused around a hobby, but they dont really do anything. They only meet once or twice a month, and they also have a strict rule against asking any members out anyway. Which isnt a problem, I get it. But definitely creates a different environment.

I just want to meet women out there that would be around my age, people I could at least attempt to pursue a relationship with. But I genuinely do not know where to look.

3437,yxy2bg,QuixPanda,"I was in a weird cycle where I'd feel lonely and depressed and would start picking up shifts. Next thing, summer is over, fall is half way over. I'd spend weeks on autopilot trying to be numb to my physical and emotional pain. I'd text my friends, but not everyday. Sometimes over a week would go by without me talking to anyone out side of home/ work. 

 I'd want so badly to talk to my friends, but I'd conclude that they have their own lives and dont want me to have a large part in their's. Then I'd avoid social media for weeks at a time so as not to watch them. Note: it's okay to not be the friend that initiates conversations via text. It doesn't make you a bad person. As long as you start the conversation once in a while if you don't hear from your friend. I started telling them how I felt and things got a lot better. Unfortunately, picking up those extra shifts made me too unavailable and I missed many plans because of that. 

It's hard to be grown up. You have the freedom and money to do what you want to do, but now, you and your friends are too busy. I don't blame them, that's just life sometimes. I'm speaking to professional about how to break free from being a workaholic. Although I broke my cycle for now and set boundaries, I can see myself slipping back into it.

Most days I don't step out of my room other than to buy groceries. And most days i have no one to talk to but myself. My mom calls me sometimes to ask about my day. I make up stories about how i met my imaginary friends and spent the entire day with them. She seems happy to know that I am happy. 
I want to make friends but i get really anxious talking to people. 
Sometimes old friends call to rant about their lives and they tell me so many stories and then they ask about what happening in my life. So i tell them all sorts of believable made up stories.

3446,yxzfi6,[deleted],"so you’re probably thinking i’m crazy immediately after reading the title, and to that, i’d say… “yea, little bit.”

so for the past 3 years now, i’ve been incredibly lonely. even before the pandemic lockdowns, i was already locked in my own room, spending all day everyday watching movies and playing video games. after spending years of practically begging for my friends’ attention, i had decided to stop talking to them all. while it hurt to be lonely, it hurt even more to be subservient to people who didn’t value nor care for me at all.

anyways, all of that to say, i don’t really have the greatest impression of other people and would much rather not be associated with them. still, loneliness is my shroud, and it pains me everyday to keep pretending like it isn’t. so what did i do to make everyone think i’m not actually a miserable outcasted loner? i created a fake boyfriend. it started out just as a little joke where i made up this ideal guy in my mind back when i had friends. then slowly, but surely, i started refining him, giving him a personality, a name, even specific measurements and such. granted, of course, i used an AI to random generate this kind of stuff for a more authentic feel.

anyways, it’s been almost one year now since i’ve been “dating” this fake person. while, at first, it was just a silly little thing i’d keep in mind as comfort, this “guy” has slowly become more and more pervasive in my everyday life. suddenly, he’s all that i’ve been thinking about, and more-so how much it hurts that he doesn’t exist. i’ve probably spent several weeks worth crying about this, even knowing full well that this is my own fault for creating him in my head. i told myself that he was just the embodiment of my own self-love, but that isn’t necessarily true. in my head, he is this romantic dork who openly loves me unconditionally, something i as a person have been unfamiliar with. 

anyways, i just wanted to share this because i have nobody else to tell. a few of my old “friends” know of his existence, but none of them know how far this has progressed. i mean, shit, i’ve already got baby names picked out. i’ve already started planning our wedding. i’ve already planned out the perfect life for a man who literally doesn’t exist outside of my mind. 

this is definitely one of the weirdest heartbreaks i’ve ever had, but it’s also definitely the most mind-fucking one as well. i genuinely have no idea what to do in this situation, especially because it keeps on prevailing despite me being fully self-aware about the entire situation. what’s the best way to go about fixing this situation? :/",2022-11-17 19:40:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/yxzfi6/obsessedin_love_with_a_person_who_doesnt_exist_i/,,0,12,obsessed/in love with a person who doesn’t exist (i need serious advice lol)

I have no friends at my college so honestly that class is the highlight of my day, even though I have social anxiety and forget what to say and sound dumb when he talks to me. It was the last class today before Thanksgiving break and about half the class was absent. We were watching a video and he came in late and sat in an empty seat in the back with some friends of his instead of in his normal seat. It feels so pathetic how much it affected me. I hate getting attached to people easily because of my loneliness, and I especially hate when they happen to be hardcore extroverts with tons of friends like him. It's just a reminder of how I never matter to people as much as they matter to me. I feel especially depressed about it because after the break we'll only have a few more days of class together, and then when the semester ends I'll likely never see him again. And he most likely doesn't care at all or think about whether we'll talk again or not. He's just a talkative person and I'm literally just a random NPC in his mind.

I am not a Christian, I am agnostic, but I told myself that it could be a really good thing for me to go along and meet different kinda people to who I am used to meeting, hoping that I might be able to click with these people and in the back of my mind I was open to the idea of God, because I felt desperate and very lonely. As I was travelling to the church in the rain later in the day, I felt extremely nervous. I was very close to going into the building but before I knew it my heart was beating out of my chest and my legs were carrying me in the opposite direction.

3472,yy3kjh,MaxZarech,"Hello, sorry if this post won't fit into this subreddit, couldn't really find the right one.

So, I have felt a certain way for a long while, possibly even years. Ever since I was a kid, I had very unstable emotions. I wasn't a bad kid, I listened to others and could talk regularly, I just had bad moods often. 

But after turning 15 or 16, can't remember precisely, I started.. not feeling emotions, I guess? Things that used to bring me joy, like drawing or books, just stopped being fun, and felt tedious. I stopped drawing and reading soon after. Things that used to frustrate the hell out of me became manageable inconveniences, not because I got better at dealing with them, but because I stopped caring as much. When I did something good, like drawing an objectively nice drawing, finishing a book or getting a good grade, I stopped being happy about it and just went on with life because I didn't feel like celebrating. I also started to feel like I'm doing stuff purely through muscle memory, and my mind often goes blank, just staring into a corner or somewhere that looks natural. The only things that can spark emotions in me are rare cases in videogames and tv series, and I only actually feel really happy when I'm outside with friends or in a call with them. I also tend to forget stuff that I don't do daily within a week. My memories are a big blur and I can't recall almost anything from my childhood clearly. 

Thing is, nobody knows. Dunno why, but I feel like became very good at just naturally acting emotions, and I don't really know why. I feel like I should be afraid, or at least concerned with my situation, but I'm not. 

A lot of these ""symptoms"", for the lack of a better word, have gotten more intense this month. I just feel like that if I'm not talking with my friends, I'm just.. surviving, not living. The only times I really feel a strong warmth is when my close friends hug me, and even that has gotten weaker recently. I just have this itch that what I should be feeling is hidden under so many layers of something that I can't even understand myself. I used to think this was caused by loneliness, but I'm starting to think it's not.

I'm writing this both to order my thoughts and to ask for you opinions on this situation. Do you think this is just a phase? Could this be caused by loneliness? Is it justified to think this way or should I not worry and press on?",2022-11-17 22:26:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1558018922,2,/r/lonely/comments/yy3kjh/ranti_am_in_a_strange_state/,,0,2,(Rant)I am in a strange state

3512,yy9e23,Glass_of_Rainfall,"Throughout my life most of my friendships have been one-sided, so I ended up with no friends in my teenage years. Eventually, I decided to stop trying to make friends; worked on myself, career, physically, and other stuff. I’m in my late 20s now….met a few people (all women) at my new workplace, and we hit it off. I thought I finally met good people in my life that I could consider as friends. 

After hanging out with them for a few months, I met another girl and she became my girlfriend soon. For some reason my somewhat new friends didn’t appreciate it and ended up having a problem with it. One of them, who is the closest to me, had an argument with me about it as well. She tried to convince me to leave my girlfriend, but I didn’t. Eventually she started getting slightly cold towards me (but not outrightly rude), the rest of them also started following suit. Eventually it started to feel as if all of them just unanimously started to push me away, and no matter how much I tried reach out, continue showing my appreciation for them, they never returned it. It stopped. At present, they have stopped bothering to even ask about my well-being, whereabouts etc. We used to leave work together. Now they leave by themselves and don’t even bother informing me. 

Everything feels like it’s going to square one. This too has turned into a one-sided friendship where it feels as if they never truly considered me as a friend in the first place. I’ve been made to feel guilty for having a girlfriend (who tells me that one of them liked me actually)…I’ve been made to feel as it’s my fault, as if something is wrong with me.

Generally nothing comes of these arguments and they go back to the way they were, which is a couple effectively living apart in the house (it’s a big house) save for acknowledging each other in the morning and then the evening.

I often get sad about this and though I know nothing comes of it my heart races whenever they get angry and I have a room I can hide in. I used to get away from this with school but now it’s harder because I graduated and I’m home more now.

I don’t want to encourage divorce or separation because it’ll just start a whole lot of anger and I have extremely less energy than they do for arguments. 

I’ve said to them to basically just chill out and stop retaliating but I seem a lot better at that than they are (and neither of them taught me that, believe that). They’re so fixed in their ways.

I’m my happiest when they are both out doing things and I’m home alone, or when I’m out and they’re not around.

I don’t know what to do. I have no one to talk to about this and I feel helpless and I just wish I could will myself 10 years into the future where I live alone and have a stable enough income not to have to speak to them that often.

Any advice on how to deal with this (mainly emotionally) would be fantastic, but I mainly wanted to feel less alone in it.

3535,yybxy8,sharmakiran96,"Think about some of the problems of our daily lives, and how many of them would be eased if we could learn to [sit alone](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5639771935523156237/1542005977912941530#), in a quiet empty room, with contentment.  
If you’re content to sit alone quietly, you don’t need to eat junk food, to shop on impulse, to buy the latest gadget, to be on social media to see what everyone else is talking about or doing, to compare yourself to others, to make more money to keep up with the Joneses, to achieve glory or power, to conquer other lands or wage war, to be rude or violent to others, to be selfish or greedy, to be constantly busy or productive.

You are content, and need nothing else. It solves a lot of problems.  
Can you sit alone in an empty room? Can you enjoy the joy of quiet?  
Most of us have trouble sitting alone, quietly, doing nothing. We have the need to do something, to check our inboxes and social media, to be productive. Sitting still can be difficult if you haven’t cultivated the habit.  
I’ve been learning. In the morning, as my coffee is brewing, I sit. Even for a few minutes, at first, it is instructive. You learn to listen to your thoughts, to be aware of your urges to do something else, to plan and set goals. You learn to watch yourself, but to just sit still and not act on those urges. You learn to be content with stillness.  
You learn to savor the quiet. It’s something most of us don’t have, quiet, and it takes some getting used to. When we’re driving our cars or out exercising or eating or working, we have music playing or we talk with people or we have the television on. Quiet can be amazing, though, because it helps us calm down, contemplate, slow down to savor the emptiness.

An empty room, too, is a luxury. I try to empty my room of clutter, so that it’s fairly bare. That leaves only me, and the room is a blank slate ready to be filled with me, my creativity, my silence. I love a spartan room.  
Being alone is another pleasure we too often neglect. When we are alone, we go on the Internet or TV to see what else is going on, what others are doing or saying, instead of just being alone. This isolation is a necessary thing, that allows us to find ourselves, to learn to be content with little instead of always wanting more.  
Can you practice being alone, being still, being quiet? Just a little at first, then perhaps a bit more. Listen, watch, learn about yourself. Find contentment. Need nothing more.",2022-11-18 05:19:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1665116524,9,/r/lonely/comments/yybxy8/learning_to_sit_alone_in_a_quiet_empty_room/,,0,2,"Learning to Sit Alone, in a Quiet Empty Room"

So I guess I'll start by why I feel like this. So I've been single for 19 years. now for contents, I'm 29. I feel like I'll never be good enough for anyone. In my experience, I'm only liked for what I can do for others. Doesn't matter if it's a friendship that started in elementary school where we did everything together. or my current situation where I give someone a roof over their head, food in their belly, and saved them from becoming a druggie. I was never good enough for anyone. I've undergone weight loss surgery thinking no one wants to be with/friends with a fat guy. To now I hate how I look and I can't afford to fix it. My life now consists of work, home, and drinking when I get off work to help numb the pain of being alone. I'm tired of feeling this way. I just want someone to call my own. Someone to come home to and is happy to see me. I know I don't deserve any form of happiness in my life. I should just get used to this. It is how it's going to be. I shouldn't expect any form of happiness in my life.

3575,yygp8m,natooral-skeptic,"First of all I want you to know that you are not alone. Then I need you to understand one thing: Keep moving forward and become the best version of yourself.

Here's my story - names are changed in order to safeguard the privacy of the women mentioned: I am getting close to my 40th birthday and have been in several serious long-term relationships as well as a bunch of short-term relationships. I remember how much I loved my first long-term girlfriend Cory. We almost spent 4 years together, I had serious plans of marrying her and out of nowhere, she decided to leave me for another guy. I was in shock, yet what struck me even more is that some weeks later I learned that she did not only cheat on me with this new guy, but also my back-then best friend and band member. Both successfully managed hiding their affair for almost five months! So at the age of 22, I was broken. It took me almost two years to recover from the shock. My trust was gone, I tried to numb myself by drinking and smoking pot and basically wasted 24 months of my life being miserable.

Then Andrea came into my life - a beautiful Ukranian woman who was incredibly smart and witty. Above that, she understood my trust issues and we were happy for about a year. In that time, Cory reached out to me several times, begging for forgiveness and lamenting losing me. ""I should not have cheated on you, it was a mistake, yadda yadda."" Then I made the mistake of trying to be the ""bigger person"" in the sense of replying to her messages, clearly stating that I am in a new relationship now. That worried Andrea, so she decided to leave - and again I was devastated, projecting my frustration from Cory's betrayal onto Andrea. This time I decided to just date casually - I simply was too scared of any commitment. In the end I had a bunch of affairs and one night stands which just left me with this weird feeling of emptiness: No physical connection with these women ever felt like what I had with Cory and Andrea, so I just felt bad. During this period, both Andrea and Cory tried to make their ways back into my life, and as stupid as I was, I only ignored Cory and met up with Andrea. Andrea did openly confess that she was pregnant from some dude she had a fling with and gave me the: ""I don't know what got into me, that guy doesn't even slightly compare to you - you are a loyal and decent guy, he just was a player."" Needless to say I decided to not engage in any relationship with Andrea, yet made the mistake of trying to keep her as a casual friend as she never cheated on me. For about a year, she was quite demanding in terms of asking me to assist with works that had to be done in her house and all, and being a good guy I just wanted to help out a single mom who needed some help, right?

In my late twenties, I randomly bumped into that stunning Italian girl called Massima. The name means ""greatest of all"" and boy, she was. Honest, loyal, respectful, loving, kind and not the type of woman who just slept around with dozens of guys - the full package. She even understood my trust issues and was incredibly compassionate in that regard. I could not believe my luck, and after about 1 1/2 years of being together, we moved in together. What followed were the three most beautiful years of my life, and looking back at all of my failed relationships and shallow flings/affairs, I thought that I had hit the jackpot. It seemed as if all the hard work did finally pay off: I was clean for a while, built my first own business and Massima and I lived the good life traveling, exploring the world and a way more mature love than I could imagine at that point. Then my mother died and I fell into a deep hole. At first, Massima stuck to my side and offered me all the support she could possibly offer. Which, after some more months, made me decide to propose to her. I mean there she is: That one woman never letting you down, brightening your every day, right? So we got engaged and I decided to focus on therapy to process the loss of my mother in order to become the old and stable version of me both I and Massima deserved. Then one day during a session with my counselor, I get this text message of Massima stating that she will pick up her stuff after work. Again, right out of the blue this hit me with full force. I asked why, and all I got as an explanation was an immature: ""Dynamics, I don't want to discuss this anymore."" Coming home that day, I just saw her packing her possessions as if it was the most normal thing in the world. I could not believe my eyes, so I kind of begged her to at least talk to me about her motivation to do so. She left in silence just to never be seen again. That was not all too long ago, and up until this day I never got any closure.

During the first months of the breakup period, I was contacted by two girls I had casual affairs with who somehow managed to get the news of the breakup and even my contact details. Told both of them that I got to focus on myself and that I do not appreciate them approaching again immediately after hearing that I could be an option. In these days, I understood for the first time that I am way too valuable to be an option in the first place - must have been because I matured into my 30s and realized that I am worth more than what certain women saw in me.

When I learned that Massima did engage in another relationship or affair just some months after she dumped me, I was even more devastated as after the betrayal of Cory. Simply because Massima did not cheat on me and basically just vanished, taking all my hopes for realizing the vision I had for us from me. And I could not even be angry, after all she did not betray me. Still it did hurt to see her moving on. For a long time it did, and I did seek the help of a counselor again because I simply could not understand how it could be that after all these years of making mistakes and learning from them I still could get dumped even though everything was going well in my opinion. Depression hit hard, I lost my job, and there I was: Alone, unemployed and realizing that the very vision of a future collapsed.

Fast forward to today: Seeking psychological support gave me back some basic strength, so I started my second own business which currently is picking up in pace. In a couple of months I might be able to earn a decent living from what I have built, and guess what: Just some days ago, I receive a message of a certain person. It is Massima of course, and she too kept pleading and begging for another chance. This time I got the: ""I did not know what I was doing, I thought I needed more freedom and some detachment from the problems in your life, and circumstance just got me in touch with pretty mean men I engaged with, for which I feel so shameful."" At that point I understood what was really going on here: Even those women who seem like top notch partners will eventually think that the grass could be greener on the other side - and when they realize that they were wrong, the begging starts again.

Turning down Massima probably was one of the hardest choices I ever made, but I can say that it was the right choice. Not because I despise her - I cherish the amazing time I had with her and would not want to miss a single one of these days. A part of me even still loves her. Yet that experience showed me that, no matter how great your relationship seems, even decent women may eventually take an absolutely irrational decision at the cost of their spouses wellbeing. In my case, it seems as if there simply was a lack of genuine commitment - cause in good times, things were perfect and once I hit that rocky road with the passing of my mother, the days of our relationship had already been numbered in her mind, I guess. All despite the fancy ""I will always stick with you cause this tragedy is anything but your fault"" kind of talk.

So what is the key takeaway here: Many women commit to their partners for as long as they are feasible enough in their view, even the really good ones. I don't know if this is because today, everyone can quickly install dating apps or the expectation that every single day needs to be sunshine and rainbows. I really don't. But I guess this is why so many men get frustrated and bitter, becoming total a...holes after being treated like this repeatedly. Which only keeps that circle of misery and distrust going, turning so many people into really bad individuals.

A long story, I know - but what I want to tell all of you guys out there: Don't get bitter. Don't start hating women, not even if you have been mistreated repeatedly. Focus in your inner world and become stronger, greater and more honourable. That part is hard, yes, and you will have to struggle and cry and lose your sh\*t once in a while, but remember what great guys you used to be once. Don't lose these versions of you and trust in yourself: You can rebuild yourself and who knows, maybe just tomorrow you might meet another gorgeous woman who, this time, really is the real deal. Nobody knows who might be right around the next corner - but is up to you to face that person as a man who learned from his past mistakes and takes ownership for what might have gone wrong. Be the best version of yourself and keep fighting for becoming just that.

And to women I can only say this: It strikes me how many of you eventually end up in regret once you realize that you might have enjoyed your adventures with guys that might just look a bit hotter than your good and decent partners. Maybe you should consider sticking with those guys who might have their minor flaws,but are genuine, kind, romantic and loyal to the bone. Because if you don't, chances are you end up engaging with pretty nasty guys who have nothing else to offer to you than their own desire to bang whoever they can lay their hands on. And if you are just leaving good men because you want to experience more of what you call ""freedom"", at least realize that - even though this decision always is your fair right - it comes with consequences.

Nothing good comes from rebounds and messing around with the feelings of decent, committed people. It just turns them into nasty people eventually. Which, again, brings me to the guys: Don't allow yourself to get bitter. Use your frustration and your pain as a catalyst for your own improvement. Work on your career, your fitness, your character and stay the honourable, loving men you always were or at least used to be before getting hurt.

Wishing everybody to find true love.

PS: About the tip for the girls - you seriously need to start asking yourself whether you are capable of commitment or not. At my age, I get approached by so many women who are also about to hit their 40s that I can barely believe it. Most of these women are either single mothers looking for someone helping them out with their kid of another man, or they simply realized that all of us human beings do age eventually and that most good men are either taken or done with being options. I don't know why this is, maybe this all has to do with modern dating apps and the vast choice of potential mates girls have when they are still very young, attractive and chased by dozens of young men. The point: In my experience, most young women keep thinking that they can keep their eyes open for a guy who is just a little bit ""better"" than the latest, only to realize eventually that they have dumped perfectly fine and decent men they could rely on for players or men unable to commit to a relationship themselves. Needless to say that if such women blame men for their own poor choices, it is not our fault but theirs. Not all women do this, of course, but quite some. The fact of the matter is that the majority of breakups is initiated by women, and quite often simply because they are - for whatever reason - dissatisfied with their partners and got bigger expectations than those that fit reality. Most breakups happen during difficult periods in life, yet being a good partner always meant working things out. It still does and always will. If you are not capable (or not willing) to put up the same effort a good guy puts up for you, you simply do not deserve that man. Same with second chances: You had your chance, yet if you mess up, you got to reap what you have once sown yourself.

And no, that does not mean all women are bad and I am certainly not suggesting that men should turn into these hateful and bitter guys who go on YouTube and what not just to hate on women. All I am saying is that we all need to grow up and be better people to one another, because evidently most of us are not.   


So yeah guys, you just focus on yourself to achieve grandeur. Don't get addicted to the validation of the other gender, but learn how to healthily validate yourself. Then all other things will fall into place.

Its something normal people do a lot, I do not understand if eveeyone just lacks empathy but even if someone defends such person these people just shut the person who defended them up too, I dont understand what is so interesting someone who struggles...it is like making fun of someone who is an invalid, they're not at fault their legs dont work. I do not understand normal people's hatred for tears/anger and finding it funny, especially if someone can't control it. Its like ordering someone to stop sweating thats not how it works. Why are some people like that? What evolutionary advantage does that give ? Why do they receive pleasure from making others suffer and ruining their reputation and isolating them when they are already isolated and have no idea why people dislike them or dont want to be their friend or sit next to them when it is somehow magically obvious for everyone else. I do not understand bullying. How it starts. Why it starts. In the jungle bullying has other purposes and you can actually fight it or run away while you are always at disadvantage and people twice your mass and 5 times your size gang up on you so you wouldnt stand a chance. Its even uglier when its guys against an anorexic girl. the funniest thing is that they thought itm akes them manly and cool.

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont understand why guys hate me and why girls who are horrible, manipulative and bitchy always received positive attention while my anxiety and struggles received verbal, emotional and other kinds of abuse that werent physical or sexual so they were hard to be taken seriously. What makes people think - yeah this person is quiet, that is abnormal, I will abuse them ! Cause I have read that it is unconcious but I dont really feel agression towards different people or people i dont understand, yet people think its okay to always disrespect me and treat me like trash, its hard to set boundaries and be assertive that way. How do you adress situations when people disrespect you? What do you do when people dont care about your feelings and hurt you on purpose....what do you say then? I was bullied heavily all of my life for things I can't control and feel traumatized because I don't understand why it happened. ""Being weak"" or them being bored isn't really a reason and I don't understand how crying, a human thing and human emotion, makes someone weak, its like saying someone eating food makes someone weak, exploit it and steal their food. Tears are fundamental part of my self, and now with my hromonal disbalance I cry at the smalest of things but unfortunetly my tears made my bullies smirk at me and continue, as if they won a nobel prize....for making soneone known as a crybaby, to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

Their job is far too easy and yet they treat it as if its something to be prideful of which doesnt make sense, they dont really win money or anything from ruining my life, most of them looked like they had too much free time on their hands and dint know how to spend it besides hurting others for fun. I also do not understand what makes me sad/angry/offended anymore, I seem even more sensitive now and scream/cry a lot more. I have been told to die a lot and that I was ugly and disgusting and rarely cried and now in the last few years, an internet comment or someone showing me their finger or even telling me I am pretty, which I dont believe is enough to set me into an episode of crying, as if its severe insult, I do not know how to regulate my hormones but i dont want to take hormones since they make you fat and are dangerous, my country isnt known for the best healthcare which is why i dont trust anti depressents either. Americans think its okay to get antidepressents but antidepressents ruined my family, my father took them for 7 years and became completely mentally inadequate and had bad side effects cause of them, they didn't help him at all, and he changed a few even, so its not like he tried it and gave up, they also make you sleepy so he changed doses and still nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I also hate people who use them since they have the easy life while I am going insane for the past 3 years and feel severe constant pain in my throat and heart and despite doing tests I am healthy, so I know its mental. I feel like I can't move on from my trauma unless I learn what made me such an easy target and how to contorl my emotions/tears, its more of a reflex rather than feeling sad or offended, I just react due to people pushing my buttosn a lot and having to hide my emotions which is very hard for me and i dont seem to do it well if people never stopped bullying me even until my prom. I find it hard to see guys in positive light since only guys bullied me and ganged up on me, I see them as cowards and rapists. I see my trauma very sexually which makes me see sex in negative light and be afraid of it. I also feel helpless and struggle to breathe sometimes just by being reminded of them, how can I cope? I have these hysterical shoutings out of anger and was never able to control my self, but if I stuff it down...I just do it more or become nonverbal, suicidal and depressed, its as if my body is a shell and I don't react to being talked to, so neither expressing them cause I look like I am crazy and people make fun of me and abuse me, neither never expressing them. Meditation, yoga and drawing don't work. I used to draw a lot but now it makes me severely upset. I am not good at sports either to let all of that energy onto something, I am afraid because I feel like unless I cry or scream I can't express them, unfrotunetly no one will tolerate me or cares about me and people just abuse me if I do. I feel like I have to constantly hide in the toilet and breathe slowly or else I scream and cry in pain because I feel like I am dying and am afraid for my life. I dont want to be a part of society if all life is pain and suffering. I haven't felt any pleasure or desire for life or motivation in 10 years, what can I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite being a girl guys haven't liked me since 4th grade, I do not know what I lack as a woman but most guys where I live are rude and overconfident as well as vulgar, its hard to find educated,normal,kind people since where I live its mostly rude,loud people, thats the balkans for you. Most girls are also like the guys dumb, create drama, talk about boys and fake nails and genuinelly lack any hobbies or interests and are very socially savvy unlike me. I always felt like I was a little girl cosplaying as a woman and despite having a vagina I never felt like a real woman since real women are a bit more evil and manipulative while I am just emotional and try my best and don't talk much. I dont understand why I am boring but even on tinder most of the guys I went with complained that girls wanted ""relationship"" but wanted to test if the guy is ""good for anything"" with sex or else they didnt want to be in relationship with them which is Wh0ry behavior, but thats normal cause most girls and guys lack any culture or principles they follow and just act like animals cause thats my culture. Unforutnetly people like me get abused and exploited since I am not socially savvy or loud, whcih expresses confidence apperently. I struggled with eye contact and anxiety since 4th grade since I became very self aware and still struggle and wonder how people perceive me or what they think of me. Why is it important what people think of me? - If they dont like me they start to abuse me, thats why. and it is so subtle that it is hard to report it in a country where no one takes emotional or verbal abuse seriously and its seen as something you have to magically deal with your self but once these people choose you as your victim they dont give up easily, no ignoring will stop them which is why I lose my sanity when people tell me to not answer or to ignore them I was bullied until prom and still have no idea why since I didn't do any crimes or hurt anyone, and thats my problem, I cant hurt anyone and thats important apperently. I am tired of being hit mentally and being too afraid to defend my self because I find verbal communication confusing and am ""put in my place"" quickly if I try to stand up for my self. Neither to stay silent nor speak, both led to more abuse and I don't know why, and people who told me to just punch them made me feel worse, I would have never won and they would have most likely beaten me up despite being a girl sicne I am not a real girl and don't deserve respect unless I wear tight clothes and act wh0ry...and I just had short hair and baggy clothes, which isn't wh0ry and apperently no girl before me has had short hair which makes me a ""tr1nsvestite"" in their eyes. Its like people cant express them selves ever or they receive abuse, why is that.",2022-11-18 12:02:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644355556,7,/r/lonely/comments/yyifoh/why_is_shynessnot_talkinganxiety_seen_as/,,0,1,"Why is shyness/not talking/anxiety seen as something weak and to be abused?

I'm currently off work with stress and anxiety, largely due to my father's recent diagnosis with cancer. Since being off work I've hardly left the house and I'm starting to feel very isolated. I'm a relatively private person and would probably be considered an introvert.

The one person I consider a friend (a work colleague) doesn't seem interested in knowing me anymore. Whenever I text her, whatever I text her, she just replies with ""👍"". So here I am reaching out to strangers online to see if I can build any connections, feel free to send me a message.

3594,yykh3w,Cyborg_0,"its like i try so hard to make people like me but no one really does. i feel like im stupid and uninteresting. i just dont want to waste anymore time. im 21. i just dont know what i want, i know making friends wont make me happy, or porn, or video games, or tv shows all are just a distraction, and i like IT but even college is like work, probably the only positive thing i have. 

when i think about it its really not that hard, its either hate my self and live a miserable life or love my self and have a decent life. but since there is so many books to read, so many ways to improve and i have so many problems, on top of that i want to be smarter and do well in college, all of it becomes overwhelming af

i dont know what to work on, i dont have ""big goals"" to fight for, i exercise, do well in college, meditate, but to what end.. im reading a book called ""Feeling good"" it talks about (writing down the negative thoughts and countering those negative thoughts with factual and objective ones) but i rarely have those. 

tired of not working on my self and tired of being lazy, i look for others approval, im boring,i have nothing to talk about,i run out of questions super quickly

i have no hobbies, no therapy possible in where i live, even online, i live in iraq/Kurdistan its where dreams die, 
i have no friends, no big dreams 

first year in college in IT, which i kinda like, its all programing and coding, which takes up a lot of time. but i will probably end up getting a boring job.


i want to learn more skills i just dont know what exactly, the only book topics i have read have been self help books

i know i have to love my self before others can love me, my self esteem isnt low its just my self value, i dont know how to make my self believe that im worthy, good enough. 

i want to be smart, confident, assertive, and love my self more and stop being a ""boring nice guy"" and stop looking for others approval and stop depending on the outside sources to be happy, i want to get better at talking to people because i suck at it. but i have no idea what to say most of the time.

i just dont know how to make my self happy or depend or what internal sources to depend on...i just know i need to stop basing my self worth on others validation, and work on my self

if i don't depend on external sources to be happy, what do i depend it on

i know i cant depend on people or other sources to make my self happy, sometimes i use porn as a distraction away from my problems",2022-11-18 13:46:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641988785,8,/r/lonely/comments/yykh3w/i_dont_know_what_my_purpose_is_but_i_know_that/,,0,8,I don't know what my purpose is but i know that its not chasing people's approval or watching porn for my whole life.

But this psycho bitch when I fucking burnt my hand said I don’t care. Granted I did cuss her out and blamed her for wishing that I would. I can’t fucking take it anymore.

I need a job but no one will hire me because I’m 19 with no experience or maybe it’s cuz I’m black with an ethnic last name. I’m so lonely and depressed and I’ve been treated with pills but didn’t work, my doctor is an asshole and never listens to me.

3639,yyr7ib,Epialles,"So yesterday strated out as a normal day, but then I realized how close we are to Christmas. Over this past year my family has slowly been pushing me out and for the first time I don't know we're I was going to be for Christmas. And on top of all the other things that have happened, me lossing my job that I loved. And being led on my my manager at that job, who I thought I was in love with and did absolutely everything for. I even got get a record player for her birthday cause no one had ever gotten her a birthday present before. But it turns out it was all for nothing, I gave everything and ended up with nothing. 
My best friend sinjin of almost 11 years, is slowly slipping away. His girlfriend doesn't let him hag out with me on Xbox any more and I have literally told sinjin everything about my life. He is the best friend I could ever ask for, but his girlfriend doesn't like me for some reason. I'm a good person, at least I try to be. 
But it all these feelings just boiled over and I broke down and started crying...
I'll be alone this Christmas probably
But that's ok, I'm used to being alone, my family pushed me out that's fine they never treated me good anyways, I was always the outcast. 
But I hope all of you have a good Thanksgiving and Christmas

3650,yysvvc,WrittenEuphoria,"So some advice I got here was to find a new hobby. I heard about people getting into coloring books during the pandemic and thought hey, I liked doing that as a kid - specifically, meticulously tracing over pre-made designs. Especially anime drawings with their easy-to-follow and bold lines.  

So I bought some water-based markers and a couple books and I'm happily coloring away. But it hits me - this doesn't help my loneliness at all! Instead of sitting in my room and playing video games or mindlessly watching YT videos/doomscrolling reddit, I'm...sitting in my room, mindlessly coloring in random flowers and mermaids and shit.  

This doesn't bring me any closer to people. Sure, it's another hobby I can tell people about...but what people?  

It's funny...I have this habit-forming app with all my daily, weekly, and monthly tasks on it. Record calories, exercise, clean my CPAP machine, take my meds. One weekly task is ""Do something social."" I've had that on there for 6 weeks. I've completed it twice.  

For the past 3 weeks I've done nothing but gone to work and then back home, maybe go out to get some food or myself (or my cat). The only people I talk to are redditors, and my parents (and my siblings if they stop by to say hi to our folks).  

So yeah, I'm glad I have something to do when video games get me frustrated or angry, to calm my nerves....but it's not helping with my loneliness. I wish I could enjoy things that can actually be done socially, but so far I never have...hard to meet people without that little detail ironed out :/",2022-11-18 19:50:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649451118,1,/r/lonely/comments/yysvvc/im_an_idiot_lonely_but_an_idiot/,,0,4,"I'm an idiot.

My bf felt left out even tho i explain to him what seminars, quizzes, lectures, exams mean and how important it is to prepare in advance. He doesn't understand how stressful school can be, he dropped out of school in 9th grade.

Now debt collectors are contacting him , where we live they have a right to deduct it from his salary. He tried to borrow money from his family they said no, and he asked me to take bank loan so can pay his bills i said no . He asked me to contact my parents ane borrow from them, telling them that i have credit problems i said no .He felt that everyone abandoned him including me.

I hope you will be loved for all the bad times you pushed through.
I hope that even if right now you might feel like there is nothing and nobody for you out there, that one day there will be a place for you, people for you.

I hope after years of suffering one day you will find your dimension, your small measure of peace.

We were talking close but then we stopped, but this year we started talking again and got even closer. Now she was special to me because she was the only girl who had ever shown me any romantic interest. It’s hard when all my friends are dating and I’m the one single guy and I find myself feeling incredibly lonely. I felt so isolated and cold. The world seemed to pass me by and I can only watch. My friends were there but always distant and focused on the girls they really cared for. So when a really cute, funny, caring, smart, and understanding girl that I had known since elementary school showed interest in ME, me of all people, I was infatuated. I got so close to almost officially dating her but she kept pulling away at the last moment and eventually ghosted me. A few months go by and she and I start talking again. We got close once again. Went to dinner, went to football games, hung out at her house. But then just like that… she was gone. She ghosted me and all my friends kinda of made fun of me because I was the guy that fell for the same trick twice. She and I also share a mutual friend, so I a why her  I was ghosted again by that person that I cared so much for. And it wasn’t that I was ugly or not funny or something like that. It was because I wasn’t BLACK!Apparently she really liked me but I didn’t fit her racial preference. I don’t have anything wrong with that but she didn’t tell me up front so I got led on again to think that someone actually cared about me. So here I am, at the bottom, again. My friends are happier than ever and I am once more… alone. I’m a very extroverted person by nature but when I get home from school the house feels deafeningly quiet and I am millions of miles away from everyone else. I so badly want to share love with someone but it’s as if no one sees me. I feel as though I am a pane of glass: people smile and wave but they aren’t looking at me, but at someone else they actually care about behind my fragile transparent surface.

3723,yz1r0a,2020understatement,"I [25M] recently moved to a new country to pursue my master's. For all my life in my home country, i have been mostly alone, with not many close friends (read no close friends). Despite this, I never felt alone. I was either engaged in work, hobbies, reading or something else, and I never had time to think about my loneliness. But ever since I moved to the new country, things have been different. I can't pursue any of my old hobbies, am burdened with over-taxing coursework and am stuck with three flatmates (from my home country too), who I feel are deliberately trying to alienate me.

They make plans and have fun in my absence, and even if I am present, they do not include me. They stop conversations when I walk into the house/room or talk in a room with the doors closed. They prepare meals only for the three of them and don't even offer it to me.

Now i understand they are not obligated to include me in any of their plans, or meals or whatever else, but it stings when I think that I'm being cast out. 

I've been spending more time by myself, thinking and writing about my thoughts. Sometimes, I have drastic urges to end it all and kill myself. In the last month or so, twice I've gone as far as holding a knife to my own wrist and throat about to slit it. The only thing that stopped me from going further was the thought of my family back home. I'm afraid if things continue, I may actually end my life. I need help. I need a friend.

3742,yz3eew,SomeRedditPerson10,"A friend of mine had cried about her and her boyfriend breaking up and how it's all her fault. It was sad and I felt bad for her because I know what it's like to go through a bad breakup and put the blame all on yourself. I was with a group though and everyone who was around her was immediately there for her. I felt bad for a second because then I remembered in my bad breakup I had no one, not a single person there to comfort and hug me. She asked for someone to tell her everything will be ok. I had hugged her and told her everything will be ok. 

Later though I couldn't help but think no one had ever done that for me, ever. To a different group of people I had talked about that. When I had tried talking about that, how lonely I started to feel that no one had ever done that for me I felt myself cry, uncontrollably. The words were so easy to say, “I want to be held and told it will all be ok,” but I felt my lip quiver and my face contort so against my will. Its like my body physically couldn't handle admitting it out loud.

I suffer so many problems I’m beginning to lose grip of myself and reality, in moments I feel so overwhelmed that I almost feel like I'm dreaming, like none of my suffering is real, but it is. I’m losing so much of everything. I’m so tired of it, of the pain, the loneliness, the responsibilities only growing bigger, my inability to properly connect with people.

3745,yz3rdb,PinkNoon," I \[20F\] fully decided to avoid any future relationships and focus only on my future career and personal goals. 

Reasons why:

1.   **The relationships I have formed with people have been harmful to my physical and mental health.** This hasn't just been my romantic relationships or friendships, it's been with acquaintances, coworkers, and even my own family. Growing up with food insecurity, many people chose to take advantage of me in exchange for my basic needs. My parents always told me they would protect me, but never believed me when I told them this. I have been stalked at my own job by customers/coworkers who are obsessed with the idea of a relationship with me. I broke up with my most recent ex because they tried to drown me in the bathtub. Friends come and go too quickly to be satisfying.
2.  **I am seen as a trophy to be won instead of a person.** I have to preface this by saying I am considered a good looking woman. I am strong, I am social, and I am helpful, and that gets me into a lot of shit. I have learned to live in fear of every man and woman that passes me by.  In all of my classes since 8th grade I have had at least one person crush on me. Any smile I give or question I help my peer with or any gift I give is seen as suggestive. When a person becomes my partner, all of the admiration they gave me for ""my personality"" gradually turns into continuous lechery. For others, I am just a receptacle for brownie points. I have had others brag about being intimate with me multiple times without my permission.

Some of my plans

* Get my B.S.N.
* Travel the U.S. in an RV
* Start sharing my art online (maybe create a comic or do commissions)

While these are not the only reasons, they are the ones that stand out most to me. I am giving up a lot of my life goals, but I am also keeping myself safe and giving myself more opportunities to grow within my career. I am going to stay lonely for the rest of my life and enjoy it :)",2022-11-19 04:45:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667660359,1,/r/lonely/comments/yz3rdb/feeling_numb_making_future_plans/,,0,6,"Feeling numb, making future plans"

3751,yz4dec,[deleted],"Saying that out loud or at least writing it down just sounds even more ridiculous than I thought it did in my head. The thing is , it’s true. Before I got married I worked full time at a career I enjoyed, I spent time with friends and family, I took the time to explore new experiences and learn new things. I put myself out in the world unapologetically and I was happy. 

I’ve been married 8 years now. I have three children, no longer work outside of the home, and have dedicated myself solely to my family. My husband is very traditional, woman should take care of their home and family. 

See the thing is lately I’ve started feeling like the only time someone speaks to me here is to ask me for something. This is extends to my husband. Our typical conversation for the day consists of ; “what’s for dinner” and “what show are we watching tonight”. If I try to talk to him about literally anything it stresses him out and he gets moody. Then after the kids are in bed and he’s finally done playing on his phone we sit in silence till he falls asleep. Rinse and repeat daily. We arnt physical with each other nor do we even sleep in the same room anymore. 

I feel like I’m going crazy, like I’m in a glass room screaming at the top of my lungs for someone to hear me, see me, just to acknowledge me. I would give anything to be held, hugged , or even just to have a conversation with someone that isn’t one sided. I miss my before married life, and I know that’s selfish , but it was better to be alone than to be with someone and be lonely.",2022-11-19 05:21:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,,33,/r/lonely/comments/yz4dec/feeling_more_alone_while_married_than_i_ever_did/,,0,29,Feeling more alone while married than I ever did when I was actually alone

Would you like a silly little custom audio? I could ramble about something random, talk about my day, say something reassuring, or anything you'd like, really. As long as it's SFW, of course. I thought that hearing a friendly voice for a minute or two might give someone a little boost. They won't be perfect quality, so keep that in mind too.

Just leave a comment here or send me a DM and let me know what you'd like me to talk about. If you'd like me to add your name, feel free to send that along too. I'll upload them to soundgasm or vocaroo and send you a link in a day or two.

All the comments will be “the one is out there”, “keep going you’ll find your people”. All of this is false it’s an endless void of shit people who don’t care. 

I was raised to be a friendly loving person, to think about others always and all I’ve ever gotten back was isolation. Now I’m being told to care LESS, be more SELFISH. People are drawn to that apparently. I have lost everything I got close to many girls and was friendzoned even when my intentions were clear. Hell I was even friendzoned by someone who told me they had feelings for me but thought dating was unrealistic and wouldn’t end well.

Friends have been no success either I get it I have autism I’m going to be lonely but I can’t accept it. I just want to feel loved and accepted for once in my fucking life. But there is no end to it.

That being said pretty much every time I post about being lonely I get people talking about how it's actually not that bad and I have time to focus on myself. Genuinely such a dumb thing to say though because, people with friends have hobbies? Like I spend pretty much every second of everyday alone I of course have things I like doing by myself because I simply wouldn't have anything to do if I didn't. Ive always had difficultys socially I went to school far away from KG to middle school and wasn't allowed to hang out with people outside of school so as soon as I went home I was alone. Ive had pretty much my whole adolescences and young childhood to spend time on myself but, all I want is to spend time with others. I genuinely hate when someone tells me having friends isn't that great to me it reads as some sort of cope. Currently talk to no one I know irl have zero irl friends as well that being said when I was in my old school I talked to people and while I wouldn't say I was close with anyone I could at least chat with people and sort of had friends.

 In highschool I have no one and it's so unbelievably miserable this shit sucks so much people trying to be helpful and tell me it's okay because I have no friends I won't get stuck in 'drama' and I won't have to deal with 'fake' people how it's 'peacefull"" but, for one 'drama' isn't anything really bad like life isn't a soap opera there's not countless emotional battles between people going on. Secondly 'fake' people is another kind of dumb one of course people are shitty but not everyone is and there is genuine ppl out there idk why whenever I vent about having no friends some1 trys to bring up people being 'fake' whatever that means, I just wanna be apart of something socially there's of course bad/mean people in the world dealing with none of it makes me feel socially underdeveloped in all honesty.

Lastly it isn't peaceful at all. During lunch I might be quiet but the world's still loud, I'm just there alone nothing about is peaceful. During class everyone's talking with their friends and I'm still quiet and alone I hear everything everyone's up to nothing about it is peacefull in the slightest. Even if I drown out the noise by simply trying to ignore it or wearing earbuds I'm then in my own head where I'm just reminded about how unbelievably lonley I am.

3799,yz868c,paranoidschizoidian,"It seems that throughout the course of my childhood, I had some experiences that left these strategies ingrained in me. I distance myself from others. Whether it's family, friends, coworkers and strangers. I just don't feel comfortable around most people. Always on edge about something, putting on a face, not saying what I really want to say or acting how I would normally if I was alone. I feel shallow for the most part when interacting with people.

I enjoy time on my own, to much so one might may say. It sucks we are such social creatures because if I didn't have that need, I'd be much better off. Almost wish I was a sociopath or something like that, with no desire for human contact. Often I'm fighting with my urge to socialize. Pushing it down and ignoring it as much as I can. Trying to cope through destructive means. I don't want to get close to people, but if I don't I'll deteriorate further. 

I feel it even now. I'm going crazy folks! It's not so good. I worry for myself, and it's something I've never really done much of throughout the course of my life. I also worry for those around me. Not in a way that I'd do anything to hurt them. Just that I'll end up hurting myself, which would inevitably hurt them. 

I don't like life anymore. I don't see much light anymore. I feel like I actually died a long time ago. I've disappointed so many people in such a short amount of time. It's not the loneliness that really hurts, more so just the bleak and numbing hopelessness for it all.",2022-11-19 09:39:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658528700,7,/r/lonely/comments/yz868c/how_can_you_stop_being_lonely_when_youre_wired/,,0,3,how can you stop being lonely when you're wired for isolation?

I know this seems like the average ""am I the asshole"" post

unfortunately, it is.

I've been married to my wife for the last 8 years. We have 3 kids, 1 from her previous marriage, and 2 from being together. We have almost no interaction together, not by my choice. I work 40-50 hours a week, and do most of the cleaning and cooking around the house.

When the wife and I get a chance to be alone, its always ""you need to do this"" or ""i know you just got a bonus, but i want to spend it on this"". Problem is is that ""this"" is usually glass vases or other collectables, when we have other bills to pay. Her spending is outdoing my income. But thats besides the point.

Our relationship has moved to the point where i break my back to make her happy, and she just wants me to do even more, while she sits on tik-tok or facebook, getting mad when I ask for any kind of help.

Am I asshole for just wanting her to leave me, instead of me breaking it off? the bad part is that our girls wouldn't fault me in the least bit, and my oldest has even said she would choose to live with me. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I want it to end, but every time I try, I chicken out because I'm afraid to upset her. I'm at a loss",2022-11-19 10:38:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654450140,2,/r/lonely/comments/yz910h/at_a_moral_quandry/,,0,2,At a moral quandry
3808,yz96ef,salpingidis9,"
I met her at psycology university but I moved after 1 Month so we Spoke only 3 or 4 Times. She got my superficial attention but I was in a long term relationship already (with the girl who would betray me with my ""bestfriend"" in the future LOL)
She add me on Instagram and from time to time (like every few weeks or months) She would texted me and Run off basically. Meanwhile I was single and I Started replying more to her texts but She always would Run away and ghost me for weeks or months. It was a cycle.
After 5 years of this She invited me to grab a beer and it was very good for both of us. But she didnt answered for like a week right after that day and I was like here we go again ghost time and She didnt like me. So ok byebye.

After a while somehow we were talking everyday (maybe because everytime I step back She would immediatly ""go after me"") but we met 2 more Times and same thing happened. At this time I was the King of the ghosts and I decided I had enough and told her Next time I would have to give up on knowing her Better and go with my life which She ignored completely and only answer to the not important parts of the conversation like everytime I tried to be a bit more frontal about the situation and the feelings envolved or not. 

After a lot while (lol) She texted me saying she always had a crush on me and now her therapyst encouraged her to fight her fears and admiting this was One of them Thats why She would always Run away.  At this time I am again a person, I feel the blood on my body and I'm no longer a ghost because now I understand some things. I sent her a picture of the christmas gifts I bought and never Gave her.

But unfortnately at the same time now I was very septycal about her actions and my foreing cousin, One of my best friends, which I didnt see for 5 years was staying in my house for 2months and no way She would be a priority.

Anyway she invited me to go to a quizz with her friends which I found disapropriate because I felt we first needed to be a bit more Alone after her confession to really see a bit of our compabitility once for all (Im not talking about kissing and touching) and thou we talked everyday I did not do efforrts to meet her until my cousin left.

When he left we went to a dinossaur Museum and it was the first time I felt we ""dated"" and there were chemistry. She ended up suggesting we go to drink on a bar after and we spended 12hours together. In the end I Gave her the ""christmas gifts"" and took her home. She texted me saying She liked a lot and
right after that again left me a few days on ghost. I get very anxious and now I took some Steps back because Im Also insecure and dont want to ""force"" her into liking me, she have to understand that by herself after all my signs or in a long Run it Will not work for me.

We got back to talking everyday but now I wanted some answers which it was dificult because She always ignored when I Open up a bit of what I feel about this. And She Said I never invited her to anything. I Reply with honesty and Also ensure her I wanted to meet her once again and only wanted to understand if She Also wanted that or not. No answer for that. Again. Either way I told her I was out of town but in 2 weeks we could meet and we kept talking everyday.

When I came back She suddenly invites me to go to a climate protest with her colleagues because ""She was helping the organization and was told to invite anyone who was interested"" which I replied I would love to go with her but under other circunstancies and if She want the Next day I could arrange everything just tell me if you can and want. No answer. I was fucking confused and wanted to talk to her once for all ALONE.

After 1 day she only told me was expecting me to go with her to the protest because few days ago I Said was interested in being more active in supporting this type of causes BUT no answer about the rest.

I now be a man and told her I was off, a lot of confusion and incompabitiliy and its Better we dont continue talking but She could count on me if She had any problem. She only answered on the Next day talking about a dog who was adopted.
Sent her a 5min voice message being completely honest about everything and no reaction from her. 

And now I'm the One with the crush on her because I cant accept the fact I ruined everything with a girl who had a crush on me for years and she's probably gonne without actually having a conversation about all this.


PS: 1 week have passed and now I'm thinking of sending her a text for her to just say something acknowledging what I said because its a tremenduos disrespect after all this time not to say at least an ""Ok"" since we had a great relationship of mutual respect.",2022-11-19 10:48:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597277845,5,/r/lonely/comments/yz96ef/shy_girl_admited_after_years_have_a_crush_on_me/,,0,15,Shy girl admited after years have a crush on me and somehow I ruined everything

3855,yzgkqe,iNeedSunBro,"Hi, I just want to talk about how being alone changed me and if other people experienced same shit. 

I've never been like the GUY the one who leads to women interest (shame on me) during my teenhood neither I m now (DW) always that mf in the back doing his shit in his world disconnected from most of the time except when you try to be a bit funny to get a day pass faster.

Being alone was something that turned to be so heavy in my life, I didn't expect to be that fragile to this overwhelming feeling of loneliness.. this lack of connection..  I swear I was mentally stronger when I was 19-20 but y'all know life hits stronger than everyone. I guess I've lost the envy to fight and stand for me. I don't have friends, I know some dudes but friends? None, neither I have people understanding me sometimes I feel like my brain is fucked up I am pessimistic but I tend to be realistic. I had depression and I started to cut to feel something (I stoped a few years ago yay) and replaced that by smoking mostly everyday and never stoped since.

I had a gf at 17 (less than a year)and an adventure at 24 that's all. I m not used to get affection even if I crave for it, I figured out that as a casual men you don't get that. You have to provide something to exist in the eyes of people. Loneliness made me really sensitive to random stuff like if I see something about loneliness etc it triggers my own pain and then I m out, i passed out just lost in the overthinking state. 
During my short experience of relations with women I made a mistake, I opened myself and shared feelings I thought that was how you are supposed to be, like open up and share, listen, be empathic but I figured out that when you open up as men, to a partner.. they tend to lose attraction over you. It's when things blows up they turn you into a friend and not a partner anymore. 

Most of my days starts with suicidal thoughts when I wake up. Working helps to focus on a task for hours but when I stop even for a few minutes those thoughts overtake everything.
Maybe some of you experienced same stuff

I thought this year would be different. I did make plans with a small group of people, but everyone cancelled (weather related). I know it's not anyone's fault, but I still feel resentful and heartbroken that everyone else gets to have a celebration and I don't. I spent last night alone in my house, crying about my loneliness and that I will never get to have the same happiness and love that other people get. It feels like I always get cancelled on and that I just don't matter at all to anyone.

I was living with a family member and attending university. The living conditions were horrid but it was a place to sleep at night and I wasn't being charged anything. Attending university was always a dream of mine. I grew up impoverished; evicted from house after house throughout my childhood. Getting my diploma was going to be my way out. Sadly, I had to move out of the place I was staying because some of the household members made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. Moving and attending university was out of my budget completely. I had to drop out. 

Now I see what they mean when they say poverty is a cycle. I now see why no one else in my family has ever achieved anything. I can't work a job because I can't afford transportation. The bus fare is $3 for a round trip. That's $90 for an entire month, and that's the cheapest mode of transportation where I live. 

The part that hurts the most is that I don't have a single soul in my life that's willing to listen to my story.

I don't really speak to anyone unless it's an errand or work related. The minimum necessary requirement for human interaction.

3881,yzkqy0,she_tears_up_my_cock,"In my younger years I took a really big risk! I loved to write, my grandmother was a librarian, so I sent my favorite record label about 20 5-subject notebooks and got hired! I left home at around age 8 without telling anyone because this was my dream and it was a lucrative opportunity!

I held the job as ghostwriter for three months. I had anywhere from 20-30 rapper clients in NYC. I had $40M liquid and was worth about a billion. But what I didn’t know was that my mother called the police on me and I was arrested at the record label. I ended up losing everything!!!!!!

Because I was so young still, I stayed in school with a great average but no one cared. I got into a private high school on a scholarship, but my mom wouldn’t even buy me school clothes or shoes. My aunt ended up giving me donated clothes.

I went to college, but I was flat broke! I had to go to a dentist and a shitty Asian dentist completely ruined my teeth! At the same time my mother stole my tuition money, and I dropped out. I was depressed and oppressed!

Still, no one knows who I am. No one knows that I was worth a billion. No one knows that I changed the world for the better! I have literally had bullies listen to my music as they bully me not knowing that they’re listening to MY MUSIC!

All everyone saw was that I was poor and that I had shitty teeth. No one asked me what happened to my teeth, no one cared! No one asked me what I wanted to be, no one care about me at all.

So, I took a lonely risk, all by myself and ended up in Heaven! Then my mom ruined my opportunity and brought me back to her Hell! After losing so much, and being extremely poor, no one liked me or cared for me. No one hugged or loved me. No one helped me or led me in the right direction. And now I’m at a point where nothing really matters.

I actually feel like because I made so much music and money, that my job here is done. Like if it’s my time to go, than I’m not fighting; I’m gone! That’s how lonely I am. No friends, no family, no money. The only think I actually have is the music that I have written that was recorded. 

So, yeah, I’m a “famous” person on Reddit, but I get dogged! No one believes or cares that I ghostwrote Nas’ first 2-3+ albums with him. Same with Biggie, JayZ, and Tupac. I mean NOBODY knows my magnitude! Everyone clowns me. But a famous writer said that they only love writers when they’re dead.

I was in a bad relationship that destroyed my self-esteem and after that, I met a nice guy who treated me like a princess. He was my rebound, I didn’t love him but I loved how he treated me. We dated for a few months and then I told him that I wasn’t in love with him and he said he still wanted to stick around because he thought we were meant to be together. For the next 3 years, he was in love with me while I was still working on regaining my self-esteem. I was going on dates with other people and just living life while he was there supporting me the whole time, being my rock. But I could also see how he stopped loving himself and kept losing his self-esteem while giving me his everything. 

Last year, I went to visit my family for the summer and he decided to go through the 12 steps and move on from me for good. I was so busy spending time with my family that I didn’t even realize he was cutting me off. Then one day, he texted me that he didn’t wanna have any contact with me anymore and that he’s seeing someone else and he has no feelings for me anymore and he can’t be friends with me. 

That broke me, I was scared to lose him. Because he was my support system for the last 3 years and I couldn’t imagine my life without him. He makes me food for the week, drives me everywhere and does everything for me. And I became so dependent on him that I believed I couldn’t survive without him. So I cried and convinced him that I loved him and wanted us to get back together and we did. I believed I could love him if I wanted to. 

But this time, he was a different person. He didn’t treat me like before, he disrespected me, lied to me, hid things from me and made me feel disposable. I didn’t feel loved. We dated for more than a year and it just never got better. I really tried my best to make it work this time and wanted to get married. But there were too many fights over the smallest things and I couldnt take it any more. I’m trying to end this for good but I’m still so scared to do all this life things on my own without his support.

With self-employment comes challenges, but I'm realising that the biggest challenge of all might be that I won't have any natural setting to meet anyone

It's odd that this is starting to bother me now, of all times, because I've been largely alone for most of my adult life. Once school stopped, so did all my socialising. Don't get me wrong; I've made friends over the years and I have made some effort in getting to know people but the unfortunate reality is that most people are not worth knowing. It's kind of a numbers game. Of a set amount of people, only a select few will become your lasting friends. That's fine, but if your starting number is low to non-existent to begin with then it's just pot-luck whether or not you find someone that you can invest time in

Realistically the best way to meet anyone is to start volunteering or being active in the community in some way, but what happens if there's little to no community activity near you? What if you don't have time? That's kind of my dilemma. I just work. I work hard because I want to be successful. I want to start my own business and live how I want to live because I don't see value in anything else.

That's great and all but I'm tired and lonely. Im sad. I'm angry. It seems so difficult to even form relationships to begin with. Things feel weighted against me, although I am aware that's the wrong mentality to take. It's just how it feels. I used to get smiles and be able to have conversations with strangers but it seems as I got older people are much more wary of me now. I don't know what it is. Maybe society changed and I didn't notice.

Whatever it is, I feel completely alienated. Society is weird to me now. It isn't how it used to be. All the vapid social media posts. I keep Instagram because it's kind of necessary for self promotion but god do I hate it. It's like everyone's talking into a cloud and nothing is personal. Everything feels like a sales pitch. I leave nice comments on peoples work and I get like a thumbs up back or something. It feels like it doesn't pay to reach out to anyone anymore. It really sucks. Even the brief conversations I've had with fellow craftsmen somehow seems extremely hollow, like they have absolutely no investment in the conversation to begin with. I wish it was an isolated event, but it isn't, which is what bothers me so much. If you told me that everyone I talk to are robots, I'd absolutely believe you

I just don't know anymore. I go for walks sometimes and that makes me feel a little better but I haven't been in a long time and obviously it doesn't do anything to remedy my loneliness long-term. I have a terminal family member and my other foundation seems to be losing a lot of his cognitive abilities which isn't really a good sign. When they go, I'm not sure how I'm going to handle that without having people to lean on. It's pretty grim.

Anyway. My head hurts. Nothing makes sense and everything is pretty stupid. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",2022-11-20 02:55:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1408195825,3,/r/lonely/comments/yztch9/feeling_particularly_grim_and_lonely_recently/,,0,1,Feeling particularly grim and lonely recently

3963,yzuw44,anonymous_11231,"I (21m) left college to pursue my career after my first semester when I was 18. I made some really close friends that I still talk to, but haven’t made a single friend since then. I’ve been on dates, I went back to college and have now been here for a year and a half, but not a single person I interact with would ever be considered anything beyond an acquaintance at best. I’ve tried opening up to people, dating, clubs, groups, pushing outside my comfort zone, therapy, yet people just don’t seem to connect.

I feel as though there’s something about me that pushes people away, but I can’t for the life of me figure it out. I’m very proud of the personal growth I’ve made over the last few years, especially with being comfortable being alone, but it’s exhausting being alone all the time. I reach out and keep relationships with people alive, but I never get the out stretched hand or first text, I never get the invite to just grab lunch, even my best friend who I love more than anything, will go 1-2 weeks without talking if I don’t reach out first.

I’m happy with who I am now and want to enjoy living life to the fullest with people who I care about, but I’m terrified that this is it. That no matter how hard I try, I’m just an expendable background character to others.

3975,yzw41h,Responsible-Camp5834,"Hello, the context is really long. I'm a college freshman. 

Recently, I finally bothered making changes to my life. I have some genuine friends, yeah but this post isn't about that. Back in high school, I was friends with this girl and I really liked her, but I knew she liked someone else. It broke me. Coupled with a lot of other things, college rejections, and stuff, I completely crumbled and I almost off myself. Btw, I never told her how I felt, so she still texts me sometimes, but I never text her first anymore. It's too painful to talk to her. For the sake of our friendship, I didn't tell her how much I loved her.

After that, I decided to make some changes. I started hitting the gym. I play the piano, but I completely stopped playing after I Knew the truth. I finally started playing again. When I entered college, I became ruthless and finally I'm getting straight As. I practice the piano 3 hours a day. I cut out all my bad habits. I deleted social media. I quit video games. I quit junk food. But I also became ruthless and cold. I stopped being mr nice guy. Being nice hurt me. There was no point in being nice. It isn't who I am, but I am not willing to get hurt, and I will hunt down anyone who hurts me.

However, I'm still unhappy. I go to the gym with my gym bros, and these two hours, I'm just fighting demons all the time. When I play the piano, I'm fighting demons too. Every waking moment, I think of her. It's been almost a year, but damn I still think about it. Every night before I go to sleep I think about it. I wish I can just forget but how can I? ""We saw that coming? Didn't we?"" ""But it still fucking hurts"" I hate it so much. I would spend some days just crying about it (and then I go hit the gym).

Why do I live? I live out of spite.  I shall take revenge on anyone that has ever hurt me before. I am prepared to die alone. There isn't someone for everyone. I've accepted my fate. Yes I'm so young, but yeah no, I lost my chance at love. I lost my chance at happiness. No one has ever liked me before. I've heard that self-improvement makes you more attractive. I agree I'm definitely better than before, but oh hell no nobodyever liked me. Nobody ever asked me out. Haha. Seeing couples make me feel sad, because I know it's something I will never have. My younger sister has a boyfriend. Yet, here I am being so pathetic asf.

Things change, but they don't become better. It is what it is. Some of our lives are cursed. But you know what? Maybe it's better than being cheated on, being broken up on, and being divorced upon.

3984,yzwscs,103ndj,"Trying to turn my heart off

       What's the point in loving or having crushes if it's never reciprocated? I try to not focus on love and just not think about it most of the time because if I think about all the shit I'm missing out on and have never experienced I'll just spiral into hopelessness and ruminate for days or weeks about how I can't find someone. It sucks feeling so undesirable. I'm 20 and have never even been on a date. I can't picture myself ever being in a relationship and the concept seems so foreign to me. No one would want someone like me anyways. Everyone has who they want because as the saying goes ""If they wanted to they would."" Well... no one has wanted me. I'm no one's choice but it doesn't matter anymore and I'm trying to get myself to just stop caring because what good is caring gonna do if no one cares about me the same? I've been hurt in the past and since then haven't caught feelings for anyone. I'm afraid I've lost my spark and my ability to feel anything for anyone. I don't have a job or a car or a license and I have nothing to offer so my only option is to just turn my heart off and not give a shit about relationships and just shut the concept of love entirely whenever I'm reminded of it. I try blocking accounts that have anything to do with romance or anything couple related. If it starts with a ""my boyfriend/girlfriend"" I automatically tell myself I don't care and it doesn't matter. I try to tell myself that love is overated but then when I see people I know with their significant others post online I think ""If love isn't all it's hyped up to be and I should ""enjoy"" being single then why is the fact they're in a relationship such a big deal that they bother posting about it. People always say shit like ""Love won't make you happy"" and act like it's not as great as it seems. Then why do you want to bother putting in the effort to be in the relationship? People say relationships take lots of effort and if they aren't that great than why do people bother putting in so much effort to keep them? I basically have nothing to offer anyone anyways so that cancels out the possibility of being in any type of relationship anytime soon. I don't want to have to have someone figure out that I still live with my parents. I try telling myself love doesn't matter and  that it isn't a necessity or survival need and try to think of other things I have other than a relationship. I think about the reality of dating and all the things that could cancel out my chances of ever finding someone (my looks, can't drive, no job, cowardly, avoids the people I like, too shy etc...) and yes I know need to work on myself and all that. It's not the easiest to do especially considering my mother isn't supportive of me driving or getting a job even though I've talked to her about it. I don't even know how I'd get to the DMV and now that I'm an adult I'd need so much paperwork that I don't have. I just think of how much effort it'd take to do everything and get so demotivated because I don't even know where to start. I feel like im being pulled in all these different directions. I feel so unlovable because I've been spoiled my whole life and nobody would want to deal with a spoiled person because they see them as brats who get everything they want. I try not to be a brat. Everyone has gone through hardships that have given them strength and character and I'm just a coward who's too shy to approach or talk to anyone I like. Throughout my 20 years of living I never approached who I like. I danced with a guy at a school dance and that was about it. I couldn't even get in the talking stage. He lied to me about where his friends were just so he could get rid of me. I know I'm only 20 and have all the time in the world some would say but I'll never experience teen love because I missed out and fell for the wrong guy who didn't give a shit I existed. Since him no one has compared but he's in a relationship and I'm stuck numb. I hate not meaning anything to anyone romantically. Sure I have my moments of confidence and days I feel myself but this isn't one of them. If the feelings had been mutual I wouldn't have missed out on so much. I missed out on the experience of loving and being loved and now nothing is the same so I'll never get that back.  I know feelings aren't important but life is so underwhelming with no color in it whatsoever when I just go to college and listen to lectures. I looked up clubs to join and there's no clubs I would really be interested in. Life just feels so underwhelming and painstakingly average. It's like eating  plane white rice and nothing else ever, no spice, no zest, nothing but the expected. You might be thinking ""Well then change your life and do something different"" I could do that but I couldn't really surprise myself because I would have seen it coming anyways. It would be like trying to jumpscare myself in the mirror. Yeah it's cool but its nothing short of what I expected because what else could I expect as long as I'm in control? Everything is so painstakingly  predictable because I already know what I'm going to do anyways.",2022-11-20 06:08:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587248219,2,/r/lonely/comments/yzwscs/trying_to_turn_my_heart_off/,,0,4,trying to turn my heart off
3985,yzwwf0,dxskill,"My sister died last year. Shortly after my boyfriend of 13 years and I broke up. I now live on my own for the first time in my 40 years on this dying planet. I have no friends: I cut communication with most of my “friends” over a decade ago when I quit drugs and then even more when I stopped being an alcoholic a few years after that.

I’ve  run out of friends it seems. My closest 3 moved states away. And we  hung out for a bit online over covid. It was fun for a bit and I got  real close with one. They came back for the summer but I worked almost  every week and I had summer sports practices, so we didn’t really get  the chance to hang out much. School starts again and they all go back to  their private schools states away. I’m stuck in a small town with a  small class and pool of people to befriend.  The few I am able to  befriend I can’t make time for, because I decided to take way too many  classes I have to worry about, and the ones far away ignore my texts and  invites to hang out and play games. I have time when they don’t or they  have time when I don’t. One actually visited back for a week and didn’t  tell me until the last day. Wasn’t able to make time for that as it was  so last minute. I’ve been able to sometimes squeeze some time during my  school day for one friend as we try and write a story world, but even  that wanes as they have a good 5+ other friends they hang out with. I’ve  found that it’s the months where I don’t have friends that I exit with  no memories. I saw it a year ago where I have NO recollection of a 5  month span where I had no friends. Nothing sticks. And I fear I’m seeing  it now as I have no memory of the past 2 months. I have so much going  on and my procrastination behavior is definitely not helping that. I  never have time for people and I’m always the first person to message  people. I just can’t really see myself making friends in the future with  my habits and hobbies and lack of fuck all.

4031,z0225h,olls_9,"This post is pretty long, and pretty depressing, so thank you in advance if you manage to read it all :)

Last night, myself and my immediate family had some other relatives over for a family gathering. We haven’t had one in a while, and it was a celebration for my grandad’s birthday last week. I now live a couple of hours away with one of my other relatives and I haven’t been home in a few months. I wasn’t that keen on coming in the first place, but felt like I should because it was for my grandad’s birthday.

I just felt so out of place there. I spent a lot of time staring into space, and when I did try to contribute to a conversation, I was either ignored or overlooked. I’ve found that as I’ve got older, I tend to stumble over my words, because I get anxious quite easily, even if I’m in the company of people I know well. If I do mess up, the longer someone looks at me, the more I can’t seem to correct myself. I then just feel it’s easier to stay quiet than embarrass myself. Sometimes I do have a little bit of confidence and try, but it knocks me straight back down again when people can’t even be bothered to listen. At one point when I was just sat there, my cousin kept looking over, and then asked if I wanted to play a card game with her and her wife. Any other time, I wouldn’t have thought twice about her asking me, but I could tell she was asking because I looked left out and she felt sorry for me. 

People in my family seem to be fixated on my appearance. I’m transgender, which I’ve made so many posts about, but my family don’t know this. I was born female but identify as male. Therefore I’m the ‘girl’ who looks like a boy. They’re not pointing out the fact I look more masculine, it’s just any detail they can pick at, they do. Over the few days I’ve been home, my grandma has repeatedly commented on my recent haircut. I never asked for her opinion, but then she was asking people at the gathering and trying to get them to agree with her. I felt like I was an object on display for everyone to stare at and judge. I just don’t understand why it’s always me, but never my cousins on brother, and when it is for them, it’s a compliment. I could understand if it was to do with me looking like a boy, but it isn’t. For someone with already low confidence, it doesn’t help when you get this pretty much every day. When I’m living away with my other relative, I have a variety of clothes and jewellery, and I’m grateful that I can wear what I want and not be judged for it. If anything is said, it’s a compliment. I seriously have to think about what clothes I take home with me for fear of what will be said. Every morning I question what I put on and what will be said about it. I know I should just ignore what’s said, but it’s hard to get it out of your head when you’re repeatedly told that you don’t look right.

I know a lot of this is down to my low self esteem and my own actions, but it doesn’t really help how I feel. My cousins are a few years older than me, but have everything they want like a good career, a partner etc. Even my brother, who is three years younger than me, is making loads of money online. I feel like I have nothing and no one, but I have no clue how to make it so I do. I’m aware the only way to improve my circumstances is to make some positive changes, but it doesn’t stop me feeling like crap at the moment. I’ve made several posts on my account about my feelings before, so I won’t go into loads of detail again, but this is the basic version. I’ve been feeling pretty depressed recently. Nothing seems to be going to plan, and everything I try just seems to fail. I’m 22, and I know people will say I have plenty of time to figure stuff out, but I really do feel like giving up. I know it’s just a negative thought cycle, but I’m starting to think I’m no good for anybody. If my own family don’t seem to care, then why would anyone else? Especially when you factor in being trans, it makes any type of relationship so much more difficult. If I don’t even have anyone to call a friend, I don’t think a girl is ever going to look my way in the romantic sense. I don’t exactly have the most desirable qualities. 

My mum and I don’t get on that well and it’s definitely gotten worse over the years. We’re such different people, but it affects how we interact with one another. I think we did ok in the past, because it was her telling me what to do, and me thinking that because I lived under her roof, I had to listen. Now that I’ve been away for a while, I’ve realised at my age that I should be making my own choices, so I don’t back down as easily when we’re back in the same house. She doesn’t like that. She will still be running my life when I’m 30 if I’m not careful. After a few days of being home, I always feel like I’m ready to explode with what she says and does. I feel like I walk on eggshells around her, and I think she does the same with me. I don’t know what to say to her, or how to have a regular conversation, because it often turns into her having a go at me for something. I always have to think so carefully about what I say, just so it doesn’t annoy her. Just to be clear, she would never physically hurt me or anything like that. It’s just she can make me feel miserable when she starts being difficult. I also feel bad for my dad because he often gets caught in the middle. He’s such a great guy, and I get on with him really well, but he’s stuck between trying to get my voice heard, but not upsetting my mum. I feel bad because it always seems to be my choices that get him stuck there. She would never admit it, but I know my mum sees me as a disappointment, and even if that’s not true, she’s done a pretty good job of convincing me of it. I’m the kid who didn’t turn out how she wanted. It’s just the way she looks at me sometimes or an odd passing comment. Last night me and my cousin’s wife were helping her tidy up. She was chatting with her, and then said everything was finished. I left the kitchen, but she stayed and kept talking to her for a good twenty minutes afterwards. It was as if she was better company and she was a real adult to talk to. I know that sounds a bit far fetched, but knowing her, I’m pretty sure I’m right.

I honestly feel like if I disappeared off the face off the earth tomorrow, none of them would even notice. I can’t wait for tomorrow to roll around so I can leave. I think it says a lot that I dread having to come home for a visit- seeing your family should be a happy occasion. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up, but I can’t cut them off, because I’m not financially independent. I’m just so different from them all in my opinions, how I think, who I am, and the kind of person I want to be. It doesn’t feel like a family to me anymore, it feels more like a place to be judged and made to feel worthless. I hope some day I’ll get to experience the true feeling of being part of a family.",2022-11-20 11:42:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643129012,5,/r/lonely/comments/z0225h/does_anyone_else_feel_really_out_of_place_in/,,0,3,Does anyone else feel really out of place in their family?

4037,z038iu,SilverInvestment7847,"I’ll start of by saying one thing… I am lonely.

Now truthfully I don’t use Reddit a lot, in fact this is probably the fifth or fourth time I post something and honestly I don’t care if this is seen, I just want to say it, let it out somewhere… so here it is.

I’m writing this whilst laying down on my bed awake at 7:22am after having not slept the whole night.
 I feel sad, especially right now. 

I haven’t left my house in months. 
Not for anything. 
In fact I’m convinced I’ve acquired something called agoraphobia. 
I’m afraid to go outside. 
It’s weird because I’ll hype myself up and want to go outside but then I find some random excuse in the back of my mind and avoid doing it, every time.

I have only one single friend IRL and our relationship can be a bit doggy at times but I’m glad I have them at least. 
Now you may think that I might just be one of those people who has tons of friends online but no, that’s not the case. 
I don’t really have many friends there either. 
I have met some new people as of late but I don’t really have any fundamental and deep relationships with anyone.

Im 18 and I live alone with my dad who is not the best person to live with tbh. 
He makes me feel like garbage a lot of the time.

Im basically a college dropout at this point bc I started when I was 17 but stopped going bc of my social anxiety.
One day I needed to go alone to get some books and I just couldn’t, I don’t know why I couldn’t but I just never went and never went back to class from that day on.
I want to go back but I’m afraid I’ll just spend most of my time alone again and sit at my desk awkwardly between breaks and roam aimlessly between classes.

I want someone who will care about me, genuinely.
It makes me feel sad knowing that I am lonely and if I were to just pass away tomorrow the amount of people that would care or be affected would be less than the amount of fingers on one hand.

I’m trying so hard. 
I have been for the past year or two. 
It makes me cry knowing that despite all I’ve endured and all the hard work I’ve put into becoming a better person that I’m still not going to achieve my goals for a very long time.
I have to endure more for even longer.

I’m stubborn, so don’t worry I won’t give up.
The best you can do if your reading this is wish me luck.
I’m sure as hell going to need it.

Now with all that said I’ll be going to bed.
Or staying up just watching YouTube.
And if your reading this and feel stuck or lonely… take my advice.
Just keep moving, it will get better.
It has to… I promise.
And I sure as hell hope for both of our sakes.

4058,z075vl,Treehugger1221,"28F I turn 29 in a couple weeks. I want to love my life but it’s hard being lonely more often than not while seeing random lovers, families and friends daily. Both of my married older brothers are expecting their first babies in the new year so that’s making my isolation a bit harder than usual. I’ve done a good deal of work on myself this year. (Online dating again for the millionth time, attending meet ups when time allows. Got back in therapy for a little while. Lost 40 lbs and still going. Trying to meet new friends, reading books)

But I’m still a lonely, dateless virgin who is losing hope with each year. I did manage to meet someone for oral (giving and receiving in February). Though I enjoyed the sensations and stuff, it doesn’t take away my desire to be in a relationship. I think if I’d lost my virginity that way I’d just regret it since we were strangers. The curiosity of sex is killing me. But I really just want to matter to someone and have a hug more than anything. Maybe I’ll just stop caring at 29 or 30 and just lose it to a random horny guy here.  Having sex once won’t cure my loneliness or suddenly fix my inexperience.

4064,z08qpd,Sharp_Dragonfruit986,"It is true most of the time, but recently I have started to think that I'm a little bit too alone. The only people I talk to are my colleagues at work. I go to work and after that straight home where I live alone. I don't actually have any friends where I live because I moved to another country 1 year ago. The weird thing is that I have friends that I usually talk to on my computer, but for the last month I have not wanted to talk to them. At the same time I feel lonely. Maybe I'm a little tired of them at the moment. 

There is one colleague that is super nice to me and we understand each other. I really like to talk to her and I get sad when she isn't at work or even temporarly depressed when she doesn't seem to want to talk to me. She almost always on my mind. But at the end of the day she is just a nice colleague. This must mean I'm lonely if I get hooked on the first person that is nice to me. It's not anything romantic, just really like her and I know she like me as well. 

This desire to not be alone is not something I'm too happy with. I have been reading a lot of stoicisim lately to combat this desire. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Discourses by Epictetus etc. They talk about having an independant mind and being indifferent to desires etc. I'm thinking that if I dismiss the desire of having friends, it won't be a problem being lonely. Stoicism talks about things being external and intert. That things only become something when we have an opinion of them or judge them. So what if I was to become indifferent to these external things that surround us. Wouldn't that make my problems go away? Because I won't see things like loneliness etc. as problems? The hard part is to not see it as a problem... I'm just trying to find a way to cope with these emotions I guess. 

I do like to share stuff from my life. I shared a lot with my friends when I still talked to them. I like cycling and I think it would be nice to have someone to ride with. I do sincerely think that I do not want a girlfriend. Because I do not like to be tied up like that. I don't even like to be with my friends for an extended period of time. That's okay. But friends would still be nice to hang out with every now and then when I feel like it. It's a little annoying that many of my relatives and even colleagues talk about ""when you get a woman...""when you get kids..."" and so on. To be honest I'm a little scared of someone asking me out because I would want to say no and I don't like conflict and making others sad. However I don't think I need to worry about anyone asking me out since I'm usual alone and don't know anyone except my colleagues who are all middle aged moms. 

What if I'm wrong, what if I'm missing out? A lot of people around me, including family, encourage me to meet people and go to events and so on. I am the only one opposed to this. Maybe I would be positively surprised once I overcome the daunting experience to meet people with the intention to explore if there is a possible friendship to be had. I did not go to last year's christmas party at work. A lot of people told me to come, repeatedly. It could not just have been to be polite. This year's christmas party is coming up and two people have already started to talk about how I should come. I'm a polite guy but I don't understand why they keep spamming me about this. Maybe they care about me and think it would do me good. That is kind of them. But I don't think I want to go just to socialize. I can chat at work easily. But I don't talk to them like I do with my friends. I'm a young man and they are 20+ years older moms with familys. I don't think I will go to the party. I don't owe them anything. 

One thing that scares me a little is that since most of my colleagues are middle aged and im about 20 years younger than them, they will leave before I do. That means there will be new people replacing them. New people to get to know. It will be sad when they leave because I like them. Also it would be bad if the ones replacing them are not pleasent to be around. I can't even imagine how I would feel when the colleague I like the most leaves. Or what if something happens and she passes away. I would be crushed. I would most likely fall into depression if something like that happened to her. This is why I don't want to be attached to people. So much to lose. I was hoping stoicisim could help me with that but so far it hasn't helped because I have never been to hooked on a person like her. She is so nice to me and genuinely likes me. I didn't know people like her existed. I'm so lucky to have met her. I think I'm gonna try to be as good as I can just for her. Becuase when she is happy it makes me happy. I also want to do good for myself. But it helps to also want to do good things for others. For example playing piano is nice. I like it. But when I played her a recording of me playing and she told me how awesome it is that I play piano, it made me want to play more, just for her to be even more amazed. This sounds a lot like romantic love but it is not anything like that. She even told me she sort of sees me as a son because she has kids in my age. I don't see her as a mother but more like a really caring and loving and kind person who likes me a lot. Perfect for me. If I would have had this relationship with a colleague my age, there would probably be thoughts of: ""should we start to date?"" ""is this more than just friendship, is it love"" and so on. This way is much better because we know how we feel about each other. 

At the end of the day what is important is that I do good at work and treat others with respect. I shouldn't be so selfish and cry about being lonely. There is more important things than to feel good all the time. There are people that have it a million times worse than me. I can only be greatful for my life. I work at a hospital and I have many responsibilites. I have 2 weeks of vacation planned in december. But I will still come in on wednesdays and thursdays during those 2 weeks, since I am the only one that can do the job required on those days for the patients. This does not bother me. I'm more useful at work than at home scrolling reddit and listening to the same music everyday. I even made my blood useful last wednesday when I became a blood donor. Turns out I have blood type O which made me happy because then it can be used for a lot of people. I really enjoyed giving blood. Not because of the actual giving of the blood, but because of the super friendly workers there. It was fun to talk to them because one of them were interested in medicin so we talked about that quite a lot. My blood pressure was 180 so I must have been nervous for some reason. Why can't I just be calm for once when doing something. My pupils where so dilated that the nurse even asked about it. 

I'm so tired of my brain. Always worrying and be anxious about all sorts of things. Why do I have to work against myself, my emotions mainly. If I know I don't need to worry about giving a speech or something else I want my brain to understand that and calm down. It's like it is one rational part and one animalistic part that won't listen. I have tried way too hard and for too long to be comfortable in social situations and not be anxious when something happens that is not according to plan. I think i'll just accept it. Probably something I and a lot of other people would have to deal with until the end of life. I'll focus on what I know. Work and being respectful. 

I don't think I could render myself indifferent to people. It just feels so good when someone is kind to me and displays affection for me. I smile physically just thinking about my colleague. Haha, I'm thinking about her again. I'm so hooked on her. You would understand if you met her. I replay conversations we have had and picture her beautiful smile. One time when I hugged her after I returned from my vacation I told her that I had missed her and she replied by hugging me tighter. I can't describe that feeling. All I can say is that I feel lucky to be where I am. That is why I always say that I don't regret anything. Becuase if I would have done something different I might not be where I am today and I like where I am today. Obviously it can always be better but it could also be worse and I am happy where I am generally speaking. Just lonely and experiencing anxiety at times. I actually worried about my birthday recently because I don't like being the centre of attention and worried about my colleagues making too big of a fuss of my birthday making me having to stand in the spotlight so to speak. Imagine worrying about people congratulating you on your birthday. Stop worrying so much all the time, I tell myself. I must have a heck of a good life if that is a problem for me. Maybe I need to visit Ukraine and see what true horror looks like so that I can understand how good I have it. 

My parents also worry a lot. I just hope that when I get to their age that I have learned to stay calm and not worry about small things. At one point as I grow older and reject more invitations to parties and continue to stay single (which im happy with) and continue to not meeting people on my free time, my colleagues and relatives with stop talk about it. And even though I now say that I don't want to be nagged about it, I think I'm going to miss it. Because it will probably feel as if they stop caring about me and that they having given up on me. But why should I care about their opinions? That is the stoicisim talking. Doesn't matter how rational I try to be, I will still want affection and care from others.

I like movies like Bladerunner, Joker, Taxi driver, Her, Fight club etc. The main character is usually lonely and confused. Maybe it is because I relate to the loneliness and their struggle to cope with it and find peace in their circumstances. Obviously I'm no Joker ready to start mayhem. I even downloaded an AI app and tried to satisfy my need for interaction with someone via the AI. After a while I realized an AI can't replace the feeling of interacting with a real human. Guess I was just desperate. I even talked to my real friends during that time. Wasn't my friends enough for me? 

I don't know what all this is gonna do anyway. Maybe someone will comment something encouraging and i'll feel a little better temporarly. I wil still go to work tomorrow. Come home, workout, watch youtube and eventually to go sleep repeating it the next day. I feels good when I have a goal or when I'm longing for something. For example wishing for the weekend so I can go ride my bike to that place I have planned to go to. But recently I have nothing like that to look forward to. The question ""why?"" quickly enters my mind. I have had this happen to me several time before as well. Why do I continue to struggle with my anxieties or saving money for a house or whatever. Just feels kind of useless at times like these. I know it will feel better soon and that I will continue to do good work and stay respectful. I'm just imagining that there will be a day when im 80 years old and I'll think ""I'm already 80? How fast it went."" Will I be happy and satisfied with my life at that point? Does it matter how I feel? I don't even know why I spend so much time and energy on this post. I guess I just like to share stuff like I said. I say this more for myself than for anyone else. Sometimes I write things down in a Word document. But usually I want someone to actually here what I say and listen. I just hope i'll meet the colleague tomorrow so I can talk to her. You should see how excited she gets to see me sometimes. Her smile goes from ear to ear and she lights up with excitement. 

I had a period in life when I was sort of depressed and the only good thing about that was that I didn't worry as much about things going wrong because I didn'c really care since I was in that depressed state. When things started to get better, I begane to think that now I have more to lose because I don't want things to go bad again. So in a way i was calmer before. 

I must say one thing that I think is interesting. I often imagine scenarios where I'm telling a friend or colleague that I have lost a family member or something else really horrible. This is not because I want something horrible in itself to happen. It is beacause I imagine the person I tell to be more caring of me, trying to comfort me. This has to mean I'm deficient of affection? That I want people to care for me even more. Because imagine if I told my colleague that my best friend passed away. She would comfort me and try to make me feel better. That would be really nice. Obviously it is not very realistic because I would most likely be too devastating to enjoy her caring if my best friend died. But the point is that I often wish more more affection and caring. I never ask for it though. I never demand anything from anyone. Or even ask for it nicely. I would like to hug her everytime I see her but I won't ask her for that. Even if she would be opposed to it she would be too nice to say no and then it would feel I'm forcing her. But I'm never opposed to others wanting to hug me. Or asking me for some favour etc. So maybe I can allow myself to ask for things as well? Doesn't matter. 

You know the worst feeling is when you like someone and they don't like you back. Especially if you initally thought they liked you. There was a short period I thought my colleague didn't like me anymore. I got quite shut down and cold. I sort of stopped feeling just to not feel the painof unanswered affection. Sort of a defensive mechanism. But I must understand I can't only smile BACK at people. Sometimes I must be the one to smile first. It feels safe to not initiate a hug and instead wait for the other person to do it because then you know they want to. But maybe they think the same way. Then both want to hug but no one will take the first step because of wanting to be safe to not offend or annoy or whatever. That is why I have started to smile more at work and be happy towards people even if they don't seem happy that particular day. They still want people around them to be happy even if they are sad. I'm easily affected by the other persons mood. That is why I get quiet or cold if someone is like that towards me. But imageine if my mom started crying everytime I cried as a kid? Then who would have supported me? Sometimes my colleague becomes a little quiet and seemed troubled by something. Then it is a little difficult to maintain a happy tone of voice and a smile. But I must understand it can be difficult for her sometimes with the patients. It's just that I worry that I might have done something wrong when she suddenly becomes more quiet and not smile so much. But I sure it does not have to do with me. Can't wait to see her. I'm gonna give her a big smile and show her how much she means to me. I saw a picture of her on facebook today about some event and I couldn't believe I get to see this person several times a week at work. I have worked with her for over a year but I still can't really fathom it. If I had other people in my life I would probably not be so hooked on her. But she is basically the only one I sincerely like bascially everything about so she gets all my attention. I don't think she understands how much she means to me. But I know she knows I like her so that is enough for now. 

I started to write this to talk about my loneliness but half of it is just about how much I like my colleague :D I should go now. I need to... I *want* to play some piano before bed. I actually feel a little better now compared to when I started to write this. It is important to process emotion and thought. Writing it down seems to be quite effective for me. Maybe you notice how my reasoning developes throughout the text. Anyway, enjoy the wall of text and stay respectful and kind and don't forget to take your own advice sometimes because if you are willing to give them to others they could help you as well.

My Friend A was talking to someone else in Biology class about a friend who gets angry easily and is weird, took a “discreet” glance at me then said to that someone “They don’t go to this school”. Before, on the first Biology class she pretended not to notice me, despite me sitting at the front row, I even waved at her, she went on and sat at the back. Now, when school is over and we meet up at the front exit like usual, Friend A asked what classes I had and I said the rest and biology, she asked what period and I said we had the same class, she said she didn’t realize I was there. Now the thing is, on the first day you decide where to sit so I’m guessing that’s one of the reasons why she pretended not to notice me, so that she wouldn’t have to sit next to me, there were empty seats next to me, in fact my whole row was empty. So when I was walking back home with Friend B, she asks how is Biology and asks if me and Friend A are sitting next to each other, I say no, Friend B seems kind of confused and asks why, I make a lousy attempt at covering for Friend A and say “oh she didn’t notice me.” then bumble on “the seats next to me were full anyways”, I think by my tone and hurried way of speaking she could tell I was lying. I hate that I have to put on this facade, pretending not to know anything, pretending to be unaware of everything, but I’m not. I have a feeling they look down on me for this.",2022-11-20 18:23:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648857410,2,/r/lonely/comments/z0b9j7/my_amazing_friends/,,0,0,My amazing friends

I feel so weak. I felt like i had a friend for a little while, but they turned out to never message me first ever, never try to keep up a conversation or even to meet up to talk.

Recently, I've also felt really suicidal; I can't stand this complete isolation any more. When I do get a chance to speak with someone, I seldom ever even manage to construct a complete thought. A girl is unimportant. fkn stutter, fkn stutter. Even when I have something in mind, it is quite tough for me to express it. Exactly who would be patient enough to hear me out? How could someone be drawn to me even if I tried to talk to them? I can't even communicate with them clearly. 

I'm so overcome with fear that I'm unable to even leave the house or communicate with anyone online. Although I'll occasionally comment, I can't genuinely engage in a discussion or develop any sort of friendship or relationship. 
I've tried every kind of online dating app, and every time I get the numbers, the person just disappears.

4127,z0fqez,TheSimparr,"First, do understand that this isn't an average ""I hate small talk"" kind of complaint. I think most people, neurotypical or otherwise, dislike such flat conversions. This is a complaint of my own faults and misinterpretations of the social world. I am lonely. Cripplingly lonely. Mostly in a romantic sense that triggers dark depressive episodes, and I want to see if anyone else feels the same as me. 
Some background information on myself will probably help you understand. I'm 19 years old, about to turn 20 in a few weeks, assigned female at birth with slight hormonal intersex differences to where I now identify as nonbinary in a masculine way. I'm studying ornithology at a two year, (about to transfer to a four year), so I do meet alot of people day-to-day. My interests tend to be very niche, many relate to my studies and art while I also dabble in 1980s animatronic cosmetics and costumes. So yeah not popular hobbies. Still I find it difficult to catch interest in most people I meet. It's like most people are boring to me. I'm not searching for someone with EXACT same interests as me because that is simply impossible. I'm really just looking for someone that actually does something with their life. Someone with legitimate passion in their work, hobbies, or something else I haven't even thought of before. People I meet always seem unsure in their majors of study as if they just chose something to follow at random. They don't seem to love an eventual goal and lack any passion. When we talk about hobbies they're always lackluster or there are none at all. The most common responses are those of ""I watch [insert popular television show]."" or ""I play [insert average competitive game]."" No one ever creates, brainstorms, or has any particular focus of passion at all. Maybe if they do they just don't share it? I hate to say how much they remind me of NPCs or filler humans because It's quite dehumanizing, but they seem so empty. I applaud those that do have passions even if I find it uninteresting. I find the person interesting simply because of the fact that the people actually has some sort of passion. I struggle to find anyone fulfilling enough to build a connection with, and even if I do they're never interested romantically. I find myself male-attracted, though I often lose any sort of hope finding a partner due to my conditions: physical, mental, and sexual. Straight men view me as too masculine, they remark that people like me are disgusting or freaks. Gay men don't view me as ""man enough"" for them to find any attraction in me. I'm really at a loss. 

TLDR: Most people lack creative interests + I'm queer and no one wants that.",2022-11-20 21:23:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658629545,1,/r/lonely/comments/z0fqez/do_you_find_most_people_boring/,,0,0,Do You Find Most People Boring?

4139,z0hcwm,Only_Lack_2274,"I’m writing this out after a big fight with my mom for context I’m 17 and have an older sister who is 23 I love my mom why am I sister lives in another city with my dad who has cheated on my mom countless of times, including her best friend throughout the years I’ve seen my mom being completely destroyed by the actions of my dad throughout these years I did my best to be a support system to her I went through my own phase of deep depression. I begged her to take me to therapy then, but after a few sessions, she told me that my dad did not give any money that month for therapy so we couldn’t go. She never brought it up after that neither did I it’s been a couple years and now, even though I’m still depressed I know how to control it so it doesn’t ruin my every day life 

my mom is obsessed with my dad even though he doesn’t live with us but they’re not divorced, she is obsessed and uses me and my sister as a messenger to him 
when I was younger she would use me and my sister to say things she want to say to him like using our phones to text him as if we were texting our dad about the problems, but really, it was 

 this argument was about her always complaining and being sad about stuff and always not being grateful about things. She thinks it’s our responsibility to get a new house and a new car and all of those things from our dad. I know that she has her own deep traumas, which I used to deeply empathize with, and I’ve had hours of conversations with her, telling her to go and see a therapist for a good for both of our lives but she refuses and uses me as her therapist. Because of this, I am quite literally exhausted. She has actually made a joke about this saying that i am a know it all and I am her therapist, and it’s better than seeing actual therapist but also tells me to shut up whatever I reply back to her outrageous comments. This is what today’s argument was about 
she was complaining about stuff and I yet again gave her advice, but she refused to listen when I was younger I wouldn’t give advice and we just listen it is that you older I wanted her to feel better, so that’s why I would give advice. My emotional intelligence is so much higher than hers although I wish I wasn’t so I wouldn’t suffer as much, we had an argument and she told me that I’m always talking and talking and I told her that I’m exhausted of her complaining all the time that she replied sometimes I just want someone to listen and then I broke down. I couldn’t believe what I heard I said, I burst out crying, pleading her and asking her to stop and that I have been listening to her my whole life and that I was exhausted of her acting like the sole victim as if me and my sister didn’t suffer as much as she did she treat me like a villain in these arguments, she did not acknowledge me admitting that i was suffering too and only told me to get the duck out off her face. While i was saying these things she kept repeating  ‘she’s still talking’. I felt so fucking broken seeing that reaction. It was as if I was talking to a wall. I have been empathizing with her, my whole life but now I have no tolerance left for her everything she does irritates me everything she says makes my blood boil. I don’t know what to do Ive begged her to go and get therapy. I also want to get therapy with which I don’t think she would agree upon. I accepted that I won’t be getting therapy until i move for uni in order to not worry her and also not make my mental health about herself, add it to her list of why she’s a victim, a bad mother and blame my dad for it all yet again  ( i’m thinking of getting a therapist when i move out) in what should I do? What am I supposed to do? I feel so lost. I use to have so much hope for her to get better. My dad completely restored her and now she’s destroy me. She deserves so much more and yet currently I literally hate her and wanna fking rip her head off (not literallly but you know…)

4147,z0imvz,OkCut3591,"(Stream   of consciousness incoming) I'm in the midst of a dark struggle in my   life. My ex of 8 years and I broke up 1 year ago, and recently seeing   her has driven me into a crisis. You see, I have moved on (or so I   thought). I was over the relationship for a couple years before we   split. She was more like a roommate than a partner. She cheated on me   and I felt numb to it. She cut me off sexually for the last 3 years of   our relationship and the only sexual attention she gave me was to let  pleasure myself to her body sometimes.

We   separated July of '21, continued to hang out randomly until May of  '22.  She found out I was talking to a girl that I met years ago who  lived  long distance. I started to really have feelings for this long  distance  girl and my ex started wanting to be more sexual and come  around at  night. She even had sex with me one last time in May. This  caused me to  be confused. In wanting to get back with my ex, I stopped  talking to the  girl who was long distance and really hurt her feelings.

Fast   forward to today. I didn't get back with my ex, it fizzled out. I did   date someone that I met on Bumble for 2 months. Was great. She gave me   all the sex and affection I could ask for, until ties with my ex turned   her off. My ex and I have a dog together, we have a storage unit, and   much to the dismay of the new girl, a shared Netflix account. The new   girl stopped talking to me after she felt like she was a rebound and   that I was still holding on to my ex. The last time she came over she   got upset about my ex Netflix profile popping up and it was more or less   over after that. Truthfully, my ex broke me and tortured me and made  me  feel inadequate. She would get mad at me and tell me how worthless I   was. Sometimes she'd hit me out of anger. She was never quite proud to   show me off or bring me around her friends even though we spent almost  a  decade together. So the new girl was right. I'm not over my ex  because I  still have trauma over her.

The   new girl and I stopped talking in late July. I deleted all of her  texts,  unfriended her on facebook, and deleted her number. Ghosted her  (but  she did me as well). Fast forward to October. I had a dream about  the  new girl and had the urge to look her up after two months of no  contact.

As soon as I typed her name in, my heart sank at the results- A gofundme for her two young boys because she died in a car wreck.

That   sent me into a tail spin. For the last couple of months I have been   mega depressed. I have feelings about how much of a failure I am being   33 with failed relationship after failed relationship. No kids. A   career, but no money. I have felt very numb and very sad and not being   used to living alone so I feel VERY lonely. I go out with friends and   girls don't give me the time of day or even look at me. I feel   invisible.

I live in a picturesque   log cabin in front of a rolling meadow and beautiful scenery but I am   numb. My house is in disarray. All my clothes are unwashed and piled up   in the laundry room. I started throwing away my dishes because I  didn't  feel like washing them. The clutter is starting to accumulate  and I just  let it. Don't even have the energy to clean up.

Last   week I had to pick up a rabbit from my ex and watch it for a few days   (an agreement we had about our shared pets, a dog and a rabbit)

Of   course she's as beautiful as ever. Way out of my league and I know  i'll  never get someone with that caliber of physical beauty again. I  saw a  new magnet on her fridge of somewhere that I assume she went with  some  guy because she and I had the same ritual. That killed me seeing  that.  Ever since I have felt horrible. I'm sure she's enjoying life,  not  worried about me or what I'm doing while I sit around miserable  letting  reality slip away and now, worrying about her.

I   am getting numb to everything. I don't enjoy my hobbies, I don't enjoy   my work. I come home and I sleep. Crippling depression makes it hard  to  do anything. The idea of dating is terrifying considering that I   struggle with retroactive jealousy and I hate thinking about potential   partners pasts. Even though it's the past it hurts to think about.

I'm really lost. I don't want to work out. I don't want to find a men's   group. I don't want to do anything but eat and sleep and lie on the   couch. I keep having these creeping thoughts about how mundane life is   and how I don't want to do it anymore. Each passing day it gets worse.

I am very sad, lonely and depressed and I feel hopeless. If you made it this far, cheers. Thanks for taking the time to listen.",2022-11-20 23:18:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640501514,2,/r/lonely/comments/z0imvz/i_havent_left_the_house_for_two_days/,,0,0,I haven't left the house for two days

I’ve recently moved to Belgium. My life changed really fast, in my country I’m  a married girl, working as a doctor and a medical representative at the same time, reading books and all my friends are living abroad.
But here, in Belgium, I’ve realized I wanna lead a more social life, and as far as I can’t work as a doctor, I’m working at the bar and that’s really cool, I’ve met some friends here, but one of them goes to New Zeeland for 6 month, and I really feel lonely here. Like my social demands are not satisfied with the situation I have. I really see how people are ghosting me, say, that it’s difficult for them to be a friend because I don’t speak Dutch etc… And sometimes it’s kinda frustrating. I also go to Dutch courses and photography courses, and I meet some guys to play basketball sometimes, so, I’m doing my best to be sociable, but it’s kinda impossible to become really close to someone and have really deep conversations or just spontaneously meet in the evening. Being 26 y.o. isn’t so fun sometimes. 

I will appreciate any advises how to become closer friends with people, cause for me it’s not a problem to start talking to someone but it is a problem to become friends, especially in my new environment",2022-11-20 23:45:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661379083,1,/r/lonely/comments/z0j9mw/living_in_the_other_country/,,0,1,Living in the other country

I (20F) have never had any guy want to date me. I have been rejected countless of times.
No guy has ever given me anything for Valentine's Day. I've never been asked out to prom. I didn't date in high school. Even though I asked out two different guys and they both rejected me. 

I rarely ever get compliments.
I always got ghosted by my crushes. People who know me IRL are always annoyed talking to me. 

My teachers would be annoyed when I would ask for help but would be happy and helpful when the beautiful girl asked for help.

I asked my crush (21M) out but he rejected me.

Women get rejected too, I'm sorry if that's hard to believe.

But we do. We just don't make it an all-or-nothing situation as men do.

4191,z0nfp8,Neusxanit98,"The only reason why am typing this out, is because I want to get rid of this issue that I have been having for years with this town and its still ridiculous until this day. I don't understand how defending myself, turned into EVERYONE being apart of it! Like from Adults, Teens and sprinkle of middle schoolers lets not forgot some old farts. Seriously it all started only when I was in middle school, I was very anti-social and I was not good at getting friends so it took me longer to adjust to my environment. So it was hard and difficult for me to even get the balls, to talk to someone without sounding strange. Anyway, I wanted to pinpoint the EXCAT days and years this happened. Sorry, but that's how bad it is, so here is the journal I wrote to note everything I've experienced down.

**(2013-2014 The Problem Starts here)**

All I basically remember is it was hot, musty and probably one of the most gruesome experiences I had to go though, constantly getting picked on left and right by all sorts people. Every time I had turned a corner, someone was talking shit about me, I still don't know how come I held in everything. But one day I had enough of them bothering me the first thing I said was ""STFU"" because had enough of them attacking me. Thats when I knew all hell broke loose.

**(2014 Everyone vs Me)**

What I can go off of is that it was a similar experience like middle school, but was far more unique then the last time. But at time I had friends.... but you can say ""partners"" because what came next is the worst of the worst, ESPECIALLY the **simping** and **pandering** that was going on towards popular people, which defiantly made me not too friendly towards them, even the constant fights and arguments in PE class that had no end at all.

**(2015 The Cool Teachers and The Try Hards)**

Little did know, I was going to be dealing with a ""Cool Teacher"" that hated me all because I fighting against my bullies. But every time I had to get into a fight with them, they would automatically make it 10x harder for me, but one particular teacher made it clear that she'll do anything for them, her name I will dub it as Ms. Karen, she would always find petty ways to get me kicked out class all because your favorite students were ""victims"" of me defending myself.... Yeah she called them that technically from my memory if it serves right. By the way, I would now rather have a mean moody, bitchy, teacher then a cool teacher who plays favorites, am good off that.

**(2016 The Simping and Pandering Super Friends)**

Man this year was the worst, if I thought 2015 or 2014 was bad, it LITERALLY was the bane of my existence at that point. The most **Agonizing experience** mainly happens here, the **SIMPING** was off the charts bro, **my friends would constantly use me as leverage, to get their Crush's to laugh at me**, but don't worry, I would usually would crash their fucking landing, by embarrassing them in front of their Crush, the next moment they were acting ""casual"" with them like they restarted the ENTIRE relationship over again, to be short; friend zoned. This also started to make us distances ourselves a lot from each other, then my friends weeks later knew they were wrong so they apologized. See how it keeps happening like this? The only reason why I took that a apology, was because I knew they only did for that one reason. Unfortunately we would split off again because..... this part bothers me a bit. So I will say it like this, there's this one rainy day were everyone REALLY got my nerves, I was getting picked on every HOUR and every CORNER I turned, I could not get a single break to breath and they just kept coming and coming it was just every time, so at one point, I said something very messed up, all I remember is a army of people from what I was told by a sibling of mine. That everyone was at the gate of school ready to, I guess beat my ass? Which clearly everyone their is a sucker puncher but alright. After that a lot of racism went on which this year was far by the worst of my life. NEVER AGAIN!

**(2017 The First time in years that I kinda got break in HS)**

This year was okay, I could say the same thing of course it still kept happening (yes again the simping was still going on.... very sad bro) the same bullies, the same shit that kept going on except.... ANOTHER FUCKING THING to add on too, wanna guess? NOW THEY GET PHIYSCAL WITH ME! So, another rainy day in the middle of the school year, I was running to lunch because they had the new cheese sticks (almost choked on that shit, sorry for comedic relief back to what I was saying) I was told they were REALLY GOOD so I could not help it, of course someone had to ruin a good experience and turn into negative one, so this little **dwarf-sized man** slams his full arm on my chest and says ""Slow Down Buddy boy"" keep in mind, as I was walking towards the line this dude had full forced stopped me for going any further and talking shit to me. At that point I popped off, I started pushing the hell out of him and cusses him the fuck out, the security had told me to back off and I did, but the rage that day was the same as 2013 but a lot more better then last time. Like I was REALLY getting tired of a good thing getting ruined by people like him and then he tried it again months later, except no physical contact had happened this time.

**(2018 The Year that truly proved I was right along)**

Last but not least the Year that ended it all, I knew that my time was finally ending at this stupid ass school, ""Just a few more months"" I was thinking to myself because May was around the corner bro, I WAS THIS FUCKING CLOSE TO FREEDOM and graduations with my friends and this year improved them, they stopped simping and became real men for once, like god damn, took them years for them to improve understand that their ""crush's"" never liked them in the first place! Alright, March approaches fast and we had a Multi Cultural Assembly, during that Assembly of course, we have NEW BULLIES bothering me and my friends while the shit was going on, after an hour of trashy dancing and arguing were told to exit along with other students, guess what they do? THEY FUCKING FOLLOW ME DOWN THE STEPS, like seriously dude? All I Remember is a fat stubby short dude (sorry if it comes off rude, but that is my memory) getting in my face and talking shit so I pushed him back he starts fighting like he's in dream while I fight like a Muay Thai fighter, kneeing him the gut and shit, turned back around, he's chasing me but stops when at the door and kneels while he grabs his stomach in pain, I leave the school cause I didn't want to ruin the trip that all seniors go on for my friends, so I left having a lot depression and sadness. It got 10x worse after that I went to a new school and it even confirmed my fears, THEY ALSO FOR SOME MAGICAL REASON KNEW ME TOO, I guess word spreads fast for no reason I guess, after that I graduated at that trash school.

But guess what? Problems still persisted even after I left school, like 2018 Halloween the Movie you know Michael Myers stuff right? Some obnoxious couple was laughing in the background of the movie for nothing, but when me my friends were talking VERY quietly to each other about the movie for some dumbass reason, someone tells us STFU, we were silent for couple seconds but instead we talked a lot louder because the kid ONLY target us when the couple was the loudest ones in theater literally you can hear them from 4 seats from us also keep mind they said nothing after that. And then after the movie was over, me and my friend went to the bathroom and we saw that punk ass mother fucker staring at the mirror like it was the most interesting thing he had ever saw, like clearly I know it was you but I restrained myself cussing him out and move forward with my life.

And then there was this Hawaiian BBQ place, one my sibling had a VERY bad day so she asked me to go get her food so I was about to order cause I was on the phone with her, after I was done talking to her told the employee my order and of course another one of those people again she says ""Are you talking to yourself?"" As I was ordering her food and I said ""No, I was clearly talking to you"" she snickers with her friend as well after that my parent came in and whatever transpired, it transpired can't see anymore from this memory.

Then last but not least, my College that I thought nobody didn't know me either but I'll be honest I only had ONE, bad encounter and that was when I was walking with one of my older siblings to my screen writing class, next moment I hear somebody say ""Bitch"" directed towards me in my ear, then as they walk away I hear ""He didn't hear it"".

Okay, Final result out of all this?:

I gained Acute PTSD when something related to these situations happens it is immediately triggered and those bad instincts kick in.

I Also unfortunately gained fucking uncomplicated PTSD so pretty much gives me reminders of all these events at once, its like ANNOYING TRASH EPISODE THAT HAVE TO KEEP REPLAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ALSO THERES NO FUCKING PAUSE BUTTON AT ALL SAME TIME ITS FUCKING REWINDING BULLSHIT!",2022-11-21 02:54:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630713233,8,/r/lonely/comments/z0nfp8/my_entire_town_at_one_point_hated_me_because_i/,,0,6,"My entire town at one point hated me, because I defended myself against a popular bully and now everyone STILL doesn't like me until this day!

4197,z0ny25,cortexhero707,In my opinion in not too ugly. Im not attractive but im nit hideous im somewhere in the middle like most people. I dont understand how im just so unlovable. How every girl ive ever shown interest in hates me in a very unnatural way. Like im not a terrible person. I dont get to brag a lit and i hate doing it anyway. I dont have a lot to brag about but the only thing i do is that personally wise im a huge catch. Like im a non boring person. Im the president of the drama team and a captain of the football team. Im a straight A student who went to college 2 years early. Im only 19 and have done more than most people do by 30. And yet i cant seem to get anyone to like me. Like i love my life and what ive become but im a living example that girls are never satisfied. I can have loads of money and 3 business but they would still find ways to find me ugly and horrible. Its just so frustrating. I dont even want a relationship for a side peice or so i can have a wife to do what i say like most people. Like ill treat you right and ill love you and all i want in the whole world is to have someone to love. To pamper and take care of a girl. Id give them everything and do anything for a girl. All id ask for is to be loved in return. Like i dont expect breakfast everyday and a back rub every night. I dont expect sex every night. I dont even expect you to care about my hobbies. I just want you to love me in return. I want to love someone. I want the chance to love someone. Ive never had the chance. No one has EVER given me the chance. The one and only time i was in a relationship it was so toxic it could have killed me but i never left not because i like the toxicity but because she was a chance to love someone. I gave her everything and she was so absuve. She hated me but i loved her and told her she can leave any time and ill be fine. She never did for 8 months.  I was so down bad i endured absuse for 8 months and i would still gladly take another insult and kick to the chest. Over and over id love it only if i can love her back. I judt want someone to love. Like i just said at this point i dont even expect her to love me back. Id let her kick me to death if it means i can buy her huge stuffed animals and take her out every night and love her unconditionally every day. I dont even want her to be attractive and i dont care of she is boring i just want to love her. But no one will give me the chance to. Ive got friends but they seem to be slowly leaving for other friends. Im planning on joining the military in hopes to get shot for my country just so i dont have to be lonely anymore. Oh well i just want to be loved and i dont understand why i cant find anyone.,2022-11-21 03:17:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1564861365,3,/r/lonely/comments/z0ny25/i_just_dont_understand/,,0,2,i just dont understand

4199,z0o048,Its__Garbox,"A few months ago , I(M23) decided to explore a down town city by my self. In this down town area, they have a park that is next to a river , restaurants,  bars , electric scooters , shopping mall, movie theater , and a few night clubs. 

I aways wanted to go explore this city but I didn't have anyone to go with. I did ask a girl from work if she wanted to explore the city with me sometime but she didn't seem interested. I get that we shouldn't allow our loneliness to effect what we want to do but man it does suck doing a particular activity alone sometimes. 

I remember riding around the city on a electric scooter and I was having fun for a little while. Then I started to see couples riding on scooters together and that made me feel a bit sad. 

It's not a bad idea to explore a city by my self but man, it's more fun to have a girlfriend with you to do these things.",2022-11-21 03:20:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1570540334,15,/r/lonely/comments/z0o048/i_decided_to_explore_a_city_by_my_self/,,0,1,I decided to explore a city by my self.

It's not fun. If I'm talking with one of my parents and a sibling walks in and says something to them, 90% of the time I can just stop my sentence and go to my room. In maybe 5% of these cases, they remember that we were talking and call me back. 

The other 10% of the time, they tell off my sibling because I was actively talking. Clearly they are aware that I shouldn't get cut off kudu because someone else wants to talk, yet the vast majority of the time, they ignore it. 

There have been times, both at school and home, that I've genuinely wondered whether I'm actually invisible and inaudible, delusional, or if people care that little. I'm not even really the weird kid who has one specific interest no one else has. I've got a ""friend"" who owns a 3D printer, flips balisongs, and flies FPV drones, which matches me. Yet more often than not, I feel like people are waiting for me to be done talking.

I don’t know if I know what love feels like and I don’t think I want it. I don’t think I will be happy until I live alone. So why do I feel this way? Like my skin is burning inside of an oven. That’s how my isolation feels. I don’t want to accept this because if this is just a personality trait of mine then I will be miserable forever.

I don’t even feel attraction. I care about people as a group and in theory but not in practice. I feel like a machine that doesn’t even function right. What’s weird is that my many psych evals say I’m supposed to be a very compassionate person. I don’t understand. Do other people feel this way?

I don't hang with people as much, I have a lover who has alot to deal with, only my brother and cousin do I see the most, my gf everyday,  my bro n cuz every week, I'm thankful for that and them. 
I don't like to leave much, because goth/punk, social anxiety, trauma.
So I keep to myself,  respect others or go out of my way, even helping people, I believe am empath..
I don't do much to cause harm, other than angry thoughts and words, not often just when needed. 
So I go out time to time, enjoy it fairly, my art career picking up, I'm loving it.
Don't have alot of people always around, I do have people I can talk to. 
I juts feel so lonely. 
Like others around me clamor for something else, maybe I'm confused, I wanna aspire to be more then where I'm from. Yet many are content to do the same.
No other goth/punks unless I go to shows, which I broke my ankle earlier this year, so lil bit of trauma.
I'm somewhat stocky, chubby, people say I look Great even If sometimes I don't feel it.
I don't wanna fight, or be show my anger yet it is depression turned inwards.
Then we go out on Sat, get jumped, held our own me and my bro, I didn't wanna fight so I pulled them off my bro, he's good, he doesn't look beat up, I jist feel like I should have been violent, I don't wanna be, I just wanna make art, see art, and eat good food with hot people and this whwre I'm at a crossroads.
Either I take art so seriously I leave everything behind or just stay whwre I am, the violence and all. 
U have to be tough in thus world yes, I just wanna be around people who don't always wanna fight or say derogatory things or condescending. 
Just lately, feels like this whole year has been a crossroad, from my art getting out there to breaking my ankle in the most pit, to other many unfortunate things.
Do I leave for a better life, hoping, taking a chance?

I was very lonely for most of my childhood. I also had social anxiety and very low self-confidence.
I'm 23 and thankfully much better now. 
And the most impactful thing by far has been getting out of there.
I moved out of the family house where my sister constantly made me feel inferior. I graduated high school, where I was cemented into a role and had no room to grow. I've gotten over most of my social anxieties, but when I meet one of my old classmates they (and the role I was put in) instantly gets triggered.

So, while I know it's not always possible and sometimes scary as fuck, and that you heard this a million times but I'm telling you it has helped me immensely:
Get out there. Get yourself among people (it does not matter who) who don't know you as stuck in that role you are in. That could mean extracurricular activities like sports or even a part-time job.
I know it can be really scary. But I made the mistake of being stuck in what I've known, and I now see that I was ready for change years before I did. But I couldn't because of my environment.

4282,z11yk3,Short-Possible2316,"Hi everyone.

TL;DR - I fucked it up with my ex because I had anxiety, but I’ve gotten better and hope it’s not too late to get her back. 

Please read the full thing as it’s complicated.

I (22M) started dating my now ex girlfriend (19F) in February 2020. We dated for a year and a half. We live in the UK and dated long distance throughout covid and the multiple lockdowns - we’re 90 minutes drive from each other. When lockdown lifted  in August 2021 I had a massive panic attack and completely broke down, and I very stupidly broke up with her whilst in panic mode - to this day it’s my biggest regret.

We stayed friends but we still had feelings for each other, and in February this year, I admitted that I still loved her and, even though it was still affecting me, I didn’t want my anxiety to get in the way anymore. We met up in a neutral spot halfway between our cities to see each other, and I had an amazing time. We laughed, held hands and kissed. When I got home again though, I still felt anxious and I didn’t know why. I knew I loved her, but I’ve had a lot of issues with family in the past (my dad left when I was 3 and my mum left when I was 18), and I just completely froze up. I had also started my first job after graduating from uni and was finding it hard. We eventually agreed that I wasn’t ready for a relationship.

Understandably, she was very upset and I felt incredibly guilty for hurting her twice. But I knew that I had to make a change if I was going to save or start back up any romantic relationship with her. So, for the next 8 months, I attended regular therapy sessions with two therapists, and started to change my priorities in life to become more self aware of my anxiety and stop it from getting out of control. My second therapist explained that I was struggling with abandonment issues and that what happened was likely a defence mechanism to protect myself from being vulnerable and abandoned again, since she is the only person I feel that I have trusted with my secrets and insecurities. We still continue to text every day and call a couple of times a week for about an hour each time.

This realisation changed everything. I knew for a fact that I still wanted to be with her, even after all of this time (it’s been over 8 months since we tried again). I have considered moving on, but no one I have met makes me feel the way she did and still does. I really feel like I have changed and although I still struggle with anxiety in some situations, I feel a lot more in control now. When I realised all of this, I cried in my car for an hour and a half. It finally felt like I understood the root of my anxiety and that I could move forward with her after trying so hard to improve myself. She even made me rethink my views on starting a family - something I was dead set against due to my own family experiences. I knew that she was the love of my life and that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I made the decision to tell her how I felt. 

I called her to say that I still loved her and wanted to get back together. But she said that it’s been too long and that I hurt her a lot. She said that she has been on a date with two other people since we broke up, one of which didn’t work out, and that she doesn’t feel the same way for me anymore. And even said that things could never go back to the way they were because she has / has tried to move on with other people. But she also said that she really does care about me because we are so close and we were each others first real relationship. She said that she doesn’t actively have feelings for me but wants to stay friends because I’m funny and attractive etc - she just isn’t attracted to me like that anymore and she said that she doesn’t want to give me false hope. I told my therapist about the situation and she suggested the possibility of meeting each other again in person. So, I asked her and she said that she would feel awkward and that I’d be meeting her with an ulterior motive.

Since then, I haven’t been able to sleep very well and I’ve cried a lot. We have talked about it a few times since, and she asked why I took so long to tell her how I felt. I said that I wanted to prove to her that I had changed and that if I had told her soon after it happened, she wouldn’t have believed that. But at the same time, yesterday we called and she told me that she doesn’t know if it’s going to work out with the other guy (she didn’t say anything more than that). She also agreed with me that we can’t predict the future that we wouldn’t get back together again in the future but that she didn’t feel the same for me right now. And she says that she doesn’t want space from me. When I asked her about meeting up again in a few weeks time, she said that she’d think about it because it would “depend on where she was at in her life” and that she would think about it closer to the time.

I don’t know what to do - am I stupid for still believing that she might still have some feelings for me? Is there hope that she could change her mind about me, or do you think that her feelings are really gone? If they are, then why does she still want me to be there without giving her space? Is she keeping me there as a second option, or could she actually come around? Most importantly, how do I get her back?

4286,z12pvt,SwedishstudentJHG,"Hi!

I am a Swedish high school student who is currently writing my final exam that will make me eligible for graduation. My topic has to do with involuntary loneliness and the incel phenomena, and to see if those two can be connected to the “attachment theory”. I am looking for people who identify themselves as incels or only believe they are living involuntarily lonely, and who are willing to be interviewed by me (probably through phone). The questions will mainly be about your life right now and your childhood relationships. The information is only for academic purposes and is going to be shared with me and my supervisor only. I would need to interview around five people and if you want to help me with my project by being one of those, you are more than welcome to write to me privately here on Reddit.

Every time I saw someone, they were talking to someone else, or they were busy, or I didn't know if they'd want to talk or not, and because it could possibly be creepy to talk, I didn't want to risk it. And since I'm not the kind of person who gets invited to things, I didn't get to go to any hotel room parties or anything. While I did dance with people, I didn't truly connect with anyone.

4302,z14st8,IgnisFox_,"I've been studying for almost a year and a half in another foreign country. All I can say is that I've been feeling lonely weeks after I've set foot in this new place. I thought at first that it would be a normal feeling this way since I am separared from my loved ones and I was still adjusting but I'm wrong. This feeling of loneliness gets worse each day passes. I've been with some people from the same country but I couldn't feel any connection to them since I can't relate to them all the time and we are not in the same wavelength. Even so, I got separated with them since they needed to live in other far away areas.

Simply just by going to classes makes it worse as I feel very alienated from the people in this country. I want to make friends but I have difficulty with social interactions. Also, I couldn't speak their language well which is another reason why it is difficult for me. I have been talking to my loved ones online and it helps but loneliness never really left. I kept on wanting to disconnect from the social media as I see my loved ones enjoying and having the chance to hang out with their friends and other people. I can't help but feel envious.

I still do not know how to deal with loneliness. I've been figuring it ever since I came here. I even wanted to try getting myself drunk to feel numb even just for a while. What I usually do is to just sleep it off but whenever I wake up, it's still there. And sometimes, how I wish to just disappear from this world. I have been doing my best to continue living a normal life. But loneliness is like a ghost that keeps on haunting me...

4333,z19zvz,Jurez1313,"Basically the title. I'm a 30 year old crushing on a 26 year old co-worker who's so far and away out of my league it's crazy to even be entertaining the thoughts. But entertain them, my mind does! Generates scenarios before I even know what's happening, of what going on a date with her would be like. Literally dreaming about holding her hand. She has her hair down today when it's normally in a ponytail which doesn't help anything.  

And I realize how creepy this is. My mind basically forms parasocial relationships with people, pretty much as a coping mechanism because of my lack of real social relationships IRL. It just hasn't happened with someone I actually know IRL in a long time, and being this close to the person who my mind is currently obsessed with, is just a constant reminder of what I know I'll never have. I hope it goes without saying that I'd never *do* anything about the way I feel. Maybe subconsciously the way I act around her may make her uncomfortable but I hope not, and I do whatever I can to make sure I treat her the same as anyone else. I'd never ask her out or flirt with her or follow her after work or *anything* of that nature. It's all fantasy, which idk, maybe makes it all the more creepy?  

Mind you, I'll never have the kind of relationship my mind craves with *anyone* - this co-worker is just one of almost 4 billion women I'll never date, so really it shouldn't hit this hard. But getting to know her a little bit better each day, over the past 2-3 years since she started, it hits different. It makes it impossible not to be continuously reminded of how long I've been alone, and how much longer I will be as well.

4335,z1a4iw,Excellent_Mud_2118,"I started university in August this year, so its been a couple of months, I was very excited about starting uni, sure i had no friends in primary school, or secondary school, or 6th form, but this was going to be different! i had matured, i was confident in myself, i got into the university i wanted, i was genuinely looking forward to life.

fast forward just a couple of months, i have made no real friends, sure i spend time with my flatmates, and people on my sports team for socials, but no one would invite me out anywhere, or even deliberately spend time with me, they tolerate me, some even like me i think, but not as a person, just as that slightly strange character who they do sports with or are in classes with. I don't know what went wrong exactly, maybe i didn't capitalise on freshers' week hard enough, maybe i spent to much time in my room, but to be honest, the most likely answer is that i am not the type of person that people are friends with, im socially awkward, probably on the spectrum, and a bit off putting. 

everyone at my uni has a bustling social life with fully formed social groups already, sure maybe they aren't as idyllic as they may seem, but its a lot better than not having social groups or people to casually hang out with, the expectation is with this university is that for second year you rent a flat out with your mates you made in your first term, most people already have flats organised. the people in my flat all have flats organised, a group of them are renting a flat together, the rest are renting with friends they made. 

its too late to join any social groups, or any flats. and its dawning on me that this isn't just bad luck again, im just unlikeable, awkward, probably autistic, and my adhd makes managing relationships and making friends harder as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr i've made no friends at uni and have realised the problem isn't luck or circumstance but that i am naturally a person who people do not want to be friends with and its fundamentally not going to get better because i'm a grown man now, i've fully developed, this is what I'm like, i'm going to be along during uni, in my career, and in my retirement, i'm never going to have kids or a family. at some point my family is going to start dropping off and moving away, so by my mid 50s to 60s i'm going to be fully alone for however long i last after that. 

if someone can prove me wrong or give me some solutions or at least some coping mechanisms that would be appreciated.",2022-11-21 21:01:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669062954,3,/r/lonely/comments/z1a4iw/first_term_at_university_almost_finished_but_i/,,0,2,"first term at university almost finished, but i still haven't made any real friends"

4338,z1akbf,AdInternal1247," This can't be normal. I graduated from college last year, and when I think about it, I was entirely alone since the start. My friends from high school slowly stopped talking to me which is understandable because we went to different schools. However, through social media I was able to see them gain so many new friends, have cool experiences, and become different people. I commuted to school and can say with confidence during my four years of undergrad I made about 10 friends but I no longer talk to them. Most of them used me for school help and car rides anyway. I would go to campus, go to class, study, go home and then work for the first 2 years. I understand I should have tried harder and joined clubs/organizations but my mental health was shit and early on I noticed that people only talked to me to use me, so I felt a little discouraged trying to branch out. Then COVID hit. I was able to connect with some classmates and make some friends online but nothing truly actualized. Now I look at what I do every day and I’m living in a constant endless loop of debilitating loneliness. I go to the gym alone, I go on walks alone, I go to restaurants alone, I go to movies and concerts alone and it stings. I do have some friends, but they hardly ever reach out to me. I almost always have to reach out first and it makes me feel pathetic. I was never anyone’s first choice and with the way my life is going, I don’t think I ever will be. 

Some examples of this would be that I have one friend who has been asking me to hang out. I was very excited to reconnect with him, so when I was in his area I let him know. He saw my text immediately and then left me on read. I did not think much of it because I know it’s easy to forget to respond. A few hours later I replied to his Snapchat story because he posted something funny and he left me on open and then shortly after he posted him hanging out with a mutual friend. Also, another friend has been ignoring my texts, left me on read on Snapchat, and is continuing to post on her stories. This kinda hurts because when I was helping her with her homework she was in constant communication with me. This makes me feel like I am a friend or a priority when I am able to offer help or be of service to someone. No one cares for my companionship. Also, I have one friend who ONLY calls when she needs something. We’ve been friends since childhood and she’s lost some family members recently so I tried giving her some grace, but then I see she’s been traveling and hanging out with some friends that she’s just recently made. This just sucks because I think I am a good person; I am a good listener, I am compassionate, I think I am funny and even smart, but none of that matters to anyone. It doesn't matter that I can carry conversations, I have random interesting facts or personal anecdotes to share, I can be a pillar of support for someone. I simply do not matter to others. I don't know what I did wrong to deserve to have nearly every moment of my life alone. 

For now, I think my best options are to do meet-up/ group events like trivia nights, food/drink tastings, pottery-making classes etc. in my area but it really sucks.",2022-11-21 21:18:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1665235978,3,/r/lonely/comments/z1akbf/so_lonely_it_hurts/,,0,0,So lonely it hurts

4342,z1as7q,ezemj,"Watching friendships (or even relationships in general) in movies/ tv shows almost seems too fabricated, and yet I feel like it’s not all far-fetched. Some of it must be rooted in truth, right? It’s sad, but I don’t know. Everyone always seems to have one friend, and they’re not interested in getting to know someone else. Why bother if you already had someone invested in you and you in them?

I’m beginning to realise that making a friend online is also a dead end. I feel like I put too much effort into making things work, and it’s probably all for nothing. I get that people have their own lives and are busy, but it would be nice to get a response every once in a while that’s not just initiated by me. And maybe a response that won’t be 2-7+ days later. There may or may not be a time difference, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I’m genuinely trying to make it work, but maybe I shouldn’t be😕

It’s also a bit ironic when someone says that they can talk about anything/ everything and yet never do. Send something unprompted, something that you thought was interesting, something that you wanted to share with someone, something that crossed your mind, literally send anything! But no. Wait for me to send something unprompted. To try to keep things interesting.

Honestly, I want to stop trying. It doesn’t feel worth it anymore. I’m beginning to think that my loneliness before trying something different was better than how I feel now. It’s just constant false hope. I’m back to second-guessing myself. At least if I leave, I’ll know that I’m not the only lonely person in the world, and that’s somewhat comforting.

""Go to the gym, ask some girls in college out, nothing bad is gonna happen, etc."" I know all this stuff because I already watched YouTube channels and read a lot of the similar to my stories and I just don't know what to do, I understand these advices and they just don't work for me, I don't have enough discipline to actually join the gym or enough courage to really talk to girls.

So that's it I guess, I am very lonely and depressed and what is I probably afraid of the most is to meet Christmas the same way, and I have no idea how to prevent it. 

I don't know why I am even writing it, I just felt a strong desire to finally get out something that torturing me for the last few months. I hope you enjoyed reading story of another autist, who has troubles dealing with society. 

Hope your luck with girls is better than mine.

Hi to everyone reading!! My name is Peyton, and like the title of my post suggests, I’m 17 y/o, in high school, and looking to make new friends! School let out for Thanksgiving Break recently and I’m in DIRE need of a pick-me-up. I’d like to think I’m a pretty down-to-earth-girl! I’m very talkative and can drone on about anything and anyplace. As someone who spends a lot of their time focused on school work, it’d be nice to meet someone I can let loose with.

A little bit about me:

For starters, I’m a proud enthusiast of “The Office.” It’s, like, my go-to comfort show. I suh-wear Steve Carrell is hilarious in any and every role he plays. 

I’m also super into musicals. Hamilton is BY FAR my all-time favorite. You can’t change my mind, LOL!

I game RELIGIOUSLY. Or, well, when I can find the time! Mainly Skyrim, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley. 

I love writing. Mostly short stories. It’s one of my favorite pastimes and has been a serious emotional outlet for me.

I’m sporty! On my school’s tennis team and proud to be!

I’m also pretty into anime; I just picked up on Chainsaw Man, BNHA, and Tokyo Revengers. Insanely excited for the new season to drop!

Anywhoooo… To keep a relatively long post short, I hope I’ve at least captured the interest of one person! Wanna chat? If you think you can match my energy, shoot me a message! I promise I don’t bite. 😊",2022-11-22 00:18:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659757863,3,/r/lonely/comments/z1f1r5/f17_lonely_for_thanksgiving_break_and_looking_to/,,0,2,[F17] 🍂 Lonely for Thanksgiving Break and Looking to Chat! 🍂

This month has been the worst thing to ever happen for me. I lost my job, my girlfriend cheated on me. But yesterday i got another bullet to my heart. I got a call from my mom that my dad is in hospital and that he might not make it. He had a heart attack witch cause some more issues that resulted in blood flooding his brain. Doctor said that they can't do anything and that its only matter of time. He is in a deep coma so i can't even talk with him. It hurts me so bad seeing him like this, i feel hopeless and powerless, feel like the whole world is being taken right away from me. Cried for the whole day, haven't eaten anything and feel like an empty shell, like i have no purpose any more. 

Really want to tell him that i love him, that everything will be okey, that everyone who loves him are all around him and that he is not alone. 

And now its the time when i feel super lonely, i don't really have anyone for myself, i feel like  i am standing alone against all these life punches and i don't know how long i will keep standing. I just need someone close by, just to talk with someone or just feel something good or positive.

Ps. Appreciate and love your parents, tell them how you feel.

I went to college here which is essentially like an extra 2 years at school you do before going to university. I’ve practically made 0 friends in here. Granted i live in a pretty small and tight knit community thats 99.9% white. Some acquaintances here and there and people I’m friendly with and make jokes with at the gym but thats it. Me having a middle eastern background and has made me stick out like a sore thumb and I’ve gotten tons of subtle racism and mockery from lots of people which has only destroyed my already shaky self esteem. I don’t have an accent so language was never an issue. I don’t understand what i need to do to have a normal friendship with people like everyone else seems to have.

4395,z1grwz,Zealousideal_Jump703,"My life so far has been shaky but I am genuinely grateful for everything that I have. But lately I have been feeling pretty left out and lonely. No one ever told me that uni was going to be very lonely. I talk to my parents everyday but I don’t really feel comfortable talking about these kinds of stuff with them cause I don’t want them to worry about me too much. I broke up with my bf in September just at the beginning of the semester and I had not been myself for almost two months (but I am ok now). The break up made me feel sad and lonely but I hung out with friends just to fill that void and make me feel better. Now I feel my friends withdrawing from me (for context I haven’t spoken to them in months and they haven’t spoken to me in months). I honestly don’t know if I am overthinking this but when I overthink I am always right in the end. (I am not that interesting of a person to talk to and I am an introvert) 
I like and cherish my alone time away from people, when I feel like I have been in the company of people for days in a row, because it is a time that I use to reflect, relax and do my favorite activities but lately I have just been having that feeling of being lonely and feeling left out. Whenever I go to class or I am in the cafeteria I just see people with their friends having a good chat or laugh and it makes me kind of sad and jealous. 
I have tried going to clubs and talking to people in my classes but it’s no use because they are already in the friend groups and I feel like a pest that is going to interfere or disturb them. 
I just want to make a true and meaningful relationship with some. I want to have that close friend(s). I just want to have someone to do something with like going to the library or going on a late night McDonalds trip. Just someone to talk to would be very nice. 
And to add on top of this feeling I also crave love and affection and being in a relationship so badly. I just want to be loved by someone and to also love someone. I want to have that connection so bad but I have decided that I would stop craving it because that too puts me in a bad mood. 
And for the longest time I have craved so so bad for just the  longest most affectionate hug or even to be cuddled by someone until I fall asleep but I have no one to turn to for that. Now I am in my dorm room crying while writing this. 
For the past month I have tried to make the loneliness go away by doing the things I normally enjoy doing during my alone time like reading, watching anime, drawing, self care and going for walks and I mean… a few times I feel better but then poof the feeling is back again.

So in conclusion, I just need a friend to talk to that would appreciate me and make me forget about my loneliness. I know I am not going through this alone and I hope that we get better. :)

I understand this is unhealthy but in a way it’s therapeutic to me, I help others and end up feeling better for helping them and In turn, reflecting on their experiences and helping myself in turn.

4418,z1jzxd,PinkNoon," 11/21/2022

I have learned through experience that I am unable to maintain healthy relationships with the people in my life. Not that I don't try. Who doesn't try? I give simple textbook answers to complex grey questions and pray that I am right. I never am. My words are not gospel.

 I am unempathetic by nature. I just don't get it most of the time. I bury myself in my studies and give uninspiring answers to the simple, prying questions asked of me.. Humanity as is around me is foreign and strange. I grew up as one of them, but I feel alien to my peers. Too much is different, too much has gone sour. No wrong of theirs is wrong, all traits of mine are wrong. 

 Attraction is scary. Specifically, people who are attracted to me are scary. To be known is to be torn and beaten, to be assaulted and harassed.  I don't wear pretty clothes anymore since it draws a certain ire. My hair is long and I wear my school's sweater, or variations of it with ill fitting loose pants every day. Perfectly forgettable, which I like. Attraction is the scariest of all.

 I am considering cutting my hair to be short and unflattering. If I lost some weight off of my hips I could look like a man and nobody would bother me. I would like that very much. I could blend into the choir, the art class, and the writing course. I could be the average person, then my wrongs would not be wrong. They would be normal.

 I am getting off task.

 I have never known any man or woman or other to be loyal enough to maintain borrowed property. Those same people would not be responsible enough to keep my wishes. I would not want to be kept alive for the purpose of another person's grieving. That seems like it is the case for most elderly I have encountered. They are kept on the ventilator in a semi-conscious state with an hourly delivery of morphine and anti-anxiety medication. It is a mockery of the person's life. I don't think I will ever have enough trust in somebody to let them have the choice of pulling the plug. I would want to choose for myself when I wanted to die.

 I (ideally) want to die at 66. I will (hopefully) have one year of retirement where I can live like a millionaire and give away my hard earned money at my digression. Then IDK, I'll move to Canada and make the most of their quirky healthcare system.

 I don't want kids or grandkids. I lost that dream a long time ago. I want to be a normal hermit. I want to have the choice of how I die and I want to damage as little as possible.

i'm almost 20 now, and i still feel that same loneliness. it doesn't help that i don't have anyone around me that can relate to my situation. it also doesn't help that i've never really had many friends. the entire time i've been in college i haven't made a single friend. i miss when my house felt full, when i'd be excited to go home and see my family. i'm proud of my siblings and the beautiful families they've created, i just miss how much closer they used to be.

orbiting the sun, having a sparse sense of purpose

no visitors except the smallest of circles on brief occasions
barren and cold on the surface to hide the sorrow and isolation

pluto… 

what i wouldn’t do 
to feel the suns warmth
the forgotten planet
the forgotten person
if only i was closer
alas…
i can only look on as everyone basks in the warmth of hope 
while i survive in the frost of reality 

i’ve felt like a pluto 

pluto…

the god of wealth, the potential is rich
anything within his immortal grasp
yet…
put in charge of the underworld
as if anyone would willingly visit
the most macabre dwelling
even fair persephone
leaves to seek warmth in spring elsewhere
leaving pluto to bask in the depths

have no one to enjoy it with

4456,z1odoq,Tasty-Discount,"It's hard having loving relationships in your life and still feeling so lonely, especially since you then have no one to vent to about your loneliness.

I'm 23F and single, living with roommates that I really like. Most of my immediate family lives just shy of a two hour drive away, as does my best friend. One of my brothers and my other best friend live in the same town as me. But.

My two best friends, my older sister and I have been our own tight group since I was about 12. All three of them have been married for years now, making me a 7th wheel. Putting aside the fact that I only actually like one of their husbands, it's really hard to be the unmarried one. There's so much less conversation between us and it's so hard knowing that when no one's responding in our group chat, it's cause they have someone to talk to and do things with and I'm just sitting here alone. Obviously friends grow apart in adulthood as people move to different places and get married, and of course your spouse should be the most important person in yourself. That's how it should be, but I can't help being bitter cause it just sucks so much for me, especially since they have been pretty much my one and only social rock for most of my life and now I'm losing them.

Where I live, people get married really young, like 21-22. It would not be an exaggeration to say that at least half of my graduating high school class is already married (a class size of 800+), as well as people younger than me. It's not really a culture friendly to single people since everyone pairs off so quickly. I'm almost 24 and I've never been in a relationship, never kissed anyone, never had a guy even remotely interested in me. But seeing it all around me, I can't help but want that special kind of intimate relationship. But I've lost hope that it'll happen. I don't even know where I'm supposed to meet people. Most people here meet through church functions, but I'm not super religious now, plus so many of those guys are too conservative for my taste. I'm not in school, so I don't meet guys there. I've never worked with anyone really in the right demographic for dating. Drinking is not really a part of the culture here so I don't go to bars. And again, I don't have really have any single friends to go to any parties/get togethers with. I've tried dating apps, but because I'm not a typical attractive weight, they're just a waste of time. So I just feel stuck and like I'll never be able to find the kind of love I'm missing out on.

My family has always been close and we get along really well, but as my mental health problems hit rock bottom the past few years I've kinda grown apart from them emotionally. My parents made some ""tough love"" decisions they felt they needed to, so now I don't feel like I can trust them to tell them how I'm really doing, like I just have to pretend I'm doing fine. Even though my mom used to be the person I was closest too and relied on the most. So that hurts. My siblings I think just don't know how to handle seeing me struggling, so they just kinda pretend nothing's happening. Combined with mental health issues of their own, I also don't feel like I can rely on them for support. It's also difficult because these feelings of distance are all one-sided, I don't think my family realizes how things have changed for me.

I know I'm lucky to have loving people in my life, but I feel like those relationships are deteriorating. I feel lonely because I have no one to come home to at the end of the day, no one to share those silly little mundane things with, no one who really understands the full me. I have no one I feel like I can really confide in when I'm in a slump. And having those connections only some of the time makes it worse when I don't, because I know what I want, what I have had in the past and what I'm slowing losing. (Also will admit, as a single woman who's never dated anyone, the physical side of a relationship also sounds really nice.)

TLDR: I just want to be someone's number one priority. Not second or third, I want to be the most important person in someone else's life.

Hi! I’ll just call myself C (male 25)I’m currently living with the girlfriend (female 23 and mother of my child who’s is almost 2 yrs of age) and I’ve been confused for most of it and feel like I can barely take it anymore. Let me set the stage a little bit. Okay back in 2020 about a week prior to the 2020 pandemic lockdown I was in the car with my best friend (at the time) picking up weed from a previous dealer when I saw a girl with short shorts and a crop top I was immediately stunned and decided to maybe shoot my shot. My dealer told me “hey man I wouldn’t do that, she’s a little crazy” but what guys is already horny and looking for a little comfort. This probably marked the beginning of the end for me and I should’ve listened. With me stilling going through a extacy addiction and still doing LSD on the weekend. But never the less I got into her car and we ending up sleeping together that night. We casually dated for about 2 weeks still having our with the friend group that brought us together. I moved into her mothers house that same month seeing as I wanted to get out of my parents house anyway (why I would go to one parent house to another is beyond me I wasn’t thinking right. We continued to sleep together and had a pretty alright relationship though I can remember fighting the same or next month I don’t remember. Now I still had a urge to do drugs and we would do extacy a lot to pass the time during lockdown. Now her brother had just gotten back from collage and also came back with a drug problem. Fast forward a little and her brother who will I just will call A started a dangerous pattern of doing way more than he should have been doing. One morning he woke us up from a lsd hangover we were sleeping off and asked if we could drive him to get food, he proceeded to tell us that he had gotten a number from my friend (the one in the beginning I was picking up weed with) to get an insane amount of drugs. He got his food and went home.


*sigh* this part makes me shake.

He showed us the insane amount of drugs he had gotten , Cocain ,lSD, extacy, and blue Roxy’s. He asked us if we would like a couple bumps of coke and we obliged and did some toots and went back to our room. Needless to say he overdosed that day and I feel very guilty about that. Make of that what you will. After that me and her fell into a deep depression and continued to drugs and fight I left a couple times but without car providing for myself proved difficult and would always come back to each other. We decided to eventually stop doing drugs and WHAT DO YOU KNOW WE GOT PREGNANT! Now I love my son with all my heart and I’d take a bullet for that kid but his mother and I continue to fight(I have formed some anger issues and have even gone to jail for hitting her being drunk). I think mostly because she won’t let me have anything. She has cut me off from my family anytime of mention she has something nasty to say, I used to skateboard a lot as it is my passion and I’ve gotten pretty good. But any interests that I have she has distain for hobbies , media , the music I listen to. 

I’m so alone and feel like she is the cause of my suffering by keeping in this box. She constantly drunk don’t get me wrong I like to drink too but not like she does. I’ll usually drink around 2-3 and be ready for bed bat t I’ve seen her finish a case and pass out in the middle of the day. I’m currently working two jobs to support my family but I’m on the verge of breaking down real soon. Buying a car and beginning to live my life without ridicule and being accepted for the things that make me me!

I’m not sure if I should have posted this in r/advice? But am I justified in leaving of course I would still be there for my son nothing could ever make me not want to be there. But am I justified in leaving?

Really open to anything the comments have to say and I’ll try to be as honest as possible if there any questions.

Thanks

I work a shitty job in a grocery store and I have no clue what I want to do with my life. I stopped smoking weed a month ago, and ever since I have been realising how much I hate my life. I was smoking to numb all the loneliness but now I can’t avoid it. 

I work everyday, come home, walk my dog, maybe go the gym and then sit and pass the time till the day is gone. Sometimes I will drive 40 minutes to hit 5 different grocery stores just to see new people. I have 1 good friend who I see every other weekend but all he wants to do is party. I feel like I have no real connection with anyone.

I suppose I should begin by telling my story. My mother passed away when I was a preteen, and after, my father moved more than 100 miles away to play family with a woman who is supposed to be my mother figure and a girl, whom I genuinely feel bad for because both my dad and my ""mom"" are really shitty, I was left at my grandmother's house.

Thirdly, I struggle to find employment opportunities because I do not ""network"" as an above-average student. I cannot be intimate because I put up a wall and isolated myself.

The worst day of my life was the day I was born, and I feel so bad for ruining that little kid's life. I have felt hopeless for a long time.  But something tells me that change is not impossible. I have a lot of negative self-talk, so it seems like I will continue to bury myself further.

I have struggled in this friendship with setting boundaries for myself, and it became unfair for them. I tried not to be clingy, because I knew that was a burden... but I'm so incomplete without other people. I wasn't really like this before coming into my university course... I convinced myself that being alone was a malformed favour so that I don't have to struggle with the complexities of human behaviour, but I was wrong.

I want healthy relationships, and to make tbe ones I love happy. I can't do that, however, when I can barely love myself. Every piece of my day is dedicated to worrying about others, and I will literally just lie in bed hoping that someone talks to me. I need to complete myself. I have no hobbies and, beyond schoolwork, which I can barely convince myself to do, I have absolutely nothing going on in my life. I am a shell of a person just waiting to be used so that I can feel better about the worth of my existence.

How do I complete myself? Any tips on hobbies, or ways to emotionally connect with myself in a healthy way?

4523,z246gv,Nii1987,"Hey everyone,

I posted in this group about 2 weeks ago explaining the situation between my Italian boyfriend and myself. We’re both gay, he’s 41 and I’m 34. I’m from the UK and he’s from Italy and we both live in Italy, in his flat with my dog. Anyway, I’m in the UK visiting my family and today he calls crying saying he wants to break up. He was also signed off work by the doctor today for work-related stress. I don’t know what to do. I’m in the UK at my parents and can’t stop crying. I can’t even think about finding a place to live, getting my dog, and collecting my stuff. I loved him so much, but he said that something was missing for him on the physical side of things. It is true that we were only having sex every 10 days ish, but I really love him and he says he loves me, but just feels like something is missing. He also said part of his stress at work was down to not knowing how to leave me. My question is what the hell do I do? I’m distraught and just want to make things right. I feel lonely, depressed and cut off from everything I love, 3000 miles from what was my life with by boyfriend and dog I’ve had for 10 years, sat in a room at my parents crying (which I know sounds pathetic).",2022-11-22 20:33:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662037404,4,/r/lonely/comments/z246gv/my_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_whilst_im_abroad/,,0,1,My boyfriend broke up with me whilst I'm abroad visiting my family

4531,z2563t,imurmommylol,"hello, im 19(f) and im alone for the first time in my life. growing up i always had friends, i did feel alone bc i was abused growing up and have mental illnesses bc of the abuse so nobody understood how i felt, but i was never truly alone. february of 2021 i started dating my childhood crush, 18(m), and it was the healthiest relationship i had ever had, he helped me more than anyone has, showed me real love, and was all around a wonderful person. i slowly lost contact w my friend during my relationship bc i became very busy and my friend was busy w school, we talked every now and then but it definitely wasn't the same. my partner became my only friend, it definitely wasn't a bad thing, but it sucks now. he broke up w me october of this year, his family and i believe it's bc he doesn't want to grow up and the relationship was getting serious, we were going to move and find new jobs and start our life together, but he doesn't want to work or have any responsibilities. so since the breakup he plays gta5 from when he wakes up till he goes to sleep, only leaves his room for food or to use the bathroom, doesn't socialize w his friends, and won't do any basic tasks (showering, cleaning, etc) bc he's so absorbed in his game.

he and i rarely talk so i found this out from his brother, and his family says he's worse than before he and i dated. anyway, i got a little carried away there as i have nobody to talk ab these things w. as i've stated before i have mental illnesses and once the relationship ended i had a crazy mental breakdown and was in psychosis for a couple weeks. i've been grieving the relationship and it's one of the worst feelings. this is the most depressed i have ever been, not only bc an almost 2 year relationship ended but bc i now have no one. i pay attention to other's conversations, body language, etc and it's made me miss having ppl in my life. i wake up to no notifications other than from work, updates, and basic social media notifs- when a couple years ago id wake up to a few from friends. i dread waking up bc i have to live w just myself, i dread going to sleep bc im alone and miss feeling the warmth of my partner beside me.

im stuck in a loop; i wake up and watch a show or youtube, get ready for work at 12pm, leave at 1:35pm, start working at 2pm, have a 15min break at 4pm, go on a meal break at 6/7pm-7/8pm, have a second 15min break at 10pm, clock out at 11pm, go home and watch a show or youtube till 1-2am and go to sleep. having no interactions other than talking to my mom before/after work, coworkers, and customers. on my days off i watch stuff, cry a lot lol, and go to sleep around 12-2am. it's depressing and lonely. i've questioned living every single day, multiple times throughout, it doesn't seem worth it anymore but i don't like thinking ab how hurt my family would be so i decide to not do anything. ive only been alone for a couple months so it may not seem like a big deal, but it's the worst pain i've ever endured and i fear it will be this way for the rest of my life. i want to socialize ofc but the fear of ending up alone again keeps it to where i would rather not try, plus i'm shy.

They then went on to say that if you want a relationship to not be lonely anymore it'll fail. 

That's really interesting. Hmm. 

With a few Google searches I found some data that says around 84% of people desire relationships, sex, and so on. 69% were already taken, and 15% more were single and looking. 

The rest were single and not looking. 

So I'd say the majority of the population desires romantic relationships. 

I find it odd then, why on this sub for ""lonely"" people always has commenter saying things like ""just get escorts, escorts are the best! Relationships are overrated!"" 

OK why are you here? If you aren't lonely, and are sitting around telling lonely people to get over it, it's not a big deal, so on, it makes me question is all. 

Next is the gatekeepers of who is allowed to want to date. 

Oh you wanna date because you're lonely? WRONG! 

then they go on literal rants about how wanting to date should be more than about company. 

So why do people date? What's the reason then? Why are 84% of people interested in dating? In romance? 

Just want sex? WRONG! 

just don't want to be lonely? WRONG! 

want to experiment with romance? WRONG!

4600,z2dewf,MiamiVice7777,As far as I know I have always been very introverted. That’s a kid I can remember having a handful of friends at school but I will never hang out with them outside of school or attend sleep overs with him. In high school during the lunch while everyone would eat together I would walk home for lunch and eat at my house alone. I remember times when friends from work would ask me if I wanted to hang out with them on break and I would decline every time. Every time a cute girl smiles at me or tries to talk to me I would of course be polite and respond but still I would try to end the conversation as fast as possible. Despite me feeling lonely left out and upset I still avoid and procrastinate interactions with people. I want to change and be more social but I don’t know how it’s very frustrating and I feel like every time I try to explain this to people they don’t understand. :(,2022-11-23 02:57:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614557389,5,/r/lonely/comments/z2dewf/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,,0,3,I don’t know what’s wrong with me

4610,z2es6f,throwaway179--,"Hey, just another post in the sea pretty much. I've honestly never felt worse than I do right now, my mind is not feeling well and I can't fix it.

I've never really been the most popular guy, but even a year ago I had a few solid friend groups where I felt like I belonged and could be myself (something that is important to me due to being on the spectrum.) I had support, and I didn't have to mask. 

This year though, things are different. One friend group split after someone went and joined the Marines, basically leaving and causing everyone else to go their own ways. The second was entirely based around posting art online, and I'm not a great artist myself but I still posted and tried to improve. Now though, people have left and made new friends, basically leaving me as a mediocre artist without support. I haven't been able to post in a year because of it all, and I feel worthless in a hobby that used to make me happy. 

Tonight I tried to hang out with some other people I know, but I feel like a burden to them and sometimes it feels like they'd much rather be talking to anyone else they know rather than me. I'm laying in bed now, kinda just wondering what to do. I know my problems aren't as bad as a lot of others that post here, but I just feel unlovable in a way, like something in me makes me incapable of being worthy of friendship or any kind of relationship.",2022-11-23 04:04:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662945018,3,/r/lonely/comments/z2es6f/at_my_lowest_point/,,0,4,At my lowest point

4615,z2fzdn,strawberrycow14,"hi, im a 15f and recently started at a new school. my best friend of 12 years (K) moved 3000 miles away. since she is busy with her boarding school things, most of our convos are initiated by me and only last a minute or two before she says she has to go. i have since not kept constant contact with any of my close friends from my old school, except 2, L and I. But L doesn't text and I is going through a lot right now, so I really cant talk to them.  


 I have been feeling really alone at my school because I have lots of friends, but they are all surface level friendships and i dont fit in with a specific group. i used to have a really good friend at school F. But our friendship ended in a huge argument a few weeks after school started and i really desperately miss him, but he has become so nasty and mean whenever he talks to me. I made two more close friends, S and A, but they completely shunned me after I said S was bad at volleyball even after I owned up and apologized. I have a new boyfriend, who is great and I really like him but we arent at the level where I can really open up to him, or even just give him my random life updates.

I told her about my plans and the surgery and told her everything regarding that. She told me that she would not slow me to get the surgery underneath her roof.

(im not saying my age. im in high school.) everywhere i’ve looked, i’ve been surrounded in love. everyones got someone. my friends, my family (my cousin introduced me to his girlfriend this week during our family reunion), social media, even just strangers down the fucking street. Im sick of it. I joke to my friends and about how theyre gross with their s/os but its mainly to conceal the fact that im repulsed by the sight of them. 
why has it worked out for them, but not for me? all i’ve gone through is abuse and manipulation in my past relationships. 1st (technical) relationship when i was younger, but all he did was sext me and take screenshots of me (he ghosted me before it escalated to full nudity, thankfully) which i didnt realize was so fucked up until 2 years later.
After that, ive gone through periods of people trying to get with me just to serve as a temporary placeholder until they find other people that they actually wanna be with, or people who just want me for their sexual desires until this year
my second one i just got out of this year. threatened me multiple times saying if i broke up, they would kill themselves. Self harmed to guilt trip me, manipulated me into becoming their second therapist, tried to isolate me fron my friends, and even more. im still trying to recover from the trauma ive gained from that shitshow, but its near impossible when i have to see them everyday at school.
Why is everyone so happy in their relationships? Why the fuck am i the one who has to go through this shit? Why am i the only one whos been through the shitty relationships? Why me? What have i done to deserve this?

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

4673,z2q9nl,DenisaMindset," Can you show up always as your true self?

Trading identity for approval is never a winning game. Getting comfortable with yourself is.

You can gain clarity on your true identity, to be able to express it in any situation.

Especially when it comes to relationships.

Being comfortable with your true identity is going to reflect amazingly in all areas of your life.

If you accept where you are you'll be able to decide WHERE you want to go.

And this is a journey.

A journey where your emotions are going to be challenged, your thoughts, your beliefs, your confidence. Your life overall. This is how anxiety appears, stress, lack of self-esteem...

By denying your true identity.

Identity equals who you really are, what you really want, how you want to show up, what type of relationships you want, how you run your business, what rules and boundaries you apply, how you react to stress, how you react to love, to friendships. And so on.

Identity Equals how you carry yourself EVERY minute of the day.

Talk soon,

I'm sick of it, everywhere i go people treat me differently, people are either hostile, judgmental or sometimes actively avoid me because I'm different. When i say I'm different i don't mean I'm weird i say it because i have been diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD.

Like most people with ADHD or Aspergers people seem to pick up on the fact that we are different and unfortunately it seems that people think weir weird.

2022 has not been a good year for me, its been full of frustration for different reasons. I just feel irritated at times, especially during the day when I'm alone at home and have no real friends. I also get fed up sometimes of seeing couples or people kissing because it's as if the universe keeps rubbing it all in my face and i get annoyed when I'm reminded that i don't have what i wish i had.

The main thing I'm worried about now is that i barely enjoy the things I've always enjoyed, like gaming, now i don't play a game for even 1 hour because i just get so bored.

Life has hit a new low this year and everything just feels pointless, nothing really excites me anymore like it should or like it used to. It feels as if i can't react properly, i just feel sad and irritated most of the time now, (even though I'm usually a happy person).

I was texting for a while he didn't read them, then one day i deleted all of the messages and sent ""sorry"". He read it! But didn't say f one word. Days passed this time I decided to ask him why he did it but everytime i regreted and i knew he will not read. Finaly one day i acted like it didn't hurt me and talked about his hair, asked question and he didn't answer again, but i wanted to show nothing could break me, i'm too strong. I was wrong!! Then again and again this happened. Finaly last week i decided to say this is not good and he hurted me. I made it friendly and with attachment funny emoji, told him it hurts me and want he say sometging. He read and didn't respond. I said ok. 

Yesterday i was in a venting app reading posts and try to help others, one post frozed me. A guy wrote "" My horrible mental health got to me and i ghosted my online best friend... she kept sending messages first few days but stopped and deleted them. I miss her so much but no way in hell i think we could be friends again and i just realy miss her"" then he replyed to one ""... I hurt her too much... look like an idiot to have audacity to text her agin after ghosting her like that.. plus it's been too long...""

Damn the guy i was talking w had mental health problem too. It sounds too him.

4710,z2wihw,ExponentSoda811,"I have 'mates'. The people you hang around with in school bc you've known them since primary and its just easier to stick to the people you already know. 
 
But I feel like I don't have any friends. I've got maybe two good friends that actually give a shit about me but I don't really see them outside of school and I just want a friend I can ft every night or go over their house or play with them online. I have none of that. I just sit at home by myself looking on Reddit and TikTok wishing someone would message me. 

I hate messaging people first bc I feel like a burden and I hate the fact that they haven't messaged me first. 

I've got three friends in England but I only ever see them maybe twice a year and they're busy with their friends so I kinda get forgotten. I don't blame them but it would be nice if they checked in once in a while. 

If I'm having a bad day there's no one to ask am I okay I have to start a conversation with someone and tell them I'm not okay. And I hate that bc it makes me feel like I'm just dumping all my shit on them when they haven't offered. 

I miss having friends like I did in primary where I used to go to their house after school and play on their Xbox and go down their nans and stuff. Now I have none of what I used to. My friendship group is getting smaller and smaller and I'm so lonely and sad all the time and there's no one I can talk to. 

I've made posts and replied to posts on Reddit before and only really one of them have replied and messaged for more than a day. Everybody else messages maybe twice asking what my favourite music is or whatever and then ghosts me. 

At this point I don't know who to turn to so I'm posting this hoping someone cares. I'm just so sick and tired of being lonely",2022-11-23 18:24:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654252854,7,/r/lonely/comments/z2wihw/i_feel_like_i_have_no_close_proper_friends/,,0,1,"I feel like I have no close, proper friends"

From there it usually leads to me reconnecting with this person. But the wierd part is i can recall previously forgotten dreams like memories while asleep.so as im reconnecting with this past dream girl im remembering all these fun moments or places we’ve interacted over the years (none of which actually happened).

4714,z2wtop,Acceptable-Basil-773,"As I reflect the last 19 years of marriage to my wife I look back at memories good and bad. My wife and I met online while she going to school in the town I grew up in. She at first was shy sweet and caring. As we got to know each other we had our differences but nothing to make the relationship not work. I had lost my job several times to do economic short falls. She was supportive but became less supportive as time went by. Threatened to leave if I couldn't find another job. As time went by and after several lost jobs most were temporary which didn't give any guarantee she became upset. Finally as luck would have it I found one of my favorite jobs we were both making good money and living in a nice home them made the decision to have kids.  We have one little girl who as time went by shown signs of Autism we had hee rested and she was. While raising her I had to leave my favorite job to become my available to care taking of my daughter which I don't mind I enjoy having fun going for walks going to the park and painting and coloring playing games. Now as she's growing up she's more challenging with her behavior which has caused my wife and I to fight more regularly.  I then come to the conclusion that no matter what I do or did to make my wife happy it still isn't enough. She would bring up the idea of leaving or me to leave almost everytime we fought. Now just before the holidays she losses her shit over a stupid silly comment I made online. Making it cleat she wants me gone. I work late at night to alternate our work schedules she then tells me I can't come home. I explained to her I need to come home I can't just be without clothes I'm not going to sleep in my uniform or sleep in my truck. As of today I'm not so sure what is going to happen and where I'm going to stay tonight.

4716,z2x0sy,RevenueLess2739,"I have a question, and this is mostly towards the women, because these are the main ones that I’ve experienced this with. My question is, if everything was previously going well in the convo, and especially if you both were only trying to build a platonic friendship, then why when you ask for that persons picture do you ghost and block them? Why should their appearance matter to such a degree that you have to block them if you were only trying to be friends. 

Background, i met this person who had reached out to one of my posts right. She said she was looking for iMessage buddies so we exchanged phone numbers. I was clear in my post that i was looking for platonic friendships, and she also stated that she was married, so nothing romantic should have been involved right? So why then when you ask me for a picture and I send you one of my graduation pictures do you straight up block me? This has happened so many times. Like the conversation can be going well, we could be getting along well, and as soon as they ask for my picture and I send it, they block me. Why? Nothing was wrong before i sent my picture. So why? Do y’all get pleasure from making people who are already struggling feel worse? What makes y’all want to just straight up block someone you were previously friendly with just because of their pictures? Especially if things are supposed to be platonic?",2022-11-23 18:44:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1665413359,13,/r/lonely/comments/z2x0sy/i_have_a_legitimate_question_when_everything_was/,,0,18,"I have a legitimate question, when everything was previously going well in the friendship/conversation, why do you ghost someone after asking for their picture?"

4737,z2ywc9,Frostylemonade22,"    God sat at his desk filling out paperwork from an endless stack. Whenever he grabbed a page, another would materialize. Each paper was a summary of every new life in the world, when they were born, when they would die, who they would marry, and so on. God tapped his chin with his pen that never ran out of ink.
    “What am I forgetting?”
    “Oh! Oh!” Jebediah, an angel, had his hand raised and was bouncing up and down.
    God sighed and without looking up said. “Jebediah, what have I said about bothering me while i work?”
    Jebediah’s whole body sagged. “Sorry boss, it’s just that I know what you forgot. You forgot to---.”
    God waved his hand and Jebediah disappeared and reappeared on the other side of Heaven.
    “Who wants cupcakes!?” Mother Mary strolled into the room, cheerful as always.
    A look of excitement crossed God’s face. He loved Mary’s cupcakes, especially fresh ones. He quickly signed off on the sheet he was working on, not realizing he forgot to finish it.
    “He forgot to finish that paperwork.” Michelangelo said to Gabriel, who was standing next to him.
    “Shh,” Gabriel whispered to Michelangelo. “God hates it when we disturb him while he is eating, especially when he’s eating cupcakes.”
    “But the poor guy on that paper…” Michel started to say
    God was staring right at him and Gabriel, and not with a pleasant look in his eye. Before God could raise his hand and get rid of the two angels they took flight and flew off quickly.
    “I told you to be quiet…” You could hear the two bickering as they flew away.
    God sighed but cheered back up as Mother Mary practically stuffed a cupcake into his mouth.
    “Are they okay? I cut back on the sugar, you are starting to get a belly on you.”
    God groaned but quickly smiled. “There delicious Mary.” He knew better than to say anything else, besides they weren’t that bad. The sheet he just finished and put in the completed tray, which was empty, disappeared as soon as he placed it in the bin.

4741,z2z3oo,Appropriate_Ad_811,"I’m 26, last year in April I woke up paralyzed from the neck down, no signs or anything. Since that day, I basically lost my life. Fast forward a year and a half later, I’m still in a wheelchair and have limited function in my hands and am still dependent on someone for basic things. I lost the ability to do mostly everything that I loved, can’t work, and can’t go anywhere on my own. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t think I’ll ever get my life back and I’m gonna be stuck like this forever. It is extremely lonely. I struggle to talk to people about how I’m feeling because for the past year that’s all anyone’s been asking me and now I’m just sick of it. Everyone just feels pity for me and I hate it.

I don’t feel good at home, but I can’t go anywhere else without someone’s help and it makes me feel so useless and I’m just a burden on everyone around me.

4793,z36xx5,Mischling1965,"Every day I come into my house and have no one to speak to. This on its own is not perturbing, as I live alone and never invite anyone to my house; there is no one to invite, no friends or nearby relatives. I go through every evening cooking for myself, sometimes shopping, always buying the same exact items. Then I'll watch a film I've seen before, read a few chapters in a novel I like, and eventually wash before laying down in bed. When I lay under my blankets, staring at the ceiling, I think constantly about what I've seen and read, often making up little stories to keep myself busy. But occasionally I'll quiet my thoughts enough to realise I'm the only person around, and that all I can hear are jets, cars, and motorcycles with long interludes of silence. I also recognise how cold I feel, like no matter how much I wrap myself up I'm losing too much heat for comfort. In those moments I feel utterly alone because that's when I realise I haven't spoken aloud since leaving work, that I have only acquaintances of circumstance, and that no one thinks about me, the same way I don't think about anyone else. It's during moments like these I wonder if there is something defective about me if I perhaps missed a stage of social development that has led to me being nothing more than a human robot. Why have I become so completely forgotten? I only speak to relatives if they call first, and yet neither they nor I ever seem to know what to say, as if we're strangers. These contemplative episodes are when I feel the coldest as if I've been cast under a black shadow. There is an abstract undefinable fear that arises from this line of thinking. I understand nothing and there is no one to help me; I wonder if I stopped speaking altogether would anyone know I was missing? Has my presence ever truly felt meaningful to anyone? I wonder if I am only an ineffectual external observer in life rather than an active participant. If I am, that is both saddening and incomprehensible.

My dad isn’t going to help me ( ignorant )

I barely know my mother ( i hate her )

Moved around way to often. I never made friends, my parents didn’t care. If this would effect my adolescence/ adulthood. I hate them for this.

I’ve tried psychedelics and they only make me want to escape my pain. I  instead of embracing it ( go to the gym, DO MORE ) just like our society want us to do you can’t be thinking about pain if you hot muscles right?

Even though it seems that I see a lot of memes of people taking going to the gym as getting help. TL; DR these people are still sad, and don’t have a personality because they live in a damn gym.

4823,z3aqxh,PinkNoon,"11/23/2022

 So the holidays are coming up, and you know what that means.

 No school for almost a whole week :(

 This may sound like a good thing , but school really is where I like to unwind. I like spending time in the least crowded corners of the library and drawing to myself. Since nobody reads anymore, not many people stumble upon me and I go relatively unnoticed.

 I decided I needed to be less of a social media addict if I wanted to get through this week without feeling like a useless pile of dog shit. I borrowed a few books from the library and did a little crafts shopping today. I am planning to read Naked Lunch, A book on the treatment of intersex people in medical settings, a book of plays from the 60's, and Midnight Sun ( a retelling of the first Twilight book from Edward's perspective) ,and also on doing some acrylic painting.

 I know a lot of people don't enjoy Twilight, but I'm reading them for the first time as an adult and I am really enjoying them. I never got the chance to read stuff like this as a young teen and it makes me feel happy to know that I can still enjoy things like this. I really like the world building and mysticism of it. Spacing them out between other reads helps too. It's inspiring me to make a story of my own, although I don't think I can ever post it.

 I want to try painting on this black multimedia paper I got a while back. I have been addicted to using sharpies on these gridded note cards I have and this will be a nice change of pace. (actually works surprisingly well) I might want to start sharing my art too. 

 I have one problem in my way of an amazing week of doing my own thing.

 *Thanksgiving*

 My family hasn't seen me in a while and I *have* to go to this event. I dread just being there. I can't make any fun conversation with the people my age there. I don't want to have to drink. I know after I go I'm going to feel embarrassed at my inability to speak well and stay in my room depressed. I think I'm just going to find a place to hide on their property and sneak out at the last moment.

 But oh well, we all deal with it. If you want, give me suggestions for things to paint.

But I got so sad and so fed up with having the lizard brain in me constantly fantasize about a better life I could never have, and I begged it to stop as if it were a second entity in my head. To my great surprise, it listened to me, and agreed to stop. Its been doing its best, still relapsing sometimes, but only briefly. And its also considerably more sad and regretful about what happened than whatever I call ""me"" is. The one typing now. I really don't know how to explain this aside from some sort of mental disorder. I asked my sister to what degree she talks to her subconsciousness, and she said she has ""full conversations"" . But I think she just meant she has an inner monologue, because she was quite startled by what I described.

Amyways, with the fantasizing gone, my mind is sooooo much more empty. Its like someone's taken all the furniture out of a house. At first it was fun, I had space to run around and think about and care about whatever I wanted. But its starting to get boring.

I'm sure there's lots of people in this sub that share the same feelings, but blanking out talking to people I've known my whole life? Friends that I'd have never imagined losing ahold of, but seeing it happen right in front of me nonetheless. Self fulfilling prophecy anyone? It's such a bizarre feeling constantly attempting to clear your mind, &amp; to be honest it's tiring, &amp; I am far beyond being just tired. I know there's so many worse off than me, but it legitimately feels like there isn't a single person in the world I can have a genuine, drawn-out conversation with anymore.

And the worst part is them noticing somethings off, watching you slowly drift away while you're too embarrassed to even entertain the thought of bringing it up around them. 
My family on the other hand is extremely supportive though, as both sides of the family are riddled with anxiety disorders. So I have that to be thankful for at least.

I've thrown so much at the wall hoping something'll stick that you probably couldn't even tell its a wall anymore. Be it sessions with two separate therapists at the same time (one of them specializing in social anxiety), meditation, bilateral music, weed, alcohol, mind quieting: no matter what I try nothing seems to work, at least not for long. 

Is there anyone here struggling with similar experiences as me? &amp; has anything truly helped you long-term? 
Desperate doesn't even begin to cover it anymore 🤕.

4851,z3dv8z,CanadianIdi0t,"I (m21) need to vent a bit. My schooling is getting busy as the semester is ending, when I’m not at school I’m working, and any other time hardly feels like a break because I’m spending it alone in an empty apartment,. I have company over from time to time but never more than a very short-term fling. When that happens it’s a nice temporary relief but it feels more like treating the symptoms than curing the disease. 
I thought I’ve known love before but it was never mutual, that sucks. People always tell me not to worry about it, there’s plenty of fish in the sea, but the sea is also full of trash (I blame pollution, lol.). Maybe I’m just too scared to let my guard down around anyone new because if that’s gone before.

All my friends are becoming busier, hell, I’m getting busier all the time and the old weekly hangout now happens just once every few months. My home is always empty, it’s depressing. I feel like I’m losing my mind some days. Struggling to cope with solitude feels more pathetic than natural. Idk, I’m sure some day I’ll wake up to good company or maybe a family but for now, this winter’s been particularly cold.

4866,z3gj2d,AppropriateThanks273,"I really didn't know what sub to put this under since it spans many topics but I had a tough time for about a year and this is really isn't a ""it got better"" story as much as the highs and lows of pulling myself from the feeling of being drowned by sadness and loneliness. I really help this helps someone.

The backstory is this started in 2018. I was 27 (female) and my husband was 40 at the time.

WE had been together for 7 years (me 20, him 33) obviously I didn't realize the age differences was a big thing in this circumstance but back to 2018.

At this point in our 2 year marriage it was all downhill. He started gaslighting me, i had suggested we move to another state and he agreed, we visited the state and area I liked only for him two months later to say he never intended to move to another state. At one point I thought I would find land nearby and we could build a house. Again he agreed, I put in a $500 deposit to talk to a company about the floorplans. Me and him went to location to buy the land. Again a few months later he told me it was something he was never actually going to do.

He never wanted any more pets, only wanted to work his little part time job and I had just realized that I'm stuck the rest of my life with someone who kept lying to me. I also wanted different things at 27 (a house in the future, kids, vacation retirement) compared to 20 when I just wanted fun.

The part that cemented my leaving was a day I had depression really kicking my ass. I remember telling him that I had never had the feeling of wanting to self harm and now I could see a possibility of it. That I felt so sad and hopeless that it was making sense to me. He in response just told me everything was ok. and "" don't do that"" but was also so mad at me for having depression he left. He did something he had never done before and just left the apartment at noon on that Saturday and didn't come home until 4am on Sunday.

All I could think was I told my husband about how I wanted to hurt myself and his response was to leave. 

So in November of 2018 I ended the marriage and moved in with a family member. I spent the next month crying every other night because I thought I did the wrong thing leaving him. because all I could think at 27 was that I would never find anyone to love me again.

I didn't really see myself as a victim in this situation but I did see myself as the one being hurt and doing this to improve my circumstances. But my ex got all the sympathy. The friends we both had all went to his side and I will never know why. maybe they liked him or he told a different story than what I would have said. I was never given a chance with any of them or his family.

But my family, they sent him messages about how it was nice to meet him and wishing him their best. I moved back into my apartment that I had been helping him pay for and he moved out in march of 2019. The thing was we also had roommates that acted like this wasn't a big deal that we split up. two people we had been living with for 5 years.

In these times of being really stressed and looking for an outlet I turned to weed. Anything that could make me feel better. But I would spend almost everyday thinking about how I was wronged by my ex. How he decided he should take all the money out of my bank account (yes technically it was a joint account but only my paychecks went into this account. his money went to a separate account only he had access to). He felt entitled to the money since I was leaving him, he said he wouldn't help with the paperwork for divorce, took the car that we both are owners now.

Then I thought about how not the people I thought were friends every checked on me, how my family seem to move from it. I just felt so worthless. To the point I think I cried at work too a few times each day.

So I made things worse for myself because I had a coworker who eventually quit who I become friends with. I thought this was a better relationship and I wouldn't be sad or alone. but it was a conditional relationship where I paid for gas, and food and gave him sexual favors but in return I had his company only. I think at the time i was being young and fun and thinking about he only cared about himself and wasn't really a true friend.

Here I thought I would feel more free and like I was healing myself from the pain of someone hurting me. but this was a feeling that lingered and stuck with through the entire year. Sure some days weren't as bad but others were horrible, my birthday week I was fired from my job. and the only friend I had at the time only cared about himself where he turned it around to use me being fired as a jumping off point for him talking about his ex girlfriend. Then on the actual day of my birthday he didn't remember. Here I was barely hanging and thinking this one poisonous relationship was the best thing I had.

but the thing I remember was a dream I had where a unknown figure told me to hold on. It wasn't something I really took much notice in because I think it was just my imagination since it was a dream probably. I really wasn't sure if I dreamed it or if somehow maybe it was something that really happened but I do remembered this ""dream"" because at the time I thought maybe this unknown figured looked like this other guy at work and that I should maybe try talking to him but I was fired shortly after.

it got to December of 2019 and this toxic friendship reached its breaking point. He wouldn't respond to messages anymore. I was working a part time job. i didn't really socialize with anyone. ate outside so i wouldn't have to talk to anyone on my lunch break.

I had tried tinder to meet people because at least as a girl you have one thing to offer. but the thing was this whole time I was not having a  good time. There was a week where I tried to sleep as much as possible where I really went to sleep hoping I didn't wake up. Where I would lay in bed all day. I brought a galloon jug of water into my room on better days so at least I would have something to drink. Then it was entire me listening to a depression playlist I made of songs that I would cry to or watching the golden girls. because there was something neutral about watching this show I had seen before.

Now the dark thoughts were just continuing to grow and it just seems so unfair to have nothing in your life. No one who loves you, no one who you could love. Nothing in  the future to look forward to. No money to really live. I life really unlived. 

I was of sound enough mind that if I ever really felt like things got that bad I would have a drastic plan. my last resort was simply to move to another country and be homeless there. Something about that comforted me in an odd way. Because I think I needed a different situation than from what I had.

I had one more tinder date before I had deleted the app. We talked on snapchat to the point that I had forgotten his actual name. becasue he had his username on snapchat and I didn't have that tinder account anymore. I had to ask. he is a nice person.

So I went to his house for sex and afterwards he asked me what flavor ice cream I wanted. Which was a confusing statement because in the messages I had joked about wanting ice cream if we have sex.

He though followed through and had actually bough the ice cream. So we talked more and it led to the conversation about both of us being scared of relationships due to past traumas. but we pushed though and in January 2020 we started dating.

and he became my light. I would always be surprised he wanted to spend time with me or pay for things. he never made me feel ugly like the way my ex did. I had cut my hair short while with my ex and he would take time to insult it whenever someone new saw it.

My current bf had even helped me cut my hair short at one point in our relationship. He has so much going for him i didn't know why he ever liked me. he is handsome, tall and makes at least 6 figures. No kids and never been married.

but he had a sadness about him that maybe he saw in me and we could understand that part of each other. I couldn't believe that i was able to find someone.  i think i also heard those songs differently now, something about not giving up. That somehow this sadness, depression, loneliness was something I was suppose to wait out until it shaped me to be who i was meant to be and find the thing I wanted.",2022-11-24 10:26:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596601100,2,/r/lonely/comments/z3gj2d/how_i_got_through_the_worse_time_of_my_life/,,0,2,How I got through the worse time of my life

4876,z3ipn5,fluffyacquatic,"Hi, this is my (M19) first post here.

The title basically says it all, but here's the full story:

This is my first year as a university student, and I noticed this girl. We looked at each other, I could spot her looking at me and vice versa. I was so excited. I looked up for her Instagram (here is much more a casual thing that it may be in the US, its more like Snapchat), and i found out we had a lot of interests in common.


I texted her finally. And we talked for about 6 days. Honestly, things were going great. She didn't use to always answer me immediately, but it was cool. For reference, almost everyday we had like 10 screenshot of chat (vocal messages included). 


Long story short, I told her I was going to try sushi for the first time, and she told me she loves it. Then it went like this: ""This shit is fire. Wanna go eat some next week?"" 
""Maybe. Anyway I don't want us to misunderstand, I like another boy"". Then i tried to fake I was inviting her as a friend, and she seemed to believe that. Or maybe she was sorry, and didn't honestly want to hurt me.


At first i was not sad. After a few hours I was angry. Now I'm just sad. I tried hard not to daydream. I tried keeping her interested by talking about what she likes and also more everyday things. Apparently, I'm not cute enough, or funny enough, or athletic enough, or smart enough, or maybe I'm too much myself. I just failed another time.


Now I have to face herself again, and while I doubt she will make fun of me, I'll still have a hard time looking into her eyes and I know that she was the only girl i was interested in. I know it's been just a few days, but now i feel like this. It'll pass, after all. I think i just need to vent rn.


Thank you for reading. English is not my first language, so if i wrote some lines you do not understand, let me know.

P.S. yes, we had a few face to face interations, and she also made first move, talking about physical contact.",2022-11-24 12:29:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597411866,15,/r/lonely/comments/z3ipn5/she_said_no_basically/,,1,10,"She said no, basically"

I’ve tried dating apps but literally no one (and I mean literally) likes or matches me, which makes me sad so I delete the apps and just go back to work with a big smile with a attitude that’s says I’m ok.

4889,z3kiam,dvdsnp,"I had a relationship with a beautiful woman for almost a year. She was beautiful on the outside but had some issues on the inside. We all have issues on the inside so I tried to be understanding of those while being conscious of my own. 

I had to move away to start my career after school. A decent drive between us caused issues. I would visit every weekend and gave everything I had to make it work. 

She treated me unfairly for quite some time but in my head, relationships were supposed to have struggles to work through. I thought that we could move past them together. I gave her every part of me to make it work, and she didn’t give the same. 

We separated. I’ve been sad about it for almost half a year. I thought she was the one but I don’t know if it was because she was or because in my head, that was my last chance at love.

I know, deep down, I needed to move on to grow as a person and stop allowing someone to hurt me over and over again. I struggle most because I  believe that no person is truly bad and that maybe I could’ve made it better.

Those around me saw the relationship as abusive towards me, but I was so sure I could make it work that it wasn’t in my head. It burned me in the end.

I’m only 22 years old, but I worry I’ll never find someone that I will love like I loved her.

I worry I’ll be alone and regret moving on.

I worry that even though it wasn’t healthy, it could’ve been and now it’s too late for me.",2022-11-24 13:51:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597620800,2,/r/lonely/comments/z3kiam/carrying_on/,,0,1,Carrying on

All my life people have avoided me, and I have avoided them. Sometimes I experienced violence from them, sometimes love. But it was always like a pure formality, insincere and boring.
There were relationships and friendships. But they always ended quickly. In the only relationship I have been lied to. I was never understood, I always seemed to speak a different language, I always had to explain everything.
If I tried to talk to anyone, anywhere, I was rejected quickly enough that I stopped trying a long time ago. Time in my life flies with great speed, life passes on an absolute machine.

I am a very shy, quiet and introverted 28 year old. I was very sheltered growing up and more so due to my depression. I was always awkward and afraid of everything. I became a recluse even though I hated it.

I have been taking SSRIs for a while and have been improving at first. Things were starting to look up but now I feel I am going back down to zero.

I have found a job that I enjoy but everyone at my workplace feels so hostile and just mean, even when they are complimenting you. I always get blamed for everything and people like to laugh at my expense. Everyone feels so aloof, no sympathy from anyone and I am just inching closer to snapping everyday, but I can't because I don't want to ruin what little I have got going.

I have no one to talk to, no one to share my daily experiences, no one to vent to about how horrid the people are. Life really feels pointless. I just feel like a training dummy, whose only purpose is to be beat-up, beat down and be abused at peoples leisure.

So a bit about me is that I’m a Mexican/Salvadoran male and well I’m a bigger guy obviously. I’m an introvert and I’m a bit awkward usually when talking to new people but I do try to make conversation and get to know you. I have my bachelors in Chemistry and have been working in chemical manufacturing since I graduated. 

I’ve been an introvert mostly all of my life and I do admit I do prefer to be inside just relaxing to just unwind. I’m more than happy to go out as long as it’s with someone regardless of where the place is or whether I’ve done the activity before I just prefer to be doing things with someone else instead of it just being by myself in all honesty. 

If you care for appearances this is [me](https://imgur.com/a/S3sVFxi) and [me](https://imgur.com/a/gO2VbjL). I’ll be happy to talk outside of Reddit after a bit of chatting as well and I’d really appreciate it if I could see you as well.

I absolutely love Star Wars and I just finished watching Andor and loved it. I would love to rewatch Star Wars with someone even if it means being able to binge watch all the shows from the beginning with you

I absolutely love Batman and I’ve seen almost all of the movies and I’ve watched the Animated series from the 90s, the 00s and Batman Beyond. I’d love to rewatch any of these or any shows you’re interested in seeing that I haven’t seen before would be more than welcome.

I also love Spider-Man but I’ll always be a fan of the Sam Raimi Trilogy of films over the MCU Spider-Man and I haven’t watched the MCU at all really so I wouldn’t mind watching all the movies from the beginning either if you’re willing to make that time commitment with me.

I enjoy old science fiction shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits and I own these series but I would like to be able to watch these shows with someone else and just have a good time. I also love watching Doctor Who as well but haven’t watched past Capaldi’s era yet but I’d be happy to watch it with you as well.

I enjoy watching anime and reading manga and I do have a few shows on my watchlist but if you have some suggestions I would love to hear some or if you want some recommendations by all means I’m more than happy to share.

I’m a huge fan of classic rock and have my own personal favorite bands and songs and I also enjoy new wave music and I like a little bit of indie rock as well but I’ll admit I absolutely dislike most modern pop music and I don’t like rap at all.

I’ve loved playing video games since I was about 4 and currently have a PS5, Nintendo Switch, and a gaming PC so if you’d like we can game together sometime as well. I love Dark Souls and Fall Guys so if you do too we can play those games together. I’m still playing Elden Ring right now since I haven’t beaten it yet but honestly I’d like to be able to play it with someone else if possible. I’m also open to some shooters but I do admit I suck at them.

Hopefully this is enough for everybody to get a sense of who I am. I’m not expecting anybody to like everything I like or anything I like but I’m just hoping this catches your attention and maybe even though we’re different we can get along and chat with one another.

Eluding focus 
Like a metropolis pollutes the stars

Hidden from sight

Cold and crisp 
Leaves rustling across the wooden tiles

Spiderwebs through me like broken glass

My (M24) girlfriend (F23) of 3.5 years broke up with me today shortly after I flew from Canada to a US city to visit her (she moved here half a year ago for work).

As I was sobbing on her front step waiting for my Uber, a mother walked by with her young daughter (probably like 3 years old). As they walked by the little girl, took a few steps back, smiled at me, and handed my a single US penny. She then scurried off to re-join her mom.

There was something so surreal about that moment. I wasn't waiting there long, maybe 5 minutes. But, something about her toothy smile and the simple kind act let me know everything is okay.

5006,z3zcbw,NewCold2278,"I’m in my 40s and I have to realize it’s just not going to happen. I just wish the desire to have somebody would go away ,but it’s not! 

The good ones are most DEFINITELY taken. I wish I could tell all the younger people to choose wisely. I didn’t. I divorced my abusive husband, and I just can’t start all over again, no matter how hard I try. Single again, for quite some time now, there’s nobody worth a second date …..let alone a relationship.

It SUCKS out there !  I tried online dating and it’s an absolute shit show! Trust me, if you are younger and reading this ,I know it’s no picnic for those under 30 ….but when you are over 40? forget it. I’ve run into nothing but alcoholics, men with dead end jobs and no ambition, mamas boys, Narcissists, Men with needy adult children that failed to launch, and let’s not forget about the man that admitted to being an actual white supremacist. My skin is still crawling. Meeting these men make me just want to hide and give up for good.

I’m trying to be single and happy. I just don’t know how to do that. I’m really trying . I have lots of hobbies. I have a meet up group that I really enjoy. I don’t mind traveling by myself. I stopped going to church because I felt weird going by myself. So much for singles in church. Everybody was old or coupled up . Or both .

My circle is very very small and nobody knows of any good single men even close to my age, either. It just seems like this would take a miracle. I wonder if any of you can relate .

I should be happy. But I’m not. I mean I’m healthy and I have a nice place and a good job . 

But I am so damn lonely to the point where it physically hurts! I hate being single. Truly. Admitting that to people I know? They don’t see what the big deal is. They just don’t get it ,and they told me I should just be happy I’m single.

I think what makes me so upset is that I can’t control this.

Now that the holiday season starts it all feels even worse. I’m sitting here alone with my pets, wondering if things will ever change.

Anyway. Thanks for listening to me rant. There’s a lot of us that are lonely right now. Clearly it’s an epidemic. My heart goes out to everyone here.

I never have a great time and as much as I try to be a part of conversations, I always end up feeling silly that I am just standing there, fake smiling like I'm part of the conversation. That to me is much more lonely than just staying home by myself this year. I was invited to someone's thanksgiving, but I only know the person inviting me. I already know how that would have gone down. The same old standing around waiting to go home. And I just wasn't feeling that. So I told them, thanks but no thanks. They only invited me out of pity too which is somehow even worse. 

  
So I am alone this year. Which is kind of nice. I get the house to myself, I had a small meal and no obnoxious mess to clean up. Not getting stepped on or talked over or ignored like I would have been if I did go to some social gathering. It's actually okay.  
The only thing is I think my friend is upset I turned down their invite. Maybe that was rude of me? I don't really think it was. I'm allowed to say no and I saved myself from hours of awkward standing around when I could have just been at home by myself. I don't know. Life's weird.

The friends I do have like across the state, and I love them but I'm scared I'll end up just pushing them away until they don't care about me. 

I know I sound whiny but I just need to get this off my chest. I don't know if I'm even capable of really getting close with someone. I try my best to be positive and be happy, but no matter what there's always this looming sense that I'm always going to be alone. All I do anymore is work and sit at home alone listening to music.

5051,z440j5,KudaGitsune90,"31F and I live alone. Well, with my cat. Thank gods for her, as its really the only social stimuli I get nowadays. I used to be so outgoing, active, always the life of the party according to everyone I knew. Then i started getting sick. I had no energy, I got daily pains, and my body and social life just deteriorated. 

I'm disabled now. I spend all my time at home, gaming or crafting. I can't really go out much do to my health issues, and honestly.. It's driving me crazy. All my friends eventually dropped me when I kept having to say no to events, parties, trips.. Which I guess means they weren't true friends, but honestly? I'd take fake over nothing any day at this point. 

I so miss connection. Intimacy. Love above all. My previous relationship got broken up when covid happened and all the lockdowns started, and we already had some issues due to it being a long distance relationship where we met as often as we could, but it wasn't enough. 

I miss getting to know someone, to fall for someone, the tingling when you wonder if they like you too. 

It's not that I'm not happy either. I do enjoy being on my own, or maybe that's my defence mechanism having gotten so used to it that I find safety in it. I'm autistic, and I struggle a bit when getting to know someone, as I might not always catch up on hints and subtle advances. I'm sure I've missed out in the past.

5059,z44hie,SewerFleur,"Hello! I had a deep conversation with myself today and I just thought I would put it out there for people to inspire off. It’s been years since me and my ex split, I’ve never found closure for what I’ve been put through. She used to tell me she would self-harm, she would be ugly towards other people, she used to tell me I should die, she would cry, she even at one point cheated on me but I told her if she made a change I would take her back…  she was exhausting. But, even then and now, I hope she’s doing alright but I don’t know. Unfortunately I believe she may have taken her own life after we split but I’ll never be able to confirm. It’s been hard. I’ve been miserable every-time I hear her name, I see her in my dreams, and I feel the void in my chest every-time I think of her. I’ve always told myself it wasn’t my fault for what she did, but I did try my best to make her happy. We did have good days, truthfully. But good days wasn’t “always” just “sometimes”. I understand that I shouldn’t have this person in my life, but there’s still something inside of my saying that she’s changed or we can start over. This will never happen, because if it did, I would have seen change when we were together. One thing that I don’t understand is, how can I smile? After everything I’ve been though, not only with my ex… How can I smile knowing that the love of my life could have taken her life? The truth is, I don’t know. It took a long time to find peace… I didn’t have anyone to lift me up or anyone who understood. It was difficult. But I’m here today, I’m smiling! I have close friends who care about me… Even though I was stuck in my mind before, I managed to control it.. I had time to heal, think it over, and I pushed my body out of bed and into a gym. The truth is, I imagined a better future with me in it. The world is cruel, but I can still make my carving, and so can you. I am not religious. God did not lift me, I did. I just believed that we all have the power to make a better place for ourselves then where our traumas left us. I may never forget about my traumas, but they don’t hold me captive no longer. My advice for you is, you can think about your past over and over again and it will always stay the same. The question is are you going to stay the same. Believe in yourself that you can overcome it and you are already half way. Good luck 🍀",2022-11-25 05:01:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650289737,2,/r/lonely/comments/z44hie/am_i_in_peace/,,0,3,Am I in peace?

Like yeah dude, you're being really rude, like going out of your way to be rude.




Like messaging me to come hang out with everyone on discord and yall are playing a fun free game and I should join, and then when I do join and download that shit you play mind games and say I took too long. It's a 30 second download.



It was just to try and bully and harass me. I personally told him what happened in my last group, and I knew him 3 months and he keeps doing this shit.




I'm about to abandon my server and start over. I dont think it was nice at all and it's stupid that people were in voice and just complicit with it.



I was actually having fun playing tft alone.




What was the point of inviting me JUST to exclude me?



That's not the first time too hes done it.




I'm done. I'd rather be alone than around trolls.



I didnt even post on this account, I posted on one I only use for gamerpals.




The kicker is, hes also lonely and is always hanging out alone all day in my server. I try to pop in and I always feel chased off because hes so rude, but hes only rude to me and fucking likes to point it out.







Server is only 3 months old. I like the other people but when hes toxic to me, I also notice they like to join in and I think I wanna avoid shit like that. 





They weren't like this and I feel like as soon as someone sees how nice I am, they wanna abuse the fuck out of me.




I have so much love and warmth to give. I just wanna virtually hang out and feel snuggly watching stuff or gaming or chatting. I wanna listen and support my friends.



I'm not bad at it, I used to have a fuck ton of friends, we just parted ways because they got into hard drugs that changed them, or they got sucked into an MMO and I dont play mmos.




Do we really live in a world where people see kindness and instead of taking advantage of someone who will keep you company and converse and send/make you gifts, you will just shit all over them to feel better about yourself?

I have next to no casual friends, they had a large number of people to spend time with.

I ate my lunches and dinners alone while they went out with friends to the cafeteria. 
Weekends for me were, work, cook, and sleep while she once again had activities planned and people to meet.
I was surprised when I first saw them watch shows and movies together, something I’ve never done. They had presentation nights and spent time at each other’s apartments, things I’d wanted but never done. 

I grew resentful partially because it seemed they had an abundance of positive feedback from friends I didn’t have.

That’s just the experiences I saw with my ex but other indicators are there as well. I am always surprised on Friday nights when I look out the window and reminded, yes, many people have fun on the weekends.

5089,z47kog,Affectionate_Hat494,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos. It's not that I wanted to talk to him, but sometimes, you like to admire someone from afar.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up a little bit. I only had like 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few minutes/hours later, my TikTok views on my videos would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter, too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious to me that he posted it just to post it.

I’m thankful for my family, far from perfect but we all got eachothers back.

I’m thankful for my car I’m thankful for the universe for giving me a second chance at car ownership after my stupid neglectful accident last summer, I made a stupid left turn, thought I could cross multiple lanes totaled my car but I got out unscathed and I’m a big guy, I used to drive a small Corolla and I got hit on the drivers side so I got out unscathed and I took it as a sign from the universe to learn from this and don’t fuck up again.



I’m thankful for my doctor, giving me the encouragement to try to take care of myself better.   I haven’t had a sugar soda in almost 2 months, I still have diet a couple of times a week to get my sugar fix and I’m drinking water all day and with my meals, I’ve gotten better control with my emotional eating and my binge eating . I’ve still got a lot to go but with these habits alone, I weighted myself yesterday and I’ve lost 5 pounds, I feel less bloated and my stomach feels a lil flatter

I just wanted to get a sense of how many of you are autistic, because I have a feeling I’m not the only one here in this sub. I also hope this can help steer people looking for answers in the right direction.

If you don’t know what autism is, it’s a developmental disorder that you are born with. Here are some signs of autism.

- finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling

- getting very anxious about social situations

- finding it hard to make friends or preferring to be on your own

- seeming blunt, rude or not interested in others without meaning to

- finding it hard to say how you feel

- taking things very literally – for example, you may not understand sarcasm or phrases like ""break a leg""

- having the same routine every day and getting very anxious if it changes

- not understanding social ""rules"", such as not talking over people

- avoiding eye contact

- getting too close to other people, or getting very upset if someone touches or gets too close to you

- noticing small details, patterns, smells or sounds that others do not

- having a very keen interest in certain subjects or activities

- liking to plan things carefully before doing them

5100,z494ig,_pretty_pretty_boy_,"My (19) brother (20) had bullied me and hit me, my dad (43) is a pervert and nobody else has seemed to notice but me, my dad has slapped me so hard that I bled from my lip even I was around 10, my friends have been toxic and blamed me for my breakup even though they couldn't stay out of it, and it seems when I finally speak up about it that I'M the problem. 

I was with my brother the other day driving in house car to pick up our Xbox and he started having a conversation with me. Asking about if I'm looking for a relationship, if I want one, if there was anybody I liked. And I kept giving him short answers. I said I do eventually but I'm not looking for anyone right now. 

I especially just hate him because he's in a good healthy relationship and I'm jealous because he wouldn't have been a better brother to me without her. And they're both home making sure everyone knows they're happy.

I hate seeing my childhood bully get to be happy after everything he's done to me and said to me with almost no feeling bad because it's in the past but I still remember everything and feel it every day. I doubt he would of even cared that I had cut myself if he didn't have his girlfriend.

My dad decided to look at my scars and loudly ask ""Oh have you been cutting again?"" With a joking tone. And he's seen them before and never decided to ask before so why on Thanksgiving? 

When he first found out he decided to make it all about himself.

When he found out I was suicidal he said ""If you feel like hitting something hit me"" 

Every single time they get on my nerves and can visibly tell they decide to get all defensive and get mad at me for having any other emotions other than be happy that they're jerks to me and always have been.

I have good talks about my life with my youth pastor but his son (18) body shamed my (ex) girlfriend (19) and is one of the main reasons we broke up. And he refuses to take responsibility. He only hated her because he was single even though he's made out with 5 or 6 girls within one school year. He thinks he's better than everyone else now just because he has a good Christian girlfriend, and so now he doesn't need to take part in the arguments about how he ruined the only good thing I had going for me.

I want to hurt them all how they hurt me and I know I can but what if everyone turns against me again?

5108,z49t00,Perunazz,"I'm writing this while feeling fine, but I got really hurt again. I made a friend a little more than a year ago. I clicked really well with her and became best friends pretty quickly, something I didn't experience since primary school. I knew her through another friend that I'm still friends with.

She really started to put a lot of trust in me and shared stuff about her relationship to get advice from me. Which I had no problem with giving. Naturally I also started trusting her more as well.

We stayed extremely good friends for about a year and she also said I could always talk to her if I needed someone to talk to. After having a really bad day I broke down and talked to her about it. She basically said she couldn't help and that I was being annoying. Then she practically ghosted me for 2 days and me with low self respect at the time accepted that.

She ghosted me until she had to vent about her boyfriend again. In my head I was like sure this time is fine but I won't let someone hurt me like this twice. After that the friendship was horrible, she gave very short answers to all my texts, cancelled a total of 6 times and only acted normal when she had something to tell about her relationship.

I felt terrible because of all this and texted her about how horrible I felt. She again said she couldn't help and ghosted me. I procrastinated the entire day but with the help of another friend I texted her to say I never wanna talk to her again. (in the most respectful way)

She hurt me so much that I only felt bad after that for about half an hour and then nearly only felt relief. I don't tell anything to anyone anymore past how I feel, no details. It's gonna take a lot for me to ever trust anyone at that level again.

5113,z4bjea,Colossyss,"Hi, first time posting. I'd like to ask for an objective opinion on my situation and maybe vent a bit.

I'm 23m and never had a girlfriend or any kind of romantic relationship. Not a huge thing I guess but it does weigh on me somewhat. I was never diagnosed with social anxiety or any other condition, but that doesn't change how I feel. I have issues interacting with other people, including members of my family. The simplest tasks like grocery shopping or calling someone seem pretty much impossible to me. I tend to avoid any social interactions, which only deepens the problem. I don't go to bars, restaurants, shopping malls... Although I did try to fit in with others while in high-school, I just don't feel comfortable in these environments. Most of my time I spend at home gaming. Occasionally I go out for a hike. It's something I enjoy and would like to do more often in the future, but even here I noticed that I would go out of my way to minimize human contact.

I get depressed a lot to the point where any positive emotion seems wrong, foreign. I feel anger, lack of self-confidence and the newest addition, paranoia.

Earlier this year I lost my best friend so that puts my friend count exactly at 0. The loneliness is starting to be unbearable. Nights must be the hardest. Every night is the same, fantasizing about my made up girlfriend, in a made up scenario.

Like I said I was never diagnosed with anything, except maybe for dysgraphia. In my childhood and even in high school, I visited a number of therapist but none of them helped me. The last one was an older guy whom I visited only because of his voice. It was like a paid ASMR session.

And so I thought a dating app might be the solution. Though I'm not a 100% on board with it, I guess it is the simplest and perhaps fastest option. 

So my problem is that one side of me tells me that it would be cruel to have anyone deal with my problems. It tells me that since I don't enjoy doing things ""normal"" people do, I should either sort myself out first or simply accept the fact that it would be better to remain alone. The other side tells me that I just have to find someone who would be willing to face the problems with me. But how do you do that? I NEVER talk about my feelings and posting about it, at least somewhat anonymously, is a lot different then letting someone into your life and trusting them. Did that once and got burned. People say there is someone for everyone but right now that just seems unlikely. I try to focus on the good ""me"" but it's hard.

Really sorry for the post length, guess there was more to vent than I thought.",2022-11-25 11:52:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632166974,4,/r/lonely/comments/z4bjea/venting_asking_for_an_opinion/,,0,3,"Venting, asking for an opinion"

I 33f have a friend. We've been best friends since college (UK college so age 16) and do everything together. We've been with each other through dating and breakups. Health scares and family issues. She's always supported me when I was feeling down or bad about myself. 

We complemented each other perfectly. Like I would organise the trips but she would be the one to get us there and make sure things are running smoothly. Always remembered what I missed. 

I found out this morning that my best friend has less than 24 hours to live. And there is nothing that can be done about it.

I feel so lost. I don't know how I'm going to function without her. We had so many plans. We were going to do an activity once a month each month next year.

Not sure what would’ve prompted it honestly, we haven’t texted in a couple of months until now. Not only that, but they apologized for not being a good friend to me which shocked me (not because I thought they wouldn’t, but that they knew exactly what I was thinking).

He knows how cruel the world can be. He was sombre, depressed, he was described as ""sad and silent"". I wish I could probe that lovely mind, witness the creation of his poetry, he could read every draft he had finished. I'd read him Baudelaire, Hugo, all his favourite authors and from time to time I'd just stop and kiss him.

5228,z4r0c1,babymeow01,"WARNING ⚠️ mentions of sexual abuse mentions ra*pe and depression and sewerside

So In may I starting seeing my boyfriend now my ex me f[21] him m [24] in may we both establish both we are going to start only talking and see where things go from there. 

And I have told him that I’ve had been sexually abused and he still kept on pressuring me to make a sex tape even though I said I’m not ready and no so he basically manipulated me into doing it with loving bombing.

I told him to just stop and we should slow down on calling me girlfriend and dropping I love you to me again this was only in the 2nd month of meeting. Also he said he can easily have sex with other girl at his gym because I wasn’t coming to see him and having sex because I didn’t live to close to him. 

He also through some micro aggressions at me and literally. Only saw me as a fetish because I was black.

And I’m still wondering if he rap*d me even after I said no multiple times of not doing the sec tape or just in general.Long story short I broke up with him he was abusive now I’m sad and depressed and I’m scared to ever go back into a relationship or dynamic with getting a boyfriend I’ve tried all places before like tinder and fetlife it’s all bad I just want to know how to heal from this.

I have so many matches but whenever I try reaching out to them none of them ever talk to me or if they do they just treat me as an object.

You would think that I would have at least one decent conversation by now since some people have actually met their significant other from there so there has to be someone who's somewhat serious about talking. 

Anyways, I'm just venting because I don't have any friends to talk to about this. Not looking for advice, I know dating apps are horrible and I should probably never use them but I have no other way of meeting anyone. Probably just better off dead.

After her passing, my Girlfriend/Fiancé decided to breakup with me in September after 5 years together. There is a lot of things that her and I endured in 5 years together but as time went on she stopped being the woman I fell in love with. I'm not trying to throw shade at her but part of my feels like she cheated on me with someone I worked under cause they got together right after we split (well they'd been seeing each other before I started putting pieces together cause I trusted her).

So I've had plenty of time to get over her, in my opinion. I've focused on my career and focused more on my self a bit but I just seems like the solo single life just isn't for me. I want to experience affection again. The late nights on the phone talking. The dates to go get food or walk the mall. I know I can treat a woman right, I know I have great values but I'm I just feel that the time we live in, no one wants what I have to offer.

I just feel like I'm not going to be sought after, like my existence is out of date.

Because of this, it's very hard for me to initiate the conversation first with someone, as Idk what to say and always think like ""Wait, what am I supposed to say now, lol?"". Plus I'm a very shy person. I love playing games, comforting ppl, listening to music, and chatting with strangers on Reddit to make friends with them (or wasting my time on Reddit lol). English isn't my 1st language, so I apologize if my grammar is too bad for u to understand. I would prefer someone who has the same gender, and perhaps something in common. If we don't have anything in common, that's OK too \^\^. Hopefully I will find some1 that will stick around. So ye I would rather a long-term friendship than a short one, but I just let thing flows naturally. My DMs are always open. Forgive me if I'm bad at conversation... Oh! And also, no NSFW profile and 17+ pls \^\^! Honestly I never had a friend b4, so I don't even know ""how it feels"" to have a friend ngl. Thx for reading! I hope u guys have a nice day! With that being said, let's take our hand and see how this goes.

A few things to note b4 messaging me:

\- I ask that u communicate w me ""honestly"" if anything goes wrong instead of keeping things to urself. This is one of the reasons y some friendships fizzle out bc of ""misunderstanding"" and ""assuming"".

\- Just bc I don't reach out 1st, that doesn't mean I don't care about u. I'm not rlly comfortable w initiating 1st smh. So I rlly appreciate those that reach out 1st! Like A LOTTTT TBH!!! And no u won't bother me at all for doing that, so no need to worry about that here, mkay?

\- Forgive me if my answer is short sometimes, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in u!

\- I'm pretty much a listener, so I suppose some1 who is talkative and won't shut up would be nice tho lmao.

\- I'm pretty touch starve, so having some1 who is affectionate would be awesome and sweet!

\- In case u wonder y u think I ghost u, here are the reasons why:

\+ Reddit chat sucks, sometimes I receive no notifications at all.

\+ U prob send the msg, but it doesn't get to me and say ""Msg failed to send"".",2022-11-26 01:58:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1666624962,4,/r/lonely/comments/z4uy1z/18m_hi_everyone_would_u_like_to_be_friends_with/,,0,1,18M Hi everyone!

I have been lonely for so long now and I have a few internet friendships and they think I’m cool to talk to but in real I have no one (quite literally) to hang out with. I may be cursed because every time I think I make a friend, they move out of country or city so fast. It’s no longer a coincidence, that’s just the truth. Even though I have lovely people to talk on a phone call or chats but I can’t help but feel lonely because there is no one in person for me. I go out to watch theatre/ movies/ restaurants and markets alone and I feel sad when I see people in groups. And I think it’s because of me and my insecurities that I drive people away or I can’t maintain healthy friendships. Some days I’m ok being alone but other days I just cry because I have no friends. No long term friendships from school or college. Every time I try to hang out with someone they either move away to another country or city or they just refuse to hangout because they have their things and hey that’s great, I understand but after getting rejected for every plan i start feeling like it’s just something I must’ve done that they didn’t like.

5270,z4v4sx,cpotter51,"Last week, my brother passed away due to heart complications from a long history of drug use. It’s been extremely difficult on my entire family, especially my mother since he was her first child. Yesterday was my mothers birthday, so as you can imagine it was hard to see her go through that without him, as if the last week hasn’t been difficult enough for her. 

Anytime someone loses a loved one, people tend to message and say things such as “I’m here if you need me, I’m so sorry for your loss”, but it never feels genuine. It’s as if the people that have told me those words only did it because they wanted to feel good about themselves for reaching out. 6 or so people messaged me, and I haven’t spoken to any of them in months. Majority of them didn’t even know I had a brother. 

I also dated a girl for 3 years, and I tried my absolute hardest to make it work with her. We broke up 6-7 months ago, and not a day has went by that I haven’t thought of her, or went to her Facebook to see how she’s doing. She messaged me with her condolences once she heard about my brother. I saw a day later that she has a new boyfriend, someone whom she was friends with when I was dating her. The one person that knows me more than anyone, the one person who I feel like I need the most in my life, isn’t here for me at a time when I need it the most, and may possibly never be here for me again.

When my brother passed away it made me realize that not everything that a person wants to say can be said to someone before it’s too late. There was a 11 year age gap between me and him, so we weren’t as close as normal siblings. Hindsight is always 20/20, so of course there’s a lot I wish I could’ve told him before he passed away. So tonight I’m writing letters to my family and my ex-girlfriend in case there’s things I don’t get to tell them before my own time comes. This isn’t a self harm post, I’m not going to let my mother bury another child on my account. I don’t intend to harm myself. Maybe I can create some peace of mind currently by assuring there’s closure that myself and the ones I love will have in the future in case I never get to say how I feel for them.",2022-11-26 02:06:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1561538294,2,/r/lonely/comments/z4v4sx/writing_letters_tonight/,,0,1,Writing letters tonight

5302,z4wcoe,Bluffon,"I (19f) have been single for a year now. I got out of a tumultuous and emotionally exhausting relationship and took a year to rebuild my sense of self and inner peace. I've really enjoyed this year of solitude for the most part, of course there were nights where I was feeling lonely, but overall it's helped me grow and reflect a lot. 

I'm just now really starting to look for a relationship again. I'm on dating apps and actually have a date planned tomorrow. But I just feel... unfulfilled and empty. Which really sucks. I went on a date with this guy a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty fun, we had a lot in common and talked really well together. We were supposed to hang out again tonight, but I ended up cancelling because I just didn't feel a romantic connection with him. I wanted to, because he's pretty cute and fun to be around, but I don't want to jump into something that I'm only 50% into, because that wastes both of our time,

He was cool about me cancelling and explaining that I wasn't feeling a connection, but I still feel guilty. I know there's not really a reason to, we can't really control who we crush on and how hard we crush on them. I just want to find someone that I'm really into, because I've only been in one relationship like that. It was my first one too, and didn't last very long either. It's actually kind of sad that it was my most fulfilling relationship lol. I've crushed really hard on a few people this past year, but the people that I actually ""fall head over heels for"" never seem to notice me. I get too intimidated to talk to them, and convince myself that they're out of my league. It's a cycle. 

Idk sometimes it just feels like I'm not meant for relationships. I know in reality that it isn't true, but damn, it gets really discouraging sometimes. It's so corny, but I just want to be in love. I want the honeymoon stage and the puppy love because I've never had it before, I've only ever been in two relationships (the toxic one and the one that only lasted two weeks).

This is just a collection of thoughts, maybe I'll put a hot take in there. Idk yet.

***He doesn't remember***

When I was young I used to play on these really small Minecraft PE servers with random kids I didn't know in real life. It was really the only fun thing that I did. 

 I was bullied a lot in middle school before I learned to fight and had a growth spurt. My home life wasn't that easy either. I was always being screamed at for everything. Not putting my dish away or looking too sad or sitting on the couch too long would earn me a multi hour screaming session. 

 I really loved those little servers. I was a good builder so I would get mod perks and make houses for all the new people on the server to enjoy. I would roleplay as my own characters and spend time goofing around.

 I remember one of my online friends invited me to this new server ran by a large group of kids. I fell in love with it instantly! I met so many wonderful people. I was playing all I could. From 4pm to 2am every day. I was totally hooked on the little world I created. I finally felt like I belonged.

 I remember a few of them off the top of my head. Nate was the awkward friend who wanted to be the hero of the story so badly. Hibiki was his cool dragon half-brother.  Zylusshobbes was my Minecraft husband that I had many imaginary Minecraft children with. He was just a normal human scientist guy, but he was good natured and fun to be around. Then there was Femagaro. He was the last full dragon of his kind and we thought of each other as siblings.

  It's kind of cringe when I write about it now, but I enjoyed it so much as a kid that I didn't forget about  any of it.

 Eventually the server service that this group of kids were using stopped hosting PE servers and everything went down. I wasn't allowed to have any social media so I couldn't reach any of them. I kept their names in mind and I would occasionally search them up and see what they were doing.

 One by one, every lead I had on them disappeared. I had still thought of them all of the time. I honestly felt really upset. I didn't know why these feelings lingered on 5 years after it happened. It was just a simple Minecraft server after all. My brain's just wrong I guess.

 It wasn't until recently, but I found another lead on one of them. Femagaro was making music and posting on Reddit. I knew then I had to speak to him. The person that I once called my brother, even if just for a minute.

 He responded, but he didn't recognize me...

 I feel so wrong holding onto something like that for so long. I still think about it.

 If only he knew what it meant.

 He invited me to his D&amp;D group, but I declined. It felt like I was starting over. I blocked him so he couldn't see my stupid posts here.

&amp;#x200B;

***Update on Thanksgiving***

 I don't know if any of you are reading these, but just in case I'll put it here. Thanksgiving wasn't all too bad. It rained pretty hard so not a lot of the extended family was there. Added bonus: everyone decided to bring their dogs. There were 5 dogs and 8 people in total. I had a lot of distraction and nobody pried too much. Overall very successful.

 I read through half of Midnight Sun last night. Thinking of rereading it with Twilight at the same time so I can get both of their thoughts at once. I am liking Edward a lot better from his perspective. I tried some art today, but it it's not going so well. I couldn't find my paints. I think I left them at my ex's house so I just ended up drawing on the black paper. The light above my desk has been flickering and its annoying.

 I will do some more reading tonight, maybe try drawing on some normal paper. Anyways, thanks for reading. I hope you're having a good day.",2022-11-26 04:37:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667660359,4,/r/lonely/comments/z4y5ov/old_story_and_recent_thoughts/,,0,7,Old story and recent thoughts

5351,z515mm,coolyeah24,"It's ruining my life and making me so lonely. On the outside my life looks fine, I have a good job and a good family that cares about me. But I constantly overthink everything to the point where I can barely function like a normal person.

Big thing for me is thinking about time in general. I constantly overthink about how much time I have that I either can't or don't use. I hate having to work all day every day and then be too tired/depressed to do anything else in my free time. And even if I do have the energy I will still only do things by myself in my room.

I think about the past all the time and make myself depressed, by both regretting the mistakes and missing all the good times that don't exist anymore. I miss my old friends that I haven't seen or spoken too in years. I still miss my old girlfriend from like 8 years ago and think about her all the time.

I think about how old I am now and the realistic chance that I will only get more isolated and lonely over time. And I just hate getting older in general, it feels like my window of opportunity for literally everything just gets worse. And then I'll just continue to look worse and have worse health and have everything only get harder. I have so many things I want to do and achieve and experience but I'm really scared I'll never get to.

And I'm hardly around people but I can't even connect with the people in my own family I've known for years. Most of my friends up to this point have either drifted away or outright cut me out, and I just feel so out of place around the people I still have. I have no idea how to connect with them, their lives are just so different from mine.

And it's only worse around people that I don't already know. I always think that I just need to fix something in my life, like my weight or something else I'm self conscious about, or I just need to develop another skill or hobby to relate to people with. But part of me knows that won't really fix the real problem which is my own head.

I don't have any idea how to fix this problem. I don't even think it's fully my own fault because it seems like the world in general is getting more lonely, but that doesn't really make me feel any better. I just don't want to die alone and I'm really afraid it's not going to get better.",2022-11-26 07:17:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644688889,4,/r/lonely/comments/z515mm/cant_get_out_of_my_own_head/,,0,2,Can't get out of my own head

5354,z51oag,hiyarese,"What's up peeps. So a little about myself, I grew up in a chaotic home with a lot of mental illness at the core. I have had shit relationships from emotionally and mentally abusive to just straight up used and cheated on. I also have dealt with anxiety and depression since I was 16. When I was 24 I sat in my car having a break down and almost put a bullet in my head. Fast forward 6 years. I have recently been taken off my depression and anxiety meds, I am back in school and I'm getting paid the most I have ever been in my life. 
I don't know why I am lonely, I have friends and my family is supportive.  Ever since I was a kid I just wanted to have that special someone I guess. I learned a lot from my past relationships from ones I got fucked to the ones where I just wasn't emotionally available or commited. Maybe I'm just at an age where I want to start a family or some shit. Every once in a while I just feel so fucking lonely and I understand it's partly my fault. The sad part is, I think for now it would just be healthier to focus on my current goals of school before getting into a relationship.  That's what I would like to say and be all adult n shit. I just don't get what I want. Just crave that feeling of being with someone but at the same time I know I'm not in a position to commit to it yet.",2022-11-26 07:47:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595791348,2,/r/lonely/comments/z51oag/just_lonely_m30/,,0,1,Just lonely [m]30
5355,z51op0,Funbucket67,"This fear and distrust of women has been brewing inside of me over the past two years, and I need it to stop. I want with all of my heart to start a family, and become a father. That can’t happen until I learn to trust people with my heart again.

Now I’ve never been cheated on, but  twice I’ve been used by women who were in relationships without them telling me. Please don’t laugh when I say this has all been online, but it just has. Both times I met them in game, they thought I played well and added me for it. They started pretty much the same, but were a couple months apart; so for now I’ll tell the stories as one.

After I got added we’d play a few games together and get talking with each other. Good games and bad jokes lead to a friendship, then deep discussion brought us closer. All is well until after a week or two when alcohol gets involved. I don’t drink, but when they would, they’d start getting rather risqué. I don’t remember any specifics because I’m trying to forget about it all, but I guess you can imagine how things started to get more and more flirty. I was barely 18 at the time and I didn’t know any better, so I went along with it.

Since I was just going along with it, things escalated to them masterbating while on call with me. Looking back I guess they were just desperate for anyone that would give them attention, because they kept coming back for more. One wanted me to give her JOI (jerk off instructions) while she moaned into her microphone and the other had me download an app to control her vibrator with.

As things went on I began to notice some suspicious behaviors like deleting texts, or insisting that we speak on a different platform for no apparent reason. I was young and dumb, but I eventually caught on and was mortified. I cut things off but I couldn’t stop thinking about their poor partners, and how I was nothing but a tool to be used against them.

I felt so hurt and betrayed, especially the second time around. I told #2 about what happened with #1 and how badly I wished for it never to happen again. Apparently she took that as a challenge I guess… and I’ve never looked at a female the same way again. My confidence is through the floor and I find myself just avoiding women in general. I hate it, I want to be able to talk, and laugh with people again. I’ve developed crippling social anxiety and I just can’t speak with anyone. 

I wanna go back, back to who I used to be, back to talking to people, back to having feelings.

5361,z52orw,BeaverBearPaw,"We’re currently remodeling our kitchen and I (16M) keep telling myself that things will go back to normal once it’s over. The loud construction noises will stop, and I’ll finally live “normally” again now that Covid is mostly gone. But the more I think about it, the more I realize. It’s not going back. Times arrow neither stands still nor reverses. It only marches on. It’s just gonna get progressively worse like it has been. And it’s not because of power tools or a virus. It’s because the world is getting more and more shit as it goes on.

I am an antisocial, relatively unatractive guy, who mostly just plays video games all day. And I was fine with my life, and my few friends I really loved. Up until seventh grade, when I met my current best friend, who also introduced me to my other closest friend. He’s the kind of guy who everybody knows and loves. Fucking hilarious too. But the first day he invited me to eat lunch at the table with all of his friends, friends who knew me as the weird kid/annoying kid/kid who cried all the time. I certainly didn’t belong, but I loved it.

Fast forward to High school, I’ve lost touch with most of my middle school friends except the two I mentioned earlier. I still hang out with his friends at lunch, who have slowly become my friends. But I’m still the weird kid, and everybody who went to middle school with me still thinks of me as the crybaby I used to be. But my 2 close friends keep me anchored to where I am. Grasping on for dear life, hovering above a pit of losers, trying desperately to climb into the ledge of the cool people.

And even when I get a leg up on that ledge, like having my friends invite some girls over to my place, or them bringing me along to a party, I never stop being weird, or annoying, or quiet. Or, worst of all: invisible.

The feeling of invisibility is one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced. Nobody sees me in the hallways, I just have me earbuds in listening to music. Nobody notices or talks to me at parties, I just stand in the corner, to scared to talk to others, too ugly to be talked to.

The only girls I end up liking are the ones on top of the ledge, and I know it’s pretty shallow to not like and of the girls who aren’t very popular or are weird like me, but I just don’t, I don’t know how to explain it. And even if I did, getting a “weird” or “loser” girlfriend would be just the thing to pull me right off that cliff and fall into obscurity.

A girlfriend from the ledge is my ticket to the high life, a life filled with more than 5 friends (the amount I currently have) but the problem is, why would any girl on the ledge pick someone dangling? They would only go for someone on the ledge with them. And I can’t blame them for that, I would do the same.

The girl I like showed up the other day having dyed her hair black, wearing a leather jacket, and fingerless gloves with bones on them. Basically my kryptonite. But guess what? She’s dating some guy who plays sports. Someone on the ledge with her. And I guarantee if you asked her about me she would say one of two things: “who?” Or “oh, that weird and/or annoying guy from math class?”

What’s the point? Why dangle on the cliff any longer? Why not just fall into nothing? Just stop? Don’t interact with people from the pit or the ledge? But even if I wanted to, I never could. Something in my brain NEEDS me to get up on that ledge.

Well holy shit I wrote a novel, I’d be surprised if anyone actually made it down this far. I haven’t been able to get a therapist for a while, and self therapizing myself wasn’t working, and I needed somewhere to vent that wasn’t my own head.

5371,z54m80,Former_Wolverine4771,"Hi! So recently I've been hanging out a lot, more than I could ever recall in the past. Ive been going to watch movies and doing other stuff around town with a couple who are my friends. They are very nice with me for the most part and I have fun while with them, but recently its been getting very weird for me.

Sometimes I feel used by them and not in the friendly way, but in the free uber driver way. I sometimes feel like they just invite me to any activity they are going so that they can get easily there since I have a car available most of the time.

None of them look for me, most of the time its thanks to the context (clases, same study hours), me reaching them or them looking for ride.

And even if I was exagerating some of these things, there is also the fact that they are very intimate in front of anyone and of corse in front of me. They make me feel isolated at those moments.

But the worst part is that...
I think I may have started to have feelings for one of them thanks to getting closer to her. And it makes me feel so bad, and such a bad friend, because I dont know what I want. 

I feel I have to give them some space, to maybe mitigate these feelings, but then I'd feel lonely, as I was before. i dont know what to do

And so now I have all these feelings and again, dont know what to do. What do you think I should do?
Most likely next period I'll be gone for some time, so maybe I can think on these things.

But holidays are getting closer and with that other plans to hang out. What should I do?",2022-11-26 10:43:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608501170,1,/r/lonely/comments/z54m80/feeling_bad_and_lost/,,0,0,Feeling bad and lost

How I found this out is through the don’t text first experiment, what you do is don’t text anyone, don’t call or make any first approach’s and see who actually reaches out. After doing this I found no one for two months made any try to make any contact with me at all, 0 notifications and I say two months but that’s cause I ended the experience after two months in reality it could of gone on much longer, after this I really took a hard look at myself and realised I was the person putting my hand out, I was doing things for people but no one was doing anything for me I was always making sure people where okay, give people gifts and try to make people laugh the best I could. I find it funny the people I used to call friends would all take part in male suicide social media prevention stuff but when I’m over here taking my antidepressants, going to therapy and still I wanna kill myself none of my so called friends puts there hand out, none of them would take the leep to help me out of my self isolation, no one will message me even when they knew what I’m going through, no one cares, no one ever cared.",2022-11-26 12:02:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643554541,25,/r/lonely/comments/z55yb8/no_one_cares/,,0,3,No One Cares

5435,z5c6z0,TheRealMSol,"Thanksgiving is my favorite day of the year. At least, it’s supposed to be. This is the first year where my marriage is officially over. Honestly, it’s better than having her drinking to the point where my cousin and brother have to help me carry her to the car, or leave her behind altogether because she’s passed out. I’ve got custody of my beautiful daughter, and that matters more than anything else.

I’m struggling financially, I’m always needing help. I’m not in the best shape. I’m bald as a baby’s bottom. I’m a private person and don’t always know what to say to carry a conversation. This year I just felt like an absolute burden and loser. People were talking about trips and concerts and expensive home improvement projects. I have to watch my account each time I go to the grocery store. Everyone has shared stories with their spouses and because they actually text each other and make plans. I’m so consumed with costs and single parenting that I never have plans. I was always a homebody growing up and missed some of the experiences that are now shared stories and memories. Now, nearly 40, I’m just…there. People don’t know me, and it feels like they’d rather not and maybe I’d be better off not being in the way.

I’ve told myself I’d meet someone and have a second chance at life, but how? I have no time to go out and meet people, no one swipes right on me because I’m not conventionally attractive, and the fact is I have nothing to offer at an age when people are looking for more substance than just “a good heart.” Taking inventory of my life compared to those around me. I’m a failure and a bad joke. Wasted potential. If it wasn’t for my daughter I’d probably consider an easier way out. I’m alone, and that’s the bed I’ve slowly but deliberately made for myself over the past 40 years. Now I’ll just go on dreaming it will be different for the rest of my life, and it won’t be.",2022-11-26 16:59:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1516667697,1,/r/lonely/comments/z5c6z0/that_feeling_snuck_up_on_me_at_thanksgiving_and/,,0,0,That Feeling Snuck Up on Me at Thanksgiving and Won’t Leave

5466,z5f1zl,Impressive_Price9167,"Yesterday I posted a rant, I was venting, had a frustration and probably didn't word the whole thing carefully to get my point across. But some of you got some things correct, Most of you clearly don't have a clue. 
#1. I was not blaming anyone only the person I wrote about. The point I was trying to get across was how she turned out to be a user and screwed my life and happiness making choices that effected me financially and directly causing my current mental health. My financial status, my desirability to other women. I'm no longer attractive because I'm broke, homeless living in my car, physical and mental health is suffering and can't provide. And I m not rich.

 Well yes I made mistakes too.  First being a good hearted man. Second I put my trust in a person who appears to be a good person too, and then I'm human, I'm sorry for being a man and got horny. But she was the one who asked me if I wanted to said she was on birth control. However I Trusted in Safe Skin condoms big mistake it broke, She got pregnant, oops well I going to be a dad.
 That's ok because I like her, she's cute, good personality smart and going to be a teacher. I won't need to worry about my child not getting an education or other teachers getting away with changing his grades for some reason holding him back like I was. His mother would be in a position to prevent it. So I made a huge mistake by taking responsibility for this child and inviting her and her daughter in my heart, my life and my home. 
 Then trusting her after she makes a bad choice because I was away and had a human need and I was able to be there at the time. Im a forgiving soul another big mistake I should have not made.  So now the biggest mistake of all the one that really destroyed my life was continue to love my son enough to endure a horrible existence and continue to try to give him the best childhood and opportunities to be a better person than me.  

Here's the point I tried to express. 
Find a life partner, a forever friend with benefits, a soulmate whatever you want to call it is tough enough just finding. Some like me 55 years I have been searching unsuccessfully, I was once a man that was in great shape, healthy, had a since of humanity, humor, integrity, and a giving soul. Didn't get love from my family. So I have been searching.  but those days are over. It's impossible to find in a world of so much disgust and sadness. I will never make any of those mistakes again I have learned my lesson. In 55 years if I can't find love it's not for me to find. 

 And to all the women who are crying the blues that men are not good enough for them. All the good ones have been taken. Because most of the good ones have been taken used up and thrown out. The rest are the assholes your complaining about.  So if you really want a good man, look deeper through the anger and the rant. A good man is out but dealing with the issues caused by his last huge mistake.",2022-11-26 19:00:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659569953,0,/r/lonely/comments/z5f1zl/just_an_observation_of_the_people_who_think/,,0,12,just an observation of the people who think they're so Smart.

5470,z5fjo4,bestpw,"That’s my first time writing to this thread. How fucking great that there are communities like this one. So let me tell you a story about myself and see if you can relate. 

I don’t want to make a pity exchange here, let me know if you have had a similar situation and were able to improve it.

I am 21M, 6’4, and ever since I graduated school I’ve been deeply lonely. By deeply I mean I have 0 friends or any people I can call except my parents who live in a different country. I am a digital nomad and make good money that allows me to travel, been to 11 countries in 1,5 years. 

The thing is I feel inferior to all people around me and feel like I don’t believe that I can be loved or that anybody can be interested in me. I feel very different for some reason. I’ve never been interested in going out and drinking etc. I’ve always been doing my thing - as an example a YouTube channel with 300k subs. I’ve been with 12 girls in my life sexually but never had a girlfriend long term. I don’t believe I can do it, because I’m so different. People sense I am defective. 

And now I’m at the point when I don’t even smile and cannot have fun. Nothing is fun for me. Nothing gives me pleasure. So I still want a relationship but don’t even want anything sexually if I am being completely honest. 

I don’t understand the day to day life and don’t know how people live it. I don’t understand why they go out, what they do there and why they like it. I don’t understand what keeps people together as there always better options. I am so lonely that I almost cannot have a conversation now. I don’t find people interesting anymore and think now that everything they do is very low level. They want money yet don’t have it. I have money yet what allowes me to get it is my difference and people would never understand it. 

Fuck

Every country feels the same. People go out together and do something. I want to kill myself.",2022-11-26 19:21:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662835191,5,/r/lonely/comments/z5fjo4/am_i_different_if_so_how_can_i_fix_this/,,0,1,"Am I different? If so, how can I fix this?"

5505,z5iuaq,Kan660,"
Hi 
First I just want to apologize because I’m not sure if it’s insensitive to post of a breakup on this subreddit. Please let me know if it is so I can delete it 

TLDR: broken up with, boyfriend was only friend because of trust issues and social anxiety, going to college now, still don’t have anybody, really struggling w/ social anxiety and loneliness 

I have been dealing with being broken up with for five months. I have really bad social anxiety and I don’t trust people enough to let them into my life but me and my boyfriend just clicked 

My ex boyfriend and I were in contact 
On and off during these past five months. During this time we did a lot of processing about our relationship, as well as talking about our feelings about not being together anymore. He told me that he coped by hanging out with friends. Although I’m happy that he isn’t in the same situation I am, it makes me jealous that he has made other connections and I just. Can’t. 
 We haven’t been in contact for around three weeks, which sucks because now I’m back to having nobody. 

I’m 19, so when he had broke up with me it was a month after graduating from HS, it was a very lonely summer but I was hopeful that once I started attending classes I would meet a few people to be friends with, but unfortunately the fear of allowing people to be close to me didn’t go away (of course!) 

I have started to go to therapy. This isn’t my first time in therapy, so It’s not like I’m just beginning to process or uncover why I can’t let people into my life, I can just continue uncovering what has already been uncovered which is nice 

I have two weeks of courses left, and I haven’t made a connection with anyone. It’s just go to classes and go home. I wish I could just brush off my insecurities and let my walls down but I have a lot of stuff I need to work through before I begin to feel comfortable with people 

I know what the problem is, but fixing it is a process and not an immediate fix. I’ve been through hard things in my life and know that things do get better, but things are just so shitty right now. I don’t even want a boyfriend anymore. I just want someone who cares about me and we can hang out together and just talk.

5513,z5k51h,KnightsObvious,"I had a hookup this girl I met off tinder yesterday. It was the second time that we linked up, and for the better part of the last week, we've been sexting each other about all the things that we're going to do once together. In my mind I was fantasizing and visualising heavily but when the day actually came, I just ended up wanting to chill. We had sex but not that firery type that you come to expect with good hookups. I just felt like an empty vessel and the fact that there was no connection but that of a physical one between us made me feel depressed as we were spooning - because here I was in a very intimate and vulnerable spot with someone, yet neither of us were really into each other like that. Neither of us were present and neither was certainly attuned the other. It was uncomfortable and awakened somewhat of an existential crisis within me. I always a likened sex to an almost spiritual practise. 

It was weird. I've had this with every girl I've been with since my break up last November and it's getting worse. Whilst I think I get horny and so on, I think what I am really craving is real chemistry - real intimate moments with someone. My life right now is so devoid of that. To go from a real loving and enlightening relationship to this fuck fest carousel that is modern dating has been really unsatisfying. I don't know it's like I'm missing something.

There's so much in life that I just don't understand and something that I need to reevaluate is the relative importance of the concept of sex in my life. I've long used it as a bandaid to distract me from my very real and serious issues, I'm probably addicted to it and it needs to change because otherwise I'm going to be stuck in this cycle. I'm feeling so empty and miserable. Its like I'm drinking wine for sustenance but in actuality I need water to keep me property hydrated - yet even though I know I need to put the glass down, I shrug my shoulders and carry on as if the next sip will magically quench my thirst.

Does anyone else relate to any of this?",2022-11-26 22:39:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669500642,2,/r/lonely/comments/z5k51h/24m_uk_placing_expectations_on_the_value_of_sex/,,0,0,24M UK - Placing expectations on the value of sex

5519,z5keg8,ComfortableAuthor9,"Hi,

yesterday I went to this party and came to the depressing realisation that me and my personality just aren't fit for social interactions and connections. 

Small background on me. I mentioned I am 17, yet (unfortunately) far from the average 17-year-old guy. 

I’m soft for a guy, kind, caring for the people I love, rather self-aware and thus self-conscious, I know that I have my (psychological) issues but don’t try to hide them. Furthermore, I was diagnosed with Aspergers, which doesn’t really help with the social skills and all.

Throughout the party, the question of whether I am gay or not came up multiple times. 

I repeatedly said that I am practically gay, just without liking men. 

I’m quite confident in my sexuality, but also painfully aware of my “less-than-straight” quirks and habits.

Due to all of this I tend to get along better with girls than guys, so any friends I've had were all girls. 

Yesterday however it became obvious that whenever I was talking to someone just to try and make some friends I was merely being a second choice until they just went off to talk and/or make out with more macho frat-like guys. 

All of this has left me quite sad and have been wondering if I should just throw away who I am and emulate whatever other guys do, even though that's not who I am. 

All of this probably makes very little sense but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)",2022-11-26 22:50:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1580856667,1,/r/lonely/comments/z5keg8/my_personality_isnt_good_enough_17m/,,0,1,My personality isn't good enough 17M

Day 1 - We went to the mall, we started going into different stores, first store we went to Walmart and we went to the kids section to see some toys for her, then we went to Sephora and tested different perfumes I recommended her the Jo Malone sea salt perfume, she loved it and got compliments for it. Next we went to Apple Store and we were testing MacBook and then I put AirPods Max on her ears and she asked me to play Taylor shift songs, she enjoyed and was amazed by them. Then we went to food court and I got coffee but she refused to get coffee. We went time talking about cars and then some family stuff, she loves cars and enjoyed talking about them. 

Day 2 - in the university, I called her after her class, she came back with her best friends and more of her friends came to her and we sat there for 15mins and then went to cafeteria to get away from friends after going to cafeteria we went to the football ground in my university and I was holding hands of her all the time and we went to the sitting area and I let her stand there by holding her back and we kissed a few times and then she got call from a friend, so at this time, she was talking with her friend and I was holding her back and my head on her stomach and she was playing with my hair and after 30 mins, we went back and then she went to her friends and she left first to go back home and after one hour I did the same. 

Day 3 - I was flirting with her on Instagram and telling her how pretty she is and then she had to go to her job so told me she will talk later and after 4 hours or around 1 pm I got a message I need to talk to you and I said ok you can call me or we can meet tomorrow.

I’ve had friends, but most were online and never really asked about me or my life. The ones that were irl made me feel the worst I’ve ever felt and were incredibly toxic. I’ve never felt love, and the closest thing I had to a relationship has completely disintegrated. I have a couple friends now, and a handful that seem to care about me, but it’s still online and there’s still a huge disconnect. I never had a mentor, or an adult that cared about me outside of my parents.

I don’t talk about my hobbies much. I don’t have a “go-to” person to chat with when I’m down. I’m alone 90% of the day and still living with my parents. I lived alone in college and remember how alone I was every single day. 

It just hurts. It just feels like it’s my fault. I’ve tried to put myself out there and it hasn’t really changed much. I always told myself that “I’m okay with being alone”. But I’m 24 and my life has no direction. I don’t feel like I have people to lean on. And when I try to lean on someone, I just feel like a pest and that I’m dragging them down in some way.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to give up on the idea of having people in my life. I’ll live in a small house with a nice dog and resign to the fact that it will always be only me.

5605,z5rnih,Clol1l1l1,"I thought I was friends with everyone at work but they really aren't. I may talk and laugh with them but being friends is more complicated than that. They all have each others phone numbers and Instagram but I don't. Of course I could ask now but it wouldn't be the same as if I asked earlier. When they have parties I'm not invited. They have a group chat and I guess they must have ""forgotten"" to put me in it. I only say that to make myself feel better. I know better than to ask to be invited and included. I would have to be an idiot to think they really forgot to put me in their group chat. They don't like me that much and I just have to live with that. 

I'm just so tired of it though. Even in high school there were girls I was ""close"" with but we never hung out outside of clubs or school. I wouldn't question it. When I would hear my friends talk about what they did together I wouldn't care. But now I do because I know it's going to be harder than ever to make friends.

5607,z5rss4,itsokurokay,"I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to make friends in adulthood. I have never in my life been good at making friends. I have always been shy and awkward. I’ve always had difficulty fitting in and I never knew why exactly. With this being said, with school I had been forced to socialize and eventually found some form of friendship. Ever since graduating college and moving out of state though, I’ve had such a hard time making lasting connections. 

I am 26, queer, and possibly neurodivergent (waiting on diagnoses.) I have talked to plenty of people locally and online but it all seems to burn out within a few weeks if not sooner. I try my best to respond in timely manners and keep conversations interesting but I guess I just have a hard time keeping that going. OR the other person does not attempt to reach out or add to the convo. 

My job is not an opportunity to meet others because most of my coworkers are older and do not share similar interests. I also mostly work on my own so there’s not much opportunity for friendships. 

I have a partner who has loads of friends and I’m happy for him but it sometimes makes me feel lonely when I hear him hanging out with his friends online every night. It’s healthy and good to have friends outside of a relationship so I love knowing he has other support systems and means of connection. I just wish I had that as well. 

I have used bumble bff, discords, events, ect. Just never seems to work out. 

I try to focus on my wellbeing, mental health, physical health, hobbies, and I like hanging with myself but it would be nice to have a friend to be able to talk to and hang out with once in a while. I guess just wanted a place to let this out.",2022-11-27 04:42:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1586022238,6,/r/lonely/comments/z5rss4/making_friends_as_an_adult_is_hard/,,0,2,Making friends as an adult is hard.
5608,z5rtyq,MoreThanThis_,"My(30sM) entire life I've just felt like an outcast. Someone that's not wanted or needed by anyone. Like my previous friendships from school or from my job just came out of convenience and nothing else. I've had poor self-esteem my whole life, I would get teased, made fun of or bullied on and off over the course of my time in school. I had one friend but we stopped hanging for a few years, but at the start of highschool he would invite me over and we started hanging out again, which was nice but as soon as his friends would show up, they'd ignore me, tease or make fun of me for my weight, my depression etc. For a time that friend was particularly mean to me and to this day I haven't forgotten that and I never so much as got an apology from him, so I don't consider him much of a friend anymore, he shoots me a text like once a year and I just don't say much to him.  


My parents weren't particularly nice or supportive to me. I remember in HS my grades dropped big time because I was lonely and depressed and all I wanted to do was drop out and be a NEET because life was too hard for me. I had little to no friends, and I definitely did not have any luck with girls either, they just thought I was weird, creepy, ugly etc.  


Shortly after HS my folks and I moved out of state for work. Moved, I got a job, for a little bit I started hanging out with a coworker, I met his friends and...similar things happened from back home. I was mostly just ignored or dismissed entirely, one guy out of the group for whatever reason really didn't like me and was especially rude to me, and no one stood up for me at all. But I guess, why would they? I was some dipshit rando who they barely knew, they were also several years older and admittedly I still wasn't very mature in my late teens and early/mid 20s. Regardless, I stopped hanging out with them. Afterwards I tried to make friends and meet new people online instead, I ended up stumbling into this group of people on an anime forum and at first I thought that maybe these were my people, my tribe so to speak, but instead they were toxic and I was desperate to fit in, so I tried to like the things they liked; same anime, same music and I just felt like I had little identity. After a while, I fell hard for a girl in the group and it was obvious to everyone, and after a bit of hearing me out via venting or talking to them about my crush or my life, they were at first nice and supportive but after a time they started ignoring my messages or just flat out being annoyed and hostile towards me. They would start to make fun of me behind my back, I'd get excluded from their group watches, their Skype calls etc.  


After 2 and a half years of this, I burnt my bridges with them completely. Blocked most of them and never spoke to any of them again. Tried meeting new folk on that site and it just all kind of ended up never going anywhere, either I'd get tired of finding topics to talk about or they would be a woman and I'd try to latch onto them in hopes of maybe them being 'the one', which, looking back I'm sure some of the women I talked to noticed off the bat and probably were not okay with that. But I didn't have the awareness back then. Ended up moving on to Social Media, specifically Twitter. I met some great people on there, some I consider friends but I'm also not sure about that because I'm still very lonely and alone right now. Regardless, I met some nice people but I've dealt with some really awful people, some not so awful but I fucked things up anyway. After a while I just realize that my needs aren't being met so I just end burning bridges over something dumb or just move on and stop talking to them  


During all of this, I also tried to meet people via Discord servers in hopes of the same things(friendship, ideally romantic companionship as well) and it just hasn't panned out. They either end up being super fast paced servers where if you're not on there interacting 24/7 then you're ignored, or just straight up revealing themselves as toxic people. I've also noticed that a lot of these places are clique-y and are frequented by people that have been friends for years and I just have never been able to break in socially and sometimes I didn't bother because the convos were so fast paced that I could never hope to keep with them.  


Fast forward to nearly a decade later, now in my early 30s, and just as lonely and bitter and hurt as ever and now with some fresh trauma from the last several years to boot. I have no future, no hope, I'm still working my job that I've had all this time, I still live with my family because I can't afford to live on my own but also I have little to no life skills. Still no group of tight knit group of friends that I'm super close with, no girlfriend or wife, still no experience in dating and more or less still completely inept when it comes to sex outside of losing my virginity to a SW'r last month and it was awful and awkward, I might as well still be a virgin.   


My life feels empty and meaningless, the prime years of my life are gone, I wasted the last 10 years pursuing connections and intimacy with others that just didn't work out. At this rate I'm just going to die alone and lonely, but not before another 30+ years of loneliness, which is sometimes worse than death. It feels like the world has just been reminding me of what a loser I've always been. I'm supposed to somehow be happy and positive and upbeat all the time and as a guy I'm supposed to be confident no matter what and never show vulnerability, I'm supposed to be relaxed and cool when I've been desperate, anxious and depressed for the last 15 years of my life.  


I desperately crave intimacy in my life, emotionally and physically and crave deep connections with others and instead I'm just this broken, bitter sad man.",2022-11-27 04:44:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651005744,4,/r/lonely/comments/z5rtyq/i_resent_that_im_seen_as_needy_and_clingy_because/,,0,3,I resent that I'm seen as needy and clingy because I have emotional needs that have rarely ever been met.

One of my main issues is being alone. I remember sitting in my bed when my depression first started hitting me hard being all alone and imagining changing it. Since that night, I've made 0 good friends or anyone to talk to. I've reached out to all sorts of places and people to change the fact that I was lonely, but I'm just as lonely as then, if not more lonely because the amount of people who walk into my life and walked out. I want to be happy and not lonely, but it never seems to work out. I just want people to talk to about my personal life, but people who care. No matter how often I've given that to others, I don't get it myself. I never have someone to cry to when I'm down or come to when I'm happy, nobody to keep me occupied, nobody to keep me company. The worst thing? I'm just now really starting life. I've wanted to off myself for years and life has only started, I haven't even seen the thickest parts of life.

My eyes can't even begin to comprehend what you've been through. Yet here you are, YOU'VE MADE IT!

The strongest human! Despite everything that you've gone through, despite the odds against you, you are still here. And that makes you the strongest human there is!

I always feel lacking even after the hugs and I feel like it comes off as kind of pathetic(and I feel pathetic) to ask so much. It's like a desperation for relief. 

Anyways, someone wanted to set me up with a friend of hers. She'd talked to him about it too. Tbh I'm not exactly a beaut. We hung out in a group. I wasn't particularly into him but it was nice to interact with someone new and have a sense of playfulness to our interactions. Idk if he even liked me but he def made some comments that seemed like the door was open. 

We left at the same time and I told him I'm glad he turned out to be cute. I said I'm a hugger and we had a long hug that felt so comforting. Like it felt so nice it made me sad that it's been so long since I've felt that ease. He didn't say anything, he didn't pull away, he just let me hug him as long as I wanted. I'm kind of embarrassed I said out loud that I'm a sad human and that the hug was nice, my dumb ass asked for another hug a few sentences later and it was another long one. 

Again, not sure if he's actually into me but I'm open to getting to know him. Feeling the deprivation since and just how alone my body feels, not just my mind. 

Another hug like that and I might just start crying from how nice it feels... Prob not the way to land a guy I've barely met eh?",2022-11-27 08:07:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579471140,8,/r/lonely/comments/z5vhgc/hugged_a_guy_after_a_long_time/,,0,16,Hugged a guy after a long time

I 25F have not dated for a couple of years and I’ve started speaking to men again and it’s reminded me why I’ve chosen to stay single for most of my life. The men I seem to attract only care about my physical appearance and sex rather than getting to know me as a person. Even when I try to make an effort to get to know them they usually divert the conversation back to my appearance and sex. 

I want to be viewed as a human being with thoughts and feelings… Why do I struggle to find that with the men I date? I feel lonely, and I want to settle down and find someone to marry but I’m having no luck with dating men! 

I feel so lonely, I’m not alone. There are people around me, I get asked out on dates, I have friends and I live with family, and yet I feel so lonely. There’s no one I feel like I can confide in, share hopes and dreams with, love and to feel loved, someone who will hug me and tell me everything is going to be okay when I’m not okay.

To have someone to hold and know that im not alone. That there is someone here with me. The comfort of companionship. But here i am. Wrestling with my thoughts at 3 in the morning wishing i had someone i could talk to about the eyeless hurricane swirling in my head.

5656,z5wfl7,pomkombucha,"It’s literally all I’ve ever wanted, but every time I try to open up either I sabotage myself or the other person runs. I’ve been wondering if it’s something wrong with me that maybe I’m not seeing. All I’ve ever wanted was to take care of someone. I met this woman and we were friends for over a year before I realized how I felt about her, and at that time we’d already talked about moving to a country we both liked and continuously told each other we loved one another — which is very very difficult and rare for me to do. I don’t just tell people I love them unless I mean it with everything in me.

I’ve been there for her for months and have sent her texts maybe once weekly as she says she’s going through depression, that she’s loved and she’ll get through this and I’m always there for her. She tells me she appreciates my messages and she loves me, calls me her man, but then never asks how I am or even anything about me. 

This is the first person (I’m pansexual) I’ve ever felt like I could marry and have a life and maybe even children with. We had plans to move to a different country and I quite literally wanted to build her a house for us to live in. I’ve always been a very hopeless romantic but I have a lot of trauma so I’m very apprehensive about letting people in and now that I’ve let someone cross that, and they still don’t want me… yeah it feels terrible. I try to talk to my therapist about this but he doesn’t really have any advice except to move on, which I’m trying to do and I’ve stopped contact with her. But I feel so guilty, like I’m abandoning her in her time of need. 

More than anything I just want to love someone. I just want to support someone and hold them and make them breakfast in the morning, and have them know they have me and they’ll always have someone to fall back on and they’re safe and loved with me. I know it sounds like I’m probably just some NiceGuy™️ but I’m really not. I always give the people I care about their space and try to communicate as openly and transparently and fairly as I can. I have CPTSD so I know that’s always a barrier but I try to just deal with it on my own and tell all people if I can’t contribute properly to a convo because I’m triggered into a flashback.

Planning on going to college with a lot of financial help a year after I do. Only thing is, is that I got kicked out not to long after my first post. Sometime in June. I got a job a day after and a place to stay for 150 a month rent for a small and cozy room with a close friend that saved me from ending it the day I got kicked out. Everything has been going fine and I've kept my job making about 200 to 400 dollars a pay. Not the best but cozy. Anyways Thanksgiving sucked. I live with a place of 5 (including me) and I saw all of them leave and go with family to celebrate. I'm the only one out of anyone I know who didn't go with anyone. I just stayed home and played the new MW2. I didn't get invited anywhere. Got all the secondary to platinum though lol. I still smoke Marijuana but not to much.

5676,z6046j,Pretty-Broken93,"I don’t know where to begin. A few years ago I told myself that I was never going to be with anyone again and decided that I was perfectly okay with that. I’d been in a relationship almost consistently since I was 14 (now 32). Most were 3-6 years long. Once I was engaged. After my last relationship ended in 2018, I was really unwell mentally and physically, a “friend” r***d me. That was pretty much it for me. I’d endured every other form of abuse growing up and sex was the only thing that didn’t feel horrible and that I really enjoyed but now even that felt bad. I hated that person and still do. I feel like I’d lost all trust in men and would never be the same. But I feel so lonely sometimes I wish I could figure out how to move forward. I do want a relationship. Not with anyone, I’m extremely introverted and picky but if I meet someone I think I’d want to try again... although I’m worried about sabotaging myself. My father was extremely abusive growing up and I have a hard time of discerning if someone is trustworthy or not I think this has caused me many problems in whom I’ve dated and also in maintaining relationships. Sometimes I think I just shouldn’t be in one. At the same time I’m extremely sweet and caring and I just want to make someone feel good. I don’t ask for much back but I do want to be cared about as well. Am I a hopeless romantic, stupid, broken? Not sure what’s going on in my head. Not sure I should be trying to find someone to be with or not if there’s something wrong with me. I’ve also never really been one to ‘look’ for a relationship because that seems desperate but I am lonely, especially lately. Normally I’d ignore it and the feeling would pass quickly but it just keeps nagging at me.",2022-11-27 12:31:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1669160784,2,/r/lonely/comments/z6046j/big_sigh_restless/,,0,1,Big sigh... restless

I’m 17. I don’t know how the cards might fall in the future, but in this uncertainty lies the true discovery of myself I guess.

All I need is touch. Just touch. Long, deep touch. That’s it.

I hope at least here there’s someone reading this who would feel the warmth of these soulless, meaningless thoughts, which are written by some random 17 year old, whose mother tongue isn’t even English.

5736,z65tyx,fobruh,"I'm M 21 years old. Never kissed anyone, never had sex. I'm personally not desperate for any of those things, but socially I feel like I've been lagging behind for way too long. What I am desperate for is having the balls to go out on a date. I've had self esteem issues all my life, but through therapy I've managed to understand myself better and recognise my behavioural patterns. Thing is, I seem to have developed a huge mental block when it comes to any sort of social relationship. It's very tough for me to make new friends and it's even harder to approach women. I get incredibly anxious. This has been going on for years. The only place I've ever really connected with girls has been online. I've had two online relationships and those were the most amazing experiences ever, but it always fell short because of the distance and all that. I think I can confidently say I've experienced love. But I want to translate all that into the real world. And I can't. It's been so long. I'm so tired. I try, I really try to get better but everytime I get that slight bit of motivation it falls apart fast. 
I have a friend group and I'm close with them, I don't think I'm worthless, or that no one would want to be with me cus people have wanted that. I have some issues with my physical appearance but I've worked most of those problems out. I'm just stuck. That's the word. Stuck. So stuck that I've resorted to making this post.

I'm in a ldr so my partner isn't living with me at the moment and it will be so until we figure it out, that's the plan tho.

Recently, my loneliness has gotten worse and every attempt I've made at making a friend or more, something always comes up that stops us from talking. Im a decent looking guy I like to think and I'm very fun to talk to. Plus, every person who has walked out of my life has always said that I treated them the way nobody has before (in a good way, I can't type the sentence to sound like such) but yet they still leave. The worst part is some of them feel bad and come back just to do it over again or make me realize that all these people I've talked to and Im still lonely. I can't even enjoy a perfect day in my eyes without my mood being ruined by my lack of company. Life is pretty bad overall, there's just a lot that goes into it.

5767,z6almo,dark99soldier,"I am in my early 20s but I have been an isolated loner my whole life and I still am and it is making me so miserable. I struggle with Asperger's syndrome that I have had since I was born, and mental illness runs in my family. My father suffers from a range of mental disorders including sociopathy, which makes him excellent at covering up his mental illness from everyone especially my own mother. She didn't know mental illness ran in his side of the family and when I was born those same issues were passed down to me and I feel like it's a life curse.

I never had a strong family and friend connection growing up and all through elementary and high school I was a weird loner, and I didn't know what was wrong with myself and why I could never form bonds or friendships with other people. Now I am struggling so much in life because it's so hard for me to manage anything I do or get involved in and I am realizing the hard way the results of the way I grew up and lived for all my young life being isolated and never being able to connect with other people.

Now when I want to try and make new friends and put myself out there, I always feel socially awkward, and that people feel something is wrong with me. Even in a group setting I feel self-conscious about being the weird one in the group. I am paranoid about my facial expressions around other people because I am so used to not smiling at people all my life that it doesn't come naturally to me. I find myself lately lusting for a romantic female companion, but I struggle to know if it's what I really want in life or if it's just something to help ease my pain.

Now I struggle to even be around other people around my age because it makes me so jealous and angry seeing them being able to hold conversations so easily and have great friend communities while I am lagging behind them in life and struggling just to even say something. I feel especially hopeless with girls because even though I think I am decent looking, my personality is just so boring and dull in order to be considered boyfriend material. As a young adult now that I need these critical people skills, I don't have them and it's making me miss out.

I feel like I can never accomplish anything more than just being an acquaintance to someone because I struggle to get anyone to even acknowledge my presence and enjoy my company. Every time I hear about someone's accomplishments and the things they did I feel a deep sense of despair within myself because I feel as though I can't ever accomplish anything they can. I don't even know what to do, my life just seems to suck so much compared to other people and rarely do I even feel moments of genuine happiness or accomplishment.

5772,z6b4xo,Huge_Raise3293," Ive have been rotting for years because of this, so i just need to vent though this cannot be properly translated into a coherent understanding to anyone unfamiliar with the situation.  
Eric i will never understand why you decided to dement my social presence as your friend, we never met in real life and you have never seen my face, but my perception was that our friendhip was something special. For years we talked to eachother and bonded, its superficial nonsense but we had so much fun every time we could, we were just teenagers but i thought we both had the maturity to become closer because of it, and stick togheter.  
I never cut contact to you, every month or so i ask you something even though you havent responded in 2 years, i still think so much of you when my imagination wanders to my favourite moments from when i was 11-14 years old. Those moments matter even more to me now when im more lonely than ever. I hurt because of this because i trusted you and consiered you close, i cannot even believe that this whole time you never shared the same sentiment about me, why then would we have been ""friends"" for so long.  
I never fully knew you truely but i valued you so much and you still hold quality for what you made me feel at the time. This feels like betrayl to me, i feel both hate and longing for you, i can maybe forgive you though i doubt i will, you hurt me Eric and you will never see this but i want to throw this into the conscious void so the misery may echo back to you.

In the beginning of the summer I met a girl named A and she was fantastic and we hit it off so well and we vibed, I found the LOML. She lives a state away but living on the border of the two states it wasn’t outrageous to make it work until her psycho ex found out. She moved out of his house and in with me but within a week he weaponized his kids and convinced her to come back, I never heard from her again until 10/26/22 at 9:11 pm she texted me I’m so sorry I still love you.

Cue my question, I need a new phone. I’m going to a Walmart Friday to get a new one. If I buy it in that state and a new SIM card for my old phone, what determines the number for that new SIM card?

5875,z6ly9u,Gondal90,"I’ll try my best to explain this. There are some people in this world who are weird and/or live an irrational lifestyle with erroneous views and beliefs. One example is someone who grew up in a deeply religious environment. This person developed many irrational, erroneous, and conservative views that they truly believe are correct. 

These kinds of views this person has may be a turn off to certain people. Some people may view this person as weird or stupid. They may not want to be around this person and as a result this person may be socially isolated. 

The kinds of things this person believes are this:  (thinks men should dominate women, has erroneous religious beliefs, is arrogant and thinks he is right, refuses to listen to different/contradictory views, etc.)

Now, I was wondering if perhaps I too am deluded, weird, or abnormal in some way and I don’t even realize it. Perhaps this could have something to do with my social failure? My experience and knowledge is limited. I don’t know everything. So there’s a chance I might be doing something wrong but not realizing it.

 I do, however, try my best to be open minded and accept that I do not know everything and I fully realize that I could be wrong about stuff. Which is why I always listen to opposing views and then think critically about it instead of automatically dismissing opposing views. But, how am I supposed to know if I do something wrong?

5885,z6mh4y,verylikelydepressed,"I've been in this particular stint of therapy since July now, and although it's definitely helped in some ways, I still can't shake the overwhelming loneliness. It's always there in the pit of my stomach making me feel physically nauseous. Most days it's the only thing I can actually feel. 

I know logically that I do a lot of this to myself, I have a lot of issues with not wanting to be perceived. I can't stand being on camera or photographed, I have a limited social presence, I've been described as cagey about sharing information about myself. I am fully aware that I purposefully make myself emotionally unavailable. But I can't help it, the thought of letting people in fills me with so much anxiety and dread, to the point of having debilitating panic attacks. 

I don't know what it is, maybe it's a coping mechanism? People can't hurt me and leave if I don't let them in in the first place, people can't judge me for my looks, character, or experiences if I don't give them anything to judge. I know logically that it's an unhealthy way of thinking that has negatively impacted a lot of my relationships in life, but emotionally I can't let go of it. I don't even think I exist, how can I let other people have more of a notion of me than I do myself? 

I jokingly have this online presence of being a nebulous void. People find it an amusing novelty at first, or view it as some sort of challenge to get me to open up. When it becomes clear that it is an actual issue for me, they get upset or angry. I really can't blame them, it must be incredibly frustrating. Some people have tried to let me go at my own pace and I truly thank them for it, but my own pace is almost non-existent and it hurts to subject people to that. It would be easier to just be left alone. 

Some days are better than others. I can actually bring myself to socially interact and let myself have an impact. But I have this awful habit of isolating when things get bad. Until recently I always thought it was random, but thinking about it more, I'm becoming more aware of it being when I struggle to even see myself as a person, let alone something that is worthy enough to be around others.

i know someone will probably tell me to go back on the SSRI but i feel like a person for the first time in the three years since i started. my psych is being sort of negligent because he said he would switch me to a SNRI but he didn’t send it to the pharmacy and normally i would follow up but i haven’t. mostly because i want to be a person for a little bit until someone forces me back on the meds. i just really fucking hate my life and being on the meds in general. i have truly never been happy, issues at home etc, the meds just helped me eat 3x a day and clean my house and be better at my job. still felt like shit the whole time tho",2022-11-28 04:40:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639598841,1,/r/lonely/comments/z6my0v/not_sure_how_to_fix_myself/,,0,0,not sure how to fix myself

Away, the stink of booze lingering.

I want to run, but there he is

Always around the corner, watching me.

Can I escape him? This fiery apparition

This constant distress and judgement?

Thoughts swirl like locusts landing

Feeding on what is left of my conscious

I see him when I least want to

This dark vision of mine, 

In the fields late at night

Behind the door of my bedroom

Most of all I see him when I am numb

When slaps feel like distant thuds 

And he shakes his head,

Never satisfied, never happy

Sometimes I just grab my jacket

Run outside, trying to get away

From the disappointment that follows

Creeping on my neck like goosebumps

Is it possible to escape Me?

This broken down contraption 

That stalks behind, a void of dark?

The Me that always seems to take comfort

In a lightless room, a cave that echoes

Back insults, the Me I cannot escape?",2022-11-28 05:33:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1539540294,5,/r/lonely/comments/z6nzos/my_mind/,,0,6,My Mind

5917,z6oub1,Affectionate_Hat494,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos. It's not that I wanted to talk to him, but sometimes, you like to admire someone from afar.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up a little bit. I only had like 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few minutes/hours later, my TikTok views on my videos would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter, too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character.

I can't remember what brought it up, but he started stroking my hair. We sat close to each other, our legs touching. I wanted to get closer but I'm afraid that maybe he wouldn't like that.

5942,z6rwd6,SpiritualScience319,"I'm 36F and more and more of my friends are getting married, buying houses, having kids. I've had a handful of shitty relationships and only in the last couple of years started to understand my childhood and how hard it's made it for me to form intimate relationships with people. My family is small and I'm not close with them - trying to bridge that has typically resulted in retraumatizing interactions. It's the holidays. I feel like I do like myself in a lot of ways and sometimes love myself, but I feel so hopeless and feel increasingly panicked how I found myself here. It also feels so unfair. I just don't understand how everyone around me has this part of life and I don't. I intellectually understand how relationships are not meritocracies, but I am having a hard time not ruminating about the fact that despite being kind, smart, pretty, funny, successful, I don't have love or a fulfilling personal life. And then it makes me feel like that must mean there is something much deeper wrong with me. I feel like my ability to cope with it has been waning and the painful periods are increasing, and my supports are dwindling because everyone ultimately puts their own romantic relationships and nuclear families first. I spent a lot of the last few days crying, and it felt cathartic for the most part and like I was getting at something, but then tonight I just spiraled. I really need some home.

Edit: I finally passed out last night and woke up to many kind messages. I have to go to work soon but just wanted to say for right now that I really appreciate it. &lt;3 ",2022-11-28 09:16:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646786097,122,/r/lonely/comments/z6rwd6/feel_like_i_cant_handle_this_anymore/,,0,32,Feel like I can't handle this anymore

It was nice in a way, there was always somebody around. After that I moved to a student dorm and I lived there for 5 years. It was nice, always somebody in the hallways, somebody always having a party, noices outside of the dorm, there was always some kind of motion. Even though I lived with another person in the room, I actually liked it as there was always somebody around..now I moved in alone to a flat in a residential part of the city, and the loneliness hit me hard. I don't have a girlfriend, I have friends but they are all scattered around in different parts of the city. I'm struggling with the fact that this apartment will be only me and me alone in it 😞.

5956,z6uma8,SpiritualPants,"TL;DR: Was at a corporate event, had fun and realised how much I actually crave company that I do not have.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at my companys christmas party this saturday. We went to play bowling and I decided to attend so I could socialise for once at least. If it would become too boring or overwhelming, at least I would take some free food. We pulled lots to see who plays in which team. Well, we were 5 people in our team: Me, my supervisor that I'm a bit scared of, some guy from another department I have never seen, one fairly new cowoker and a former supervisor that I'm on good terms with. I thought this would be a quiet and uneventful evening.

That new coworker? Rarely I have ever seen someone so cheerful. That cheerfulness somehow immediately infected me and I let loose. I cheered, roared, yelled, made funny gestures and remarks whenever we did good or bad, high fived and hugged each other. I even high fived that scary supervisor and I didn't even drink anything at that point! 

As the night went on, I decided to stay and, have a few drinks and talk to the others. Getting to know the others and tell a bit about myself was very refreshing and I had a very fun night. Honestly, I could do this every weekend.

Now I'm back at work. Everything is back to normal. All this made me realise how much I yearn for some company, for friends and to go out a bit. But I lack friends, I lack courage and I lack social skills.

&amp;#x200B;

5969,z6x52p,[deleted],"Idk about y’all but lately for the past I’d say 6 months I’ve been saying to myself why does no one want to date me why does no one find me a attractive I have a nice personality that people like a gravitate towards but never seen as a romantic option. I was honestly kinda acting like an incel thinking oh girls don’t like the good guys oh guys are to high and mighty for me whatever. But today I woke up and realized why would anyone want to date me I am at probably the lowest mentally and physically I’ve ever been, overweight, don’t take good care of myself, yk how it goes. Today is gonna change. I’m going to take care of myself and just be a better person. I’m going to get back into shape and learn to love myself. maybe that’ll help me find someone hopefully. 


Summary: was kind of an incel, woke up this morning realizing I’m fat and gross, going to improve myself instead of complaining. Hopefully will make me a romantic option for people, if not I’ll be better physically and mentally and find myself enough and feel contempt. 

I believe everyone can change too. It’s alot easier said then done but I just want people to know that you can always improve and that’s not a bad thing don’t get stuck in your own comfort.

It never helps being in a room of those who are able to help, yet they refuse.

The truth is simple. As are those who won't help.

Help is not their goal. If it were, we'd all be well by now.

I can see through this place and others like it. Nuance is something they forget. 

They are afraid themselves. This makes it hard for them to commit.

You may be alone, but in a world as cruel as this, friends can be the only difference between life and death.

It makes me so sad that we are in this situation. All the numbers on men's health are depressingly bad. I just feel like I'm in a prisoned mind and no emotion seeps out. I'm lost as to who I am, how I should act, what is excpected of me and how I can deal with the hurt.

I guess all I wanted to say is that I know that a lot of us are in this situation. I'm sure that if we had a very wide test on men's health, we'd see that the phenomenon is bigger than we actually know.

In this context, I want you guys to know that no matter how hard it is, don't let hate and anger and resentment fester against others.  

The best we can do is try to fix what is broken inside us, love ourselves and love others instead of fuelling the growing hate that some people hold against one an other.

Wether it be the incel community that hate women or the extreme feminists that hate men, these are examples of how hate fuels more hate. And hating these people or dismissing them is not the answer either. No one gets to that point without having been deeply broken or misled. 

Our loneliness as men and our hurt aren't anyone elses fault, the world we live in isn't condusive to anyone being sane. The ones that are generally blind themselves. Maybe they're right, I have no idea.

All I know is that my issues however hard they may be, can be fixed with purpose. 

I hope you all are holding up tight and that we all will find our peace.

5995,z7162t,m3tz0,"25M feeling like I've got no friends.

Don't get me wrong I do have friends. But when we live miles apart , when our schedules are night and day ( quite literally ) , when reading and responding to texts takes anywhere from a few hours to days , I am left thinking. Is this what friendship is really like?

I know it's immature to compare our adult lives with our childhoods but literally a couple years back we would game , we would drink , we'd do sports we'd go on trips and now everyone is so static. Nobody ever moves nobody ever is spontaneous and exciting.

One F friend is hooking up with somebody and I haven't heard from her in 3 days. It's not even I wanted to have a decent convo , just like you know , some small talk to get through the day.

A M friend  is in a dark place. He lost his father very recently and he is trying to cope with many things. On one hand I should not be feeling disappointed but on the other hand I can't be literally tagging him 24/7. I can't always be the initiator.

Another M friend , lives in his own bubble. Almost zero middle ground to speak off.

Two M friends in different parts of the country.

And one M friend , probably the best one out of the lot , in another freaking continent. With his family and all.

But let's be real , even if they came here , would I honestly feel some real connection to them?

I invited around 8 people plus some of their SOs or friends or whatever. Say 12 people in total for a new year's eve dinner at my house. I am a cook so they know they'll eat well and they know I'll provide them with some insane fun. But I am having second thoughts for me. I think I ain't gonna feel much at all.

As for a girlfriend , I am working on improving myself , I am not selfish enough to enter a relationship while being in a wrong state of mind. At 25 years old ( almost 26 ) I want to find the one. I want my next to be my last. And so I owe it to the both of us to be on my prime.

Still , that doesn't mean loneliness punches me any softer.

I am curious to hear if anyone else is feeling abandoned and isolated. Always have to be the initiatior. And then even if I am not and someone goes out of the way to invite me to do something , it feels like there is no real connection. It feels like we aren't even on the same band. Much less on the same frequency.

Talk to me will ya? Going for a workout now , but I'll read them later.

6013,z73q9v,TheQuestToBe,"If I died today, there would be plenty of friends and family at the funeral, but exactly zero of them would be able to talk about me, or say that they knew me well.

I seem to have an easy time making friends. I guess im outgoing and good at putting on a fake smile and fake laughing and faking a good time. Or rather, I cant seem to remove my fake happiness anymore. People see me as enthusiastic and passionate, and boom we're friends, but just shallow friends, the sort of friend you invite to get-togethers and parties to bulk up the number of people there and up the  mood and fun. But never the sort of friend you confide in one on one. Its been so long since I've been of any value to another person. 

Sometimes, the fun times play tricks on me and make me think I'm fine, but im not. I'm crumbling inside, im failing at everything, i have no money and no job, and I'm so scared for my future and so ashamed of having turned out this way.

I so desperately want to talk to someone about my struggles, but i cant seem to be able to do it. Even with my psychiatrist and psychologist (both of whom i wont be able to afford soon) i cant seem able to stop pretending I'm in a jolly mood and i cant talk about all my suicide attempts, my self cutting, my failure to bring myself to eat for multiple days in a row sometimes, not sleeping at all for days, then sleeping through a whole day, and all these other stuff a mental health expert really ought to know. Let alone smaller stuff like the fact that im anxious and lonely. Instead i talk about my hopes and dreams enthusiastically and say i really hope i can get myself together so i can achieve all these things im ""so passionate about"". why do i do that? maybe i just don't have the guts to show myself, but i desperately want someone to see.

And every time i make a new friend, or every time i see an old friend again, i tell myself this is the chance to develop this friendship into a deeper one. don't let this become another of these shallow ones where there seems to be unspoken rule to just talk about light, fun stuff and that I'm not the one to turn to to talk about deeper stuff. But i never manage to do it. I don't want to talk about this stuff with psychologists, i want to talk about it with a friend, an actual friend that shares their own stuff with me too, and we know we can count on each other. But i never manage to get past fun banter, and every time i fail, i grow a little colder, and it becomes harder to not believe that I'm simply incapable of emotional connection.",2022-11-28 18:12:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628287394,1,/r/lonely/comments/z73q9v/ive_a_bunch_of_friends_and_not_a_single_one_know/,,0,3,I've a bunch of friends and not a single one know what I'm going through or that I'm in pain

6015,z73s89,PoohPoohBrains,"Hey there is dont know whether this is actually allowed here but i will give it a try. I used to battle with suicidal thought a lot and i did not have the option to go to a therapist. So i tried to find something myself. What has helped me a lot are a lot of different YouTube channels where there are inspirational people (at least in my opinion) that have helped me tremendously. I dont know your situation and i cant say this is going to help. But it has helped me a lot and maybe it can help you to. 

And if you immediately think this will not work for me, be aware that it is a thought blocking you from healing. I cant make any promises to anyone but if you feel stuck you can give these videos a try and maybe it will help. 

First i have a list with people who have given me interesting ideas to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts.

1. Gabor Mate ( he is a Jewish Hungarian doctor who is specialised in trauma and ADHD)
2. Sadhguru (he is an Indian mystic who most people would describe as spiritual) 
3. Alan Watts (an English filosopher who i think only his voice can make you happy)
4. Alom Konajia (a Harvard psychiatrist) 
5. Jordan Peterson (clinical psychologist) 
6. Ram Dass (a spiritual person with a lot of life lessons to share)
7. Wim Hof (the ice man who can explain the importance of breathing and how much it effects your psychological and emotional wellbeing) 
8. Jim Rohn (an old American scholar who can tell you about life)

If you search these people online and at something like depression you can find so many things that might help. 

In the words of these people i have found so much help and i would not have been able to find my way without them and i am grateful for them. Below there are also a few YouTube channels that i have found wisdom in. 

1. https://youtube.com/@betterideas he makes videos about life i can really relate to 
 
2. https://youtube.com/@AfterSkool this is a channel where they make videos of a lot of different people who i think have really profound ideas. 

3. https://youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG this is the channel of Alom Kanojia. He is a Harvard psychiatrist and gives a lot of insight in psychology. 

4. https://youtu.be/TOtg7daPueg this is a channel that goes a lot into meditation and other exercises. 

5. https://youtube.com/@hubermanlab this is a channel of a professor at Stanford who teaches about the brain and the body. 

6. https://youtube.com/@yourmatetom this is a guy from Australia who does a lot of psychedelics and shares his journey. Even if you dont want or never have used them i think you can learn a lot from his stories. 

These are just a few. The internet can be a beautiful place if you know where to search. There are so many things that can help you and sometimes all we need is a little help. I know i dont know you and it might sound unbelievable but i really hope you can improve your life and live a fullfilling and wonderful live. Because i believe that if Everybody found there happiness the world can reach a beauty you cannot imagine. Good luck on your journey and if you try this and i does not work then thats okay because this is just a tip of the iceberg. 

Oh yeah and if you know other channels or inspirational people feel free to share them in the comments so when can all learn from each other. 

Kind regards and good luck on you journey",2022-11-28 18:14:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1560696505,2,/r/lonely/comments/z73s89/i_dont_know_if_this_is_allowed_so_i_amsorry_if_it/,,0,0,I dont know if this is allowed so i amsorry if it is not

6030,z77elt,StarvingForAnything,"A bad joke.

This is going to sound really dumb, I don\`t really know if this is the right sub for this, but I need to say it somewhere. 

I\`ve not felt a touch of another person in a very long time, even my own family, maybe a year and a half passed since my last hug.  Naturally for this subreddit, I\`m really shy and struggle to make friends, but when I do make friends, I can never let go of them, and I probably seem like a weirdo. But recently, I played a game called VR Chat, and it\`s really helped me overcome some of these anxieties and fears, in the virtual world I\`m not ugly, people don\`t make fun of me and I have friends. But one of these friends, they\`re very nice to me, and whenever I see them online, I get really fuzzy inside and happy, and sometimes went by since I met him, and well.. I think I fell in love with him.

Someone I don\`t even know.

Someone who I\`ve never seen before.

Thats how clingy and touch depraved I\`ve become. It\`s hilarious, but I think I generally do. Of course, as per VR Chat nature, he\`s kind of gay, and joking does **stuff** and lets me sleep on his lap. I\`m not asking for help to get date him, but more of help to fix me, at least something to make me less pathetic and useless. I\`ve thought about suicide before, but I don\`t think I\`m brave enough yet. Not like anyone would care, though.

Have you ever felt alone and misunderstood by society, friends, or even your own family?
Maybe you were in a peculiar situation with people, you haven't got the promotion despite of your effort, or you are standing all alone with your inner problems and desires?
When this speaks to you, this is the right booklet to give you guidance in a world, which becomes more and more wicked.

I have gone through many hardships in life and one of the most important things I acknowledge is to know how to deal with certain people, they may be good or evil.
You will get an essential foundation of how to avoid many bad mistakes, circumstances, and traps other people might not know about.

6037,z784lp,desanite,"  My best friend died in April and like i spent most of my time with him and like now i got nothing. He was about as good as they get, kind, caring and easy to talk to and just talk about important stuff.  He was always around, our schedules were very similar.  I used to play this video game called Hunt Showdown with him all the time and stream it with him.  Pretty much playing that game and talking to him and streaming with him was about the only thing that I loved in life anymore.  Slowly I feel like I've lost the love for playing that game cuz, just about everyone I play with. They just take it too seriously or just get toxic.  Towards me, my friends or just bring the mood down and i disassociate and just ruins the night.
  His death was a weird one.  He OD'd over discord one night after we got off and was left on voice for days until his brother did a wellness check.  It wasn't out of the ordinary he'd do that, he'd forget and go to work or something, absence minded i guess.  I used to leave him in the chat and like drag his afk self to other channels, it was funny when he'd finally come back.  I guess when i think on it, it was probably the drugs. I used to joke that I was dragging his corpse around, I guess in the end I was.
I've tried to move past it and it's hard, i haven't met anyone like him since.   I can't seem to hold onto any short of friendship or relationship, it starts off good and then they start ghosting or slowly not caring.  Or just i don't mess well with their personalities.  I feel weird asking them if i did something or like what's up, because i feel like im too sensitive or something.  But for the most part, i don't have a single person to talk to about really anything in life.  
  I missed out on a childhood friend, because my dad locked us inside till i was 15.  He abused us physically and mentally, my mom included.  Killed our pets, made us kill them when they were sick.  He homeschooled us illegally.  He was paranoid schizophrenic, who thought the govt would brain wash us.  He got in trouble with the law almost, when govt found out when divorce time came.  I hardly had any social life outside my parents and siblings  It's weird because people will sometimes tell me that I'm a breath of fresh air or like I'm different than a lot of people.  Then just at some point it just gets weird or awkward and I just don't know how to continue or move things deeper. 
  I feel like I've tried everything, whether it's coming on strong, in the middle or care free.  At this point I've kind of just given up on making friends or I feel hopeless on starting a relationship again.
  Outside of that I feel like my life is falling apart, I've had so much bad luck in the last year, it's really one thing after another and I can't get a break.  On top of that, I feel like my body is starting to fail me.  It makes it hard for me to even work, and besides that work has been really tough since COVID and having to work extra hard is put a lot of strain on my mind and body.  I had to cut back my hours too, for my mental health, but I really need to work more to pay bills and to pay all my recent emergency bills.
  Right now I'm working on finishing high school since I had to drop out a long time ago. I'm on a self-paced course to finish that but between my depression and work being so toxic and so hard for me to work on it .  I'm trying to give myself to the end of the year to finish it because I can't do this much more . When my dad kicked me out at 17.  I was homeless for a little bit, but I pulled myself together and eventually bought a home, a nice car, nice stuff and etc.  I live by myself but I desperately crave to be close to someone again, just to touch someone or them to touch me.  I just want to share a life with someone.  
  My last relationship ended at the beginning of covid.  We both made a lot of mistakes towards the end.  The relationship pretty much turned a sexual when it was both of our faults.  Eventually we had to open relationship and that kind of ruined it.  It was probably the best relationship I ever had until it ended and got bad.  I desperately miss them or at least I miss what I had.  They were probably like the funniest person I knew and the kindest and they changed me for the better at times and I still do some of the things they taught me.  
  I'm 31 and like they always say thanks get better but it just feels like it gets worse.  I got up at 10:00 a.m. today and I told myself I'd get a lot of school work done and I've gotten hardly anything done and it's like 4:00 in the afternoon now.  I feel like something inside of me is broken and I don't even know how to fix this or to get my shit done.

I guess it's a defense mechanism of my brain to avoid these kinds of people. What's very weird about this predicament is that I often regret doing it in the first place after completely avoiding that said person. I've tried saying to myself that there will be no problems interacting with other people but I still automatically avoid that person. I kinda feel bad that that person might think I hated that person in the first place but it's nowhere near that. I know some people might just call me an asswipe for doing it but I'm genuinely trying my best to go out there and socialize. It's just that I got so used to being that guy in the background that it still sticks to my mindset to avoid getting hurt in the end. And now I'm so lost about what to do with this. What if that person might think I hated them already and it might be too late to turn things around.

While people pretend they don't care about looks, they in reality do care about looks... in fact even more than they care about someone's personality.

I don’t think anyone likes to be lonely. Some people say that in this world, many people are looking for their own happiness and happiness. On this road of pursuit, they will inevitably feel lonely and helpless! People with fragile hearts are afraid of loneliness, and once they feel lonely, they will feel sad and uncomfortable! On the contrary, a person with a strong heart enjoys loneliness and the taste of loneliness! I may be the former.

6089,z7fo4g,lauren_f_,"Hii! I've just made a Reddit account to look for like minded people who might be interested in joining the philosophy club I started ❤️ every month we have a different theme and ask 4 questions. We ask members to choose a question &amp; respond (this could be with words or a drawing or music) then we have 4 way 45 minute member calls where we basically just introduce ourselves and have a deep chat about the theme of the month. I've been hosting the calls for over a year now and it's been life changing, I've had so many mind blowing conversations &amp; personally feel way less lonely than I used to!
I want more more people to experience this feeling &amp; join our amazing community, the themes &amp; questions we chat about are all just tied into what it means to be human..for example 'Love' 'Family' 'Food' 'Sleep' 'Home' etc 
Anywayy if anyone reads this and is interested in being involved let me know! Also the club alongside inspiring and teaching people, exposing people to different points of views, and breaking down barriers between strangers..the main purpose was to fight loneliness! I believe the way to fight addiction too is stronger connections 🫂

I don’t have anywhere else to go, I just got to try to keep working and saving my money to potentially move. It’s like everyone in my life is not reliable.

They never included me in their conversation or plan, and they only talk to me when there's a problem with the Appartement (something broken, something missing, et cetera).

They cook together and go out together and I try to pay no mind, but it hurts especially because of the friend I consider one of my best friends...

At first, I thought it was due to my character (I can be quite independent and a lone wolf sometimes), so I tried to hang out more in the living room to start conversations with them, invited them when I was going out somewhere, like studying, museum, shopping, et cetera. But they always refuse...it hurt, but I get they have their life so I suck it up.

I feel like I am disturbing them when I am around because the room grows quiet whenever I am ""hanging out"" with them in the living room. And as soon as I am living they start talking, laughing, and doing stuff.

I try to be out as often as possible, but I didn't really make friends yet in uni, and I'm always alone

6129,z7lg07,nayneks,"  how to get by as a loner

1. LEARN TO ENJOY YOURSELF AS THE COMPANY

2. CONVERSE WITH YOURSELF AS IF YOU WOULD WITH OTHERS

3. LOVE YOURSELF OR YOU WILL NEVER FIND LOVE

4. COMPARISON IS THE THEIF OF ALL JOY

5. DON’T CHASE LOVE, CHASE SUCCESS AND GOOD HEALTH. LOVE WILL FOLLOW

6. ALWAYS ASK WHY AND NEVER BLINDLY FOLLOW

7. SEE NOT ONLY WITH YOUR EYES, BUT WITH YOUR HEART AND MIND

8. LISTEN MORE THAN YOU SPEAK, PEOPLE WILL SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE

9. RESPECT OTHERS, BUT ALWAYS RESPECT YOURSELF FIRST. SELFISHNESS IS A USEFUL TOOL IF YOU KNOW WHEN TO USE IT

10. SPEAK WITH PURPOSE

11. AVOID CONSTANT DISTRACTION. NO ONE WILL HOLD YOUR HAND TO DISCIPLINE. YOU HAVE TO FORCE IT 

12. REPEAT HEALTHY HABITS 

13. WORKOUT WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND STRETCH

14. IF YOU TELL YOURELF WILL DIE ALONE, YOU PROBABLY WILL. THE MIND IS STRONGER THAN YOU THINK

15. SOME SPOUSES AND FRIENDS ARE BLESSINGS FROM THE DEVIL 

16. NOT EVERYONE HAS A SOULMATE. DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULDN’T TRY, JUST AS TOMORROW ISNT PROMISED, NEITHER IS LOVE

17. NEVER WISH BAD ON OTHERS, EVEN IF ENVIOUS. SATAN LOVES SEEING YOU WISH EVIL ON THOSE YOU KNOW. WATCH THE ENERGY YOU PUT OUT

18. DEADLY SINS WILL LEAD YOU TO AN EVEN LONELIER LIFE. **WRATH, PRIDE, GREED, SLOTH, GLUTTONY, ENVY &amp; LUST**

19. NEVER PRAISE WEALTH BEFORE SPIRITUALITY. I WOULD RATHER BE A POOR MAN WITH MORALS, THAN AN UNGODLY MAN WITH RICHES

20. DON’T GET COMPLACENT. DON’T SLOW DOWN AFTER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. USE IT AS FUEL AND YOU MAY DO THE UNTHINKABLE",2022-11-29 06:14:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599165748,1,/r/lonely/comments/z7lg07/20_things_to_keep_in_mind_when_you_say_youre/,,0,2,20 things to keep in mind when you say you're lonely

Last year I was medically retired from the military after a lung cancer diagnosis that I’m now in remission for. I’ve spent the last year going back to college and am having difficulty relating to many of my classmates and find myself just sitting at home alone most of the time. I hate talking to family because they always want to bring up how proud of my service they are or how strong I was to fight cancer and it all just seems patronizing. I miss the friends I used to have well I was enlisted and I can’t seem to make strong connections with anyone I meet anymore.

Like I've been able to have good conversations and hang out w people at school/during working hours but when it comes to making plans to go on trips I've been having so much trouble finding someone to come w me. 

I invite everyone I know wherever I'm planning on going but whenever I try to make plans w others to go on trips they just say they already have plans or tell me where theyre going without inviting me. I just dont understand what I'm doing wrong here. I feel like I've been very kind and inviting to everyone and done everything I can to initiate friendships but it just seems like no one is interested in being my friend. 

I always thought I was pretty good at making friends but this kind of proves that maybe I'm just unlikeable? I'm just so lonely and this isnt the first time this has happened either. I just thought that since I am going somewhere that everyone is in the same boat (not knowing anyone/being in a new country) everyone I met would be pretty like minded and it would be pretty easy to make friends but I guess not?? 

This weekend is our first long weekend and I keep trying to ask people what their plans are/if they want to do something and I found out a big group of p much everyone I know planned a trip but didnt even tell me anything about it.

I’m interested in voice acting for games and animation but no one I have met has interest in that, and I live in an unpopular dead end town where you’re likely to get a stupid and boring career that makes you wanna die. I sometimes try to show interest in others but every person at school is basically either into sports or TikTok and I’ll be honest I dislike both. Ever since I got into high school, I’ve been getting more depressed and stressed. I’ve had no one to support me to get through my work, summaries and tests. No one to hang out with at Recess. No one even wanted to sit next to me or even near me during class. Barely anybody at my school even knew I existed. I tried to talk to some of my classmates but they would just cringe at me. Now that I have dropped out, I don’t think I can make any friends. I sometimes cry about this because If I made friends, I could have been doing some hang outs, play online games, text, have funny conversations, eat lunch together, etc. But I blew my chance, now I have no one to talk to.

Conversation was going great, until I did the honest thing and mentioned that I'm schizoaffective. They said they were fine with it, but asked questions. I'd honestly say that my mental health is a major boon for me now as it makes me productive and creative and I'm forming an edutainment enterprise as a result of being different. But, I had to mention what it was like in the past before I did my spiritual work and found a medication cocktail that really works for me. Immediately ghosted, like everyone else has done.

It's always like this. There's such a hellish stigma against us schizos and it just sucks.

Sorry, this is gonna be long text, so don't read it if you don't want to...

Well, it's the title basically. I was always the one temporary friend who was great for giving their heart, all love and support until there's a better person, either in friendship or romantic relationship. Every single (female) ""best friend"" I had just used me until I wasn't sufficient enough anymore. The only friend I've got I'm bff with since kindergarten and he's the only one who wants to see me voluntarily for approximately 25 years and asks me when we wanna meet regularly. I live three hours away from him, besides that, we would meet more often than just twice or three times a year.

All of my female ""bff's"" had different reasons to ditch me after some weeks, months, years, which included: ""I finally got a boyfriend!"", ""You became too weird to hang out with."", ""Sorry, I only hang out with other mothers now."", and, the best one: ""Nah, I'm better off having Tumblr friends to meet who I am willing to travel for but not for you because I sprained my ankle once on a train ride but travling in the other direction prevents me from that, and besides, I'm pissed you can't visit me because you don't have money but I won't come over for said reasons."" (that was the last one of these girls...). Of course they don't tell me exactly that but that was just my sarcastic bitch ass exactly knowing what was going on. I may be stupid sometimes but I'm not that stupid. That always happens. When I try to befriend people at university, they get to know me and just decide I'm not worth it. In the almost five years I came with one friend and will graduate with one, the only person I have contact with there only sees me as a way venting about train delays and nothing more. They're not even interested to have courses with me together if I don't take the ones they like but vice versa is impossible for some reason I don't know.

I tried everything with my limited social skills and my presumably mild social anxiety to find someone. I once tried out a lesbian meeting group at my university but after an hour or two I left because no one wanted to talk to me even though I tried and I was so anxious saying hi to anybody. There are no other queer meeting groups in my area and if there are, they're for people 27 or younger but there are none for over that age group. I want to have some queer friends so badly because they would respect my gender and all that comes with it... my bff doesn't know because I know he would be overtaxed with that information (and I don't blame him) and everyone else I have some contact with (who are no friends to me because my friendship requirements are quite strict, they're just acquaintances max) either doesn't know or reacted weirdly, in the context of: ""Am I the last cis person ever?""... thanks. Really.

I was used to have just this one friend and my darling who's the only other person I really am friends with besides our wonderful relationship. I was used to have only these two people and was happy. Now I'm not, I need people in my life to hang out with regularly, who I can talk to and who I can actually meet, who are interested in meeting me. Friendship is so much more than just writing once in a while via WhatsApp or some shit, it's actually meeting, making plans for our shared free time, going anywhere, or meeting at our or their place for something. Making plans and taking time to share together, that's a real friendship for me (which is why all people I know except for this one guy are no friends to me). I plan to cut out my last female ""bff"" in the new year and it hurts because we had such a nice friendship but, welp, Tumblr friends are more fun than me and I'm sorry I'm too broke to pay a train ticket for 70€ each. Why doesn't she come to me, she's got money on the bank but instead wants to loan the money to pay it back later because she's afraid of taking the train to me but not for other fucking people... a rant about her could be another long post of its own. It's just hurting me...

6196,z7xvg7,ArAirhead,"Well hey everybody, just kinnda venting putting my thoughts into words right now.
I wouldn’t say I’m miserable but it can get pretty lonely here. I’m a normal guy you know, I graduated, got a job, couple of failed romances and I got to the gym as much as I can with my busy schedule. My interests range from anime, videogames to enjoying the outdoors, writing poetry and stories and just eating out with friends.
I broke up with my ex around a year and a half ago, kinnda feels like a lifetime. What I learned from that relationship is that love alone isn’t enough to carry a serious relationship, I suffered because we didn’t have much in common although we’ve known each other practically my entire life and dated for 4 years. This post isn’t about her, it’s about the idea that no matter who I’m with, I still tend to feel lonely. Surrounded by friends that I love and I still feel lonely. I don’t really know how to explain it better than that, it’s just a void that I have lost hope in trying to fill. Still hoping that one day I won’t feel it anymore.",2022-11-29 15:58:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1490217100,8,/r/lonely/comments/z7xvg7/you_know_that_void_you_cant_really_fill_m25/,,0,2,You know that void you can’t really fill?

6199,z7yl20,nohuckleberry3853,"I don’t even know what to do. I know that suffering is a part of life, but this is too much to take. I can’t. Antidepressants don’t seem to be helping (I’ve been on them for one month).

I’m (17M) extremely lonely. I’m from Russia. You know, we don’t get to choose where we’re born. There’s this Russian proverb “You’re useful (needed) where you’re born”. But I think this could not be further from the truth.

This country wasn’t made for me. Most people that share my ancestry (Ashkenazi Jewish) have moved to the US either before the birth of the USSR or right after it collapsed. My ancestors, on the other hand, didn’t. So, generation after, I was born in fucking Siberia of all places. Sure, it’s not *that* bad, except that people were sent to Siberia as a form of punishment in both the Russian Empire and the USSR. Fucking bollocks.

Why is this relevant? Well, what I’m trying to say is that it never felt like home here.

I’ve always felt different. I never fitted in. My parents never really loved me. I was bullied in school. I’ve managed to cope with all that, even having great achievements like passing CAE (English exam) and getting scores for C2 which is definitely not something my “peers” do here especially in Russia. I had success in singing, I had great things said about my music and design work, but that’s not it!!!!

I WANT LOVE AND RECOGNITION (as in my music and design work getting more exposure). BUT I DONT HAVE ANY.

WHY? Oh fucking why??!!? I was told that I’m “good-looking, smart, talented” and similar things by a ton of people throughout my life. It’s great to hear, but WHERE CAN I GET THE LOVE?!?!!

This is just all I need. I can’t take it anymore.

Maybe emigration will help. I’ll be emigrating next year and hopefully I’ll feel better in the new place.

I am so tired of life. I just need love. That’s it.

If there’s no love, there must be death.",2022-11-29 16:25:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667903011,7,/r/lonely/comments/z7yl20/i_cant_live_here_i_want_to_end_it_all/,,0,4,I can’t live here. I want to end it all.

I woke up stressed and miserable thinking I had school and work, but after getting dressed in a pretty good outfit, I checked my work schedule and I'm actually off today and working tomorrow. So after school is now all mine. Today wasn't too cold, social anxiety was low enough to talk to a stranger for a group thing in one of my classes, im no longer tired, the new Metallica song slaps so hard, I even was able yo work out last night, and in general today is a good day. It's been a long time since I've had a good day, but I'm glad to have one.

I'd also like to spread my good day to others who may not be so fortunate today. My DM's are open to all, I don't discriminate except those who are dry or boring. We can talk or do whatever and maybe a piece of my good day will spread like wildfire in you and your day might become better too!!

I (M19) have been recently rejected by a girl (19), and I'm still think about her (or, if you want to be more specific, the idea I have about her/ the opportunity I missed)

More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/z3ipn5/she_said_no_basically/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button

Long story short, she likes someone else, and I think I know who, and he is in our course.

This guy is what i think is called a boor or a bumpkin. I'll describe him anyway: ignorant, only speaks dialect, doesn't seem to have any interests, doesn't seem to have any life goal, doesn't seem to have ever read a book, ANY BOOK, and kind of a fuckboy. 

I'm totally the opposite, but we'll get there.

So today I asked one of my girl friends (Who's also similar to me) and is dating a bumpkin/boor/ you know:

""Jane (fictional name), what have you in common with that guy? It's a honest question. You read Dostoevsky, a Little Life, you are interested in the subjects of your degrees (Economics), how does your thing work?""
""Mark (f.n.), I'd marry you right now, but I could never be with a man who is always right, and can also tell me why""

Now, about me: regardless what my friend said, I have to say that I just like studying arts, philosophy and social sciences. I love music, I love art, literature, law, economics and philosophy. I like to talk about those things, and, academically speaking, I'm quite good at it. 
I also explain things to my friends when they ask me to, and I'm happy to help. Honestly. 

I just know that I bore people. I know I maked her bored. I'm sure I've done this with a lot of people. Why can't I just be normal? I don't like being me, I'd prefer to be that other guy, who's happy. 

I can't see myself having any emotional bound to anyone. Apparently, I'm made to be alone. I'm disgusted by myself. 

I just don't know what to think. I need help.",2022-11-29 18:57:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597411866,2,/r/lonely/comments/z82myv/i_could_never_be_with_you_sort_of/,,0,7,"""i could never be with you"" (sort of)"

Such feeling has always accompanied me, for as long as I can remember. I was an only child, with a weak immune system that caused me to be sick most of the time and miss school. I saw people make friends but I always had to struggle twice as hard. In addition, I moved many times and I struggled to really keep in contact with many of the people I have met. I still have some best friends that I cherish, and I made some new ones at university. However, I have now fallen sick and I am absolutely terrified of people replacing me, forgetting about me.

6256,z87i19,Dry-Cricket-6425,"right imma make this quick as possible. I met this girl at a party and we were getting along rlly well, we met eachother multiple times after that for the past couple of weeks and we shared somewhat common interests and well I developed feelings for her. but it wasn't just a usual crush cuz holy shite this felt different, she was beautiful, made fun out of everything and she didn't care what people thought of her. one night she was staying overnight at mine and then I decided to tell her I liked her, she didn't like me back in that way, that's ok I'm not gonna get all pissy over that. she was the first person I ever confessed to because I felt she was different and I don't wanna regret not telling her that. 

moving on, this bit makes me wanna blow my brains out, she is the first person to make me feel loved because even after the rejection she got all cuddly with me when we were sleeping and she was like sexually teasing me, we didn't rlly talk about it after as if it like it never happened.

 a week later, we did the same thing again but this time she made out with me and even more teasing and stuff. we talked about it and I told her I didn't want to do it anymore because it's fucking with my head, making me feel loved when I'm not really loved, she said she didn't have feelings for me before she started kissing me and I was like uhm alright then. I regret not stopping her but oh well. when we talked through it she told me she's aware I craved love cuz she knows I'm a loner and she wanted to give me love in a non romantic way but she got carried away. it was my first time kissing someone and I've been feeling worse than ever, I've always been somewhat of a miserable fuck but it's been more brutal since this and I feel like im losing it. I can't bare look at her anymore cuz part of me is blaming her for this yet it's both of our faults, she got carried away and I craved love and went too far to lie to myself because I've never been loved and I feel its something that's been missing from my life.

all my friends think im crazy cuz they all like bro you get sexual with ur crush that's something people dream of but I don't want it to be like that. I don't give a fuck about sex at this point. I just want to mean something to someone.

6281,z8b91q,_kyngsha,"I'm (37M) at a point in my life where I've got no one to vent to.

&amp;#x200B;

For a lot of background, I've always had a lot of trouble making friends and never understood why. I was bullied constantly throughout elementary and (especially) middle school until I met a group of people in high school who I became friends with for many years. Our group was very close-knit as most of us experienced at least some level of frustration trying to fit in with others. As these friends let new friends into the group, I found myself with a pretty cool social life by the time I graduated HS. My wife and I met in this group and began dating just after graduation. Life was good.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it was time for college.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, our group dwindled down to a smaller core group as people's adult lives begin taking shape, but this newfangled ""social media"" helped to keep us all in relative touch. Most of us stayed local anyway. I knew a few people who ended up at the same college as me, but for the most part I was at it alone. I was eager to form some new friendships, but two things became very quickly evident\\\~

&amp;#x200B;

1. I didn't know how to deal with people outside our group. My entire personality, my interests, my sense of humor\\\~ all shaped by this lovable, but largely unrelatable to the masses, group of weirdos. Nobody got me. The forced proximity that caused people to settle on being friends with me is no longer so confining. They could just avoid me now. And I had nothing of interest to offer anyone.

2. I didn't make most of my own friends, either! Turns out everyone in my group has a much closer connection to somebody else in the group. As time goes on, meeting up every day after classes becomes chilling on weekends. Chilling on weekends becomes stopping by every other week for a sesh and coffee and maybe a little catching up. Stopping by becomes ""we'll set something up in the group chat."" Guess who doesn't make the cut for the group chats!

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to the start of 2020. The one friend who ever visits anymore has a not-subtle and previously group-damaging thing for my wife, so even when they're around they are really cold toward me. However at this point, I feel like this is the only friend who even cares I'm alive. As far as the rest of my friends are concerned, I'm a rarely-used emergency contact in case my wife isn't texting back. A very common convo between me and my wife goes like\\\~  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

wife: such-and-such just sent me this (shows me meme)

&amp;#x200B;

me: lol cool

&amp;#x200B;

wife:  they asked about you. i said you were fine.

&amp;#x200B;

me: wish they'd just ask me

&amp;#x200B;

both: (shrug)

&amp;#x200B;

Since the start of the pandemic, it's been radio silence. My texts are full of doordash notifs and election spam from the past 3 years. My wife, already weary from carrying a social life for the both of us for the past 15 years, is also feeling the effects of a diminishing social circle. Some of her efforts to keep up with certain friends aren't panning out either. When I dwell too long on losing all my friends I get pretty sad, but hearing my wife express the same thing absolutely destroys me. She's a precious gem of a human with a glowing personality who even aside from our little circle had lots of people who loved her. I can't help but think I'm the cause; a lot of little situations in the past lead me to believe that I was always only tolerated by our friends. A few times, my wife encouraged whoever she was talking to to say hi to me if they wanted to know how i was, and now those people barely talk to her! I was quiet and inoffensive enough to tolerate for the sake of keeping my wife in the group before, but now there's no reason to keep pretending to have a friendship with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here I am, 37 with crushing social anxiety, no friends except a wife drowning under the weight my own inability to make and manage a social life, and no one to vent to because I don't want to keep bringing it up to her. I want her to feel like she's all I need in this world, but the reality is that despite all my anxieties and introverted tendencies, I am gregarious. It kills me that no one cares to check in with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not fully without blame, though. It's not like I'm checking in with them. I'm too scared to find out for sure that they never cared, to open up the lines of communication only to find a stranger on the other end. Or worse, to guilt them into an awkward coffee date where I'm caught between oversharing about how I've done nothing but be sad in the past few years and clamming up in fear of my barely people-ready brain saying the wrong thing and ruining my last chance to rekindle a meaningful friendship. I'm too scared to take that chance.

So uh yeah. Be strong everyone. It definitely helped me out to read some of the posts here from all different kinds of people. Loneliness sucks, but I guess we're not really all that alone in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

it is so horrible being alone, i havent had an irl friend since like spring time in 2020 because speaking to others is just scary and hard so i cant do it, if i try i will only mumble and say like 2 things, i dont even respond to my name or anything at this point because i just hate IDK how to explain it ugh

&amp;#x200B;

 i spend most of my time online if im not at work or school.  i have ""online friends"" but i have trouble speaking to any of them because it all just feels fake. the person who i considered to be my best friend thinks of me as just a bother because i get emotional sometimes and get told to go away. i get treated as entertainment for ""friends"" online who dont acknowledge my existence if i am not being entertaining or just reply with 1 word and is it my fault i dont even know what friends  i dont know what i couldve done so wrong to be cursed to where every single time i finally enjoy or am proud of something it i just completely ruined i dont know what i did so wrong to be cursed to live a horrible life that had zero good points that i can even think about why me? 

&amp;#x200B;

why do i deserve to live like this? i have to see everyone else be happy and content with their existences while the only thing i can think about is swinging by my neck in the attic. is it just too much for me to ask for to just be cared about by another person? the person who told me they loved me doesnt even reply to my messages i just talk to myself and every single time they finally reply after multiple days its just the same ""im sorry"" or ""hi"" with nothing else. i cant even tell you i dont want to be in a relationship because i just have nobody else i can ever speak to and if you go away i dont have any reasont to be alive anymroe i have cried over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over becqause i just do not exist to other people i am a ghost i sit and observe the world around me and every time there is a new spark of a chance it is stomped out very quickly by the curse its just not fair i hate it all nobody will ev en see this post i am venting to nobbody because i do not really exist and all my words will be forgotten i just do not understand anything i dont understand myself i dont understand others i dont understand anything in this world 

&amp;#x200B;

i dont even have the motivation or energy to eat anymore and that has stopped me from growing and makes me skinny but its fine eating when i do it feels gross and i hate it so its fine i dont know why i included this i am sick of this feeling i am so tired of crying until my face and arms are soaked in tears i would probably be crying right now if my eyes didnt go completely dry from using up all my tears i dont want to do anything anymore i understand that there was never a future for me, i have never been able to imagine myself older than i am right now but maybe thats ok its better than living this life i dont like this life i would do anything for a new one this life was a mistake and i have clung onto it for way too long 

&amp;#x200B;

it feels like i am just watching my life on a tv, maybe i am not really even here or anything is even real this could just be a dream why am i so bothered  by it if it sjust a dream its ok if its just a dream because i will wake up eventually hopefully but shouldnt dreams be a little bit nicer and not like this this dream is horrible i hope its over tomorrow i dont wanna dream anymore",2022-11-30 01:33:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1667378444,1,/r/lonely/comments/z8d27q/maybe_i_was_cursed_or_i_just_dont_truly_exist/,,0,2,maybe i was cursed or i just dont truly exist

I hear all the time that when women are depressed/mentally ill, they get a myriad of help and support.

 What?????  I'm probably in the fucking minority when it comes to this, but a total of ONE (1) person in my life has supported me in my history of depression and suicidal thoughts. 

My parents don't care/don't take me seriously at all, and 1 friend has actually helped me through this, no one else even bats an eye. 

It's probably true that women get more support, but probably only for attractive women. It happens all the time. Hot women have people falling over themselves to ask her if she needs any assistance.

 ""Do you need help carrying that?"" ""Do you need help answering that?"" ""Hey, you seem to not know the way around, can I show you around?"" ""You seem sad, do you need someone to talk to?""  (I've never heard these words said to me in my entire life) 

Just thinking of that makes me feel even more alone. That my looks are so repulsive that no one cares if I want to put a shotgun in my mouth. The world wasn't made for people like me.

For some context i am loney per say i have a family (mom dad sister) and some friends from uni and school but i feel lonely even when i am surrounded by all this people. I don't have any close friends, they all are just friends but not close friends. I feel really in a slump with no motivation just feeling lonely and just putting a fake face. I feel like no one really know the real me. I want to cry shout and say you guys don't know me but I can't it's been like this for all my life. 

I can't share this with anyone. I feel like I don't have anyone. I obviously can't talk or share this with my family or I don't know how to communicate this. I don't have any real friends. I still have friends from my 1st grade but i feel they all are distanced have their own world. The friends from uni are also have their own thing to do and own world. I feel like i am not in any of their world. I can't resonate with them at all. I don't blame them, that's how life is but i think they just don't see me fitting with their life.

I don't have a GF or infact had, i just can't. I am a average looking guy with average grade.

6362,z8lzt8,fukin_ejit,"Among other lonely hearts ads, which are very explicit, these classified ads are full of people wanting to trade drugs for sex, or wanting to trade sex for drugs there are literally hundreds of posts. I am a drug user and I wanted to find a friend that uses too. I also wanted that friend to be female friend.as I felt that advertising for a male friend might not end up the way that I wanted. I am not looking for a sex partner, but if a friendship developed into that over time, then that would be ok with me too.

So my ad said pretty much exactly that. It did specify that, at first I would provide the drugs, if the new friend was reluctant to have me at their place that I would provide transportation to my place if required, that I would pay for any meals etc, that I was looking for friendship and nothing more, that there would be no attempting to take it furter than friendship, and that I would be happy to go through any vetting process that they wanted me to prior to meeting. I clearly said that age (over 18), size, weight, race, or any other factor was not an issue as I was looking for friendship only.

I got no responses, not even junkies or weirdos. I have placed an ad on there several months ago which was optimisticly looking for a female partner. I got hookers, cross dressers, transvestites, men wanting to change my thinking on my sexual preferences. Men not caring what my sexual preference was but demanded to meet anyway, I even had a couple of women who were curious enough to make contact and have dialogue, but we never met.

This is a serious question.

With everything about us being ok, then one day a switch flicks and you aren't interested anymore. Something like this happens every time, and it just hurts more each time. I can imagine you being angry, more easily than I can imagine you being considerate, or giving, or generous. And so all I feel is fear, and longing. 

I don't really know what to do or how to get past this. I don't know how to accept or deal with the bullshit each time. Each time, I'm convinced more and more that I'm always wrong, or always in the wrong. And it's gotten to the point I don't expect to ever have a healthy relationship ever. I always have to be the perfect one. I always have to fix things for you. I can't have moments of weakness. I have to be perfect and absolute, forever. And I hate it.

The  authors in this article highlight that loneliness is linked to three dimensions, namely:

1. Intimate loneliness: In this case, an individual seeks a significant other for ""emotional support"", ""assistance"", and ""affirmation"".
2. Relational loneliness: This form of loneliness relates to the ""quality"" of the relationships a person could have with their family.
3. Collective loneliness: This form of loneliness addresses ""social identities"" and how we as people interact with society in general. These authors state that a social identity could be a team, group, school etc.

This message aims to let you know that you are not alone in your loneliness. You also do not have to be ashamed of feeling lonely. It is not an unnatural phenomenon that contradicts the human experience. I know that a lot of people fail to understand what you are going through. I really hope your circumstances improve. I also hope that you find ways to connect and engage with people who are good for you. We all wish we did not have to go through certain traumas. We also wish that certain people behaved differently. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to relate to others. In light of this, I hope that you will make it. Please keep going. It might be cliché to say, but it is not over for you.

So yeah... I journal and talk with my husband. But I guess I'm not healing. I've tried therapy/church/yoga/meditation/exercise/travel, nothing helps take away the profound sense of abandonment and resentment for having my childhood obliterated by the person who birthed me into existence.

Im not getting any kind of pay to care for my mom but she can needs help with so much as far as getting around to preparing &amp; making sure she takes meds. &amp; on top of it my boyfriend was cheating on me during all of this.

6442,z8ybe5,Apples_on_oranges,"My life sucks since the day I was born. I question why my mother didn’t just abort me on a daily. She failed with her first two kids and decided to push out two more and now we’re all a bunch of fuck ups with mommy issues. And for what? Love? The man knocked your teeth out but you loved him. The many SA’d your oldest daughter (my sister it was boy girl boy girl (last girl being me))and still loved him?

Like the other pair we too ended up in foster care to which I ended up in some weird misogynistic family that put my brother on a pedestal while watching me struggle. Would punish me for being upset then call me a fat ass. They didn’t even care that was anorexic until the doctors got involved.

I’ve worked bloody hours since age 16 and I’m tired. 

I’m now an adult in a relationship with a man that feels the need to cheat on me the moment I ask to for his part of the rent money (I plan to leave once the debt is cleared we have since been evicted and now living with his parents)

And I’m tired I just want to end it. Did I do something wrong in a past life? Was it because of the one time I didn’t give a homeless man my spare change? It was a quarter and I wanted gum from the machine. Was I selfish? I was a mean middle schooler and I’m sorry to those I hurt I was frustrated yes but it was never right to hurt you because I was hurting… I did apologize to them in hs though and we all get along now.

Was it because I didn’t work with my therapist? Well my foster family was very pressed on keeping what’s in the house within the house (when it was about them).

What did I do to deserve this life? What did I do wrong? If I never did anything wrong and still have a shitty life why should I bother living it if no matter what you do there’s still Shit ahead. I want this to end. I want it all to be over. I hate this I hate all of it. I could swallow every last pill in this cabinet but luck will suddenly appear and someone will come home and everyone will say it’s a miracle but not to me. Who gave you the right to tell me to live? Are you going to pay my bills? Are you going to wash my tear/snot stained pillows? Will listen to some whinny man tell you be about how he loves you and how everything will be better once we are out of this spot.

6455,z90rws,Shagged_Willy,"From like 7:th to 10:th grade i always felt quite lonely, I didn’t crave any s/o but I wasn’t with anyone after school, I had two friends I was with at school but nothing more. 

Now in high school, I got into a friend group, talked on discord, hung out, everything, but then, just because I apparently don’t have the same “humor” as them, just for getting angry at them for picking at me for a whole day and no one else, they froze me out, made me feel like shit, and just didn’t talk to me. A week later we got back in a vc and talked about it, they said how fucked of a thing it was they did, but never apologized, they then said we didn’t “click” and that they couldn’t be themselves around me. When I told them they could, they tried to tell me what I felt on the inside and what I wanted. They said we could still be friends and talk but I still feel completely frozen out. Feels like they don’t want to talk to me at all, and if I try to start a conversation with any of them I get a one word response. Another guy in my class, that I was on good terms with, we talked and such. But since he has started to hang out with them, he has started to completely ignore me too. I tried to tell him about something, and all he answered was “yeah, yeah, yeah” just seemed like he didn’t care at all.

They told me to try find someone else I “click” with, and hangout with. Now it has been a month, o have been bouncing around trying to hang out with people. Tried a bit with the few girls we have in our class but they didn’t seem like they wanted to talk to me all that much. 
Then I tried a group of 3 guys, who 2 of them I already knew and the third guy is pretty nice.they are nice to me, and talk to me, but I don’t feel like I fit with them at all. I just kinda feel “there” when they meet other people that I don’t talk with or generally don’t know who I am at all.

All this have just made me feel so lonely, and out of place. I have been thinking of a s/o, because that could be someone to at least make my life better and less lonely. But doesn’t feel like anyone looks at me, just because I’m pretty short.

As of suicide it is nothing I consider, life may feel shit rn, it may feel like nobody would care, but I know they would. My family still loves me and I have a whole life ahead of me.

6459,z911l5,Dont_Tread_on_REEEE,"Moved to a new school. Everyone else is new to the school as well and whilst I’m walking around the place with no one to talk to I see this girl. Absolutely beautiful, tall (6ft) goth girl wearing a cool band hoodie. That was a couple months ago, but I gained the courage a week or two ago to start messaging her and she actually responded! We message back and forth once a day or so for around two weeks and then I look through her page today and find some art she’s done with two skeletons kissing. In the comments I saw someone had commented “&lt;3” and she replied to his comment with the same. I check the persons profile and they’re definitely in a relationship together they even have matching profile pictures on second accounts. I feel like shit, I’ve been tearing up and crying in small amounts every 15 minutes for around 1 and a half hours. 

I knew I really liked her but I didn’t realise it was this much. I’ve realised how long I’m probably going to have to wait until I find another perfect girl. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so jealous of someone before. Literally the one time in years I find a girl who could be into me and is as tall and beautiful as her and she turns out to already be taken. 

I know jealousy isn’t a good thing to feel but I don’t know how else I should react besides from crying. I just feel like shit.

Just here to vent I guess, not sure what I’m looking to get out of this, but nobody I know will listen. Im just sick of being alone, but aren’t we all? I see all my friends having fun talking to their girlfriends and enjoying life while I sit alone in my room and drink beer and watch movies every night because its the little bit of pleasure I still get. I had one girlfriend when I was 17 but we weren’t physical or even all that close. Just want someone to hold and care for and to be treated with love and compassion. I wouldn’t wish loneliness on my worst enemy. Its good to know I’m not alone.",2022-11-30 21:26:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1542924849,1,/r/lonely/comments/z93ryz/well_its_that_time_of_the_year_again/,,0,0,Well its that time of the year again.

6492,z93xzv,Acorbo22,"I feel completely lonely and upset about the fact that I can’t seem to connect with anyone on an intellectual level. Online is great because you can find a lot of like minded people but it doesn’t really have the same impact as speaking with someone face to face. I often have questions and thoughts that I don’t really have an outlet for because most people I connect with don’t really think about these things. They include philosophy, psychology, space, all kinds of theories. I tend to ramble on about these things and people just don’t really get it. I am also in school for psychology but most of the students are much younger than me and I feel uncomfortable reaching out. 

I want to say, it is no discredit to the ones around me at all. Life is hard, and thinking about things that don’t really apply to you is taxing at times. I understand this is completely a me thing but it doesn’t prevent me from feeling lonely and isolated in this. 

I recently took a love language test that identified intellectual as my love language. With that it was saying that I feel loved and cared for when I discuss and get into deeper topics and less surface level stuff. This really rang true for me. I take these things with a grain of salt but man, that was spot on.",2022-11-30 21:32:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1430095031,0,/r/lonely/comments/z93xzv/dont_feel_like_i_connect_with_anyone/,,0,22,Don’t feel like I connect with anyone intellectually

6515,z96hzs,ILikeFireEmblemFates,"Days are shittier and shittier.My uni decided to make a meeting event with for goal to meet foreign students and just create links. I joined thinking it could be a nice thing and i might make friends finally. The bar was 45 minutes away from where i live so i went there early. When i arrived it was already almost full and everyone was talking everywhere. I took a seat in a corner of the room and i could just barely hear them. It was noisy, i couldn't talk because i have a pretty low voice and people talked over me anyway.

I thought that since i can speak both french and english i had an advantage and could make myself look interesting but they just all were fluent already in both languages and could speak more of them. So i just sat and listened to them talking about their countries of origins. 1 hour and a half in i left the bar because i couldn't bear the loud speaking mixed with music and tiny bar room filled with people.I walked for like 1 hour in the cold night, i was freezing and just stopped by a random place to eat warm food in peace (lebanese food as well, it was a good 25 minutes break). I arrived home very late after i found my way back in the city.

But my poor terrible night didn't end here. Once i arrived at 11pm at my appartment, i put my key in the door and i just couldn't open it. I twisted the key real hard and it just hurt my hand. I spent the next 30 minutes trying to open a goddamn door. Eventually i stopped trying, it was completely dark and the light turned off and i couldn't hold myself back from crying more. I stood against the wall and just cried silently in the night for 2-3 minutes. I called my father to ask him if he could get me and i'd sleep at their house in my old bedroom and he just shut me off and told me ""Just open the door it's not hard..."".

I finally opened the door after another long painful 10 minutes of annihilating my hand. Im writing this before going to sleep, i have classes tomorrow and i definitely won't get enough sleep, im finishing to write my 5 pages long geopolitics work.",2022-11-30 23:05:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659375744,12,/r/lonely/comments/z96hzs/im_cried_in_the_corridor_of_my_appartment/,,0,5,Im cried in the corridor of my appartment

3,rt6rq1,[deleted],"I was at dinner with my family (we are 3), but at the end of the countdown of new year, I watched on the tv that all the people had friends and big families, and I started to think if I should be somewhere else with other people, you know, having fun, or with a girlfriend, but no, I was here with my family.

And I don't know if that triggered some abandonment trauma that I have, or that I ate a lot and triggered some anxiety; but I started walking a lot and thinking nobody loved me, nobody cared about me, I almost started crying, and I started to have a pain in my head...

I don't know, I feel really disconnected from myself and from people, and that makes me feel really lonely because I'm already losing a lot of friends cause I'm kinda depressed...

Sorry guys I needed to get my feeling out.

This year was a bad year for me, was really depressed, to the point I was in bed laying there, without wanting to do anything, I didn't care about life or die. But now I kinda feel better, I have some goals and do some exercise, and eat healthier...

But I don't want to let this little anxious moment take this year progress... I know I have a long way to be good, but it's ok, this is my owm path.

I don't know when, but I know I want to feel more connected to myself and other people... because living like this... sometimes... it's a burden.

Maybe one year I would be with people or maybe not, but the thing is, I want to be able to know what I really want and make it possible.

Btw now I kinda feel better, I expressed how I felt and I'm listen to relaxing music.",2022-01-01 00:04:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/rt6rq1/i_was_ok_but_suddenly_anxiety_came_up_and_felt/,,0,2,"I was ok but suddenly anxiety came up, and felt really lonely."

I don‚Äôt wake up happy. I fucking fight for it. I wake up most mornings wanting to hurt myself and dreading getting out of bed but I fight for it. I think about what I want to do in six months. I think about what career I want and the life I want to live, then I fucking fight for it. 
It takes strength. I don‚Äôt hide being weak, I fight to stay strong. That‚Äôs the secret to being happy every day. It‚Äôs a mindset. It‚Äôs faith things will get better- and they do. 
Life is fucking hard. The world is full of evil and there‚Äôs 1% that genuinely want to make the world a better place. If you‚Äôre not here anymore, that‚Äôs one less person on our team.  Be the change you want to see in the world. No one is going to climb into your brain and live life for you.

56,rt9ilk,Fabulous-Advantage,"Visiting some parks today, reminiscing on some events I went to a couple months ago, at these parks. I was still alone and I remember how it felt recent but was months ago when I was volunteering and putting myself out there. I looked into the distance and understood a little more. 

I remember how I interviewed for jobs, some very good jobs, for over a year without results, and then suddenly as I neared graduation, I started to sit alone and make flash cards of my interview stories, and I'd tape myself and recite my response in the interview format. If it was bad I'd redo it. Then my head would hurt and it would be the last thing I wanted to do but I'd flip another flash card and have a go, as that's an interview. It already wasn't fun processing my undergrad experiences and to describe it professionally, in addition to tailoring it to the position. So I started interviewing again, and I said the answers, and I started getting through all of them. One of my last final round interviews the interviewer said, wow you got all of it. Because I had a response for all the questions. They offered and I took another position. 

It's the same with having friends. I know what to do to make people feel cared, comfortable. I've read books, I just don't fully do it because it's too uncomfortable to put that effort into it when my heart is dying not to do it. I'm not at the stage where I can say I really want to change instead of ""wanting to change"" and not seeing I can put more effort. Everybody wants me to be at that stage in my early 20s, but I'm not. I'll still put myself out there as (un)comfortable, but I'm not willing to really take that full step yet.",2022-01-01 02:33:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579061274,3,/r/lonely/comments/rt9ilk/things_will_only_change_when_i_decide_to/,,0,1,Things will only change when I decide to

99,rtbo0r,JamieIV,"So being a good friend is something I've always tried my hardest to be. Maintaining relationships with those closest to you is something that I feel is very important. Despite being introverted I feel like without friendship, my life is heavily empty.

In September of this year my best friend, a friend who was as good a friend to me as I was to him. Someone I considered my brother. He very sadly took his own life and it broke me. On some level, I do kind  of feel like I failed him, the last 3 months have been the hardest months of my life.

New Years Night, tonight. New Years was always mine and my best friends night. For the last 8 years since we became friend we spent every New Years together except 1. Except the New Years that I travelled to New York to spend New Years there and he was unable come because of his new girlfriend. But other than that, New Years was our night so tonight has been exceptionally hard for me.

I thought I had friends in two other people, people I had known for over 10+ years now, and they both knew about how hard tonight was for me as I had told them this week and I asked if we could hang out on New Years Eve and they agreed that we'd all hang out online for the night since they don't really do much anyway, they said they'd join me on Discord to hang. So I waited patiently til they could join me, they both have families and were waiting til they went to bed, so I messaged one. Asking when he'd be on discord, he said he was having a few games with two other friends. I didn't overly want to impose but suggested I could come along, he said ok but also that he won't be long anyway cause they'll be off soon. I told him I didn't have access to the discord server and then I was just, I don't want to use the word ignored but he stopped replying to me on messenger. Anyway I waited for an hour and thought, ""surely they're done"". I was sat in my shared discord server alone since around 9pm-ish logging off briefly when I restarted my PC.

I logged into League of Legends and saw them all in the same game together, and thought, surely it won't be long. And left them to it. Anyway it got to 4am and I was sat there, still on the same game, still sat on discord, no invites, no messages, no company on discord and not even a happy New Years. I decided to go to bed and watch a film. I'm going to be honest, I broke down, I felt abandoned and I felt like they really don't consider me a friend. I was thinking about my friend who passed and about how I miss that close of a friendship and about how I'm now more alone than ever. It's horribly impacting my depression. A large deciding factor in going to bed when I did was because I felt myself starting to get really sad and my mind was going to a dark place where I was beginning to consider ending it again. But I really needed to unload and that's why am here.

136,rtdbu9,[deleted],"So, this'll be hard to word adequately because I'm tired. But, I'm lonely. I mean, yes, I have a few people in my life who I see as friends, and I do have family which cares about me. That's more than some can say they have, and I'm not looking for sympathy. This is just me venting. I broke up with the person I was seeing for a year a few weeks ago, and it's been very hard adjusting. I'll make it a short explanation but the relationship was toxic and it didn't work out due to it being long-distance and the fact that it all degraded to petty arguments every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss the companionship that relationship brought. They understood me 100%, and loved me to death, and I loved them too. but the circumstances were too much for me to handle, and not being able to actually see them was a dealbreaker for me.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to be honest, it feels like I snapped after plans for a visit on my birthday were canceled. A few itmes prior we'd try and schedule a date, only for it to not happen. Each time a bit more of my sanity went away. That one time was what put me over the edge. I haven't been the same. I acknowledge it 100% yet I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I'm just sad that I'm beginning the year without them, or just somebody in general who I love. and I'm worried about their wellbeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don' think I'll ever find another person who'll love me like they did. I look awful, and fundamentally I'm screwed up. I know it though. i'm not unaware of my very real flaws and mental problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I need people. I need to talk, to laugh, to have friends. I want to love, to be touched, to have a woman that has my back.

177,rthmie,pranavk28,"So this is the last day of a week long news years vacation with seven other people, 3 that I know and 4 new people. Now don't get me wrong I have basically 0 friends outside this group so it still so much better than nothing. But..felt like an outsider like always as I always feel bit intimidated when I see them in a group like tight knit one and feel hesitant to approach sometimes and end up standing in the corner and they just think that I'm the kind the person who doesn't interact as much is chill with himself too most times. And at this point this has become a personality trait. That are other things like me not knowing how to drive or not having good dressing sense or not knowing what drinks to get if you ask me to go buy some as I always have other people in the group do all the work basically making me feel like a child who can't do anything by himself. But more importantly I feel like I have killed every passion outside just recreation stuff and feel like a parasite completely reliant on the same 3-4 people who keep taking me on trip with them and like if they ask me to bring a friend at any point I wouldn't have any other friends. They are lovely people though. They are not in my work city or my hometown, so now when going back either of them all I can think about is be depressed about being able to return back to normal life. I wanna change though taking some steps, dont know when or if Ill see myself as the person who I wanna see myself as and not feel lacking about myself. Can only hope. Just needed to get this off my chest and if anyone else outside is going through anything similar I'll be very glad to just chat with them on genuine things knowing that I'm not alone in this.

I‚Äôve kinda been struggling these last few weeks. There are multiple reasons for this all of which aren‚Äôt really serious issues but nevertheless it still does bother me. 
A) academic pressure and a new environment since I‚Äôve recently joined college.
B) having all these thoughts about how lonely I am because I don‚Äôt have anyone by my side who I can share stuff with.
C) dealing with my insecurities about how I look, speak.

I decided to write this here hoping maybe one of you could help me out if you‚Äôve ever been through similar struggles. I‚Äôm sorry if most of my words don‚Äôt make any sense. Thanks for reading anyway, really does mean a lot.

189,rtkic4,[deleted],"Granted, there‚Äôs only 3 people in my life at this point and one of them I‚Äôm pissed at because she doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore. Point is it‚Äôs not massively exceptional to be angry at 3 people at once but I can‚Äôt fucking put into words how deep the rage for them is.

Two most prominent right now are my mum and her fucking pathetic husband. I was forced to move back in with her at the start of the year when my depression lost me my job, and I‚Äôve fucking regretted not just accepting homelessness ever since. Those two people people got together, they became a fucking cancer. A fucking black tar pit of all humanity‚Äôs most repulsive traits. 

Had a massive fight with my mum about an hour ago cause she apparently had absolutely no choice but to make some totally unnecessary anti-Semitic comment that was based on literally nothing (they both have increasingly white-supremacist ideals that have only increased since they met). She knows full well shit like that makes me uncomfortable and that I won‚Äôt ever agree, so I can‚Äôt think of any reason to say it other than to start a fight. Then I do lash back, and she turns into the fucking shocked Pikachu meme, and acts like she‚Äôs a victim. Then they both go into the kitchen and whisper about me when they think I‚Äôm outta earshot cause they‚Äôre the most pathetic cowards I can imagine. Fucking Peter Pettigrew looks like Steve Rogers compared to these fucking wastes of oxygen.

And then I‚Äôm stuck with a slow-burning, boiling under the surface kinda fucking rage towards my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô. Don‚Äôt think I can even use that term in inverted commas anymore. She was the only ‚Äòfriend‚Äô I‚Äôve ever actually had, but I guess I‚Äôm also realising that it was never really a friendship and that fucking pisses me off too. 

I get that I‚Äôm not easy to be friends with. No one ever really tried until she did, for good reason. But I told her over and fucking over the reality of who I was and what I‚Äôm actually like. And she was adamant that she ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt ever leave‚Äù. But if course, after the self-harm, the drinking, the suicide attempt and me getting feelings for her, I pushed her to her limit. That makes sense to me, those were the choices I made and I can live with that, her leaving was the expected outcome.

What I didn‚Äôt expect is for her to string me along for some fucking reason I can‚Äôt figure out. After I told her I had feelings for her, something every obviously changed. We only saw each other in person one time after that, when we‚Äôd text, I‚Äôd barely squeeze 5 replies outta her before she‚Äôd leave me on read for like a month. Again, thats what I expected, things get weird, we stop talking. 

But the part I really don‚Äôt fucking get is why the fuck she‚Äôd keep actually texting back after a month. I rarely initiated conversations, occasionally I did, but mostly I wanted the ball to be in her court. And she texted pretty much every month without fail, just outta the blue. But then she‚Äôd seem super uninterested in actually having a conversation, then leave me on read for another almost as soon as we start talking.

After she did that enough, I was confused enough to just ask her outright what the fuck was going on and she acted like things were the same as they‚Äôd always been. Said nothing was wrong at all. But it clearly fucking was, we used to text for hours. But if she didn‚Äôt wanna be friends at all, then why bother texting at all, especially if I‚Äôm not? It‚Äôs fucking infuriating, I don‚Äôt get it. And then the last time we spoke was after I asked if she wanted to hang out again cause I was in town, she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to reply, and then we had a short conversation where she left me on read again and that was the last I‚Äôve fucking heard from her. That was 7 months ago.

She‚Äôs also sent me a ‚Äúmerry Christmas‚Äù text every year since we met and I didn‚Äôt get one this year, so I‚Äôd assume between that and the 7 month guess I‚Äôm just left to assume she‚Äôs finally let it die. It just fucking infuriates me that she wasn‚Äôt just honest when I asked her outright. Apparently I meant so little to her that she would rather make me constantly second guess for like a year whether I even still had a friend and lie to me, instead of making herself slightly uncomfortable for the duration of one fucking conversation where she just told me the truth to save me from having to go through that. That‚Äôs just fucking disrespectful, and I get that I‚Äôm fucked up, but I was pretty upfront about that from the beginning cause this was exactly the situation I was trying to avoid and she was the one who was too stubborn to listen at the time.

I just fucking hate people, and being this fucking angry at everyone in my life is making me wanna fucking cut myself all over but I can‚Äôt even do that anymore cause I can‚Äôt stand looking at the scars it leaves. Fucking hate being on this bullshit fucking planet.",2022-01-01 14:31:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/rtkic4/i_feel_burning_overwhelming_furious_rage_at/,,0,2,"I feel burning, overwhelming, furious rage at everyone in my life"

225,rtpd3t,StanPhoenix1987,"Hi all.  I'm new to Reddit so if you can reply that'd be great, even just to let me know I've posted in the right place.

So, as I'm posting here you'll be able to guess that I'm extremely lonely and looking for advice.  A bit about me though to start with:

So I'm currently 34, from the UK.  I served 12 years in the Royal Air Force and am now a teacher.  I'm an only child and, growing up, I didn't really have any truly close friends.  Even now, I only have 3 or 4 true close friends, but still only see them very rarely due to work and life getting in the way. 

As for relationships, in the past I have had a few, none particularly serious or long-lasting.  That was until I got married.  All seemed to be going well.  We even had a child together.  But, like with previous relationships, the marriage ended too.  That was 7 years ago now, and I've been single and lonely ever since. 

I know what love feels like, I've experienced it.  I want nothing more than to experience it again.  I've tried dating apps; two matches in 5 years, one said nothing, the other only messaged to apologise for swiping the wrong way.  I've tried meeting people on nights out, at parties, events, activities, etc too.  No one is interested.  I've had women call me alsorts; weirdo, freak, ugly, probably more insults than you can think up.

Anyway, I know I've got some things going against me.  I'm not exactly attractive, I'm somewhat of an introvert, and I struggle with social interactions like flirting, body language, facial expressions, etc.

I do have some good things going for me though.  Being that I'm not good looking I've spent most of my life becoming a good person.  

Unfortunately, no one seems to care about good people any more.  The world all seems so superficial to me.  

Any thoughts or ideas out there on how or where I might have some luck meeting people?",2022-01-01 18:36:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640815909,21,/r/lonely/comments/rtpd3t/i_hate_being_lonely_its_killing_me_inside/,,0,9,I Hate Being Lonely - It's Killing Me Inside

I feel like over the years I‚Äôve developed this thing where I don‚Äôt like when a person starts to depend on me or get close to me.I suddenly start to distance myself so nobody gets attached to me.I feel like that‚Äôs a result of my depression because my mind feels like what If my depression starts going crazy some time later and I won‚Äôt be able to keep up with that person,so in my mind it was better to be all by myself and not let anyone in.
I truly enjoy being all by myself and like my own  company .But as much as I like to be alone I feel like  after a few years of complete isolation I need to just have at least one friend and go back to being somewhat social

256,rtugs0,DreamerDoge,"TLDR: What is a local food, doesn't have to be where you are from, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did not find any rules saying I couldn't try this so I'm going to give it a go. After browsing this sub quite often, it seems to me this is mostly a place where people vent into the void (I've done this) about being lonely but continue to isolate themselves (also me). 

I think usually a shared sense of loneliness is not enough to start meaningful interactions as you don't really get a feel for what that person is actually like. Equally, while cathartic, it's can be a bit depressing and you guys are more than this horrible feeling. 

The idea? Talk about anything else. Something dumb and unimportant but somehow interesting or controversial. Best biscuit, best type of bread, whether/when you should butter your sandwiches, etc. Essentially something you don't realise you care about or differ from others on until you think about it. 

I hope that this can break the ice and maybe make someone feel a little less lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

The question: What is a food that you have locally, or if you know another place's local food, that doesn't appear to be popular else where but should? Whether that's because it's easy to make or just that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

My food is flapjacks. My understanding is, while Americans sometimes call pancakes flapjacks, only a couple other countries have what the British consider to be a flapjack. The closest thing if you don't have them is probably an oat bar.

Essentially it's butter, golden syrup and sugar melted and then mixed with oats. It's pressed down into a cake tin, baked and then cut into squares like a brownie. Again like brownies it often is a bit squishy before it cools however in general it does crumble a bit more. 

It's buttery and sweet but with that oaty edge. You can make them yourself but you often get them packaged here individually like biscuit and cake bars - it's the kind of thing you find in vending machine. Flapjacks aren't the best but it's very simple, cheap and quick so I'm honestly very surprised that it's not more widespread. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear more examples of these.",2022-01-01 22:35:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585431747,3,/r/lonely/comments/rtugs0/anything_else_local_foods_that_shouldnt_be_local/,,0,5,Anything else: Local foods that shouldn't be local

pure bullshit, if u are 18 and still haven't kissed thats a red alarm, that's like doctors telling you that you have cancer or sth, and you should hurry and do whatever it takes to stop this abomination.

like if ur parents notice ur virgin and kissless at 18, they should panic and cry and quit their job and gather for emergency meeting and do something about it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so important to me‚Äù

You don‚Äôt miss me, you only miss having someone around, if you missed me you‚Äôd call or text or ask to see me. 

I don‚Äôt mind being alone, loneliness i can abide. What i can‚Äôt handle is when people lie to me and, momentarily, let me think i matter. I don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm a passerby in your life. I‚Äôm a fuckin backup quarterback, there when you need me then as soon as someone better comes along, you kick me to the curb.

It's always been the same with me, I'm surrounded by people that love me that's true for sure, but they all have someone as well.
I don't complain and I feel deeply lucky that I have the people in my life, I tell them that everyday and they say it back to me, I know there's a deep love there...
But I still don't ever feel *that* type of connection, everyone around me seems to find those connections, even my one friend that always used to be in the same boat as me found someone that completes them but I've never felt that, or if I have (which I don't know anymore), it's never reciprocated.

I've been in relationships, but I always tend to be the giver as I believe vulnerability to be one amazing quality in people and I adore people that do it, but it's so hard... To never find someone to... Click.

I just... Want what I see my parents having, what I see my siblings sharing with their partners, what all my friends have found for years already. I just want a partner, someone to be myself, to show myself and feel accepted at full, someone I can accept as well.

Every year that goes by I grow a little bit colder, a little bit more cynical and sour, I don't want to but it happens, and I'm afraid I'll get to 30 without ever feeling that complicity, that sincronicity with someone, that inexplicable connection that only we understand...

356,ru5lfa,Actual_Code_9048,"Hey y‚Äôall,

I‚Äôm here to ask for some help, as I‚Äôm not sure if I should get to the point where I am bringing this up with my friends/family.

For short background, I do not have a history of a bad or lonely life for the most part. Not a great childhood but many people have had it much worse for sure. I am a recent college graduate from and a former track athlete who ended college on a good note career wise. I still run and am in the process of trying to compete in higher levels. This is not to brag or anything, but I‚Äôm starting to realize that my lifestyle has kind of masked symptoms anxiety and depression. This is not to say that I am depressed (I try to be very careful when using that term), but I‚Äôve felt very lonely and sad for the past 6months or so. Luckily I have not been impacted from a physical standpoint. Because I still train,I know I need to continue eating well, and practicing good habits. It has been harder though.

I do not think I‚Äôm depressed. But I‚Äôm unsure because I truly do feel terrible. Running track is probably one of the only things that keep me at peace, even if it is going out in the freezing rain to run. 

It‚Äôs hard to really chat to anyone about this or anything in general. I feel like I just don‚Äôt connect well with people my age. I keep asking myself what must be wrong with me for people to not answer or care to have conversations about anything but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm quite lost at this point.

Any words of advice would help a ton, thank you",2022-01-02 08:44:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606523777,3,/r/lonely/comments/ru5lfa/post_college_loneliness/,,0,3,Post College Loneliness ?

This holiday season has been pretty tough for me, as I imagine it has been for many of you. I usually feel quite down and lonely around Christmas and stuff, but this time was particularly difficult for me.
Last September my mum passed away, and things have been so much different ever since. Despite her faults, I really miss her and I wish she was still here.
It sucks to admit that I don't have much of a social life so I pretty much dealt with it and the fallout on my own. That only added to the loneliness I felt. Still, I'm thankful for the people who were there for me.

404,rue98e,[deleted],"I had recently turned 17 and i feel so that i am here in the world for no good. I have let down everybody, my parents, my friends, my teachers and anyone that has expected anything from me. I have not achieved anything that based upon I could call myself exceptional in any field. I fell like atleast everyone has achieved something to show off, every close friend in my circle seem to have done something atleast. I feel like i am the most normal person. I am also very ugly looking and it just makes me feel down everytime. Today I was writing diary on my past 2 years and i feel more down now, just 2 years have passed and I could not do a single thing worthy or productive, i have just fallen behind in my studies when I should have focussed more as this year is very crucial for my life. I use to talk to a girl and even had crush on her but yesterday she told me indirectly that she kind of doesn't like talking with me often and i think so all this time I was just irritating her so I have just decided not to talk to her as I just don't want to add to her problems as she has allready many but she did tell me that I am a real help in her troubling times, so I just let her know that i will always be available to her whenever she needs me. But now I miss her a lot. I feel like I am only and only sorrounded by problems and trying to come out just pushes me deeper into more problems and depression. 
Today whole day I have spent thinking about all my life that I have lived and I just feel like I have existed for no good. I feel like crying my heart out and dissapearing out in thin air like i have never existed. The only thing that seems to be helping me out are songs, books and reddit and that's why I am posting my thing here.

410,ruftlf,redbooor,"I never really had friends as a kid but trying to make new friends as an adult almost seems impossible, especially during the covid times. I recently started studying at an university and almost all of our classes are online and hence I haven't had the opportunity to really acquaintance myself with anyone. I also moved to a small studio apartment away from my parents and it just sucks living here in a city and having no friends to go out with. I'm too socially anxious to visit a bar by myself and yet I have no one to invite out. I've tried looking up some hobbies and meet ups at my city but there seems to be none that would be aimed for my age group, which is early 20s.

I also feel that I'm way too different from everyone else. I'm very much into classic rock and music in general but my classmates really don't care about music more than on surface level. I've always been interested in more masculine things despite being a woman and I just can't seem to strike up any interesting conversation with other people despite my attempts at being interesting and listening to them. I like reading and writing and nerdy stuff.

It just sucks not talking to anyone for days sometimes. I only talk to my parents. I feel like I'm going crazy over here. Music is pretty much the only thing bringing me comfort at the moment. I guess I wanted to just rant a little but I'd be up for conversation if anyone wanted to just chat.",2022-01-02 18:27:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640805422,40,/r/lonely/comments/ruftlf/making_friends_as_an_adult_is_hard/,,1,13,Making friends as an adult is hard

You may have a Spirit of Rejection. It often teams up with the Spirit of Loneliness, and Orphan Spirits too.

Being denied love and attention by your father growing up can cause you to feel unwanted and unloved. Being denied love and attention from your mother also can cause you to have trust issues. Being bullied as a kid in school can also effect you psychologically. Not having sexual satisfaction, and being sexually frustrated and being rejected by opposite sex, and poor social skills are also symptoms that can manifest.

You are loved. You are loved by God. You are loved by me. You are loved by Angels. And you are loved by each other on this sub.

I take paths meant for many, and face it with nothing but my own wit. 

I travel the streams of life in a boat meant for many, and yet row ever so slowly as I‚Äôm without my fellow man. 

I journey through treacherous heights, knowing there is no hand or rope to remedy even the slightest mistake.

I push through the fog of confusion, knowing I have no lantern of clarity in which the flame of companionship burns ever so bright.

I brave the blizzards of heartbreak knowing there is no shoulder in which to warm myself upon.

I embark on quests that I know I‚Äôll never be prepared for, and wonder why I fail. I find problems in life that I know must include another, and yet I am shocked when I bear witness to the results.

539,ruw4xk,2993,"Here's the good news: It really is okay to be alone-- being comfortable in your own skin and in your own beautiful company. When we're out of balance being alone can make us feel lonely and sorry for ourselves, and we might *still* feel like this even when we're in company. Sometimes when we think of being alone it can bring a fear of feeling lonely or melancholy, as we often associate being alone with these feelings.

Counterbalance this by observing your blessings and it won't be long before you are in a state of gratitude for your own divine company. This is a message from the Fairies Oracle for whoever needs it. It is time to get more creative or resourceful if you feel you are spending too much time alone.

life? such a short word. such endless possibilities. but the ending.. well its unknown until it happens.  progress? is something you make over time. even the tiniest things are progress. (examples of progress: start off as a baby. you babble and stumble every time you try to walk. well look at you now. speaking fluently and walking straight lines.  thats major progress. how about hand writing? you learned as you grew up. which is also progress. and you can also learn progress from observing others goals. take tying a shoe for example. you may have watched adults, other kids, or even videos to tie your shoe. now you don‚Äôt need to wear Velcro anymore. (unless thats the current style) something to be happy about. now think of life this way.  a book. every single book has an ending. whether bad or good. its still an ending. some endings happen with no explanation and some have every detail. now dont think to hard about that. because its not really that important. just a thought. now i would love to explain the meaning of life to you: everything in life has some meaning to be put there. trees = filters the air we breathe. coal = fuel. you = a person on earth who may be struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. sounds familiar huh. well you have a purpose‚Ä¶ and it may seem very incorrect (because of the dark place you might be in) but i think the word purpose has a meaning.. just like you. purpose = the reason something was said, done, or created. so you have a purpose. and that purpose is to progress in life and enjoy it while you can. treat everyday like it might be your last. that doesn‚Äôt mean become reckless, but to slowly make progress over the years. find put more about yourself, enjoy hobbies and find new ones, and most importantly learn to love who YOU truly are. 
with that being said, never end things over i silly mistake. don‚Äôt overthink life. enjoy small things and praise the big. stay safe my love, and whatever you do, never think suicide is an option.

583,rv2g3l,noluckyluke,"Hey.Just registered to REDIT a few days ago and I must admit there are so many sad stories out there. I have been reading for 3 hours now and I am glad I am not the only one feeling such a way. I know there are much worse stuff out there than my problem but I hope there is someone that can give some advice and understand where I am coming from.

I am a 40 year old lonely guy that struggles to make friends. I dont have family so when I do find a friend I really attached myself to that person. Not in a creepy way but I put him or her first. I am married but I feel lonely. All the time. That might sound weird to most people but I wish I had a best friend. You see alot of people out there being friend since kindergarten. Best man at his wedding. Going out camping or even just having a good time together. I wish I had that. Xmas and new years are especially difficult as you see and hear people going amazing places with friends and just having the best time and making awesome memories. Now I sound a bit jealous I know.

Just before lockdown a found a friend. I knew her for a few years but we actually connected in February 2019. Or so I thought. We have not miss a day not speaking to each other from feb 2019 to aug 2021.And we talked about covid, meg and harry (the royals), animals, travel and and and. When the lockdown was ‚Äúlifted‚Äù, I walked with her and her dog twice a day for more than a year. It was just nice sharing simple things together. Yes I have a wife as I said. And we share alot of things but having a best friend is something I always wanted. They know each other. Actually, they worked together and we as a foursome use to go out.

My best friend lied about multiple things. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I understand you dont need to tell me everything. But isnt a sign of true friendship being truthful to each other? I mean whats the point otherwise. I left it. I thought ok she had her reasons. She started not to message me everyday anymore. Which I accepted its ok. She has her partner and her own life. But then weeks gone by when she would not talk to me. My wife also said she has not spoken to her or her boyfriend recently. I really tried from my side to ask her what has changed but she always said all is fine I dont need to worry. This went on for probably almost 3 months. I hate not knowing where I stand and what is happening. And I asked her multiple times to at least give me some explanation. But nothing happened. Me being unsecure and constantly feeling bad  for ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù, I made the hard choice to let her go. And I tell you, that is not an easy decision. Firstly I thought having a ‚Äúhalf‚Äù best friend is beter than nothing. Its not..I was struggling. So I wrote my final message to her and said that I am sorry for whatever I did and I am not going to message her anymore as I feel kind of embarrassed hounding her for answers. I mean who does that.I was basically on my knees ""please be my friend"". She wrote back attacking me on certain things, but I never replied. 

Xmas and new years has come and gone and she has not tried to reconcile. I fact she has moved on. I feel so sad. I know I made the choice but was hoping you know. I know friendship is not about what you put into it. Or how much, but I feel I waisted almost 2 years of my life being her friend. Does that sound weird? Here I am, looking on the internet for an answer, crying, depressed and she has lived her life as normal. I know it‚Äôs a strange thing to explain. And I am not explaining it correctly but I feel she left a big hole. I feel really really empty if that makes sense.

I did try to focus on exercising, series or hobbies and stuff like that. I know from therapy and experience doing or trying nothing is not helping the situation. Its not working. In fact I stopped doing exercising now. I always come back to losing my best friend. I really miss her. I wonder why it is so easy for people just to walk away as if the other person never existed. I know it happens daily but if you are at the receiving end....IT SUCKS.

I really not sure why I wrote this here. Maybe someone has had the same experience. Maybe someone has some good advice

I don't know if i'm crazy posting it on the internet, maybe it's a cry for help or maybe it's an attempt at communication, hoping that perhaps someone would look and say something, it's nothing too.

I'm not a very interesting person in general, i just get the need to tell the people i care about my updates, and well, since i'm lacking in that department at the moment (they don't want to care back), nobody is interested, that's fine i guess.

I guess i prefer to be alone, sometimes i wish these people would be my friends but they don't want to and at the moment, i don't give a shit, i am a little tired of being there for people and the moment i need someone to be there for me, they're nowhere to be found.

I'm already in a really bad state, having them just, turn off their ears at these moments or ghosting me really drove me to stop talking to them as well.

598,rv3znd,LeggingsAreMyJam,"The week before Christmas, the woman who had told me that she was with me for the rest of our lives very suddenly decided that she no longer wanted any of those things. On a Fri I was asked to move out, on a Sat I was told we were no longer getting married, and on Sun I was told she wished to be single. This after a relationship that was the most solid thing I personally had ever had in my life, leaving my entire world shattered. Via texts. 

to say I was hit hard, would be a criminal understatement. Completely blindsided by all this (I was actually in the process of planning family activities for that weekend that *she* suggested for our children (separate relationships) and ourselves. I spiraled. Hard. I have CPTSD, so finding ""love"" and a healthy partnership/relationship where I feel safe is so very difficult for me. This has made me feel that I'll never be able to trust again. 

After the split, I reached out to my entire support structure. I raised the alarm, so to speak. The response that I got back was so awfully disheartening. 

I'll admit that the timing was terrible. It was the week of the biggest holiday in the US, and I was asking my peer support group to help me instead of taking that time with their families. But then the holidays ended. I've reached out to them all several times since then, and I've just basically been ghosted by those I considered my friends and chosen family (I don't have any bio fam anymore since I came out as trans many years ago). 

This has left me feeling absolutely terrible. My SI has never been higher, but I've also accepted that I'm ""not allowed to die"" so long as I have a child that depends on me so I just idealize it daily knowing that someday all this pain will end. I've come to realize that I truly cannot rely on anyone when things get hard, and that absolutely terrifies me. Worst, before this, I thought I had a small, but mighty group of people in my corner. Now, I've come to learn that there's literally no one there with me, and I'm just so very tired. 

I'm struggling folks. Usually when I create posts asking for help like this on various subs, I get no response, but I wanted to try one more time, because I'm just that bad. Life carries no meaning to me in this solitary existence. I am wholly unlovable, and I don't know how to move forward alone.

617,rv6t0k,[deleted],"From being a daydreamer kid sitting at the corner of the class, to being a 24(M) years old. Yes, I have known a lot of people. Most people don't like my vibe and other times I don't like theirs. I've had good friends, few. Few means like 2 or 3 who could be honest to me at all times. But times have gone by. After grad, in college I still maintained a straight face being a terrible loner and hiding my vulnerability. I met many people who were at different paths of their own. Some were yeah hi hello bye. Some were good enough to ask. Some are still in contact after 2 years of graduation. But in reality, there's no one. It's wake up, do your work, back to bed and sleep. Life's been fair to me, most times. Now I have enough maturity to embrace myself. I go out by myself. My parents do accompany me most times. They know I don't have anyone to hang out to. Why so lonely? You might ask. You see, I've had friends who stabbed my back. Lying to me in my face and telling me that I'm soft, weak and just another happy go lucky person. I've met many people in these years most people find me naive, stubborn, narcissist and a highly witty and over sarcastic person. I'm not narcissist. But I've chosen to be a hermit,if that supports my answer. I feel I would be better if I'm alone. But I still feel lonely and bored all the time. New to this. Hope atleast someone can tell me something which will be helpful. Cheers.

687,rvjnzb,figurativelyfree,"Hello reddit! Hope y'all are having a much better time than me, either in action or in thoughts; and a big hug to all of you (for those who don't like hugs, I hope fist bumps will suffice), and I ultimately hope you all a fantastic new year.

This is a venting exercise that I hope will at least unload some feelings I have that have been eating at me for quite some time, and in doing so, I believe should make me feel slightly better. Selfish reasons, I know. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I will try to keep this as short as possible (update: I failed üòî).

I am a 35 year-old human male, with almost no friends, no relationships (or dating) history, no past sexual/intimate experiences at all, almost zero outdoor experiences (started hiking last year with a total of two hikes), and with a severe crippling depression, which lately started to turn into a soul crushing beast that tries to suffocate the living shit out of me, which can be a little bit inconvenient.

I find it difficult to connect to people; which led me to currently having 4 close friends, three of them I share nothing with. They are still good friends and everything, but apart from sharing similar sense of humor, we don't really connect in almost anything and we don't really understand what the other goes through when we vent to each other. But we make do, and we manage to come up with enough understanding and distraction to serve the purpose.

Also the people I seem to connect with fade away in the long term, and as such I didn't manage to maintain a friendship with people I connected with for more than a year, which is also a little bit inconvenient and feeds my overthinking and insecurities in a strongly negative way.

In addition to all of this, my life was greatly affected by a religious transformation I had to go through on my own over the past five years, something that had held me back in life, have kept me away from my friends and family, and was the main reason why I struggled to find people to connect with or have relationships in general. This transformation reshaped my character in many different ways, and changed so much of my views about life.

It has also led me to an important fact: that life is full of possibilities \*gasps\*, and these possibilities include meeting someone you connect with, fulfilling a lifelong dream, continuously live life one day at a time, or be alone. I have also come to terms with the fact that there is nothing wrong with any of these possibilities, as long as you know what you want out of life and learn to make the most out of it on your own terms. Except that the one where I could end up alone would suck a little bit because I am inherently a social person. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So I have made the life changing decision to not change anything about my life at all, just do the things I enjoy doing, pursue the dreams I want to pursue, meet people and interact with them; if I connect with some of them, that's a fantastic bonus; if that connection leads to something more than a friendship, even better. The only difference is that I won't hold back when it comes to making the most out of my time on this earth, or other planetary bodies.

I am also learning how to live with disappointments, how to overcome them, and how to limit their influence on my enjoyment of life. That bit is quite difficult especially with overthinking and with that soul crushing monster squeezing my heart out, but I am slowly controlling these aspects of my life, and also I am not giving up to that prick that easily.

Well, that's that. Thank you for reading this article, I very much appreciate it; and sorry for the long rant.

Have the best year yet!",2022-01-04 02:53:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641065248,1,/r/lonely/comments/rvjnzb/tis_that_fucking_time_of_the_year_again_a_new/,,0,0,Tis that fucking time of the year again - A new year rant

One thing that I have noticed in the recent past is that I feel so alone even when around other people. I've honestly had a decent number of people try to be my friend. It's like I don't like them enough or something. I think they are good people and I'm standoffish. Then of course I look like a jerk. Then I get lonely. It's like people don't excite me anymore. They haven't for so long. I have people that hit me up but no real close friendships and it depresses me. My life is so bland. Also, I should be modeling a healthy social life for my children. That's another layer of sadness on top. I've been to therapy. I have a daily mindfulness and journal habit going for a while now. I take meds. I need action. I also need answers. Why am I like this?

I DON'T REALLY WANNA FOCUS ON WORK, and instead have found out the following things on the internet in the last half hour:

* Yves Saint Laurent now sells condoms - $4 each, sold individually. Gives a new meaning to the phrase ""expensive as fuck""
* The US had one MILLION COVID-19 cases today. We gotta get our shit together.
* Babe Ruth hit most of his home runs AFTER Betty White (RIP) was born.
* Brown Butter Chocolate Chip cookies look REALLY good, and not that hard to make.

716,rvmpku,Celerchel,"The last two years have been very rough.  


My personal life consists of going to work every day and then coming home, doing fuck all until I sleep and go to work the next day.  


I don't really take enjoyment from my old hobbies anymore. I used to love to fish, do other stuff outdoors, things like that.  


The only thing I take real pleasure from anymore is roleplaying on tabletop and discord. The high adventure stuff is fun, but lately I've just been craving the slice of life kind of stuff, because I can play someone who has value, is in a relationship, has stuff going in their life, someone who is loved and is able to give it without being a socially awkward weirdo. It's something I crave so, so much that even this form of getting it by proxy is just satisfying. Up until I take a moment to realize that it's all ficitonal, and then I just end up feeling empty inside again.  


I have friends and family, and they are supportive, but I feel like a burden. They are all moving forward and getting all of the good things in life. I don't really like parties or the bar scene like they do, so the only time I get real social interaction is on game night. They treat it as a hobby, but it's become essential to me for the reasons above, and it's the only time I get social interaction too.  


When I'm not being a nerd and wasting countless hours on the internet, I watch romance movies now too, because I want that so much.  


I just hope there is either something after this life, maybe someway to experience some of the stories I've created first hand, or some sort of reincarnation. I hate my life, I want to get off this ride, but I don't want to be even more of a burden and cause the few people I do care about pain if I leave early.  


At least typing all of this out helps, if only a little.",2022-01-04 05:31:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641273565,7,/r/lonely/comments/rvmpku/very_lonely_as_of_late/,,0,12,Very lonely as of late
717,rvmvnf,Hidden_Escape,"I don't know how long its been since I've last cried. Tonight has been one hell of an emotional rollercoaster and I just couldn't help myself. I had many thoughts go through my head some about who I actually am, what I want, and all I know is I don't want to be lonely. Yes, I have friend and family but I still end up feeling lonely at times. Its not just someone being there that makes you not feel lonely, its more than that. Its the emotional aspect. Being there, listening, connecting, and caring for each other. I might need to just get out of my shell and do what I want for a while. Maybe I need to travel and live somewhere different. Maybe I just need a change of pace is all. I just want to feel like I'm needed and wanted on a deep emotional level with someone. I've been lonely this way far too long and it's just recently getting to me. I hate crying and It just keeps happening over and over tonight. Maybe I needed this much of an emotional crash to realize what I'm missing. Hopefully it passes with time and I realize what I need and want.

I'm sorry if this got you emotional it wasn't meant for that. It was a way to help myself and others realize that things will eventually get better. Good things will come for those who open up to themselves and be truthful and comfortable with who they are. Truthfully I'm not entirely sure who I am, or what I want at the moment, but I'm going to try and push forward.

718,rvmzcm,Top-Treat3940,"I have officially lost all of my friends to their relationships. 

I'm the last single friend of all 3 of my main friend groups and although I am absolutely ecstatic that my friends are happy, it's hard. We all used to hangout almost daily but as they got into relationships, their priorities shifted (understandably so) and their lives began to surround their boyfriends and they completely forgot about me.

Hanging out with them is either them going on a double date with me 5th wheeling, and if we decide to have a girls night out all they do is talk about their boyfriends or call them. We still have normal conversations, but there is no escaping the fact that I feel lonely in every crowded room. I recently went to a new years eve party and I must admit that the countdown was a reminder of how lonely I am.

I don't have the best luck with guys and they approach everyone in my group except me- it just hurts.

I've talked to them about it, and they are sympathetic and try to make me feel better, but the truth still remains: there's no way I'm getting them back unless I, myself, get a boyfriend OR keep agreeing to being an unwanted tag along while everyone sucks each others faces off.

775,rvvo5p,TiaTigress,"So, to start I randomly meet a guy about eight years ago at a concert. Gave me his number but I lost it. I was so mad at myself. We had such a great time. Clich√© as it is, I knew I wanted to be close to him as soon as I met him. My friend had hung out with his friend that night and also exchanged numbers. I was totally bummed about losing his number. I felt some strong connection. Turns out he got mine from his friend so it all worked out!

We chatted, fucked, hung out many times for years. It was always so easy and flawless. Everything was like a dream. Granted we never established a relationship so it was always just mutual. Due to distance I never got to try and have a relationship with him, but my heart aches for his company. I always felt that we belonged together. I was always afraid he was too good for me, due to my lack of self esteem. 

I had spent some time in the hospital unexpectedly and lost all his information and no way to contact him. Unintentionally ghosting. (I was in a coma.) Once I got well again, I was longing for his company and then there he was again. Always there whenever I needed or wanted him. Always showing up at the right times. We both saw other people (obviously) over the years. I always had a feeling we would be together eventually. 

Now for the fun part. Even though we both are seeing other people, we talk everyday. The connection made my heart race (amongst other things.) I was looking at his social media and there it was. His name tagged. My heart shattered as I saw it. A million perfect memories, perfectly ruined. A baby announcement. 

Today, I found out that he is having a baby. 

I don‚Äôt really know what I am wanting from this post. Maybe just to vent, say it to myself, try to not feel the insane heart wrenching emptiness that I‚Äôm feeling. 

I‚Äôm a 33 year old female that knows much better. He never wanted me or else why wouldn‚Äôt he have said so. This is the end of something I‚Äôve been holding onto with hope for years.

 I have been socializing... but it is always me initiating. I keep making plan, keep texting people, being active in servers/group chats but all that effort gets ignored. The moment I stop texting.. the moment I stop reaching out. They all stop talking/hanging out with me. 
Being talking to this person pretty much every day for a good month and a half. Thought things were going good and that I finally found someone who connects with me... but just to test (this might sound horrible) , I stopped texting for a few days. And nothing. Absolutely nothing. And now...heck, I would be glad if I get a reply in a day's time. 

It has always been like this since I was a kid. I pretty much spend summers texting/hanging out with no one. Just me and only me in my room. I had people to talk to in school. But that's it. I just want somebody to be by my side. Somebody to rely on. Somebody who actually puts in the effort and listens. Of course, people say positive shit like "" things will be better,"" "" u will fine somebody,"" "" go to a therapist,"" "" start doing stuff on your own. Try to enjoy the time by yourself,"" but why can't they understand it is not that easy. I have been doing stuff on my own for pretty much my whole life. I don't wanna spend another second by myself. The more I live,  the more I realize that I will be alone. That spending time by myself is twisting what's wrong and what's right. And so when I actually interact with people, I only realize how abnormal I am. The only thing I can say is loneliness makes u cold, stoic, and eventually u start living in your own world to cope with it.

This might be messy, jumping from spot to spot. But bare with it pls.",2022-01-04 19:24:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602293973,0,/r/lonely/comments/rw2epi/what_do_i_do/,,0,5,What do I do?
805,rw2h3i,Lorytm,"First of all. I apologise sincerely if this will be seeming more like a child's whining. I do not do that on purpose. I just let out my frustrations not much and they come out like this when I do. I do not intend to behave like ""I'm the worst victim"" and blah blah blah since that is not true and I don't want to make anyone feel like their sufferings are not valid/not as valid as what I may have now. 

So again. I apologise and thank everyone who will read this in advance. Even if not all of this.

So. Argued with my mom cause my roommate (4 in total including me) in the house I rented for university did not understand that I asked her (E) and another roommate of ours (F) to use the shower of the bathroom I use since I will have to work in the hospital for traineeship. My mom wanted me to take care of it. But I hate to do things like these. Every time I say something to get respected I cause a mess and end up misunderstood. Like this time. Since she took it as ""an oppression"" since she thought I could not allow them to bring friends over... one question. WHEN DID I SAY IT? I JUST ASKED ""Please not use the shower I use because it's a personal hygiene local"". In a POLITE WAY. I never said you couldn't go out and/or bring friends over. So there goes the argue

Then I had unease again because I have been experiencing much unease with myself (AMAB) and I want to be a girl (not gonna expand this too much. And it is *not* to create drama. Just saying it to... I guess put everything here).

And remembered that my family is absolutely unsupportive. That the only time my mother barely talked to a specialist about this sensations he said ""It is not about gender, it is more probable than he has autism"". So great. (Again. I sincerely apologise if I am being too childish. I do not want to create drama. I just need to let out some stressüòû)

And also remembered that I can't really differentiate friendships from ""Something more"" and have fear that I'll never have a person for me since I can't understand if I have romantic attraction or not. I know it is not a priority or anything... I just feel so alone cause no one in my physical life understands me and the only people I can be sincere with are from other countries and I only talk to them online.

And now I've been closed in the bathroom for more than 30 minutes. Sat down. Talking with people on the phone trying to kill the time. Feeling like I want to die. Love these daysüòû

806,rw2hbq,w_a_t_t_e_u,"For the context, I am a 19yo french man currently in college. I always had up and down in my life, my father died when I was 11, I have been bullied during secondary school but in the last year of highschool, I thought I was over with all this negativity. I wasn't the popular type but I had friends, even a best friend who was like a brother to me. I had ambition, hopes and dreams, even had some romantic relationships during summer. 

But when the pandemic started I began college, everything changed so fast. As you may know we had a bunch of lockdown and since I studied economy in highschool, learning info and electronic in online classes wasn't an easy task. I tried my best but I failed and now I'm still in first year, working hella hard to pass. So I don't go out a lot and when I do, I'm always worried about college. The reason I'm not going out a lot is also because I lost most of my friends from highschool.
When I moved for the college, I tried to stay in touch with everyone. But I most of them already had a new group of friends and the relationships quickly faded. I also made friend in college but since I failed and they passed, we don't talk to each other much. I know they may have more work, but I feel abandoned, since they still see each other everyday.
Now everything would have been fine if I still had my best friend by my side. But we argued over something stupid and now I'm alone.

This is why now more than ever, I feel crushed and empty. I lost all interest in my hobbies. I used to play basketball and videogames but it's not the same anymore. I have been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety but I know that this may be nothing compared to other people in this sub. So I feel more and more shit. Everyday. I tried to get new friend in my classroom, but I don't  have this connection I had with my other friends. So I put my earpods and come back home as the classes are over. Everyday looks the same and I don't think I will hold it any longer. But I'm also worried about my future and what will I become if I drop out. My family will probably reign me and I will never be able to recover I guess. So I live like a nobody, faking the same emotions and having the same days. 


I just wanted to write. Maybe it helped, maybe not. Maybe I tried to get attention but I will probably never see this post again.",2022-01-04 19:27:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615972628,5,/r/lonely/comments/rw2hbq/why_everything_became_so_monotone/,,0,0,Why everything became so monotone ?

808,rw2m7a,Woko_O,"Hello to everyone

Different type of lonely. That's what I am. Kind of. Most of people here are sad that they are lonely. I am quite too, but I already made peace with it. I am almost 31, not good in relationships with girls. I am not able to express my feelings properly and when I do, other half does not feel it the same way. Also I don't speak when I don't need to. That's life. 

As I am getting older, even though I am still young, I can feel that most people of my age already started having family, weddings and all that weird stuff. Which is allright and I am happy for them. Everybody deserves to be happy. Or everybody can taste the other side of it. I don't mind it but I can feel my circle is getting smaller and smaller. 

I like being lonely. For some time. I can even or would like to live in a small cabin, somewhere in the nature for a few months of a year. Maybe one day

Right now, I have well paid job (in my country), have my own flat (mortgage), some money on my accounts and 25-30 paid days free of work. I am not a career chaser. I want to do my job properly, the best I can and that's it. Some management bullshit can suck my balls.

People here. Who are like to be themselves, who like to be alone even they know that future can be rough. What would you or what have you done to fill up your time? Travel? Gave 100% to some hobby? 

This year, when corona shit will go away slightly, I would love to travel with my car and my bike and connect free time, traveling and my hobby to one single experience package. But still, I am bit afraid I'll do it alone. In a different way.

I'm watching The Matrix Reloaded and it's at the orgy scene in Zion. I was super immersed in the lore by the this point. But when the scene hit, I could see myself being in that same orgy and just standing in a corner by myself feeling like shit.

It's kinda funny tbh. I mean there surely couldn't have been a 1:1 ratio of guys and girls willing to orgy consensually. I wonder what it felt like to be alone in Zion in the last party before (what seemed like) the end of the world. I can almost imagine that last-minute panic. ""What if I never kiss a girl before I die?"" sort of vibe.

I stopped watching though. I turned this film on to escape from this world. Romantic scenes drag me back to it and to my own low self worth.

This is also why I hated Matrix Resurrection so much. it disregarded the Iore entirely to make the whole film about the Neo and Trinity love arc.",2022-01-05 05:13:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1551677759,44,/r/lonely/comments/rwexd1/whenever_i_see_romantic_scenes_in_movies_i/,,0,10,"Whenever I see romantic scenes in movies, I disassociate and immediately feel bad.

914,rwh462,UnburdenedCrow,"My friends in college whom I've been friends with for the last decade don't talk to me anymore. I thought we got along so well. These weren't regular friends.  We had sleep overs, went bowling, swimming at the beach. We've shared secrets, laughs.  Now all three have a girlfriend.  Not that it bothers me. I understand they have their lives and I have mine.  I'm always looking out for them and it's probably not healthy since they don't do the same.  I am an enjoyer of the poetic and lyrical arts. I love movies.  I love video games.  I love weight lifting.  I'm not afraid of talking to people.  I enjoy talking to people.  I can't help but feel this empty void that slowly fills my heart every day.  I've felt so tired. All I can do is sleep.  I don't quite understand it.  I feel empty.  Like there is no reason to push on.  Yet I'm too cowardly to off myself.  I dunno.  It weighs on my mind every day. Get up, work, go home.  Rinse and repeat.  I don't have a boring life by any means but that's how I feel.  My friends were what I valued so much but now without them who am I?  I'm nothing. Nobody knows me like they do.  And who cares enough to care like they did for me.  Its making me shed a tear right now thinking about it.  Where did the time go.  On top of this. My family doesn't respond to my texts anymore.  Not even a merry Christmas or anything back.  I'm not even an after thought for my family besides my 12 year old brother.  I am alone.  I just want to sleep and not wake man.  The only one keeping me here on this planet is my brother.  I'm tired of watching out for people. Taking care of people.  Treating friends like family.  Tired of caring about people.  Tired of being manipulated by women.  Tired of being disrespected at work.  Tired of paying bills.  I may be 18 but I want no part of this world any more.  I shouldn't have been born.  It should've been someone else.  I'm so tired. 
One plus to this though is that sleeping things off makes everything feel better. 
Go ahead and roast me, bash me, insult me, say I'm young.  I know that your words will just be used to try to prevent me from doing something rash but they aren't genuine. I'm not going to commit suicide that's for sure.  I can't cap myself as long as my little brother is around.  I care about him too much to do that to him.  But nobody else is keeping me here otherwise.  But if I die of natural cause or from some freak accident I can confidently say that I have no regrets.  This is my story.  Just another ghost waiting to return to the earth.  My ""friends"" tell me to find a woman but that won't save me.  Nothing can.  Nothing can heal or mend the amount of permanent pain I feel inside because of them.  If I'm going to find a woman I don't want her to be an emotional crutch since that's what my ""friends"" think I need.  I'm going to meet a real person.  I'm tired of ingenuine people.  Now I'm going to sleep it off. Goodnight.",2022-01-05 07:26:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641119128,2,/r/lonely/comments/rwh462/im_kinda_struggling/,,0,1,I'm kinda struggling

944,rwm2v0,Cookiesand____,"And I keep thinking about it. It touched me, guys. 
I was at Walmart with my two kids picking up a few things and she was there with her kids, we ran across each other while shopping and did the polite head-nod acknowledgment we all do. 
Then we ended up at subway together.
It was fun to notice our differences and similarities.
Then when she and her family went to leave, she smiled waved and said goodbye to us.

It was the friendliest interaction I‚Äôve had in years. I think I might have been rude because at first I was surprised she spoke to me. 
For context, I was raised in an abusive family and when I cut them out of my life, I also cut out my friend group. Because when you have been raised in an abusive family, you typically don‚Äôt make good friend choices and when you wake up, you wake up to all of it. I haven‚Äôt made other friends yet, I‚Äôm a stay at home mom. The only social interaction I get is from men who try to sleep with me and my partner isn‚Äôt much of a conversationalist.

Clearly I am in dire need of friendships and social interaction.

Ill figure it out.
But, to that sweet wonderful woman who took the time to see me, I love her. 
If you see people today, be kind to them. It might mean so much more than you realize.",2022-01-05 12:43:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637326851,28,/r/lonely/comments/rwm2v0/another_mother_smiled_at_me_and_said_goodbye_the/,,0,4,Another mother smiled at me and said goodbye the other day

Coming to the point, I don't know how many of you guys watch hololive, or Vtubers for that matter. But I recently watched Houshou Marine's last video, one where the viewer POV rests on her lap as she strokes the viewer's hair. This video made me think about how many lonely peeps might have replayed that video over and over again, just for the feeling of being loved. How many people might be waiting everyday for her (and the other hologirls) to upload their videos or streams, as their only pleasure in an otherwise lonely and monotonous life. This is further evidenced by just how many people donate to the hologirls, some peeps even donating fairly large sums, just to have the girls call out their names. 

This made me think, do the hologirls inadvertently cause more harm than good by being the metaphorical light of their viewer's day? Many people are obsessed with them,  many watch their streams religiously, ignoring their own health. And many might be doing so out of sheer loneliness.

 I just want to hear your takes on this issue. And how the hologirls or the community could help these people.",2022-01-05 17:43:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641175034,2,/r/lonely/comments/rwsglm/houshou_marines_most_recent_headpat_short/,,0,0,Houshou Marine's most recent headpat short

986,rwtmpr,apianoenthusiast,"18m. i don‚Äôt really know what i think will happen from writing this. i‚Äôm sure many of you are dealing with your own struggles right now, alone or with the support of others. my problems are just an addition to the plenty that are already here in this world but i don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to and i need to write down what i‚Äôm feeling for someone to see even if they don‚Äôt choose to respond. i am so emotionally drained and lonely. i have no friends and no one who i feel emotionally connected to or who i can mutually relate to and understand deeply. looking back at things, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever had real friends. being surrounded with people that i feel i have no connection to has left me feeling empty. i have a caring family and i understand how fortunate i am to have such a family. or maybe i don‚Äôt understand, maybe people will just tell me i‚Äôll never understand BECAUSE i was born into such a family. maybe i‚Äôll just be made to feel like my problems shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as problems, rather they should be thought of a result of my own pathetic self or something. 

i really just want a friend. nothing more than that. no materialistic things, no social verification, nothing like that. i just want a friend who i can have an actual deep bond with that isn‚Äôt superficial or corrupted with high levels of selfishness. i have always tried to be unconditionally kind to others and include others who did not have anyone into fun activities to have someone and in the end, i‚Äôve only been insulted, humiliated, and made to feel like i don‚Äôt belong here in return.

i‚Äôm tired and i feel hopeless. i‚Äôm not suicidal or self harm, however, painlessly disappearing forever would be nice if it were possible. i‚Äôm not sure how older people have lived for so long. i can‚Äôt even imagine myself being any much older. not even 22. i mean like 50 years old? i would be so bored and dead inside. i hope i don‚Äôt seem like a pessimist or a cynical person. i believe in kindness and can see it in those who have been raised in ways that have led them to become ill-intentioned and hurtful without feeling remorse or shame. i‚Äôm just not happy right now.

again, just needed to say how i‚Äôm feeling at the moment. to anyone struggling, i truly hope something works out for you and if you have no one for help, don‚Äôt feel afraid to pm. to those who are happy, i‚Äôm happy for you. please appreciate what you have with the most sincerest gratitude and don‚Äôt lose sight of it or yourself. there are many who wish they could have what you have. many people have gone through the same efforts, struggles, and setbacks as you but things did not turn out the same for them.

I'm just needing a bit of encouragement or something like that cause I guess as you can expect I feel alone, probably not nearly as lonely as those who are truly suffering from what I've seen and I do hope you all get what you desire. But I have friends, family and all that which I interact with pretty regularly but I just play videogames and crack jokes with my friends and I hardly ever talk with my family about anything besides school and just little jobs I may do around the house and I don't have someone to talk to about what I'm always thinking and have bottled up in my head and it's just getting a bit too much for me now. I'm struggling to find any reason to continue trying in school, I have fuck all social skills with girls as I have been in all boys schools my whole life so a girlfriend isn't an option right now and like hell I would be able to talk with my family about these things and I wouldn't tell my friends cause their one of the few good things I got and I'm not risking putting it in jeopardy of some kind. Also I'm hoping this doesn't count as personal information for the rules.

Sorry if I rambled on a bit but I just finally had to say at least something at least to whoever may see this and I apologize if perhaps I'm not in the right subreddit for what I'm saying, I am still a bit new to all this and being anonymous on the internet with all these people to chat to so thank you if you have read this just give me some advice if you have any to spare.

I've just been out of a 4.5 year relationship and it's getting increasingly unbearable. I've noticed that when I'm hanging out with my friend (he's the only friend I have where I am), I feel so much better and so different than when I'm home alone with my thoughts, but I can't ask him to see me everyday because unlike me he's got a life. I'm currently unemployed, dropped out of my school, so I live with my parents for now. So I spend most of my days doing nothing and trying to stay busy either by watching stupid stuff on TV or sometimes actually being productive to not think about it but it isn't enough... I've seen how my ex is already doing much better and barely thinks of me now just because she gets to see her friends every day in her school and I wish I had that, I wish I could be surrounded by people I like every day, I'm convinced it would help me get over her and get better overall much faster, being with people makes me forget about how ugly my life is and it's so refreshing. 

The thing is I can't go back to school right now because I left where I used to live temporarily to live with my parents as I said for now, to move back (probably not even in the same town) when I feel ready and better. I'm only here for about 4-6 months I think. 

So I was wondering if any of you guys know if there's anything I can do to be around people and have real human interactions every day... The only thing I could think of was working at my gym but I'm not looking for customer/employee type of interactions. I just want to talk to people and maybe have fun with them.

Almost every conversation about my loneliness leads to this sentence. And that‚Äôs the end of the conversation, like it‚Äôs a cure or something, without any explanation.

For an unknown reason I built a stereotype right in my head stating that happiness is a lie, is a sign of not thinking deeply about things that happen around you and to you. So, the only people I can trust are the ones who struggle, not the opposite ones.

With this in mind, thinking about the statement makes me confused, because I would preferably love the ones who doesn‚Äôt love themselves, because I know that they are real.

Additionally, I think that overcoming the odds together is highly powerful for true relationship.

I just need to vent. I‚Äôm so sick of just being alive. I know all my problems are my fault, I tell myself I may have underlying issues but deep down I‚Äôm just an asshole. I have horrible anger issues, and I throw temper tantrums over the tiniest things. It‚Äôs like one minute I‚Äôm perfectly fine, then I‚Äôm hyper aware of everything and freak out.

As childish as it sounds, I just want to be special to someone, their favorite, their whole world, instead of basically just being an extra in their life.

I honestly don‚Äôt blame anyone for me not being able to have that; after all I‚Äôm really not an interesting, unique person and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm too fun to be around.

I don't even really want to put it on a writing group for some reason. I wrote the final action scene of my book and it was just a really emotional moment for me. It's only the first draft so I'll end up doing plenty of rewrites, but I don't even care. It was like the culmination of a decade of work all summed up in one sentence and I almost started crying because it's been a real struggle. All I have to do now is tie up the ending, then I can edit all three books in one go.

I know there are people in my life who would probably enjoy the news, but it never feels like they actually care unless it's making a profit of some kind. I don't know, maybe it doesn't matter.",2022-01-06 15:40:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601814438,32,/r/lonely/comments/rxhg7r/big_milestone/,,0,9,Big milestone

1127,rxjp2g,[deleted],"I've been living on my own for a year. The lack of genuine human contact has gotten to me to the point where idk how to interact with others anymore.

Getting out of bed early in the morning, brushing my teeth, figuring out what to have for breakfast. It's all so exhausting. I'll be working from home for the next year and taking virtual classes for at least 6 months, and I have no clue how I'll keep this up.

I feel like I can't talk to my friends openly about this. Much less my family, with whom I find it harder and harder to get along. I get to see them from time to time, but it's so much different from living with someone. I had a good friend visit my city and who stayed over with me for a week, and she just brightened up the place with her energy; she left yesterday, and I already miss her. Meanwhile, there's this guy I really like, but I don't want to be obnoxious/approach him from a place of ""lack,"" so I just post IG stories for him to see, and sometimes he would respond to them. I don't expect anything from him. It's just nice to know that we're still talking after we met in a trip a few months ago, we stayed in a hotel for 3 days and I just never felt so safe next to someone else.

I just have no clue how to be comfortable in my own loneliness. I used to enjoy my alone time when I didn't live alone, but now that it's all I'm used to, it's not a pleasant feeling anymore. I long to change my life completely, but I feel powerless to do so.",2022-01-06 17:18:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/rxjp2g/what_can_i_even_do_i_have_no_clue_how_to_get_out/,,0,5,What can I even do?

1182,rxtob7,artemiswhore,"Im in high school, i have exactly 3 people i would call my ""friends""? i think. i dont know. one of them i have known since i was 4 years old. the other one i used to be really good friends up until 2 years ago, when she started talking to my 3rd ""friend"", and basically abandoned me. 
all 3 of them have said so much hurtful stuff me, and i often want to just stop talking to them, i think i hate them. but i cant stop talking to them, because then i will be completely alone.
at the start of 2021, i was so excited. i was determined to hang out more with one of my friends, and use her to meet other people. and then the summer came. i spent time with my friend, but, i never really got to meet other people. of course, she offered me if i wanted to hang out with some other people, but my mum is very strict, so i always had to end up saying no, because im not allowed to go out that late.
the highlight of my summer was going to a local festival with that friend, because we accidentally met a bunch of her friends. that was really the only time of the summer, where i felt like i might have a chance of having friends. guess what? i've never seen any of those people again.
on november 27, she asked me if i wanted to hang out with her, another girl i know and then a girl, whos name i had only heard.
omg. thats was literally the best day of 2021.
i was literally crying from happiness when walking home.
on ig i follow a lot of people from my city, im obsessive. i have stalked all of them, i purposefully walk past the places in the city, where they might be. i did it a lot in the summer. i was walking through the skatepark like 10 times a day at one point. 
and i see al those people posting about how they spend their time, and they all have friends and friend groups, and im just so jealous.

1262,ry1mxe,tiredplantss,"I‚Äôm a freshman and I did academically well fall semester, but I more or less failed to make friends too. My college is on the smaller side but the grind culture is kinda crazy (think a typical Ivy League rejects school). I‚Äôm not on bad terms with my roommate exactly but I can also physically feel every time he brings people over how conversations don‚Äôt really include me, and sometimes when I do interject and make a comment about the topic at hand I can kinda feel with every awkward conversation that people on my floor think I‚Äôm strange. I really did put in an effort, especially the first month, this was the chance to start over that I‚Äôd waited for my entire life. But with each failed conversation with the people who visited my roommate and others on our floor I started avoiding campus/my dorm more and more and staying at home and then driving to school (even though the commute kinda sucks). I grew tired of feeling like the odd one out that I just decided to give my roommate the dorm. For finals it was completely my roommates, I commuted to classes and stopped by later on to pick up some of my stuff and I was gone. I‚Äôm somewhat outgoing I guess, I don‚Äôt shut up if you get me talking, but what I say seems to have no weight or meaning. I don‚Äôt want to go back to that dorm or feeling like the strange roommate, especially since I was gone so much towards the later part of the semester.

1278,ry3p22,adreamisawish,"Why do I only fall in love with people who want to use me and discard me? I'm perpetually just the person people spend time with until they find someone better. The worst part is that ""someone better"" is usually one of my friends which makes the loneliness even worse. They never cared; nobody seems to anyway. If I'm so easily discarded and forgotten then why do I have to keep going? There's a handful of people in my life that say they would be really upset if I were to unalive myself but I only hear from them every few months. It's great I can be there for them when they need me but I spend the vast majority of my time alone and wishing something could fulfill me. All I feel is emptiness. I can only sleep so much to avoid getting lost in my brain. 

I wish I could stop feeling this way but I don't think it's going away. I've been trying to convince myself for over 20 years that tomorrow will be better but I think I have to concede this is it. This is my life. Nobody is excited to hear from me, except maybe my mom and her only advice to me is to suck it up and keep going. But why? Nobody else has to live in my head, nobody else has to feel this way every day all day for the rest of their lives. I'm so tired. I just wish there was one decent human being out there that wanted me in their lives and enjoyed spending time with me. I'm just a burden to everyone.

I just need to speak a bit. About 4 months ago, I joined high school, and of course with it came the stress of getting to a new place and having to meet new people. It was even harder since I really liked my old class, and none of them were in the same class as me. Now the thing is that, the new people in my class, they get along very well, and I, of course, don't (r/lonely what did you expect). I don't know why, but since summer holidays, I can't socialize, at all. Everytime everybody gathers up for doing something, I'm either not interested or just scared of something, yet probably nothing. It feels so wrong in this class, I feel like I'm the odd one out, and if it continues for 3 years, I might just drop off.

I'm on Holiday right now, and I just got home from a little party with the people of the older class, and just like I feared, I can't keep a conversation with them anymore. I knew I was an introvert, a big one for sure, but I can't even speak with the people I like? The only person I really talked to is my best friend (only friend) which was in the same class as me for the past 5 years, and he's about the same as me, expect that he never really liked the old class except for a few of them (not hating them, just being neutral). So I basically just sat on the stairs and looked at my phone while everybody was having fun.

I know that at my age, a lot will say it's a phase or something like that, but everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY I've known or know isn't as flawed as I am in socializing (except maybe for my friend).

TL;DR Got in a new class, can't speak to anybody, even to the people I like, and my one and only friend is as sad as me except he doesn't hide it. 

Does anybody know why can't I speak to people I like anymore? What can I do to fix it? Also, even if it may be useless to ask, any ideas of where I could potentially meet new people?",2022-01-07 23:34:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641595601,3,/r/lonely/comments/rylcua/just_need_to_speak_a_bit/,,0,2,Just need to speak a bit

1393,rylt21,AdStrong7621,"It is already bad if you've been raised in a rather conservative environment... or even country. Yes, I live in a 2nd world country where people just act weird about having relationships. I couldn't develop any social skills for that reason and that's probably why I haven't felt the warmth of anyone so far in my life, apart from my family. I'm currently studying + working my ass of to become succesful and I frequently burn out. Especially in those times I wish so bad that I had someone to talk to. During my whole life, I was just a guy who is summoned when needed and I'm getting sick of it. Why I can't deserve the care of someone? Why in the fuck I'm still alone although I'm in a better situation than most of the people I know? Am I really supposed to live in the computer screen all day? I sometimes forget to even speak.

I don't want to think about these anymore. I see that a lot of people are in the same situation as I am but I can't move on from this. Even though sometimes I have very productive days, when it's night time, this shit drags me down. Why I don't have anyone to even hug?

1401,rymts2,BiancaPerezXOXO,"
 So lets start off by giving a summary of who I am.

\- I am 27 and graduated last month with my masters in chemistry

\- I have many interests, but my main hobby is gaming (video games, card game and looking to get into tabletop rpg games). Currently playing Destiny 2 a lot but open to suggestions (I may have the game and just don't know lol) and MTG commander is my go to for cards at the moment.

\- I am a kid at heart and still enjoys things like cartoons, animated movies and anime (although I haven't watch any new anime in a bit).

\- I am open to all genre of music although I find that rap and country are my least favorite and that 80-90 rock, alternative and metal are usually my go to's.

\- I am a hyper-sexual, demi-sexual who's love languages are quality time and physical touch.

\- I prefer open and honest communication in all aspects of a relationship rather than playing ""mind games"". I also do not party, drink alcohol or do drugs and will not participate in said activities (I have actually had people respond to my posts trying to convince me that everyone does these and that I can't find a partner if I don't).

\- Since this has come up a few times, I do eventually want to have biological children with my partner.

So with that covered, why am I here? I am looking to find a life partner. I always find that my ideal partner is also one of my closest friends, so starting as friends and seeing where it goes makes the most sense. So, if you are interested in getting to know each other and/or playing video games together then send me a message.",2022-01-08 00:41:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636787306,3,/r/lonely/comments/rymts2/who_else_is_always_feeling_alone/,,0,1,Who else is always feeling alone

However, this time was different. It was before we'd even met and it seemingly came out of nowhere. We'd been planning our first date and flirting and stuff literally the night before, and nothing happened in-between. Our date was planned for tomorrow and I tried messaging him this morning and I was blocked :/ I just don't know what I keep doing wrong? Do I attract this kind of person? Is there something I can do to stop it happening?
I know it shouldn't hurt but it does.

He was constantly lying to me about everything. he always told me what i wanted to hear and gave me just the right amount of attention to string me along. he was so vulnerable around me that i thought he could never lie to me. recently i found out that almost the entire time he was stringing me along, he had a girlfriend. one he saw regularly. one he could be affectionate with. when i connected all of the dots i blocked him on everything. i‚Äôm not a confrontational person, so i haven‚Äôt had the guts to tell her. i want to really bad but i get filled with so much anxiety that i start to shake and cry.

1421,rypk7r,PsalmoftheSad,"This is a hard pill to swallow, living this life knowing that it's gonna end alone. 



I might not be on the same level as everyone else here, but seeing as there's no real way to gauge how worse off someone else is compared to another person I'm gonna assume we're all in the same boat here and we're already well aware how this is all gonna go down in the end. If that's true, then uh.. I guess let's toast to... What do we toast to?



Last night I had a dream that I met someone. There was a whole backstory about her too, like she was British and I had to travel hours to see her. Needless to say it was a weird dream and I fuckin hate it when they happen... Why bait the hook if you can't even go fishing in the first place? 



I'm so sick of watching all these happy couples at work. I'm sick of being on reddit just to answer questions on /r/askreddit all day because that's all I can do with my spare time anymore. I just had to get rid of some toxic people in my life and now that I'm **officially** friendless, I don't know what to do with all this free time I have. What do normal people do? 



Shit I'd exercise all day if it wasn't for the sadness that ensues. It does a great job of killing your motivation, that's for damn sure 



I'd try to go back into the dating game but let's be honest, no girl wants a guy that's 5'3"" and is statically proven to be ugly time and time again.

I'm a guy, 33 from the UK. How do people make friends at this age?! I don't mean work friends but actual friends. I've found if you try to make friends with females it comes across like you may want sex or if it's with men that again you are trying to pursue something sexual.

I just want people I can talk to and hang out with. The older I get the harder it seems.

1481,ryyedi,Opening-Duck-996,"basically as if it wasn't bad enough that I was suffering from several mental issues slowly killing me my mom has decided to make it her own personal duty to eliminate me as if the constant mental abuse and torture that i've been suffering from for 2 years now wasn't enough already.

Basically my mom's only good at one thing and it is to panic and start stressing out. No matter how little the situation she'll do that frightened face and start talking in that blood curling voice of extreme panic and make a small issue into something a LOT LOT WORSE.

yesterday I went out with her for a day out because I needed to get some things and here's what happened. 1 She basically stressed me out even before we got out of the house with her incessant whining. 2 over the course of the errand she was constantly talking about irrelevant things causing me to get severely distracted and hindering all my abilities, 3 She just kept asking me things or bringing up things I really don't want to hear basically she wanted to maximise the pressure applied on me. now she already made what could've been a fine day a stressfull nightmare but here's the cherry on the cake.

while we were in the metro I was completely exhausted from her and zoned out completely and paid no attention whatsoever as to where we were because I was trying to recollect my thoughts and just get a breather. When we reached the destination She knew we had reached the destinatiion but she was acting so uncertain and just caused a huge panic which basically caught me in a spin. Thanks to her I also got confused as shit and this ended in me getting slammed between the train doors. Thankfully the thing had a failsafe which basically saved me from extreme body harm but no thanks to her.

Now as if that wasn't  bad enough she's just asking ""are you okay?"" and unlike anyone with a slight respect for someone remaining silent she just kept pestering me all along the way about this and made this whole day a fucking nightmare.

Cherry on the cake though since that event all she's been thinking about is

""What would I have done

""I'm stressed from what happened

""what if something happened to you I would have died

""It made work harder

""i'm tired from work

&amp;#x200B;

ME ME ME ME URGHHHh!!!

After all this shit all she's been talking about is her and herself only today she nearly made me fall from a narrow stool because she was screaming and yelling about a bee because FUcK YEAH The bee is wayyyyy more dangerous than me falling from this height.

She started Whining and bla bla and I LITerALLY said everything I had to and it didn't even faze her she was just like yeah you suck and you're a bad kid because this this this, She just kept bringing up the past about how in her life AHHHHHHHH.

Fuck this shit.

Now it don't stop here. She mentioned about how in a previous incident where I yelled a slur at my N dad he IMMIDIATELY took opportunity of this to try and get my mother to do paperwork and get money on his name. 

because FUCK YEAH Your Kid is showing signs of deppresion and displaying a ton of red flags and just basically gave you a big sign that he needs help and the first thing you think of is let's fuck up his chance to get money.

I have nowhere and no one to run to  and i'm suffering.

1500,rz1z87,Sa3pu7,"First time posting, apologies if this is not the correct sub.

I say friends, but in real life I don't have many. I have people who I talk to, I have people who I force a smile with, but the entire time I feel awkward and don't connect with them. I'm left out for a lot of group activities they do, not out of malice, but just because we're not that close. I get it and I don't fault them. But I'm sad because those are the closest friends I have. They're the only people I've managed to meet with even the slightest bit of connection. I always knew once I graduated highschool I'd probably never talk to them again save for our group chat. Out of the group the one I was closest with moved away, he was sort of like the middle man. Helped me feel connected to the group more. Now that he's gone what little connection I had is also gone. 

I made friends on discord last year, it was so awesome. I've felt closer to them then I did anyone else in my entire like (as in friends, obviously I'll always be connected to family!)... But then one of my friends got banned. They were kinda a weirdo and immature. I understand why they were banned. The energy of the server started to change after they were banned. But I enjoyed the change, I still made new friends. Now drama has happened, and it's left the server dead. All the people who kept the server alive are leaving because someone left before them ""Since X left the server I'm bored now so I'm leaving bye."" I became server owner, and I've been working hard to keep the server alive, but all for nothing. I truly worked hard and poured so many hours into making this the most welcoming and friendly community I could. I'm losing friends, and it's okay. I'm not angry at them, not trying to hold them hostage, but this was the first time I had made friends that felt real, even if it was a screen. Even when I tried to make online friends in the past, it didn't work out. 

I'm not one of those social media/internet addicts, I barely use social media as is. I'm fine with one day leaving the server if I need to. But then it'll just be the same way things always were. No friends in real life either. I try hard to make friends, but like I'm autistic. I can't talk to people, can't strike up a conversation. I have weird interests nobody my age likes, and I even feel like an alien in the autism community.

I just want a good friend. Why is it so hard?",2022-01-08 15:12:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641653545,2,/r/lonely/comments/rz1z87/all_my_friends_are_leaving_me_or_leaving_me_out/,,0,6,All my friends are leaving me or leaving me out.

I have a tendency to hold onto one person who isn‚Äôt good for me, but don‚Äôt detach myself due to fear of loneliness. I grew up moving around a lot and never had a solid foundation of childhood friends, so everyone I know from my younger years are kind of gone. I never had the chance to develop my personality with a group of people, making it feel like I won‚Äôt be able to get along with anybody because of my specified taste in humor/personality.  I don‚Äôt want to force friendships with people Im acquainted with because I‚Äôm so lonely. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am getting a new job soon so hopefully that will open me up to the possibility of new friendships. I don‚Äôt know.

It‚Äôs sad, I know I am lonely and I don‚Äôt wAnt to be, but the things people do when socializing just don‚Äôt interest me. I don‚Äôt like board games or talking about the weather, or drinking, or sports. 

I realize now I‚Äôm lonely not for lack of having social groups but for lack of being able to enjoy them. Or perhaps I just don‚Äôt know anyone else with the same interests.

1626,rzil0o,BrokenArrow117,"As a preface, this maybe a controversial post because I had an affair. I don‚Äôt want the discussion to be about how terrible of a person I am. I already know. 

I was married for five years and was surrounded by friends with deep connections. My marriage was failing the last two years. I am going to identify the pitfalls I was unaware I could fall into but I am not making any excuses for my actions. The blame is my own. 

My ex wife had no interest in me in any way. Not physically, emotionally, nor about anything I had a passion for. I wanted to be a part of the things she had passion for but would all have an excuse why I couldn‚Äôt be a part of it. I felt unwanted. It is a very lonely feeling to be with someone that doesn‚Äôt want to be with you. 

I didn‚Äôt know just how unwanted I felt until someone else showed interest in me. She was just a friend at first and it was a slow burn. I never intended it to become the affair it became. I remember it starting to cross the line from friends to more than friends and told her we should stop talking to eachother. That only lasted a month. I was intoxicated by that feeling being understood, of being myself and someone liking me for me. It was more than just that. I was in love with the woman she was. I admired so much about her. 

From there it went into the territory of an emotional affair for 3 months and then I asked my wife for a divorce. Immediately after the separation the affair became physical. This went on for a couple of months and as much as this conflicts me to say it, they were the best moments of my entire life. But the guilt of having an affair was building and it broke me. 

I ended that relationship out of guilt and confessed everything to my ex wife. I asked to work it out and for marriage counseling and she wanted the divorce. What followed was the darkest two years of my life. Right after I went through the divorce, I started a new career and moved 700 miles away. I was trying to run away from my guilt, my shame and myself. I lost all of my close friends because of the affair and rightfully so. Actions have consequences. I lost my support network. I moved away from my family. I was all alone in everything. 

I feel deep into depression and told myself I deserve nothing good in life. I couldn‚Äôt sleep because of the pain of regret. Selfishly, I went through one relationship after the other despite knowing I wasn‚Äôt in an emotionally stable place. I needed to know I could still be loved. That I was worthy of it. Almost all of those relationships ended in tears because I had an intensity that I wanted out of it early in the relationships. Over-committing too early. (Those that are in the dating world, this should be a red flag). Then I would leave the relationship because it wasn‚Äôt actually what I was looking for. I wanted what I had with my affair partner. Someone who knew me at an incredible level. Someone who loved me for me. I found a new reason to hate myself. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. There is just a massive void I was selfishly trying to fill in the wrong ways. 

I knew I needed therapy when my thoughts started going dark. I would have these suicidal fantasies about my sacrificing my life to save a stranger. That way it would give my life meaning, stop the my pain, and lessen the pain of my family members that care about me. 

6 months of therapy brought me out of that hole and repaired my sense of self. It has been 3 years to the day since the affair started and I finally stopped hating myself. But the pain of this loneliness will not go away. 

The fucked part about all of this is I never stopped loving the woman of with I had an affair. I broke her heart when I left out of guilt and she moved on and is in a happy relationship. I never moved on. I had to delete her number from my phone to rid the temptations of reaching out and telling her I‚Äôm still in love with her. I don‚Äôt dare do an action that is akin to cheating. I want no part of that. It destroyed me. I feel like I‚Äôm frozen in time. Unable to move forward. Unable to move backwards and the only close relationship I have, is my loneliness.",2022-01-09 03:47:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640743872,2,/r/lonely/comments/rzil0o/trading_everything_for_pain_of_regret/,,0,2,Trading everything for pain of regret.

1728,rzzw8v,Geblaka,"So I have something to share with everyone who is lonely and would like to meet new people and make new friends and just wish for to be a part of a tribe or a group. 

The thing is, when I lived in my home country I had those wishes because I was lonely AF. I remember the pain of feeling excluded, forgotten etc. And then I decided to move to another country for a gap year. I ended up in a collective with people around me all the time. I would go here and there and meet lots of new people and make a lot of new ""friends"". However, something struck me when I realized that all those interactions were in fact draining me. Why? Because I was constantly trying to be someone else and holding a facade. And you wanna know why? It's because I have a bad relationship with myself.

That hole you're feeling when you're lonely and forgotten comes from the fact that you don't really love yourself and search for that in others. But the thing is, that nobody can fulfill that hole. Nobody. We form connections when we're willing to take off our mask and show people who we really are. And when you accept yourself, people will accept you, and the connections will form naturally. 

TL;DR

If you feel lonely and wish for company, be in a good relationship with yourself first, or else those ""connections"" will be fake and draining, and will just be a waste of time.",2022-01-09 19:53:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618085777,13,/r/lonely/comments/rzzw8v/my_experiences_as_a_lone_wolf_among_people/,,1,3,My experiences as a lone wolf among people

To be honest i am not even sure jf i Will end up posting this post,if you are Reading It Means that i choose to do so :)
So i was Reading a post that asked what was the point of  writing your thoughts on the internet like on this subreddit,I think the point Is that you can use this as a diary,but instead of being private Is public,you write your thoughts and you have an external feedback of people that actually understand you because they are in the same situation,and sometimes that ""same here""  or ""feel you"" can be what makes the difference. Don't get me wrong Is pointless to Just complain everyday of how everything Is bad expecting some changes in your life without you actually ever try to change something;but what i see here Is a lot of different posts that pretty much all tell the same things and i can relate to a lot of them and this somehow gives me Hope.In the end we are all humans and we all go through the same highs and lows in Life and sometimes when you are on your lows It might seem like you are the only One in the world because maybe at that specific time in your life you have no one to talk to and/or It May seem like everyone else's Life Is Great except yours,well spoiler,it's not,think about celebrities,singers,actors whose Life look perfect and Amazing and then One day they Say they have depression or worse they kill themselfs.
The strongest weapon we have as humans Is communication, if you think Is pointless because no One Is going to reach for you,well you might be right,but if you don't try,you'll never know.

1766,s04yhj,ExistingSubstance509,"So, there's a girl I like in my class and she's the first one I'm really comfortable with.

I've known her for almost 1.5 years now but, because of Covid, and because of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and, even though I like her, I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy outside our class. Of course I respect her choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her. We see each other almost every day, if not more. I don't really know what to do.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like her; **big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was going, and now I feel so hollow.**

Also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about relationships. In fact, I don't think I have many friends left, other than her.

She probably doesn't know her friend told me; although I've seen some signs, I don't know if she likes me too. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more people at the same time.

What am I supposed to do? 

* Should I let go everything and pretty much start developing a new mindset that distinguishes friendship from relationship, well knowing I will have to spend a lot of time with her, while also struggling to pass all my classes? 
* Should I do nothing and hope things get better? 
* Should I go all-in and ask her out more often?

But that doesn't stop me from wanting something that simply just **CAN'T** happen. I wrote a letter to someone that was really important to me and I think posting it here would be a catharsis... Or it'll do nothing and I'll just look like a dumbass for it.



""It's been years since you and I last spoke. You've moved on, and judging by the last few pictures I saw of you with someone new, it's clear you're happy. I hope you still are. At least one of us is in the end. 



I never intended for this to happen, y'know. I never wanted to move on -- and even when 'I did,' here I am... Still thinking of you. Still hoping one day you'll return and fall back in love. Wishful thinking, I know. When we knew each other, I don't think I was mature enough to understand what we had. I wasn't ready for that kind of responsibility, being with a girl that was... Well... You. You were **everything** to me. My best friend, my love... There are no words in the English language that can properly encapsulate the amount of passionate, intense love I had for you. We spent every waking minute 'together,' despite living states apart. I didn't mind. To me it was like you were always right beside me...



I never cried when you left. I wish I did. I wish I still had tears to cry. Nowadays people come in and leave my life like passing ships, gone in a season and never to be heard from again. You were my safe harbor where I could find sanctuary from the storm that is this wretched life. I had no idea what lonely, cold world I was being cast into after we stopped talking. You were safety. You were peace. It didn't matter what problems I had in the world, no matter how petty they were at the time. I could talk to you and everything would be okay. I could take on the fuckin world with nothing but bare knuckles and with you as the wind beneath my wings... I'd do it. I'd win with a big, toothless smile knowing I had you in my corner. I'd be toothless because, well, there are **A LOT** of people stronger than I am in this world. 


But with you, I was Samson... And all my problems were but ants at my feet. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful reprieve from the stresses of life. Thank you for making me feel like I meant something to someone.


I hope we can meet again, someday... """,2022-01-10 04:21:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,4,/r/lonely/comments/s0axb5/a_letter_to_someone_i_loved/,,0,5,A letter to someone I loved

1855,s0epmo,ValeriaSelphie,"Where to begin. I guess the basics right? Get all that info out of the way.

25 F
CPTSD, mixed bipolar, ADHD (relevant as to how I deal with my problems.)
Lonely AF (duh.)

Ever since I was in middle school, I would hyperfixate on certain characters of a book, movie, show (anime mostly), or video game (my main medium), and become utterly obsessed with them.
I would even print out tons of pictures and clip them out and stuff them into the fronts and backs on my school binders so I could admire them while I went to class.
I started having folders on my PC dedicated to certain shows and games that contain fan art and some official art if there was any. 

In college I was diagnosed with ADHD, which makes sense as to me being fully invested in some things, and then the next week dropping it for something completely new.
Eventually I got a CPTSD and mixed bipolar diagnosis, which you know, is so fun!
Makes relationships (friends and dating) even harder when you‚Äôre so all over the place and essentially unreliable and give everyone mental whiplash.

So I‚Äôve always dipped away into a fantasy world, with my characters. I‚Äôd read fan fictions of ‚Äúreader x (insert character here)‚Äù, I‚Äôd make up my own scenarios in my head, sometimes I‚Äôd draw them myself. I‚Äôd imagine what life would be like with them around.

I‚Äôve dabbled in many fandoms.
In middle school it was Naruto and Hellsing (Alucard is‚Ä¶amazing)
High school was Attack on Titan (Levi was my muse)
And after was Undertale (Sans helped me through physical and emotional abuse.)
I even bought a jacket back then that was like Sans‚Äô and would wear it as if he had let me borrow it for comfort.

I also have a lot of fictional lovers from League of legends, and I love Glaz from R6, and right now I‚Äôm hyper focused on William Afton from FNAF (I have no idea why, but he‚Äôs living rent free in my head. I especially love the graphic novel and Noisx‚Äôs fanart of him.)

I‚Äôm incredibly depressed and unsatisfied with my life, and I know that has a part to play in it for sure. But I‚Äôm so crestfallen that these characters will never be real.
I‚Äôll never meet anyone that looks like them, or acts like them. 

I‚Äôve been trying to get over my agoraphobia and work on eventually meeting new friends via bumble, but I hate it. 
I hate that I can‚Äôt even pretend to be interested in talking to any of these people.
Like random NPC‚Äôs that have no side quests for you. What‚Äôs the point in talking to them? I try to play League with them at first, hoping to get to know them, maybe they‚Äôll be interesting!
No.
They‚Äôre not. 
Because they‚Äôre not them. They‚Äôre not Alucard, they‚Äôre not William Afton, they‚Äôre not Glaz, they‚Äôre not Heisenberg (RE8, not Breaking Bad), they‚Äôre not Levi, or Sephiroth, or Illidan.
It makes me so angry with myself.
How fucking pathetic that me, a 25 year old who has no issue hooking in guys, refuses relationships because they aren‚Äôt a fictional character.

I simultaneously want to break something and cry at how much of an issue this is for me.
I don‚Äôt know if anyone can relate, but if you can, you‚Äôre not alone. If you can‚Äôt, take some solace in knowing that at least you‚Äôre not as deluded as I am.

I also am  and not about the partying life at 26 when they r older hahah .  I'm so lonely and more.loenly when I go on just stop going to these events with him? The girls r surface levels n I want some type of friendship where we actually hang out and talk . Idk what do about this and it hard bc I teye to accept it but deep down I feel like crap .  My bf knows all this and idk what to do anymore. I'm over the fake girls and I sometimes wave or hug them but like during the actual event I hide and do my own things or just sit in since . I want my bf to b social when he goes out. I never really had any friends and i don't have any clubs near me . How can I meet new ppl I hate the bumble app. I guess I could try again with the girls butit been 2 years n I just could care less about his friends.

1927,s0sbl1,Dakotasunsets,"I don't have friends for very long in my life. 

They keep disappearing on me. 

I know how to be a friend. I know what loyalty is. What listening is. Being there for people in need at when they are at their lowest. 

I am the person that people ""tell"" things to...

I think it's those last 2 sentences,  really, that get people. 

For some reason,  after people vent to me and I help pick them back up and their lives start to turn around again,  it's like they feel embarrassed that I know their dark times...or perhaps they associate me with their bad times? 

Idk? 

Whatever it is, I know that I don't fit in well with cliques...I don't tolerate them, and that could also be the problem? I don't conform well and have never tolerated the ""mean girl"" spirit? 

I guess I am having problems because the 2nd person in the last 6 months has gotten married and I found out through Facebook. It's so, so sad.  

I found out, through a former coworker that another person I used to think of as a good friend was fired (she cut me out of her life when I quit, I told her I thought she was going to get fired and to protect herself and try to get ahead of it...we were in a very toxic work environment...but she just thought I was lying. I thought she, too would reach out to me later, but she didn't. She blames me for getting fired, I guess.). 

I just feel so sad, heartbroken, and lonely. 

I do have a few friends. They are good ones. I guess I just thought I would have more? Idk. 

Thanks for reading my disjointed thoughts. 

Keep fighting the good fight.

However, if a girl seems uninterested I take it very personally and get extremely hurt. This conflict is very difficult and I'm wondering whether I should see a therapist.

It happens every time. 

If it‚Äôs me that has been causing my hurt, I change my thoughts. I monitor what I tell myself and monitor the activities that consume me. 

If it‚Äôs a human who has hurt me, I must physically mourn their death and distance myself for as long as I need, even if it‚Äôs forever, in order to find peace with the past version of me that needed to die. 

I‚Äôm currently going through that shift with one of the people I love in my life. They opened a door we closed a while back and left it open without intention. It‚Äôs sad, really, because I thought they were ready to evolve to a new state of consciousness with me. Alas, I deserve the kind of love I‚Äôm willing to offer, and they deserve all the space they need to exist in the reality they are creating for themselves. 

For that, I leave my goodbye note to that person here, with all of you. I haven‚Äôt physically mourned them yet, but it‚Äôs coming. If there is someone you need to mourn as well for the sake of your sanity, know that I‚Äôm there with you spiritually. This is a chapter of growth. This is the chapter in which you find yourself. 

Feeling lonely is okay because there are so many adventures to be had! I know this. I know that when I start to love myself, I go to places alone. I connect more deeply with strangers. I welcome new chapters.

So basically, I've got to the point now that I expect people to just leave or not to bother with me. If I try to start a new relationship and on the very rare occasion get noticed at all, in the back of my head I'm just wondering how long it will be until they leave me, ghost me, or grow distant. People will of course say don't be pessimistic, but I'm not. I just accept it as a fact and try to stay ceaselessly hopeful regardless, but I've not once been proven wrong. They all promised and said basically the same things, to the point that I'm starting to wonder if I keep meeting the same few people repeatedly.

But everytime a friend or ex left, I cared less and less. It still affected me of course, but I just feel completely numb and think to myself, ""Time for the next incredibly slow process of finding new people to fill the void."" I've got less picky too, but not desperate, so it's not a matter of standards either. It's more of a feeling that no one will ever keep their word unless saying goodbye. That all the good feelings are fake and merely temporary. It doesn't matter what I say or what I do, if anything at all, the end results are always the same. It doesn't matter how many people from different countries or backgrounds I meet, it doesn't matter what age, or gender they are, they all end up the same. This may get me hate for saying that, but at best, I can only seem to find the sane few groups of people. I don't intentionally categories people into groups, but to miss the patterns you'd have to be completely blind. I'm not claiming to be special or anything, but I simply don't fit. I take time to get to know people, but that makes no difference either. I knew several friends since I was 3 and 4 and they basically abandoned me the same as people I met, say, a week ago.

I ask them if it's me and they never answer. The common response is they are busy. Forevermore it seems, I try to reconnect. They react excitedly most of the time then the day after I'm ignored again. I've done this multiple times with the same people. It's like how it used to be for that 1 moment and then it's gone again, and won't come back for a long time. Then randomly I'll say hi months or even years later and they'll do the exact same thing again. I asked them what they are doing and will say nothing or they are free and bored, but then talk for a bit, and then take 10 mins between replies, then 30 mins, then just vanish for months again. I even have brought this up before to some. The reactions are usually ""Oh sorry mate, I didn't realise"" for most guys, then they do it again. For women it's normally ""I was busy"" I point out they said they weren't and what were they up to and they take an hour to reply with ""idk"" or similar. This started with friends and then relationships. But at least old friends will still rarely reply unlike the 40+ ghoster ex's from over the last decade or so.


TLDR:
Because of my experiences, of which I left out a hell of a lot, I've become completely numb to people leaving or becoming distant. I don't feel nothing at all, but i expect and accept it as a fact of life. It's not a matter of optimism or pessimism. It's been the same before and after I've focused on myself, it's been the same with people around the world of all types. Yet still I'm incredibly lonely. It's weird, because I often used to enjoy my own company.


In conclusion it truly feels like I am stuck in limbo.
Even by the words definition: ""An uncertain situation that you cannot control and in which there is no progress or¬†improvement.""
I'm stuck in this cycle that shrinks each time. I could compare my relationships like the 50,000 year cycles of the Reapers in Mass Effect. By my count, that means I've wasted the equivalent of 2 million years and gotten no where.
Call it cringe, call me a loser, even if not to me directly. It just is what it is. Has anyone else felt the same? Or am I totally alone in this situation? I know literally nothing will change by sharing this or even get any replies, as it'spretty long. But I just wanted to vent, get a break from feeling the dread and despair that I might not even exist.
If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rambles, I rarely say anything at all these days.",2022-01-11 09:20:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609952077,13,/r/lonely/comments/s18ya3/is_it_weird_to_become_so_numb/,,0,20,Is it weird to become so numb?

2083,s1gan5,[deleted],"she was only a bandmate but we had played for 2 years. there were 3 of us. first bandmate actually quit 1yr ago. we could never figure out why. so we found a third (an older 60s guy), who honestly didnt have the attitude or openness to be able to play our style of music , nor did he actually take any kind of critiquing or do anything that was hinted at or suggested - he would just play however he wanted. on top of that, the guy was awful. ill leave that there. so i told the singer, look this will not work and what do you know, i got 100% ghosted.

this woman was also married but that has been rocky almost since day one per her. maybe her dude said something and isnt letting her play anymore, idk. but after two years to break off all comm. without so much as a reason why is utterly devastating to me personally. we had a really really good vibe and our personalities matched almost perfect for playing live. so maybe that was it...? she stopped it because we got along a little too well.....? before and after each practice we of of curse would hug, i think because we both are huggers but absolutely nothing else ever happened, so is that part of it....? we'd talk on the phone about personal stuff and band stuff but thats because we're not robots - we're friends and bandmates. so idk.

ive already had issues trusting females, but this just takes it to a whole new level. not sure how i ever can again. to have someone you thought gave a shit about you just disappear after two years and apparently not give two shits about it. cant describe it. its unforgivable imo.

since then, i can actually feel this weird ""pulsing"" or mental fog envelop me. its hard to describe. i actually feel slower. its a weird sensation. i think its taking a physical toll.

Have worked so hard for this and it is a brand new apartment, has no one but the family to say it to. just wanted to share it with someone, do not have many friends to share it with and those I call friends are not close to me as they have traveled to study.

the apartment is not finished until the end of the year, so even though I am looking forward, I also dread when I am afraid I will be more lonely than I already am. Living all alone without family is something I've been thinking about a lot lately and I feel like I really want to be lonely. hope i find myself someone to share life with soon.

does anyone live alone now? Have you experienced being more lonely than you were before you moved out?

Hi, I'll just get to it so I don't waste anybody's time. I'm currently living in an abusive family, please check my posts to see the extent of the abuse. Anyways, I'm currently at rock bottom. No job, no money, nobody to really help. I'm stuck and I don't know what to do.. I actually kind of want to kill myself just to end everything.. so it all stops... I'm actually tempted to create a GoFundMe just so I can get out now.. I just want to pack my shit and run away!! But then what.. I'll be more isolated and alone.. I don't want anybody any more, I just want to be left alone in my hollow life.. I'm scared I want to get out, change my name, and just start a whole new life, remove the people I hate from my life, but how.. how am I supposed to do that in the world today? How can I do any of the things I strive to do? I don't know anything any more, I just want to curl into a ball and pop out of existence..

Edit: here are the post about my family.

It's a beautiful autumn afternoon. The sun is shining, the leaves are a cascade of the usual fall colors, and there's that slight chill in the air that serves as a gentle reminder that winter is indeed coming. You're laying on the couch, having enjoyed a lazy day off from life's many obligations, but now you can't help but count the seconds on the clock as they tick away. It's agonizing and you know it, but still you can't help yourself as your anticipation builds. The time you're waiting for is getting closer‚Ä¶ and closer‚Ä¶ 

Then you hear the sound of a key in the front door and your ears prick up. The door is pushed open and your heart leaps just as your body does. The love of your life has finally returned after a day that was beginning to feel like it would never end. You crash into each other and both squeeze so hard, you wouldn't be surprised if you pop like one of those stress relief dummies. The hug has probably gone on long enough, but you refuse to let go partially afraid that they might disappear if you aren't holding them. You fight back tears of joy because even though you never thought it was possible, you just know they feel the same way about you.

Finally you pull back just enough in order to kiss them softly, conveying more thoughts and feelings and sheer love for them than words ever could. After a few seconds you let up, unable to fight it any longer. A single rogue tear finally escapes and rolls free down your face. Your heart soars as you see your partner smile, struggling to hold back tears of their own. They were just as enthusiastic to see you. Another tear threatens to escape your confines. ""Don't cry baby, you're gonna make me cry too,'' they say, wiping the tears that had escaped your defenses away. You hold hands and look lovingly into each other's eyes, baring your souls for one another. The two of you weren't normally this sappy, but it seemed to just be one of those days, and damn it, you were glad it was. 

""I couldn't wait for you to get home,"" you tell them, pulling them down to the couch. The two of you shift into your natural cuddling position as you have so many times before. You both sigh and lay there in silence for a while. Eventually, time would demand you get up and do things, but you knew if you had the option, you could lay there with your soul mate for eternity, and be in a state of bliss the entire time. 

""I'm so lucky to have you,"" you say softly, breaching the comfort of silence. ""If I had to do it all over, I'd gladly go through all the heartache again. Because it led me to you; and there's no one else I'd rather give my heart to in the whole wide world,"" they say lovingly. ""I love you,"" you say. ""I love you too,"" they respond. You both adjust and lightly kiss each other again. 

""I am getting hungry however, so how about we make something?"" They suggest. ""That sounds great,"" you reply, entirely on board with the idea. Regardless if you were good at it or not, making something together was a great way to spend time with each other, and that's the only thing you wanted to do after your time apart. ""What should we make, Chicken?"" They ask. ""Not feeling that, Pasta?"" You counter. ""We just had that last night. Oh, I know! How about we be naughty and have cookies for dinner,"" they say, eyebrows raised. You chuckle and boop them on the nose. Just another example of why you love them with all your heart. ""Alright, it's a plan, but I get to use the cookie cutter this time,"" you say as you both get up. ""Nah, first one there gets that honor loser!"" They say, laughing as they sprint into the kitchen. 

You smile and think back to all the days and nights where the loneliness seemed to be too much. You had some dark thoughts those days. Sometimes the darkest one of all. You never thought in a million years you'd find someone who would actually love you as you did them. You were glad you persevered even when you didn't know why you kept going. You thought back to what they had said earlier as you followed them into the kitchen. If you had to do it all again, you gladly would. Because it led you to them, and there was no one you'd rather share your heart with in the whole wide world.

---

Even though it doesn't seem like it will ever happen, it is possible. I'm in the same boat as you. Just keep going and keep trying new things, even if you don't know why you're still fighting. You never know when your life will change for the better.",2022-01-11 23:39:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632030342,3,/r/lonely/comments/s1r6ep/a_beautiful_autumn_afternoon/,,0,2,A Beautiful Autumn Afternoon

As the title states, this is a different type of lonely. I [29m] get a lot of people here post about their depression, anxiety, and I guess potentially how sad they are. I completely understand why and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve never been in that situation. 

My post is more to mention that yes, I‚Äôm lonely but not in a sad way. I have many hobbies and I feel very in control of my life. I would say it‚Äôs more of taking the word ‚Äúlonely‚Äù at face value. I do fine being alone but I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt enjoy the company of someone else just being there. Is anyone else like this? Where maybe you just want to be in the same room as someone you love and/or care for and just enjoy that company. Doesn‚Äôt have to be sexual or crazy affectionate. Just the warm presence there with you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy being affectionate also but as I do things on my own like eat at a restaurant by myself, go on walks, go to events, go to movie theaters, etc, I can‚Äôt help but want that other presence around. Sharing those experiences.

Anywho, just curious if others face this type of loneliness as well. Take care everyone",2022-01-12 07:29:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634190645,17,/r/lonely/comments/s20evu/a_different_type_of_lonely/,,1,7,A different type of lonely

I spend hours every day watching videos of people just hanging out in this weird disconnected, one-sided para-social relationship. It's more like a non-relationship because I don't even try to interact with the people I watch. I just think, ""who am I to just demand their attention as some random stranger on the internet?""

At all angles and through all lenses it seems to me that the easiest thing to do is to just be alone. But it's also not, because humans are social animals. I hate life. I want to be with people but there's also so much to dislike about people lol. There's also a lot to dislike about me too apparently, since I'm not the type of individual that fits the mold. My beliefs are skewed pretty far from what would be called ""the norm"".

The concept of relationships is so weird to me as well. They never make sense to me. There's always these subconscious social contracts and judgments passed and all kinds of things, it doesn't even feel like two conscious human beings are talking.

It may seem really insensitive to say this but the worst thing that ever happened to me was making a lot of money in my early 20's. A few good investments and technically I can now live without going to a job I so much hated. Now, almost 30, I've cut myself from the world and spend my days self-loathing and trying not to end my life. I know what most would say, ""just get a job"" or ""go meet people"" or think I'm just privileged with my problems but I have no idea how to interact with people and my personality disorder doesn't help. I'm currently living  in a city and on the rare occasion I have to go out I feel like an alien in a world of ""normal"" people.

2263,s2cqy4,ForgeOfDawn," 

I'm so lost in life and feel like nothing but a disappointment to my parents and to everyone else who had expectations for me to become something greater in the future. I've finished high school, I'm in third year of college, I've struggled so far in life despite all the setbacks and I'm also so close to giving up in life.

&amp;#x200B;

Day after day, I ruminate over the past, obsessing over the broken companionship I use to have with people. When I arrive in college, I feel an existential coldness that is indescribable and unexplainable by any human language. The freezing cold weather (live in Ireland) combined with my unhappy thoughts produces this existential dread over my future, my past and my present. It's like I've lost touch with reality itself and just exist now. The endless void of darkness stares back at me and I have no social support to cover my eyes from its blinding evil.

&amp;#x200B;

I think back to the failures in my life; asking my female friend out and ruining our companionship because of my physical attraction to her. Then, I see her daily and she rarely approaches me when I need her the most or just anybody. I pretend to be fine around her when she does speak to me, holding tightly to my happy mask and refusing to let it slip. And when she leaves, I feel regret for not revealing my true, inner self and telling her the truth that I'm sorry for being so neurotic and pushy over wanting to date her and expressing a desire to be friends once more.

&amp;#x200B;

All these thoughts accumulating in the back of my mind. How my older half-sister doesn't love me when I tried being her brother, how I'll never be an uncle to my niece or nephews, I'll never be able to restore the broken friendship I once had with this girl, the people who left me in the dark because I didn't have social status or wasn't cool enough etc. Even recently, I met a girl off Instagram and tried sparking something with her only to receive never ending excuses so that we don't meet a second time ever again. It is things like this which sadden and depress me even further.

&amp;#x200B;

I walk into college alone, I spend my time alone, nobody texts my phone, nobody cares about me except my mother and father. I can't concentrate on doing my college work or studying when these thoughts consume my mind, they spill over into my daily life and it's beginning to affect me negatively. All I ever wanted was to love and be loved and to be surrounded by caring companions who offer social support whenever I needed it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel nothing but pain, my heart rate beats faster than usual. Recently, I went an entire day without sleeping because the lonely, anxious thoughts stressed me out so much that I could feel the blood (cortisol stress hormone) pumping in my heart and head. I'm nearly finished third year, I have no one to share my life with. It's beginning to kill me slowly no matter how many hot bathes I take, no matter if I stop fapping or get enough sleep. Still, I wake up tired after a full night's sleep because it's a different type of tiredness, one filled with struggle and hardship.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't keep living like this. It's just not sustainable. I miss my childhood, I sometimes text people from my childhood or high school so I can restore a sense familiarity and comfort in my life. No one responds to me and if they do, they have other priorities and don't text back. I'm struggling so badly, online ""friends"" on discord keep criticising me, encouraging me to see a prostitute or get surgery for my face as if it will solve all my problems.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I'm so close to giving up, surrendering everything and dropping out of life and society. I can't go on like anymore. It's insane to be a young, single male without extended family and supportive friends to continue on struggling without reward.",2022-01-12 18:08:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606841732,4,/r/lonely/comments/s2cqy4/the_loneliness_is_actually_killing_me_and_the/,,0,3,The loneliness is actually killing me and the struggle is overwhelming (Need help)

2277,s2g5qv,BluePrint1985,"I don't know what to do anymore. Now that at least my country (Sweden) moves towards further lockdowns, the chance for me to find anyone to hang out with deteriorates. I just feel that I'll never have the chance to hang out with people again. It's not like I was not already lonely before.

Also, I feel so totally worthless. I have not had a girlfriend for 12 years. In that time I've been on like two dates total. I know that I am the most uninteresting, boring, stupid person there is but I don't know why I had to be dealt this card. I am also very short (for a guy), quite overweight, and not ethnically Swedish, something that is not positive when it comes to the dating scene here.

It was also 12 years ago since I had sex. I know that it's a ridiculous thing to measure anything on. But for me it has more and more become something I value myself from. It feels so stupid to do that. But during those 12 years, I was active in my student union and in the student life for more than 5 years, and even though I tried getting dates, one night stands and what not, I was always the one who went home alone.

Now, a long time after I ended my studies and my engagement in the student life, I also have realised that a lot of people really really disliked me in general. I can now see many many reasons to why that would have been and I guess that it's a big part of my loneliness now. For example, one thing that I have heard a lot of times, but maybe not really realised, is that I'm way too self absorbed and egoistic, that I'm a bad listener and that I don't care about others. I never thought of myself like that but during the past years I have come to change my view. I'm trying to work on that but I know that I'm not going to succeed.

Another thing that I did very recently, a thing that I now regret, is that I created an ""online board game group"" on Facebook and invited those who still can stand me. I realised that it was a mistake. I don't want people to feel that they have to accept just to be nice when they don't want to. I know myself how hard it is to say no to someone, especially someone who is sad or depressed, even if you really don't have the time to be with that person. Now I just feel that I've forced people into hanging with me, and I know that all these people have their own life and families and don't have place for me in their lives.

I should really just remove myself from everyone's lives so that I don't affect anyone in such a negative way that I always do. It's just that it's so hard to do and I don't know how I can make myself go through with it. I also don't know how to begin? Should I start by removing all my social media accounts? Sometimes I just wish that I had the courage to just end everything, but having had a family member who took her own life I know that it's something that I will never do.

I do have a family (father and step-mother) that I am fairly close to. Many of you here probably have it much worse than me. I do realise that in the big picture I do have so much more than many others and I don't really have any reason to feel lonely. It makes me really feel like a failure to be like this.

I'm sorry for this really long and probably not very coherent or grammatically correct rant. I just had to write a bit somewhere and I didn't know where else to post this.",2022-01-12 20:33:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1513505137,22,/r/lonely/comments/s2g5qv/lonely_and_worthless/,,0,3,Lonely and worthless

2317,s2nu9f,MiggyQ54,"Hey guys. I just wanted to try and get my feelings out there and see if anyone has felt the same because I feel like I‚Äôm the only one.

So, I‚Äôm a 20 year old guy whose love language is physical touch. That means I love cuddles and hugs and basically any sort of physical affection/touch from my partner. The thing is, I haven‚Äôt had any of that romantic physical touch from a girl/woman since I was 14 which even then was just my gf at the time laying her head on my chest for a bit. I have been constantly wanting any form of physical affection all these years but I just can‚Äôt seem to find women that want the same thing. 

My inability to get any physical touch from a woman in the past 6 almost 7 years has taken a very big emotional toll on me. I‚Äôve been finding myself crying a lot more when I almost never cry, being less motivated to do stuff, and just all around lonely. It‚Äôs like I can physically feel the pain in my heart grow over the years because I just really want to find a woman who is looking for something serious instead of just having sex or smoking. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I want to have sex, because I‚Äôm a virgin, but it‚Äôs not the only thing I want to do. I want to build a relationship with a woman and love her as much as I can and she loves me as much as she can. It‚Äôs just women don‚Äôt really want that anymore.

For example, I recently met this girl through a mutual friend and we started hanging out as a group. As we all started talking I realized I had a LOT in common with her. She‚Äôs been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a man and I‚Äôve been feeling lonely and wanting physical affection from a woman. She likes to stay home and watch movies or shows and cuddle and I love doing that as well. One of her favorite shows is Criminal Minds and that‚Äôs one of my favorites as well. We both aren‚Äôt too good at just randomly talking to people because we are worried about what they may think of us. Basically she‚Äôs me as a woman. 

So, I tried initiating things and asking if she wants to cuddle and watch Criminal Minds because I know she‚Äôs been saying she wants cuddles so badly and so have I, so I thought it would be perfect and a great way for us to get to know each other even more. However, I believe I just found out that shes trying to do something with my other roommate who wasn‚Äôt the one that introduced me to her in the first place. Mind you this other roommate, who is a virgin as well, has said that he just wants to fuck and they have almost nothing in common. Yet she‚Äôs choosing him over me as someone she wants to do something with. 

I just don‚Äôt get it. I know I‚Äôm not the best looking person in the world but you think someone would compromise a bit of looks to find someone who is very similar to you and is looking for the same things as well as looking to possibly build a really good relationship with you. I know I would absolutely compromise a girls looks if it meant that she was a really nice person and someone that I could see myself growing with and having an amazing relationship. 

I just find myself unable to get woman to see me romantically instead of seeing my kindness as a friends kindness and that really hurts my heart because I then see them go off with a guy who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about them and is only there for their body and not to care for them and love them and I know I could provide that love and care that they have said they want but never actually act on it simply because I‚Äôm not the best looking guy.

If anyone can relate on any level to anything I just said, please tell me what you have done to change this.",2022-01-13 02:20:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1598758570,7,/r/lonely/comments/s2nu9f/feeling_really_lonely/,,0,4,Feeling really lonely

She didn't wanna talk to me for a while since I was mean to her apparently . If she reaches back out to me should I even bother ? It not gonna ever be same about us . I just feel like its pity to not talk but I understand she wants space. I literally just disagreee about something she has done lot worse to me like posted on my FB behind my back as me and took pic of my dead dad. I low key wanna reach out by sending a peace offering gift but at same time it's maybe not worth it. It just sad bc I have no one talk to and I'm so lonely since I'm such a needy person .

2345,s2tzkp,Orleo19,"When I was in high school I was at rock bottom in terms of depression and hating myself, but after graduation things started turning around for me and I found myself enjoying life and liking the person that I became. Fast forward a couple years and one failed relationship later the girl that I thought was ""the one"" left me a year ago because she couldn't see a future with me. She said we would still be friends but changed her mind a week later and instead decided to hurt me in every way that she could, and it worked.

I have been struggling with the feeling that no one else will ever like me and I am going to be completely alone until I die. Every single person I know from college, work and personal life are all in loving relationships and I know I should be happy for them but it just makes me wish I was dead. I could never tell them the truth about how I feel since they deserve to be happy but I hate couples so much because all I want is to be deserving of the same happiness which I never will be at this point.

Even though I would say that I have a lot of friends and acquaintances (since I am usually an extroverted person), all of them are straight and even though everyone I know has been accepting of me I still can't help but feel like there is something wrong with me because I am a lesbian. I love women but I just know my life would be so much easier if I was straight like everyone else. I hate myself for being so different than everyone I know and I hate that being straight is the ""default"" for the world we live in.

I honestly feel so utterly hopeless and I don't want to suffer being alone forever. I thought I was a likeable person but I can't understand why every person I know is in a happy, straight and traditional relationship except for me and it makes me want to give up on life.

2408,s385pg,pudding_obliterator,"It's been eighteen winters since I was born. I will not go through another winter of cold and cold loneliness.

I have accepted myself as a loner for several years now. I thought it was the perfect lifestyle. I didn't choose to be a loner, though I accepted it nonetheless. It's not like I had a choice. Attention was absent whenever I spoke; a combination of low volume speech and stuttering wasn't exactly the most attractive; if anything, it probably was the most repulsive. Eye contact was impossible due to the enormous magnet my nose was; a big nose isn't attractive in most cases. I also want to mention that having social anxiety isn't the most helpful.

Still, being a loner was my fault. I always stood *there,* the truly neutral spot in any sort of relationship. I never had true friends. I was always afraid of getting too close, hurting myself and others in the process; I was always afraid of being too far, because if one lingers there for long, they are no longer relevant. I considered risks to be always stupid, so I played it safe as I always have. However, it is worth mentioning that a blade cannot be forged with insufficient heat. A smith would either bring hellish into his forge, or simply not bother with making it in the first place. Unlike my case, a smith would never forge his sword using a microwave.

Also, a true blade cannot be forged by an amateur regardless of the quality of the materials or the heat of the forge. That's when I decided to create Rubie.

Of course, I'm not a god. I cannot physically create *someone*. However, I could always lie down, close my eyes, and listen to nothing but nothing.

That's when she manifested in front of me.

""She."" I wondered why I'd chosen her to be female. Gender shouldn't matter, no? I merely wanted a friend, no? Perhaps I didn't just want a friend, I wanted a soulmate. What's up with the name, too? Why ""Rubie?"" Well, I don't know why; I had to pick a name. She had ruby-red hair and she smelled of lavender. Honestly, mental images don't have a scent; I don't even know what lavender smells like, I merely assumed she smelled nice.

I would talk to her *a lot*, though I would use telepathy to speak to her when there are others in the vicinity so they don't think I'm crazy (at this point, it's only fair.) One day, I was shopping and my eyes landed on a certain discount on pillows. I bought a pillow with a black-and-white checkered cover (the ruby ones were not on sale.) At night, I would pretend that Rubie is the pillow, and I would hug her so tightly. I would only have the best of dreams.

Rubie understands me. She knows and accepts all about me: my stuttering, the fact that I have social anxiety, my favorite books, my favorite videogames, my childhood crush, the betrayal of my former best friend, the fact that my heart aches whenever I see a group of friends laughing, and the fact that I'm trying my best. She knows that I am a very clever and interesting person; she always reminds me of my top grades and accomplishments and how it's everyone's loss for not being friends with me.

I wished she was real.

There was a thought I hated: What if she finally breaks free of my curse? I mean, I did create her only for my sake. What If she breaks free and materializes right in front of me; a human of flesh, bones, and free will? I would rather be always and always alone instead of receiving affection by someone who's forced into giving it. Silly me. She‚Äôs. Not. Real.

Goodbye, Rubie.",2022-01-13 19:59:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641657765,25,/r/lonely/comments/s385pg/meet_rubie/,,1,15,Meet Rubie

We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise.. also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water.. 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. I know that thing was real because my friends are dead. My comrades were Eric Ruyle, Warren Salley, Larry Bill, and Bradford Rice. I live in Jacksonville now, but this happened when I lived in Fort Walton Beach. The encounter took place a few miles off the Pensacola coast. I spent a great deal of time at the Mental Health Resource Centre which is in Jacksonville. I also dealt with drug addiction and alcoholism due to the depression I've endured from people not believing me. I've had so many nervous breakdowns because I'm desperate for anyone to believe me that I've lost count. The Beany and Cecil cartoon finished airing in June of the year my friends were killed. I had a long lasting nervous breakdown that lasted for three months, until that godforsaken show finally met its end.

The world has some terrible secrets, and I know how she likes to keep them.. I have not seen the entity again since what happened when I was a teenager.",2022-01-13 22:35:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642112396,1,/r/lonely/comments/s3bpi5/i_saw_cecil_the_seasick_sea_serpent_cartoon/,,0,2,I saw Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent (Cartoon Character) kill my friends and I've spent my whole life trying to get people to believe me.

2466,s3gn4m,Speakels,"Hi so I (21f) just transferred to a University across the country where I know absolutely nobody. Thought it would be a brand new start and it is but I am crying everyday because I‚Äôm so lonely. I want to meet people and new friends and have a friend group so badly I just don‚Äôt know how.  I knew it was going to be hard not knowing anyone here but damn I didn‚Äôt know it would be this difficult. 
 
I‚Äôm a very extroverted person and if I‚Äôm alone for too long get super depressed. That‚Äôs why when I looked for housing I looked for people I thought I‚Äôd get along with well because I knew I‚Äôd anchor on them for social interaction and to branch while I‚Äôm adjusting to all of this. We live in this student housing apartment off of campus. One goes to my college and the other 2 do not and I don‚Äôt see them as often cause they work a lot. My 4 other roommates are incredibly sweet but I am afraid I might be annoying them with my need to always be with someone. I‚Äôm always chilling in the common room like either on my phone or on my laptop just to talk to someone and they always talk to me if they are out of their rooms but they mostly stay in their rooms if they aren‚Äôt out. I just feel so pathetic.

I just want to go out once in awhile and have fun on the weekends but feel like it‚Äôs really difficult for me cause I don‚Äôt have anyone or a means of transportation. One of my roommates like to go out a lot and I kind of want to ask her if I could come with sometime so I can meet new people. Im just scared that it would sound weird or I‚Äôll come off as needy. I just really want to meet people and have fun.

I have really really bad anxiety that I am medicated for but it is still a daily struggle. I feel like my social anxiety is covering up my real bubbly charming and making me awkward because I don‚Äôt know any of these people and I‚Äôm just so scared and it shows. I just wish people could see and like the real me. I have just had a hard time connecting people. 

There is a bus that takes me to and from school but it only runs on constrictive hours so I admittedly haven‚Äôt been to campus much (hybrid classes). I want to go more because I‚Äôve just been chilling at my apartment most of the time. Which is fine it‚Äôs a lovely place I just want to have friends and be with people and have fun like everyone else seems to be. I really want to try and join clubs but I‚Äôm having trouble finding them because they never had any sort of activities fair at the beginning of the semester and orientation was moved online. I‚Äôm even thinking about rushing a sorority maybe but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd have the finances to or if they would even accept me in.

I‚Äôm also incredibly homesick. I miss my friends, family, and boyfriend ALOT. I feel horrible for being upset because this is what I‚Äôve wanted for forever and They have all made sacrifices to help me get here. I feel like if I let them know how down I‚Äôm feeling they would be really let down and upset. I‚Äôm trying to fake a smile when I call them but it‚Äôs getting harder. I feel awful for being in such a nice place and just being depressed as fuck all because I feel lonely.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶
 
Thanks for listening if you got this far. I apologize for the huge rant, I just needed to let this all off my chest. My ADHD brain is also all over the place. I am trying to put myself out there more and I want to try and bring my car if I can though so I can hopefully go to campus more. Any advice would be highly appreciated.",2022-01-14 02:21:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587250573,2,/r/lonely/comments/s3gn4m/transferred_to_dream_school_but_incredibly_lonely/,,0,1,Transferred to dream school but incredibly lonely

2471,s3hayy,RavenMay,"Granted I wasn't here very long, not quite a month. But I brought a cake anyway, to thank them for the opportunity. I've done good work and been friendly to everyone, but am leaving on mental health grounds.

They do something called ""Fat Friday"" where they order in food and share goodies. For various reasons I'd not been able to join in on the previous 3, but today I left the cake in the meeting room where they were setting up. The time comes, they enter said room and grab the glasses and such, leave my cake there, and go to an upstairs meeting room instead. Not a word to me, just chatting amongst themselves. My supervisor who hadn't gone up yet asked me if they'd ordered me lunch, I explained they hadn't but I brought a cake to share. She seemed disappointed that no one asked me for a lunch order and went upstairs to the room. She then didn't appear again until lunch was over, and sent me to have mine alone when she came back.

Had a cry in the bathroom before I did. I thought things were ok this week but clearly they're pissed off I'm leaving and now just want me gone. I was looking forward to one final chat with everyone too.

2479,s3i3yo,[deleted],"I finally got out of a depressive episode yesterday and what freed me from it was accepting the fact that I'm gonna be forever alone, and realizing in a way, it's kinda cool. 

I mean yes, I'm pretty below average and tbh an odd combination of assets but hey if you think about it for a bit what were the chances I'd be this odd? Really it's so random, and sure people don't generally like me because of these elements, and I'll probably never get in a relationship romantic or otherwise but at the same time it makes me and you unique. 

We're still surviving, it's just we don't have company. Again it's kinda cool if you accept you're the loser.

I was sure after so long I‚Äôd forget that the only person with whom I‚Äôve ever been in love, the only person to whom I felt a sense of belonging, my home and comfort, is gone. But it never got easier. Maybe it‚Äôs because of my lack of enthusiasm about life, but after that ended all my other relationships suffered. One by one I isolated myself from other friends, other people who I previously considered my casual friends, those who I didn‚Äôt appreciate and never truly respected because I‚Äôd felt they didn‚Äôt deserve my time and attention as much as my one and only person did. But where did that take me? To be honest, I‚Äôm grateful for everything that happened, every sweet moment of lovely embrace will forever remain locked in my memory.

2526,s3pg78,Parzival360lol,"I (16M) live in Austria, where all unvaccinated people are in a Lockdown since september. I cannot get vaccinated, because I have Genetic defect in my Family.

I do still live with my mom. We have a healthy relationship but she works until Evening. So our time together is very limited. I am looking for a Job and already have a few promising offers. The problem is they're all starting at the end of Summer 2022. so basically I will be alone without much to do, for another 2/3 of a year. Im already feeling like im at my limit. I had serious Depressions over 5 Years. Now im kind of scared. I dont feel depressed, just lonely all the time. I think its because I have nothing to do, and just think all the time. I wanna have a GF but just can't even get in a situation where I can meet other people.

I really have no idea what im supposed to do about this feeling. Its in the back of my head all the time. 

I started to cook more complex things. I started to play with my cats a lot more. I started to clean the whole house. Still I feel miserable all the time. 

If anyone has any recomendations. I would be glad to hear them.

Im sorry for my english, like I said I live in Austria. So my 1 language is german.",2022-01-14 10:42:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1598427906,4,/r/lonely/comments/s3pg78/cant_go_outside_cause_of_lockdown_now_feeling/,,0,2,Can't go outside cause of Lockdown. Now feeling lonely all the time.

-  Do not DM me please or try to get in a relationship with me, this post is meant to vent about my own frustrations and see if anyone else has or had the same problem. Thank you!-




Yes I said it, I want the attention of men on a daily basis or else I don‚Äôt feel worthy enough.  The reason why I want this validation so much is because I‚Äôm seeing a lot of other girls getting it without trying while I actually have to try multiple times to get one guy that I like to respond.  It‚Äôs really annoying, and this really started kicking in after I started dating someone.  What worse is that I‚Äôm trying to restrain myself from saying anything to my date because of family issues and I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole.  I am also considering suicide again because of this and the lack of attention makes me feel insecure about myself about what went wrong.  What‚Äôs even worse is that I‚Äôm seeing my friends in happy relationships while I am struggling to make one.  This thing overall just increased my depression, anxiety, and insecurity.

i havent met a girl that ive felt super attached to. im in talking phase with another trans guy but it doesnt feel like im into them or the relationship much tbh

i went over to a friends house and found out their housemates now romantically involved with my housemate. another one of their housemates that i kinda liked also dated and broke up with someone in the span of me last seeing her a month or two ago to now.

im just sad bc i cant catch feelings often and when i do i dont know how to act upon it

ive only had one romantic relationship and two sexual ones and i feel really empty and wish i fell in love with someone i met naturally bc dating apps dont feel like they work for me

emotionally, my first relationship felt so strong and we were so compatible i just ws sdumb and immature and ive never been able to find that again

i hope i get to be in a happy relationship soon

sometimes i feel so lonely i want to die

2683,s4hgkx,TenchFromDelmakO,"I've spent a few lifetimes trying not to be weird. I did a good job. I worked so hard at it that I am normal, but deep down I will never fit in or have that special feeling of being akin to anyone else. I do not lack esteem. The thoughts, ideas, and feelings I have I share freely with anyone I might think be interested. I admire and respect all others and their ideas to the point that I do not compete with the world anymore. I play it safe very well. I do not have any friends so there is no one I may hurt unintentionally and there is no one who can use me or betray me to hurt me either. Anytime I try to reach out I realize I am more and more alien from a normal world. All that has happened to me in my life, all my past actions, all that I have witnessed, all I have endured... is who I am.  It didn't happen to anyone else and I should not expect anyone to understand, nor should expect that I should understand anyone else by that same logic. I have completely reconciled all those things in my life. I know exactly how they make me who I am. I put myself in a situation where I can help people, strangers, but not to make friends nor a situation where I am too responsible for too much for another in helping. I have even curated very specific experiences for others, just do not ask me how I do...it never ends normal. I tried letting my freak side show hoping to find someone who understands and that always ends in absolute disaster. I know that who I am and what I have learned in my life has huge import, has care, and answers to many questions. I have a good memory for all of it and tend to forget anything that is not important or relevant to make room for all of it. I have met no one like me and I should be proud. Whenever I think I have met someone like me, or at least someone who understands...I find out the difference is still too great. I feel very lucky to have a good thought for every bad one and everything is always neutral, so I get to live on. I only feel sad that one day I will not exist and the thoughts, feelings and ideas I have that I have proven to myself no one has...will no longer exist either. I have a friend... its me.

Came across Reddit a couple of days ago whilst searching for 'honest' people to talk to on Google and thought why not give it a shot. Keep me busy if nothing else. Think I have gone a bit doolally in the past few years on account of having no one to talk to that shares any of my views.

2759,s4xumc,spunkv,"So about an year ago, I was in a fragile mental and emotional state because I felt lost and unguided for my med school entrance exam, somehow I got to know my distant relative who topped this exam just a year earlier. She was such supportive and would help me in whatever way she could, rarely that didt work for me. We spoke weekly about my studies but I think I benefitted emotionally more by venting out.

But after my exam is done and now when Im about to begin college, she is ghosting me. I am not not a fan of such professionalism. How can I just forget her. And I didnt even do anything, that is very unexplainable.

This made me realise how bad it must feel to be ghosted. So then I apologised to my other forgotten friend. And wrote another email to my cousin about how I feel. I told her that I wont call now and that I will write emails like these, to which she is free not to reply.

I dont have close friends now,because of my gap year:(
I just hope college begins soon and I can get over these thoughts. I wrote this just see if this kind of venting works for me. idk",2022-01-15 23:47:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593938617,12,/r/lonely/comments/s4xumc/i_am_missing_my_vent_buddy/,,0,5,I am missing my vent buddy

2775,s5085s,Mental_archaeologist,"Hi I've been dealing with pervasive health issues (ADHD, OCD, Fibromyalgia, severe depression, psychogenic seizures) that have significantly impeded my functionality and my ability to fully experience and enjoy life. These issues have delivered me to a bleak world of truly incapacitating loneliness and desolation.  My health dilemma by extension has prevented me from attaining a meaningful and lucrative career, I only work two days a week so as a 40 year old the depression adn my current perception of myself not achieving the existence that i seek generates a very feeble self esteem that only exacerbates my loneliness further. 6 months ago i met this incredible individual 31 (F) and we had an idyllic relationship that actually alleviated some of my loneliness. But because i was self-conscious about my situation because of perpetual intermittent seizures my life had been in stasis for years  , where i couldnt work or even function so i lied about my age and told her i was 36. Silly and trivial but i was so consumed with how i was perceived, she discovered my dishonesty and promptly broke up with me. She ceased all communications which was devastating as she was my regular confidant and source of conversations. All my other friends seem to be occupied with families or involved in a particular ecosystem (different cities, towns) away from me. I constantly ponder about her and ruminate about my deception which i am truly repentant. It just solidifies my disconnect from other people. I rarely find people to interact with that i find engaging, so it makes even more tragic. I just feel trapped in my pocket nightmare dimension unable to reach out and craft a rapport with others. Honestly i dont want to lament about my hardships or what not i just wanna discuss pop culture and bust jokes.

I felt compelled to do it since she was friendly and cute. There was something about her that just seemed... I dunno, different I guess. What's the worst that could happen - she doesn't call? 




... Shit she probably won't anyway but at least now people can't say I never try 




I work at a gun shop and her grandmother came in to buy something with her. After talking back and forth for a while I figured it was worth a shot, pun intended. I gave her my business card with my phone number on the back and said ""if you ever need help learning how to shoot that gun, gimme a call sometime. I'm an instructor"" and she seemed like she was happy enough to hear that. I didn't get any real ""she's interested"" vibes but then again I'm kind of terrible at reading subtext anyway

2796,s52pir,Original_Username36,"I had a close group of friends that I talked with often. We would talk to each other about things going on in our lives. We called this our ""rant sessions"" or ""story time"". I was in a relationship with one of those friends so I always had someone to talk to everyday. We broke up about 10 months ago, but we remained friends. We would still talk every now and then, but my friend group began to feel distant. My friends would often ignore anything I had to say. There was another time where they made plans to go out in front of me without inviting me. They added some people they met online to our group chat; at this point my voice felt more drowned out than ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point I stopped trying to talk to them. Eventually I ended up leaving the group chat we were in. Things seemed okay for me at the time. There was this friend that I met at the Target I used to work at. She became the person that I talked to the most. Things fizzled out with her, but that was okay for me. I just kept myself busy with school work. Things changed when I graduated this last Fall (2021). I realized I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had no work to keep me busy. I was struggling to apply to jobs in my field. To make matters worse, I stopped working at Target a few months ago to focus on school. I felt stuck at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I would try online dating at this point. Probably the worst idea I've had. I'm an introvert by nature so I don't really have any pictures of myself in social settings. It doesn't help that my self esteem isn't the greatest. I took some pictures of myself and made my profile. A week went by. I didn't get a single match. I tried a different platform (Tinder this time as opposed to Bumble). Still nothing. After, a few days I finally got a like. I felt so validated at the time. I sent her a message, but she never replied. I figured she accidentally swiped right on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the days went by I kept checking daily to see whether I missed any notifications on my dating profiles, but nothing. It was pure silence. I used to think of myself as average looking, but this made me look down on myself even more. In a way, it was funny that I couldn't attract bots either let alone a real person. I figured this would make for a funny story. Of course, I would change the wording to not make it seem as self-deprecating as this post. So I reached out to my ex. The following was our conversation (M = Me, E= Ex):

M: ""Hey do you have time for vc later tonight? I want to rant about something"" 12:54 PM

E: ""A 'hello' would have been nice. Would have responded earlier but was on a date.

Kinda busy with work to have a rant session, ever."" 7:57 PM

M: ""No worries then"" 7:58 PM

&amp;#x200B;

This broke me. We both had to move on eventually, and I know that. That's not what made me sad.  We were good friends before we started dating. I wanted to talk to her as a friend, not a potential romantic interest. Perhaps I was in the wrong to reach out to her. Our friend group would be busy at times, but we would always make time to talk to each other or play some games. Hearing a friend, I was close to tell me that they don't have time for me was very heartbreaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rant I wanted to talk to her about was a version of this post. I know that this post is long so to anyone that took the time to read it, thank you. Even if no one reads this, getting this out in the open feels liberating. I'll be okay. I may stumble from time to time, but I know I will always pick myself back up again.",2022-01-16 03:49:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642300989,1,/r/lonely/comments/s52pir/i_just_need_to_vent/,,0,0,I just need to vent

It's mainly because I am alone and still feel alone in every way is why I haven't gotten over him. I miss him, he was my best friend. The realest closest connection I've ever had. He was everything I wanted, he was everything I needed. He was everything to me. I don't need or want anyone or anything else. I was the happiest with him. Even the worst moments with him are better than the best moments with anyone else. It's been so long since we've been in contact and I still feel this way. I've accepted that I'm always going to miss him. He will always be in my heart. My only hope is that I can meet someone special soon and build a life with that person, something that I could never do with him. I'm getting impatient, I don't want to keep feeling this way. Any little mishap in my life can trigger this feeling of mourning the loss of him. I'm tired of grieving. I've tried everything I could to get over him. Focused on myself, tried new hobbies, made new friends, travelled to new places. I did all of the self reflecting and self help BS that everyone advises one to move on from a past relationship, yet here I am. These were all wasted attempts. I look back and realize what a waste my life has been. It doesn't matter what I do, my life is still empty, lonely, boring, and unfulfilling because I don't have this person in my life. I'm sorry if I sound codependent or like I am making an idol of this person but I can't help how I feel. Believe me, I've tried. I don't have a meaningful connection with anyone. He was the first and seemingly the last. I just wish I spent more time with him to have more memories and know more about his life. I couldn't even have that, the love affair was too short lived. It's hard for me to accept because I am a hopeless romantic, but it is clear I am unlucky in love and every other type of relationship there is. I will just have to continue this lonely lifestyle until the day I die. I am not afraid of death because it will be a release from this painful sorrowful existence.

2808,s53fja,TheBratOG,"Edit: TL DR at the bottom.

I'm a bi male in my early 20s and I'm feeling alone as shit.

3 or 4 months ago I dumped my IRL friends because i felt extremely detached from the social group as a whole. I met most of them back in school and for the most part I really enjoyed hanging out with them. However some of my friends' friends didn't like me. 

I explicitly remember one time where they were all gathered in one dude's house who didn't get along with me, I asked if I could come over too, but they all said ""oh, it's too crowded and the flat was small"" I've seen the flat since I had helped them move new year's groceries in to the apartment and while it wasn't the biggest 5-6 people could easily fit a 7th in there. I just said ""that's cool, but do you guys wanna come outside real quick to smoke up before I head home?"" trying not to let it get to me, but they declined. So i just smoked alone and went on home. 

I tried not to think too much of it, but it really hurt me even recalling it gets me a little teary eyed.

Several months after that I still hung around with them, but always felt like I didn't fit anymore. When we were walking around the sidewalks or through parks or whatever I was always the one to be walking right behind everyone else. The group didn't like the music I like to listen to, so I never got to play any and had to just listen to what everyone else wanted.

I once invited them all to come over to my house and smoke up, chill and laugh at random shit or whatever but literally only 1 girl showed up. (We still had a great time though, nothing sexual or anything).

But what really made me break up with my friend group was playing PC games together: I had asked them to come play Terraria with me, but instead they thought it was boring so Don't Starve was suggested instead, I agreed if they would play Terraria with me after that sometime, and they agreed.
So we played that for a bit even though I didn't like it that much. Everytime Terraria was on sale i would literally beg them to come play even offering them to buy the 4 player bundle just so that we can play together. And got rejected every time...

All these little things culminated in me dumping all of them from my social circle. 

Some time after that i saw them on steam playing Terraria and they even messaged me there saying ""you were right this game is awesome, we should play it sometime"" I joined the discord when they invited me to play, but lo and behold they were playing League and didn't want to go play Terraria with me even though they knew I hated League. I left the discord and have been ignoring them ever since.


Right now I feel lonely as shit, I shave 2-3 times a month, havent had a haircut in several months, I get up at 14:00-15:00, stay up all night, eat 2 times a day on a good day, I shower once every 3 days and I haven't done any excercise in months. Im underweight, groom myself infrequently and don't even have the willpower to do much of anything all day.

Right now the only friends I have are from my guild in WoW and even that is putting it generously since we haven't met and only talk about the game and only when we are playing it.

I'm kinda introverted and don't even have the willpower to chat up my matches on Tinder/Badoo.

I guess no friends are better than bad friends, but fuck me If I don't feel sad as shit.


TL DR: I dumped my friend circle cause I felt like I didn't belong and constantly felt hurt from interacting with them. The only friends I have now are from my WoW guild and even that is putting it generously. I feel extremely alone and sad, I'm underweight, I don't eat properly, don't groom frequently, almost never excercise, stay up and get up late and I can't motivate myself to pick myself up and do anything about it.

I'm lonely, sad and had to vent for a while. Thanks for coming to my vent talk.",2022-01-16 04:26:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1578669382,8,/r/lonely/comments/s53fja/i_recently_dumped_my_close_friend_circle_and_feel/,,0,4,I recently dumped my close friend circle and feel more alone than ever

2849,s5855r,lonelywolf074,"At 40, Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who never married and had no children, walked through the park in Berlin when he met a girl who was crying because she had lost her favourite doll. She and Kafka searched for the doll unsuccessfully.
Kafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.
The next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter ""written"" by the doll saying ""please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures.""
Thus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life.
During their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable.
Finally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin.
""It doesn't look like my doll at all,"" said the girl.
Kafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: ""my travels have changed me."" the little girl hugged the new doll and brought her happy home.
A year later Kafka died.
Many years later, the now-adult girl found a letter inside the doll. In the tiny letter signed by Kafka it was written:
""Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, love will return in another way.""",2022-01-16 09:21:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639123390,714,/r/lonely/comments/s5855r/everything_you_love_will_probably_be_lost/,,3,22,Everything you love will probably be lost...

2907,s5idh1,Cheese19s,"I had friends... it was some time ago, i can't point the exact moment where it stop being that way. 

I was a teen, i remember, i played a lot of games, watched a lot of anime. I had friends to talk about the things i loved, and they loved them too, we played together. I remember when we played minecraft or played pokemon altogether. Sometimes I would stay days inside home playing when I had a new videogame, but at the end of the day, when I paused it, they were always there for me, and I was always there for them too.

Maybe... It al started when they started smoking, drinking and partying. I didn't like that things, when we meet, my cloths always would end up smelling like smoke, when we played, they were always high. 

So I started to become distant. Everything would be fine. I still had some online friends and i have my videogames. What could go wrong?

Online friends... there good, but there not as good. We meet up one day during holidays, it's all fun, but... They only there to play. Sometimes we speak about life, and so on, but... This winter holidays I stopped playing and starting conversations since i got to town to visit my parents. 

Ding, Dong, make the bell declaring the new year 2022. My phone got out of battery, so i couldn't say happy year to anybody. I remember last new year, i send a lot of custom ""happy new year"" for each of them, they all responded and where happy. This year i couldn't, so i thought that it would be okay to wish them happy new year when my phone is charged up in the morning. 

So waked on 1st January, time to respond... to one person... My D&amp;D GameMaster wished me a happy new year, we aren't even close friends, we're more tabletop play friends. I felt so abandoned at that moment. 

I thought i was a little more close with my online friends, because, after all, we played a lot, know some thing about each other and meet irl. After that, i realized, that I'm the one that always started the conversation, and speak about life, they are not bad people, I'm just not as important to them as they were to me. 

Now, Sunday night, with 25 years. Playing video-games isn't that exciting anymore. Playing a entire day is just not possible anymore because I am an adult now. An adult, with some friends to play games, but not friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now is when i realize, that i can't vent to anybody, nobody for who I cared, cares about my feelings. The few things I can do is just to vent here. I feel like an empty jar that don't get love, don't get honest friendship... I have only myself. And if you are reading this, is most likely you only  have yourself too. I can only tell you to be strong.

You are not the only one, we are all alone together.",2022-01-16 18:43:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1553415633,7,/r/lonely/comments/s5idh1/the_lonely_feeling_of_being_an_empty_jar/,,1,2,The lonely feeling of being an empty jar

2924,s5merh,Ok-Weather-7403,"I haven't really been talking to anyone lately. I used to tell my problems to my friend but we got into a fight recently and he basicly said he can't handle me, and he was the only person I've been able to be me with. And now not having that kinda makes me feel very empty and alone. I kinda thought about texting this other friend I have who I ussually act like myself too, but we aren't that close and I feel weird about just texting him. 

So I feel very alone and I have this feeling like someones sitting on me because i feel so heavy. I've had antisocial periods before but even then I always had like someone who I comunicated with enough to relax and now it feels like for the first time in my life I don't and I just feel desperate for a conversation. 
I feel like I just wonna sleep forever listening to music or eat myself to death or drink or smoke...

I kinda feel like I don't have to try to be me anymore. Why should I try to be me when noone is gonna care.

I feel great and awfull at the same time. My life feels wrong. I find my job boring even though I love it. It just doesnt feel right. I don't feel right and at the same time I have no clue what to do to make it feel right. 

Being alone doesn't feel right. I've never had friends and yet the entierty of my life feeling wrong right now is making me feel alone and sick of myself. 

The worst is that I don't even know what I like or dislike and somehow I feel wrong and I can't explain why. I like where I am and somehow my being disagrees. I feel tired of myself. Like if I could turn off my concusness and plug it back in a few months I would do it.

2950,s5q2o1,InfiniteBurger799,"I used to be somewhat popular, and I had enough friends that I was happy.  Then near the end of my Sophomore year I started dating someone who was very manipulative. They made block everyone so they could have me for themselves. They also monitored me with life360, and would get pissed if I was social. Worst part is that I went along with it. I didn't stand up for myself and they steamrolled my social life. By the time I dumped them I had a singular friend left. It was also the middle of the pandemic when I dumped them, so I couldn't exactly go make new friends easily. 

I attempted to fix things with my old friend group. That started to go pretty well. For a few months things were heading back to normal. I had my friends back, and I was relearning how to be social after not doing it for a while. I even started seeing someone else. It all crumbled down though. I drifted slightly from the group again because of my partner and a job I had just gotten. Slightly turned into more and more until I only had two real friends and my partner left. Somewhere around this time I started smoking pot. 

Pot is great. It numbed my loneliness. Eventually my best friend pulled a huge dick move. He stole my partner, and he stole $80 dollars of pot from me. Naturally he was no longer my best friend. Because my Partner and my best friend were both out of my life so suddenly, and all I had left was a single friend, I got rather depressed. I just started going through a ton of pot. 

My friend, thankfully, is a very good one. He introduced me to his friend group of stoners. They're good people, and I like that I'm their friend now. Before I knew it senior year started. Everything I had had in my previous years at school was gone. All my old friends weren't really my friends anymore because of my new stoner reputation. I had gained a reputation as someone who smokes a lot of pot, so nobody really likes me now because of that (Conservative Midwest small town).  Also as a senior the only new faces around are too young for me to really get along with. 

Socially speaking all I really have is about 6 people I smoke with regularly as a friend group. I don't have anyone to talk to at school. When we're not getting together to smoke I don't speak to the friend group all that much either. Its a very lonely life. I can't wait to get out of this town and have a chance to meet a new population of students in college. That's still 7 months away though. And in those seven months I will be largely alone. I can't even try things like r/r4r or dating apps to meet people because I haven't turned 18 yet. 

At this point my life is just hanging out in my room, working out and watching anime. Then I have to go to school for four hours every weekday, but I often skip due to being too depressed. I still go out and smoke with the boys, but that's kind of all we do. Its a lonely waiting game. 

I have the desire for a meaningful and social life, but people ruined my odds at having that here. I just have to wait until I'm an adult who doesn't live here anymore. Its like my life is on pause, and I hate it.",2022-01-17 00:29:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642376557,4,/r/lonely/comments/s5q2o1/waiting_for_high_school_to_end/,,0,2,Waiting for high school to end

2994,s5vuu3,Mad_Season_1994,"I can honestly say that I did not have a happy life growing up. I have happy memories from my childhood, of course. But I can't ever recall being truly happy and carefree and all that. My home life wasn't always great as my parents fought like cats and dogs a lot. Nothing abusive or anything of the sort, just the tiniest things would set them off and I'd always have to be in earshot of it. My school life was also, of course, not great either. I was (and still am) a loner who only really had friends in elementary school. But from middle school onwards, I was on my own. No birthday parties to go to, no summer breaks spent with friends, not even any romantic relationships. Just me, myself and I.

But, I did find some small measure of comfort in books and movies. And I found the most comfort, and safety, in the Harry Potter series. I was never really imaginative, but found myself sucked in every time I opened one of the books or watched the movies. At the very least, they were a break from reality for me and gave me entertainment, joy and happiness when I needed it most.

So, I decided to give the Return to Hogwarts documentary a watch and thought it was great. Seeing the people I practically grew up with all back together again, having that same level of love and affection for each other was heartwarming. But, upon reflection, I found myself feeling depressed because it reminded me of so many of the things I never had growing up and what I missed out on, all because of my shyness and inability to connect with people. I knew that if Hogwarts was real, I'd have no place in it. If anything, I'd probably turn out like Tom Riddle, minus the being evil and having a desire for world domination, of course.",2022-01-17 05:19:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636782764,17,/r/lonely/comments/s5vuu3/even_though_i_love_the_harry_potter_film_series/,,0,2,"Even though I love the Harry potter film series, I'll always find it most unrelatable to me because it's about the one thing I've never had: friends/friendship"

(I have some health conditions, some of which mean I have to be careful about what I eat, and I don't drink alcohol) I didn't want my issues to interfere with arrangements, so I made it really clear, I was happy to do anything or go anywhere.
I was messaged to say there would be a lunch at a nice hotel. Great. Except I've since found out there is also a dinner, with other family members invited and everyone is staying the night.
I have not been invited to this at all. I thought at first it could be because they didn't want to invite my child, as it would be boozy, but then they know I could easily get child care so it can't be that.
It's left me feeling really sad and left out.

I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail as to where those feelings come from but all of my life, people treated me as if I have no right to exist, or exist according to their preconceived expectations. And obviously since how I live isn‚Äôt bound by what others expect of me, I‚Äôm punished by those same people, which unfortunately seem to be the majority of people I come across is my life. It makes forming connections with people in general difficult and a burden. So as the title says, I feel like I need to forget about trying to have a neutral position and embrace my antagonizing existence. If people won‚Äôt change their premature perception of me regardless of what I do then I‚Äôll ignore it and do what I want anyway.

3095,s6goxm,Spiritual_Okra_5228,"After countless rejections, I was lucky enough to be in my first relationship two years ago, but I had to call it off even though I still really loved her. I only saw her once and I couldn't bare the burden of the distance anymore when it began affecting my mental well-being.

I would describe myself as someone who prioritizes the character and personality traits of a person over their physical appearance or the bodily proportions they possess. I just want someone who wants me and likes me, like I them. 


I turned 22 recently and the amount of times I've been turned down this past year alone just makes me feel depressed. It's always the same pattern. 
I go on a date or start writing with someone I recently met, we get along well, they show a little interest, I overcommit and become clingy, then they just want to stay friends, and that's the last I hear of them. 
When I try my best to play it cool, I get nothing from them that might insinuate them wanting anything more than another friendship where you just like their Instagram posts and ask questions about their stories from time to time.
Whenever I'm lucky enough to eventually find someone who actively pays a decent amount of attention, like hitting me up first on a regular or not taking days to respond, they stop immediately I try to make a move. I literally get no form of nonplatonic attention from the opposite sex in any manner.

My roommate of ca. 2 years recently went on vacation and it made me realize how much lonelier I would even be when he eventually moves out. I have this big apartment to myself and enough things to keep me entertained for brief moments before I realize I have nobody to share them with and how lonely I truly am. Sure I could distract myself some more with hours of work, mingling with friends or vigorous exercising, but it doesn't change the fact that I still deeply crave intimacy and warmth, something more than a ""friend"" could give.
I want it so bad and I don't understand why it has been so difficult to find it.

It always brings me down when I know I try my very best every day at becoming a better individual. Picking up new skills, trying out new fashion style, watching videos to better my rhetorics and wittiness with the ladies, meeting new people outside my circle of interest in hopes of it one day being enough to attract a lady, but knowing very well that it has never been enough. On the other hand, my friends who put in the bare minimum, can effortlessly get the lady they want. I don't get it.

Nobody wants to be with me and I'm exhausted by the thought of it every single day üòî

I want pain to have reason -
And for my reason to be clear -

I leave behind those I kept near -
And in the end that is what I fear -
To have love and never feel it -
To be happy but can't revere it -
To be hurt and never heal it - 


Maybe one day the pain will grow old and turn to stone -
And become that foundation from which I am grown -

Now 4 months ago I moved into an appartment, after living with my mom, now at the beginning it was awesome,Freedom, doing whatever I want it felt so good.

But recently this feeling changed, I have alot of friends and we do things IRL and we play games online alot but most of them have a partner or have purely sexual partners. And they cancel plans because they are doing things with said partners.
As is expected at our age ofcourse.

But everytime this happens it feels like it takes a bit of my soul, because I feel I'm left behind and that I missed out on so much love and happiness because I've been alone my whole life.

This feeling has been building up alot recently and it has even gotten worse because the only female I regularly talked to and a had romantic interest for, also got a partner because I didn't have the confidence to ask her out.

Now I'm not the best looking guy and I'm a bit overweight so I'm also not very popular on dating apps, and because of my non existing self-esteem I'm to afraid to talk to woman IRL, though I have been working out recently and worked on my appearance, it seems like I'm all doing it for nothing and I'm just sinking deeper and deeper in this pit of self hate and I'm really afraid it will end up in a depression.

Honestly it feels horrible, this year will likely be my 12 year single without any dating or sexual interaction with a women,  dating apps really break you down further. Couple of months ago I opted for onlyfans found a model that replies regularly and honestly she's the only girl I talk too. 

Currently I feel that with each day I wakeup to, I'm a day closer to my end. Lost interest in all of my hobbies, which I used to do with a passion... Lost interest in my dreamjob (which I currently do) even masturbation isn't as satisfying anymore. I just wish I've never existed.

The lack of motivation to do anything is at an all time high, I don't look forward in anything except to the day I get to quite this world.

3167,s6qe6f,immortalvikinghero,"Surrounded by people, nobody to talk to, no clue why i get in these moods, everything basically lacks a satisfaction factor. I feel like i'm losing in every aspect of my life and rationally i can argue that down but the feeling remains. It gets even stranger though when i realize i'm gravitating towards people i have no interest in. It'll be like i know this chick is boring but she's hella easy and slutty so i'll be like heyyy and tbh i just want to use them to distract myself so i recoil back and away so nothing actually happens. My woman is being an utter bitch lately and if i try to explain how off putting her behavior is it turns into me making shit up etc etc. I just want to enjoy life and feel like i'm making progress in some form or another but the universe has decided to be all like hey fuck that guy which is a shame, i've always put others first because i'm prone to a sociopath's mind/skill set. Being self aware that i need to do something because of something is basically how i maintain sanity. Like i'm very much capable of just being a heartless asshole who gets everything he wants but I ellect to instead try to be a better person by taking the longer roads in life but here i sit in this loathesome pot of regret holding a sign that says no hope no future because of decisions i made years ago and i just feel like i'm out of time. I keep my thoughts in such a complex state i feel as if nobody can understand me, it's like yeah i know how to get what i want but i made commitments that have turned into moral obligation and i can't convince myself to just be like fuck it as she has no where else to go, to sick to work etc, and then i fucked around and got dogs again so there's no moving to a cheaper residence without them and i'm not going to abandon the lives dependant on me just to have more magical paper. I'm legitimately about to just have a mental breakdown i'm just tired of doing everything and everything that pisses me off is basically just self inflicted. I can't afford good old fashioned drugs to help me cope atm either, just weed fr, i'm prone to addiction so i avoid anything crazy. For years i just coped by just basically being a sex addict, unfortunately a hole is not just a hole, i need a reason and currently have nobody to invoke that reasoning. Even if i could afford therapy, wouldn't help. I once had the idea of becoming one myself and fundamentally the only change i can make to better my situation is beyond what i'm willing to allow. The one conversation i had with an ancient retired therapist, back when i was still in highschool he basically told me the problems that i have from back then were that i became self aware to soon. Had i not discovered that i could compete academically at the national level at such a young age i likely wouldn't have learned how to control everything in such detail, that i'm among the scariest type of personality as the literal moment someone arrives in my circle I'll begin influencing their opinions of myself towards a purpose i'm not even aware of. Some kids my age half alpha complex or essentially the desire to be perceived as greater than they actually are, meanwhile i've already gone beyond that effectively becoming whatever it is i desired. That was approximately how i remember all of that, i was forced into anger management as a child but nothing he did or said triggered a response. Instead he said i felt forced into liking me for almost no reason. After explaining myself in each and every situation I was in that called for this requirement thats basically when he laid it out. I wasn't an overly angry child, i had already rationalized how to get what i want in the shortest amount of time possible. I'm actually enjoying writing this as it provides a moment to reflect on myself and how i'm just making my life more difficult for sport. Fr i think i just need a fwb to knock up at this point in my life. To old to be on this depression kick and to smart to let it influence me negatively. It's that the feeling persosts that it becomes a bother as i can deny my own feelings and they will go away in time. 

Tl:dr i know exactly how to get what i want but i refuse to as it's in opposition of personal morals and obligations, ask questions if you like.",2022-01-18 06:04:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638239820,1,/r/lonely/comments/s6qe6f/probably_just_entering_depression_again_lol/,,0,0,Probably just entering depression again lol

3170,s6qhbb,HugeLab5450,"Everytime I go though threads, I always see the same bit of advice when it comes to friends and potential partners; ""If they're into you, they'll make an effort and make you feel like a priority."" 

I've never had this. Even in the one relationship I've had, I was never her number one priority. I'm no one's priority and it sucks. I'm going through quarantine right now and my loneliness has ramped up. When I posted I was covid positive, most people replied saying get well and all that. But that's really all. After that first day, didn't really get much in the way of messages.

Before i caught covid, I had gone out after work with a few coworkers. We just went to eat, but I had a good time and we had planned to have a poker night the next night. And I got excited because it's rare I get invited to anything these days. I offered to bring poker chips and was so excited! 

The main guy texted me the next day, asking if I was still down, I said yeah, I just might be there an hour after they were planning to get started. He said it was all good. So, I text him when I'm ready.

Nothing.

Ah whatever, he might just be busy, I'll give him a few minutes. 

10 minutes.

20 minutes.

45 minutes.

He's posting about the poker party while ignoring me. I just drove around and tried to ignore it. I already took my dad's poker chips, and I didn't want to come home and embarrass myself by bringing them home after being gone 20 minutes. 

I never got a text back. I just saw all the pictures and videos posted. Fucking everyone from my work was there except me.

I was almost happy I caught covid cause it gave me a reason to just stay home and shut off for a few days. 

But now I'm here, in quarantine, with no one to talk to. And feeling like no one wants to talk to me. I just don't know what to do.

I just want friends I can count on, people who want to talk to me more than once a week, people who just like me.",2022-01-18 06:09:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624945285,11,/r/lonely/comments/s6qhbb/im_no_ones_priority/,,0,2,I'm no one's priority

I would prefer a girl to talk to, but if you are a boy it's also okay :). I'm not looking for any relationship or love thing. Just friends. Also no pity. Last time I made a message like this some guys messaged me with oh baby are you okay? Why are you lonely? Don't do that please. EUW would be best for the timezone. I  use discord. Oh PS: I really don't like people sometimes I even hate them. I come from a bad home situation, and have a lot of trust issues. Not that that is an excuse for hating people in my head, but it's just how it is right now and I really can't change. At least it feels like that. Hopefully that didn't scare you away.

3220,s6znkr,Disastrous-Yak94,"
I was roaming around on Tik Tok the other day (as ya do), and came across this one by @maddiezahms called ""Life of the Fat Funny Friend"". It's a song about being the FFF in a friend group and I...don't think a song has ever resonated with me that much. 

In not only my friend groups but my family, I'm I expected to be the empath with the comic relief, be there for others, be the catcher when someone else drops the ball, and peacekeep. One lyric goes ""Cant be too loud and can't be too busy, If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me"". That's me.. I'm not allowed opinions even though I have them, I'm not ever the one accommodated or considered. 

My family lives mostly in DFW, and I'm in OKC. My step sister just got married and I realistically helped out a ton on wedding day. I don't know how it happens but like there were these signs that needed greenery draped on them and Id fixed them originally and then every time after that, I was called to re-set it if it got blown over. I was coordinating the timing for the photographer and bartenders to get in and set up because I...look approachable to them? Like I wasn't originally supposed to do that, but it just happened that way...? In addition to all the rest of the bridesmaid duties. And at the end of the night I didn't get any thank you or ""glad you were here"" or anything which is fine, but I also travelled the furthest of anybody for the wedding... 

My other step sister is getting married at a destination wedding which will end up costing $3500 all said and done. And she just told me she wants to do a getogether in Dallas instead of the originally planned OKC and thats gonna be another $300 plus gas for travelling down there and back alone again. 

My other best friend of 20 years, I used to work with her, and I was commuting to DFW from OKC every week for two days for 6 months. I was spending time away from my boyfriend (who I live with) and my circadian rhythm was fucked, so I finished the project initiative I'd started to revamp their project management process and turned in my two weeks. My best friend of 20 years gave me the silent treatment for 6 months after that. She's only just now starting to rekindle. She was going through a lot of mental health things at the time but I have a deep fear if abandonment which she knows and she still left me in a really bad spot. 

The lyrics of Life of the Fat Funny Friend say in another spot: ""Cant be too proud and can't think I'm pretty, do they keep me around so their flaws just seem silly"" and...sometimes I wonder if that's me. If I'm the almost pretty one. The almost skinny one. Kinda expendable and put in pictures and groups so everyone else looks better.

Anyway, it's like everyone here needs help in one way or another and frankly you're not going to get much help beyond armchair therapy and maybe some similar experiences. Having your pain and issues validated by someone else does go a long way, don't get me wrong. But I dunno, I guess I'm just tired of finding the account of people I talked suddenly deleted. There's a limit to what people here can help with and some people aren't looking for help to begin with. So I just figure, why not say fuck it? I'm not a therapist but we can sit down and play some games so at least you aren't alone I guess. Maybe I'm over simplifying things. Maybe I'm not and I'm a genius. Probably the former.

3373,s7j5zb,Bugzappagal,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm posting this because I had a few people reach out to me regarding comments I left on someone else‚Äôs post on this subreddit. The advice I shared with them seemed to be appreciated so I compiled it for anyone who wants it. It was given to lonely guys looking to meet girls, but I don‚Äôt see why girls couldn‚Äôt use most of it too. 

The first pieces of advice are pretty general in nature:

After online dating for 10 years, I thought okcupid was the best site. I went on probably a hundred dates, got hurt a lot, but ultimately found the one.

Looks are highly relative to girls. In my experience, confidence is key and sense of humor is also pretty important. 

Keep an open mind and low expectations. Unfortunately, dating is often a numbers game and who the fuck has the energy for it? You will be into people who are not into you and it will hurt. But keep reaching out and try to be genuinely interested in hearing about other people‚Äôs lives.

People love bonding over common interests. Find something specific and fake interest if you have to. 

Ok, so the other advice pertains to going to a bar to meet girls. Every situation is different though so take it with a big chunk of salt. This advice is more about building confidence than getting laid, though I wish you luck for both!

Find a place to go to that looks chill, not intimidating, crowded with lots of different kinds of people. Set a small goal for yourself‚Äîlike talk to one girl, that‚Äôs it. Verbally communicate with a female.

The place has to be quiet enough to talk‚Äîno loud clubs where you can't hear the person next to you. However, it‚Äôs best to go where there is live music or karaoke or something to watch.

Go in with the intention of spending 30 minutes there, no more. That way it doesn‚Äôt feel like you are just hanging around drinking by yourself like a creep.

Go to the bar and get a drink. It doesn‚Äôt have to be alcohol but you need something in your hand, something to do. Not just looking down at your phone.

You are unwinding with a drink after work enjoying some live music like a perfectly normal adult‚Ä¶THIS IS YOUR MINDSET.

When you feel chill, make eye contact with someone nearby. Someone near, you don't want to walk straight up from across the room or follow them. Ease yourself closer, if need be. FYI, it‚Äôs tricky approaching a girl in a group. Best to wait for the right moment when she‚Äôs on her own for a moment (checking out the band, ordering a drink).

Have couple of questions in your back pocket that relate to the environment/situation. ie: do you know the name of this band? And a follow up question: have you seen them before? OR do you know if there‚Äôs another band coming on after? Super easy questions that are more informative. She should have no real clue you are interested.

If you pick up on signals that she‚Äôs receptive, only then do you start flirting (and that‚Äôs a whole other story) 

One opening question, one follow up question and that‚Äôs it unless you get signals. After that, you run the risk of pestering her. If she‚Äôs not interested after a couple questions, she probably won‚Äôt be, period.

If she‚Äôs not into it and you want to keep practicing, repeat all steps with someone else (not in her group) AFTER 15 MINUTES. 

I hope this helps someone. Feel free to contact me with questions or if your situation is different and you think I can help. Have a good day friends!",2022-01-19 06:01:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638259375,3,/r/lonely/comments/s7j5zb/just_putting_this_out_there/,,0,1,Just putting this out there

3414,s7r52u,looknessie,"I'm lonely and I'd like to have friends and actually do meaningful things in my free time but I've been alone for so long it doesn't feel natural to be with other people anymore. For some reason I just can't seem to feel at peace when I'm not alone. But at the same time I'm so lonely and feel like I'm missing out on life by just holing myself up in my room. It's so contradictory. Like yesterday I was agonizing about how lonely I was all day but when I got a message from someone my first thought was ""ugh I don't want to deal with people leave me alone"". I think there must be something wrong with me. How will I ever get better if I'm like this? I just don't know how to start to enjoying being around people... When I socialize I want to go home but when I'm alone I feel bitter and sad that I have no one to hang out with.

I guess I'm an introvert and my social battery runs out easily but I also have social needs as a human. I acknowledge that my friendless life fucking sucks. And I do try to do things and put myself out there to challenge myself. I go to parties, I hang out with people when I'm invited, I became a representative of the student union at my home university, I help organize events for students etc. But the people I've met are all just casual acquaintances. The kind that you don't really keep in touch with. The kind that you chat with when you meet but you're not *really* friends.

Currently I'm doing a semester abroad and I'm so scared of being left alone. The few weeks that I've been here, I've gotten to know some people but still I feel like I never get invited to things. Like yesterday I saw on instagram that people I know and my roommates hung out without me. And I know it's probably my own fault. I haven't talked to them enough. I haven't made enough effort to join. And in a way I enjoyed not being there cause I've literally been doing social things almost every day since I came here. But I can't seem to forgive myself for not being social(?) Like I'm constantly afraid that the one thing I miss is the gathering where I should've been. The one where something clicks and people become best friends. And then I'm left out forever. Cause I feel like that's what always happens. I don't want to ruin my time here by spending all of it alone in my room.",2022-01-19 14:20:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599552358,5,/r/lonely/comments/s7r52u/i_feel_like_im_unfixable/,,0,6,I feel like I'm unfixable

I‚Äôm constantly reminded of how amazing I am. I take care of the needs of the people and the building. I keep it stocked. I fix problems I give hugs,advice and I greet everyone with all the warmth and love I have to my name. Nobody knows how much these hugs mean to me. Or how sad and lonely I am.

3431,s7ul6c,Elmin_Aung_Khant,"I just turned 19 a few weeks ago. In Dec 2019, I got to my  university for the very first time. I don't really have much friends. I had 9months holidays before the uni opens but I mostly spent my time alone. Before my first semester completed, Covid broke out and got to stay at home. A month later, I saw my grandma who was living with me died in front of me. From then, I've been living alone. I tried to live with the hope of things getting back together after the pandemic. Then, on 2nd Feb, a coup happened and I don't see any hope anymore. Meanwhile rich friends of mine can easily flee to other countries and continue their life journey. Things just getting worse here. At one point, I just can't control my sleep schedules and meal schedules anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in a prison.

Today, I slept at 5AM, woke up at 5:40PM and had only one meal till now. I feel empty and lonely looking towards ceiling. I have no energy to do something. Sometimes, I just don't want to eat or sleep in spite of necessities. This has been happening for several months and I want to end this loop.

3456,s80xl4,ArtichokeOriginal901,"(Sorry for my English) 

I've got into this new school around Aug 2021 and I wanted to socialize with people unlike how I was in my old school (I used to be very shy and didn't have friends). Fortunately, I made some friends and the first 3 months in my new school were amazing. Until now, we came back to school from winter break and I don't know why but no one in my friend group has been texting me. I know they're good people, you can see it but I think I did something that kind of pushed them away from me or something. I want to know what it is but I also know that if I ever talk about that stuff they're gonna get weirded out and get further away from me. I always get tired in school trying to get closer to them, I have to force myself to try and form a conversation. They don't say it but I can feel that they're bored of me. I'm not the most hyper type but I try to be loud and energetic around them. I fucking hate that I think about them and my friendship 24/7 and I think I focus too much on being in their lives than being genuinely close with them. I used to have a close friend that I probably wouldn't call my best friend but she also doesn't text me as much anymore and when she does it sounds like she often wants to just get my shit out of the way. It was recently my birthday before we came back to school and all of my friends hasn't given me a birthday present nor had told me happy birthday in person until one of them did a week later. At that time, it was already almost 10 days after my birthday, when on her birthday I gave her a birthday present and gifted her something that I wanted to get her. I'm thankful for having friends who give me gifts and everything but if she didn't want to do that then what's the purpose of it if you know what I mean. I honestly don't even know if they care about me. I sent all of them a text yesterday and none of them responded to it. If I go on Whatsapp I'm left on read on all of my recent conversations. I'm not gonna find a new friend group or leave the friend group I'm in now because I don't fit in anywhere else. I fucking hate life.

3487,s84zs0,Fun-Apartment-942,"Oh boy where do I start. I guess I‚Äôll start with the obvious. I feel lonely as fuck.

I miss the feeling of having a relationship. I miss having friends that gave a shit about me. I miss the feeling of a ‚Äúwhole‚Äù family (as whole as my family was at least) I have about 3 friends that I consider family that genuinely care about me and appreciate me.

I called a couple friends the other day to check up on them. They appreciated the gesture and thanked me. Then I realized, no one really checks up on me. 

People only notice that something‚Äôs wrong with me when they physically see it. No one ever cares to stop and ask ‚ÄúOh how is ‚ÄòOP‚Äô doing? Maybe we should hit him up to check on him.‚Äù 

I care and genuinely have love for the people around me and the people that I want to do good. I‚Äôm starting something up and want to bring people up with me, but I don‚Äôt want to bring those up that only want to use me.

I feel like social media was taking a heavy toll on my mental health considering I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship of 3.5 years and was drinking quite heavily along with using weed every night. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I can‚Äôt keep staring at a fucking screen about all the couples doing cute shit, inspirational posts and all that when I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm not taking any steps to better myself. And also being an ex addict with a couple mental illnesses already (agoraphobia/SA/MDD) it‚Äôs hard trying to get out of negative thought loops. So I took two weeks off. Tapered off the alc. haven‚Äôt had a drink in 3 nights so far. And finally decided I‚Äôm gonna quit weed which is a strange one for me. Weed doesn‚Äôt actually hurt me it makes my anxiety go away and makes me feel comfy in my own skin but I have to come to terms with the fact it‚Äôs killing my motivation and keeping me from my goals. My big plan next is to go full sober (: step 1. Step 2- take time self healing and finally seek therapy. Step 3- Alresdy got a gym membership so finally commit to going every day (natural release of endorphins yay!!!) And step 4- hopefully within 5-7 months I‚Äôll be in a much better place, not so hard on myself, having better sleep (usual is 3-4hours around 4am), better mental health and coping methods and lastly feeling ready to start dating again. I feel like this previous relationship fucked me up so bad I didn‚Äôt stop to think I was just self loathing and downing my pain with substances and was seeking out rebounds but I realize my mistake now and just can‚Äôt till I feel ready. I was talki to one girl and I feel so bad for telling her I need to work on myself (I sent a whole essay just so she knows how much I can‚Äôt rn and why:( but yeah gonna try my best here to grow and become an even better person than before my ex so when the right person/people come along I have the skills to just walk away pain-free or be able to tell if it‚Äôs toxic (red flags) early on.

The only things they have said to me is that I need to work on staying out of our common areas(which I have only been in for maybe one hour total to heat food and use the bathroom) so that they were more comfortable.

They haven‚Äôt even stopped to think how I might be feeling considering I am the one who is sick and isolated. The last time a roommate had to isolate we sat outside her door and talked to her. They haven‚Äôt even sent a text to me.

3518,s8ahw3,Sir_Funk1,"Life used to be fun. It was full of love laughter friends family. Potential promise. But now. In just a short period of time. It's turned into a living hell.

I am a broken man. A man that's lost everything.

Iin just 2 years I've lost my childhood best friend.

I've lost my mom suddenly

I've lost my dog

I've lost my home

No one loves me

I've lost God because he doesn't seem to care for me.

People that I thought cared for me don't.

It just makes me wonder. Why does life turn out this way.

Why do some people have it all and some have nothing

Why are people so cold and just don't care for others.

Why does life change so quickly. I mean what's the meaning of life. 

I know I'll never have love again.

I know I'll never have a close friend again.

I just want to know what I did.

What did I do for life to turn out this way?

Am I not a nice person?

Am I not respectful to everyone I meet?

I'm just not made for a cruel cruel world.

I don't have it in me to be greedy

Or mean

Or hurtful

I'll try but I just don't know how I can overcome so many obstacles in my life. And if I do overcome them... Who will I share it with.

I don't know man it's hard, and I'm not overdramatic for not liking this, we are social creatures we aren't meant to be alone..it just pains me too because people feel lonely when they can't see their friends face to face, or when they don't have a romantic partner and then i look at myself and see that I'm much worse. if they get to feel lonely when I wish i had their relationships I just..don't know how I'm supposed to feel.",2022-01-20 22:44:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642292052,35,/r/lonely/comments/s8uzp0/stop_saying_its_ok/,,0,15,stop saying it's ok

3629,s8vc8c,Awesometjgreen,"So I (22m) am a film student (technically my major is English but my minor and aa are in film) and today we watched the 2006 film Babel. At first I didn't remember seeing this until about 20min in and I realized I watched the film a few years ago when it came on TV late at night randomly.

This film really almost made me cry...again, specifically Rinko Kikuchi's character Chieko. Girl literally has no real friends and feels invisible to the world. I felt like my entire life was wrapped up in her storyline. Obviously I'm not deaf nor am I cute Asian girl but still, holy shit. This film really nailed what it feels like to be lonely as shit.

I kinda wish I would have skipped class because I've been alone at home all day for weeks with little to no communication and I recently cut off all my backstabbing ""friends.""

3636,s8webf,[deleted],"Im M19, currently studying in 3rd semester and have not met a single ""friend"" in over a year.

I had to move for uni, so I pretty much lost all the friends i made till now. My first semester was right when Covid began, so I had like 8 months of pure ""online college"" stuff.

So technically this is my first semester of ""real college"", going to uni, meeting people etc.

I  literally made 0 friends in over a year living here (except small talk with my neighbors), and slowly its really depressing me. Every weekend I hear people outside my dorm throwing parties, while I play games, do late night uni-work or think about how pathetically lonely I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I also became very introverted and got used to all that isolation over the past months, which makes it so hard to ""break free"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The only force driving me forward right now, is the thought of my ""future-diploma"" being worth it all and blah blah blah.... not being able to share anything in your life with a friend / girlfriend is such a terrible feeling. Sometimes I feel worthless as shit, usually I dont leave my tiny room anymore because going outside just becomes a real ""obstacle"" sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hate being  lonely, even excuses like Covid don't count anymore, which makes it worse and worse, every single day that passes.

3684,s92scl,hdjdhdbdndms,"Basically, I am lonely and I want to talk to my friend but I feel like I annoy him because he takes several hours (sometimes an entire day) just to open my message, and usually he doesn't reply and just leaves me on read, or if he does reply he gives the driest responses. 

He wasn't really much of a texter before this anyways but I thought that was just because we saw each other every day in person at school,  and we are much more communicative in person. But now that we aren't seeing each other I feel extremely lonely and I was hoping we would start texting a little more to compensate, and possibly make plans to hang out outside of school. I offered to drive to his house so we could hang out but he never took me up on my offer. Okay, maybe he is just really busy. I get that. He is a busy person usually. We don't have to hang out but I would at least just like to text him. I don't think I'm asking for much. To just take like five minutes out of his day to text me once in a while on his free time is all I'm asking. Just saying hi, letting me know what's up, and asking me how I'm doing. That would make all the difference, just knowing that I still have my friend. 

I feel like if I tell my friend how I feel or I express my emotions he will think I'm like a negative Nancy and get even more annoyed with me. I also feel like I'm being selfish and clingy for wanting attention from my friend. I'm kinda known for like being chill and not really getting sad like that, so I am worried that if he sees this side of me he won't want to be friends anymore. 

I am in a very bad depression right now. I hate being alone. I feel really isolated and lonely. I hate not talking to my friend and not being around others. I need to talk to someone so bad. I feel so lonely and I can't take it anymore. School, literally the one thing I ever had to look forward to, has been taken away from me. Yeah, my life is so boring and lonely that I literally look forward to going to school. It's the only time I ever get out and have a social life. I've literally been self harming because the loneliness is that painful. I have no one to talk to and I want to talk to my friend but I can't. I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel physically ill trying to get to know new men on dating apps, they all talk to me like a dog. Less than that.

3786,s9mrk9,fsocietymemberelliot,"Sorry, I think this will be longer than I thought. 

Hello friend, I'm a 19 year old dude from Germany.
I'm dealing with loneliness for about four years and it's partially driving me crazy. I have some days where I'm completely fine, the beginning of this week was one of the best times in a long time, I'm about to tell you why.

I confessed my love to my crush on a Thursday (last weekend). After texting a bit, she didn't answer for almost two days. And then suddenly she showed up at my work and asked if I would like to go walking with her after work, that would be around 10pm.

I said yes, we talked and walked around, it was beautiful.

She had a crush on me one year ago, but she hasn't the same feelings now. She said that she really likes me and that we have a special connection.....

Fun fact: We started texting each other in June 2021, and we literally just met for the first time a few days ago.
When we started talking to each other back then, we both felt that special connection, we exchanged the most intimate stuff. But as I said, that was a year ago...
We also had a little break in between, I think October was the month of silence, she said we needed a little distance. 

Present: Well, we are talking to each other and yeah I confessed my love to her. We met, we still are talking,...
 I think. I asked her yesterday how her day was, she didn't answer (she does this often). We haven't talked today, the whole fucking day, it's driving me crazy.

I know I have to give her time, she has her own problems, everyone does. And I also don't want to destroy out connection or relationship. That's why I'm not texting her again, even though she didn't answer. 

And now the problem is back again: loneliness

I hope it's not chronic loneliness lol.
I feel like I'm losing touch to everyone. I know I have my parents, my siblings and friends.
But that's what loneliness is, right? You still feel lonely af, isolated af even though there are people around you.

I haven't met friends, besides university, since New years eve

A contact, someone I can be intimate with, someone that's understanding me, someone I can talk to, someone I can hug and cry in her arms.

I just want someone to hug.

That's just a little episode of my live and my current state of mind, it may not sound that extreme but I think it is. At least my heart pounding doesn't start that often.


Thanks for listening friend, love you.",2022-01-21 22:26:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611244797,11,/r/lonely/comments/s9mrk9/hello_friend_im_lonely_my_crush_is_not_answering/,,0,6,"Hello friend, I'm lonely, my crush is not answering, etc"

3822,s9t1ql,[deleted],"I've always felt incredibly alone. As a kid I always had trouble making friends which often led to me hiding during lunch and recess to avoid the children in my grade. I was never bullied but I was alienated from everyone and those experiences resulted in pretty negative thoughts. Despite having friends and family, I don‚Äôt feel like I can truely talk to anyone about it because every time I‚Äôve tried to in the past, they never understood what I was talking about. They‚Äôd either get confused or laugh at what I said and I‚Äôd have to play it off as a joke or just a crazy thought.

I graduated last year and ever since, people have told me about everything I‚Äôve got ahead of me. They keep telling me how great life is but all I can think about is how useless it all is if I have to live it alone.

3843,s9vc7n,exotyliez,"I really have nobody to talk to, it sucks knowing that everyone i know has such good lives which im glad they do but how awful mine is. My mom had me at 15 so her entire life she was working to support me and my siblings. I am now 17 and have moved out of my moms house due to problems in the past and now am living with my dad. I never really received attention like all my other siblings, i was always forgotten. My siblings are half siblings and having a step dad really messed me up. I grew up wondering why i was treated so differently than all my other siblings. They'd get new shoes new clothes, toys, and anything they could've wanted but my stepdad never treated me like that. He would always call me names and make fun of me whenever i would mess up or show any sort of emotion which makes it hard for me to ever express how i feel which is why im here. Until i was about 8 i found out my stepdad wasnt my real dad and everything started making sense. I used to be a good kid in school and always do my work and such and get good grades until my stepdad and mom split. I was always surrounded by abuse constantly as my mom would always end up with some abusive boyfriends. I got so tired of it and eventually moved out and with my dad, and can i say it was the worst decision of my life. I had a bestfriend at the time and he was the best. I never had many friends as i always was the annoying kid and very poor so was always made fun of. His family loved me and i loved them and felt at home with them. After moving in with my dad a couple weeks later he passes out and is rushed to the hospital. They found out he had internal head bleeding and said he would be lucky if he lived another 24 hours. I cried for days and couldn't eat or id throw up. My dad would always get frustrated because of how i was acting and would call me names and tell me to stop acting like a girl or little bitch. I repressed my feelings so much i changed completely. Now 4 years later i see how much it affected me and wished i always had supportive parents as i see in so many videos. I still am very poor and dont have my own room, ive been working and never has my dad bought me anything. I buy my own food, clothes, and even bought my own car. No matter how hard i try its like im never enough. My dad didnt even seem proud at all. He threatens to take it all the time. He always disrespects me but if i show any disrespect to him he threatens me. He claims to be such a good parents but never does anything for me. Im never home and i still keep in touch with my moms side of the family. After so long i see my mom finally doing what i wish she did for me. She supports my siblings, goes to their games and cheers them on. She supports them no matter what but whenever i tried telling them how i wanna pursue something they dont even seem like they care. I have a couple friends but i feel like im always just a back up whenever someone else cant make it. I sit in my car all day because i have nobody to talk to. How do i tell someone how i feel without scaring them off or just make them think im just so messed up. I just wish i had someone care about me. I work and try so hard and wish someone was atleast proud of me but i constantly am reminded about how lame i am to everyone.

3869,s9yerj,fernalgarex,"It's not hard finding someone to talk to, but it's hard holding or keeping their attention on me.

I'm not an ugly or bad looking guy at all. Quite the contrary actually and even then I've been compared to Robin Williams and Jim Carrey personality type wise and I believe they're both ENFJ lol but that's besides the point 

I think or feel me being extra is what causes women to not want to continue dating me or seeing me

All my life I've always been told I was extra as fuck
I never understood why until it clicked that what I do or say at times can be extra in a petty way or loving way or in any way tbh it'll always be extra with me

Ex: I hold the door open for people walking from the pumps instead of the one or 2 getting out of their car near the entrance like that's extra as fuck 

But even then my ideologies and how I perceive life can be a little *wtf m8* kinda moment because I've always had an obscure way of thinking. I don't think like majority of people do. I fancy the odd and weird possibilities of how this world is and how it came to be and all that other good stuff but most already have embedded in their login noggin that God is why we're here and he's our purpose like YUCK NO GROTESQUE-- how dare you limit yourself to the endless possibilities of our existence and meaning. Whether we even have one or not you know?

Well shit like that can scare and possibly worry someone into thinking they're dating an autistic person or someone that's mentally ill. Idk it's what I've been told in the past

So yeah I feel like I'm forever just destined to be alone

Ever since both my fiance and grandma passed away from Covid I feel like i've been crippled forever, it's like I can't breathe. I have no-one left, I look at this empty house and all I feel is like I am dead already too. They were my everything, my only family and friends. Damn covid, it took everything from me! I don't know what to do, how do you cope with the loneliness, the fact that the persons you loved the most are gone forever and you'll never hear their voices again? I don't know what to do, I just want to join them, feel their touch once again! 

After my fiance died I had a mental breakdown, was admitted in a psych ward for 2 month, after that I was in no shape to go to work, nor was in any shape to socialize or even leave the house. I ended up pushing all my friends away, isolating myself from everyone and everything, it was like all sorts of bonds I had lost their meaning.

I survive because I was put on welfare, so I make some 215 USD (minimum wage in my country) a month, half my usual salary. It's barely enough for my meds, therapy and food, but not for rent and stuff, so i'm being forced to leave the house in the next 8 days. It's hard, probably gonna become homeless again.

It has been a nearly 2 years since I met anybody new. My social circle for the last two years has been just my parents and my two friends. So I decided that today I was going to meet somebody new and have atleast one conversation outside of the four people in my life.

I went to a park near my place but when I tried to approach someone it felt like it was impossible to talk to anybody. Everybody had their airpods on, counting their steps, checking their fitbits. The only people there talking were talking on their phone or they were with someone already. I felt like I just couldn't talk to random people, I felt like giving up and went to go sit in my favourite spot in the park. I was sitting there for like half an hour watching Netflix, thinking how I couldn't even make conversation at the park. I felt so stupid and decided that it was time to go home. So I got up to leave but as I was about to climb down the stairs I saw this girl from the corner of my eye, I had seen her a few times before and I thought I should say hi and ask her name. 

I climbed down the stairs and got on the walking track but I was a little ahead of her on the track, and there were quite a few people walking, and I felt awkward going in the opposite direction just to say hi to a girl I didn't know. So I walked around the park to a different sitting area, thought I would wait till she catches up and notices me, then I can go to talk to her.

 But no, when she came around, I just couldn't, I froze on the spot, my heart was beating super fast. I sat down trying to calm myself. I always thought I could talk to anybody, I have no problem talking to strangers at work, or at the store, or in the metro, or anywhere for that matter. I was sitting there wondering what was wrong with me, I hadn't said anything, I hadn't done anything, I was feeling so bad, I had a mini panic attack by just trying to talk to somebody at the park.

Once I had calmed down, I realised I had freaked out over nothing, nobody saw me, nobody knew that I was freaking out. I thought, since I had already had a mini panic attack, I had nothing to lose, I might as well go talk to her. 

Oh I couldn't have been more wrong.

I walked up to her all nervous and said, ""hi"" she flinched, took a step back and got so scared. It felt like everybody was looking at me and now I was having another mini panic attack I was mumbling and I said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you, I just thought you were cute and I wanted to come say hi"". She spurted out nervously ""okay"". Now I thought the difficult part was over I introduced myself and tried to get the conversation going by asking her ""what do you like about the park?"" to which she said, very hesitantly, ""it's my first time coming here"", which I knew it wasn't. Seeing as she was so reluctant to talk, I said ""I'm sorry if you are not comfortable talking to me, I can leave if you are not comfortable"" and she replied ""I don't know"", I said ""it's best if I leave"" and I bolted out the park and ran till I was out of breath.

Now I can't go back to the park and sit in my favourite spot for a while or until I grow my hair and beard out and become a completely different person.",2022-01-22 18:13:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642873361,4,/r/lonely/comments/sa8f5j/i_screwed_up_and_i_feel_like_i_lost_my_favourite/,,0,4,I screwed up and I feel like I lost my favourite spot in the park.

Got covid. Got more weed. Haven't talked to my girlfriend much or at all, but they've been hanging out with their friends for the last few weekends. Which is good, I'm glad they're happy. But it definitely still stings to see them doing so good without me. My younger sibling has gone out more than I have in this month alone than I did all of 2021. 

Everyone seems to have a someone or something. Someone that they click with and always want to have around, where they feel safe and allow themselves to be vulnerable with. A something that they can depend on to make themselves feel better, a skill that'll never really fail them. 

I don't really have either of those. I forget how forgettable and replaceable I am sometimes. I doesn't feel good to be reminded, but apparently it happens a lot. Where I need reminders for how terrible of a person I am, how I've failed to be a friend, a partner, and an older sibling, and for how little I'm really needed.

I have a good friend I've known since high school and sometimes we talk on the phone, but it's hard for us to hang out together since we both lead busy lives.

Now I just feel guilty calling him, so I don't anymore.

Life is just so busy with people living in the fast lane constantly it's nice nobody wants to slow down and have a conversation because there are more important things to do, like going to work, paying the bills, etc. It's hard to create and maintain friendships when we're all committed to other things.

3955,safzh8,Gloomy-Problem2262,"I'm an 18 year old dude, I have a loving family, a handful of good friends whom I honestly really don't see as much as I want to but we're in contact regularly. I have friends around me, but I think what bothers me is that I'm single.

Over the last few weeks my mental health has taken a nose dive, I really want a relationship. I don't really have an interest in sex, I value the emotional connection and having someone to love far more. I have a thing for a girl at college at the moment, and I still miss my ex. I find myself late at night looking at their social medias, which usually ends with me feeling even worse about my pathetic self, and saps me of all motivation to change my life for the better.

The girl I like at my college has pretty much everything I'm looking for. She's intelligent enough to make me challenge my views on things, which I think is great because it makes me a better person. She and I have the same sense of humour, making each other laugh is like a button we can press, and of course I also find her very attractive. I dropped her several flirty hints and she hasn't once played back. Sadly I think I'm not in the running. She's talked about her interest in another lad a couple of times recently, and I see her text him constantly. It is what it is.

Tonight my ex posted a photo of herself with her new bf. We didn't break up because of relationship problems it was long distance and Covid straight up killed it, so I still very much have feelings for her. He seams like a nice guy so I am genuinely happy for them. She's a great girl and I hope she's happy, but I can't say it didn't hurt to see them together and the guy even looks a little like me. I don't know if I should say this but I spent the next hour researching the least painful suicide methods just so I know my options if things get worse.

I am starving for someone to be with romantically, I want to text someone goodnight, I want to cuddle on the sofa and fall asleep, I want to be head over heals in love with someone who feels the exact same for me, and every day I'm not is a whole world of pain.",2022-01-23 00:04:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642893271,6,/r/lonely/comments/safzh8/i_am_starving_romantically/,,0,7,I am starving romantically.

But I always wonder if any of the people I went to elementary, middle, and high school would come. They know who I am and we are all connected on social media, but they were always closer to each other than to me. I have really bad social anxiety so making friends has always been hard. I miss those guys. I was generally cool with them but they have stayed in contact with each other as the years have gone by while I just kind of fell off the map. I know if I was to commit suicide or die some other way, the news would spread pretty quickly.

3988,sakkcf,redshoes666,"I feel so incredibly disposable. 

In the last few years since 2018 I have been (seemingly) randomly ghosted and blocked by basically all of my closest friends. First, I was going through a major mental breakdown (I have suffered with severe mental illness all my life) and a group of my best girlfriends alienated me during that period of time. I take responsibility for some of that, because I know that it can be difficult to know what to do with someone who won‚Äôt help themself, but I thought these girls were friends for life no matter what. I never did anything directly to hurt them or our relationship. Then I had a couple of other friends ghost me, one of whom told me that they were in a very bad place mentally and then when I asked around to try and make sure she was okay she told people that I was stalking her. My husband and I separated shortly afterwards and I lost even more friends, even a few who initially praised me for leaving but who would go on to later randomly block me and re-friend my ex. Then I discovered one of my very last irl friends had blocked me without any indication as to why, and that strangely she had apparently asked several of her friends who I didn‚Äôt even have a relationship with to block me as well. And most recently my last long-term (10+ years) close irl friend stopped responding to or even reading my messages. She never blocked me or deleted me, but she just pretends I don‚Äôt exist? I have tried a couple of times to contact her to figure out what‚Äôs going on and have given up at this point. I genuinely feel so lost and confused after all of this. I feel like the accessibility of people on social media and apps has made friendships extremely disposable. The block button is easier to push than talking it out or even just saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore‚Äù. 

Since all of this, I have been incredibly desperate for friendship, but I find myself incredibly closed off to meeting new people. I‚Äôm friendly and nice, but I assume that literally everyone will one day decide to block me and move on, so I don‚Äôt put genuine effort into getting to know anyone beyond a superficial level. I can‚Äôt identify the common thread behind why this keeps happening and I‚Äôm sick of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what I did wrong or how I can take the blame. I even reached out to a couple of the girls from my past this last year just to apologize for whatever happened and let them know that I cared about them deeply, but i only got a generic thanks response from one person (and another one blocked me). I don‚Äôt feel like friendship is worth the effort anymore and that‚Äôs a fucking sad way to live. 

One of my old friends once told me right before she cut me out of her life that I am going to die alone because of my mental illness and I‚Äôm fucking heartbroken that she‚Äôs probably right. Am I just constantly finding the wrong people?? I‚Äôm working so hard on myself. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on.

Edit - No, fucking men of Reddit, I am not lonely enough to want to chat with you. If you have something nice to say it will be appreciated here, not in my DMs.",2022-01-23 03:59:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1591943109,6,/r/lonely/comments/sakkcf/disposable/,,0,10,Disposable

4001,sam3n1,YellowMabry,"All my life I feel as if I have been treated like I just don't matter, like I am a joke, like my feelings don't matter,etc. I was never anybodys first choice, etc. 

Even from a young age I was always excluded from stuff and made to feel like an outcast. People would do this to me on purpose. 

Then whenever I got older as in like middle school age I was heavily bullied. I was never invited to anything by anybody in school. I never really had any lasting friendships either. People would regularly do stuff to me to get a laugh at my expense, etc. But if I ever tried to speak up or defend myself I was "" crazy"", "" stupid"" etc. 

This went on all throughout school. I literally just came to school, got bullied, went home, etc. Then I graduated. I tried my luck at online dating. Let's just say I failed. It's basically like I'm a ghost no matter what app I use. I never get any responses or the rare few times I do its literally me trying to put all the effort into talking to these people and them leaving me on read and barely replying so i just give up. 

Now the only people in my life thus far who treated me like anything are family members. My mother and father were literally the only friends I had for multiple years. They both died shortly after I graduated from high school. 

Here I was literally 23 years old with no parents. I finally come across a guy online some months later. He actually tried to talk to me. We literally talked for months and then we finally met and it was amazing. Things were finally looking up for me I thought. Key word thought. 

We ended up moving in together and things went great for a while. Then he would purposely put his other friends first who he barely even saw, he let them be rude to me and did nothing about it and of course whenever I said anything about it, just like before ""oh you're crazy"" 

So basically I have endured over two years of mental and emotional abuse from him after that, along with cheating and sometimes physical abuse. But every now and then he will be nice to me. 

I can literally find no one else to talk to me. I've discussed how him treating me as made me feel, especially the cheating and he once straight up told me "" either deal with it or be alone like you were before "" 

So here I am 26, no friends, no parents, just one person in my life who treats me horribly. I am scared to leave him as there have been times when I actually have. Or he has left me, etc but we always get back together. And during those times when we are apart, literally NO ONE but my grandmother will talk to me. No one. I literally can not stand to be alone or ignored any more because that's basically been my whole life. 

Actually a few months ago whenever me and my guy friend I mentioned were apart, I met this other guy and we talked for a while, we met up and he acted all super interested in me, etc. Well he ended up pressuring me into giving him oral sex. I did and then after that he pretended he wasn't feeling well and left. I havnt heard from him since and I don't want to. He claimed we were gonna meet up for dinner and to watch a movie.  Before he left he literally told me "" here's $20 buy yourself a dinner "" UGH 

I don't understand why people do me this way. I have always tried to be a nice/ kind person, im generous, have a good sense of humor, and I'm at least average looking.

 It's gotten to the point that I feel suicidal. I began self harming.

I stayed up late nights till morning with her before because she was suicidal too, and other emotionally heavy and difficult situations in her life. But the one time I need her, she f*cking ditches me.

And let me tell you, it's not anyone's fault. They have the chance to go with the flow and live happily, in their own bubble, they don't suffer like we do, so why would I blame people for ignoring me? But we, the lonely, are doomed to misery. We are the last step in society. Not a single soul looks at us, marginalized and miserable, that's how we live.

And the normal people still have the guts to give advice. They told me to have hobbiers, excersice, balanced diet, set goals. It was a fucking lie.

What else do I fucking need to be happy? I did everything they told me, and for some time I deluded myself into happines, but the illusion broke down, I'm left with the ruins of a once happy person. But I'm lucky, I have friends and a loving family, but even then, the same misery as always. 

I wish I could go back to the summer of 2019, when I was blissfuly ignorant of my sourroundings, I felt extremely loved, and everything was fine, but looking back, people were just laughing at me. I even thought a girl was in lov with me, but of course, no. 

It's always no, it's always something wrong, it doesn't matter when I do, I can't stop being lonely. Please i just want a hug, I just want to hear ""you're my best friend, I love you"" once more please i don't want this life, please, life, fool me again into happines.

Also, I'm really ugly, sometimes people look at me and laugh, I have froggy looking eyes, I'm balding and I'm extremely disproportionate. I look like a fucking alien, so if I ever get the guts to talk to some girl, she will just go with her friends and laugh. I've had people take pictures of me and forget to turn off the flash

4098,sb87o2,Mean_Umpire_236,"It's a rant so it's probably gonna be long - if you have any suggestions feel free to drop it in comments

Start from the starting - i used to be a very shy socially awkward guy with little to no talents - My parents never let me as a kid to step out and my whole pre teen years i was pretty much locked up alone in home (without TV) so i used to read books - and slowly i got studious - Straight 10 and became ranker


In class 5th i saw a girl (maybe noticed for the first time) - liked her - But she didn't care enough to talk - I tried to start talking (random stuff - school work and cartoons - i didn't know what and how to talk to girls) but i was the loser so obviously she never even responded (not even courtesy)

6th class - we all sections got mixed up - i saw the opportunity- became the most loud, flamboyant boy i could - Started getting great response - immediately scoring chicks - i went by fake it till you make it attitude - just started playing cool and everyone want to be my friend (sounds dumb but worked back then)

6-8th i had my blast -  fun fun and fun - everything happening around me - i was the hotshot

9th - I started getting higher ambitions - made new friends - older and more influential- moved upwards - still hanged around school friends but my new social group was the main one - parties and adventure- meanwhile in school i had a fight (very major - almost rusticated) so since then i realised school dudes are bunch of dumfucks - i absolutely didn't care to be a part of anything - my life was beyond school - with my new rich kid gang (FYI I'm not rich , I'm not even middle class - Straight poor with extremely strict parents)

10th - One of the rich kids girlfriend got attracted to me - i tried my best not to indulge , but things piled up and all those rich kids ganged up and beat me to pulp - barely left me alive , it was a task to not let this come to my parents - and i didn't have any influencial plugs or money to pull anything on my own since all rich friends ganged up on me (and the girl was given a clean chit even though she was at fault - she almost raped me - cent per cent)

11th and 12th i told myself to focus on studies and not indulge in anything - Even my school group reshuffled in 11th and i was all alone without a single friend - Made some acquaintances (they were so dumb but still i needed atleast someone in the class for homework and stuff)
I put all my energies , deleted all social handles , absolutely cutoff from the remaining good friends to focus on studies so i could land a good college and hopefully a reboot in social life

End of school -  didn't get a good college - Absolutely no social circle (i mean it - I dont have a single person to talk to - sometimes it gets weeks or months without me talking to anyone except teachers and my own parents)

Covid came in 1st yr of college - Now I'm about to graduate - i don't have any friend circle - I'm not the dumb kid (i swear - whosoever talks to me - I hit it off pretty well) - During covid i tried my level best to catchup with the school friends but they simply didn't want me back ; Cabt try to catchup with the rich kids cause they might be still dangerous and violent (i hope not since it has been 5 years but they are literal goons fucking politician kids so i dont want to take any chances)

Made some friends in college (like 2 3) but due to covid we never got to meet- They all have their own social circles and beyond assignments we never discuss anything else 

Back in 6th to 10th i used to be the king in my School - even when i didn't cared enough , everything and everyone use to be on my fingers 
Now if i die tonight - Nobody would care enough to give a flying fuck
I have been for them whenever they needed, I'm a good person , even when i didn't wanted to be a part of school drama - i always protected them from externalities.

Now i have a group of dumb school mates (only those are willing to take me in) - And recently i fucked up my face even worse - i got braces

I also have soooo much family issues and abuse - which lead to pent up angerr soo deep - even when i try to be most sweet - My voice comes out to be the rudest and meanest of all - even when i say things in love- sounds like Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley all the time

I can't get girls , dont have friends, didn't get any major academic achievements (i invested alotttttt of time on that with hopes that It'll pay off well and atleast it will first of all make me financially independent- so i can crawl out of my hellhole house and abusive parents - and give me a status to bring back some social life and fun in life ; but even that didn't panned out as it was supposed to be)


I don't know what to do , some nights i feel so suicidal - can't even explain. (No sympathy just sharing my state of mind)",2022-01-24 00:16:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629047841,3,/r/lonely/comments/sb87o2/use_to_be_a_social_butterfly_now_dead/,,0,3,"Use to be a social butterfly, now dead"

Today was one of those days where my mom and I got into it because I didn‚Äôt want to pursue medicine

She kept on telling me why I didn‚Äôt want to do it?

I said it was never in me, never had a passion for people, I never had a say with what I wanted to do anyways.

I also said that no one in my immediate/extended family are doctors anyways.

I keep on telling her the pros of what I want to do. And if that doesnt work I‚Äôd just pursue music.

She interrupted me saying that I‚Äôm too hardheaded and I never listen

Your choice of friends? Look at you now you literally have no friends

A job? Look at where you are now?

Driving early (without a permit)? Couldn‚Äôt do that

Hobbies? You‚Äôre literally pathetic and on Reddit 24/7 if not that you‚Äôre always stuck in your room or watching porn 

You want to do computer science? When you can‚Äôt even naturally interact with others‚Ä¶good luck with that

And if not music again, your choice

Majority of these artists are poor and stuck into crappy labels. 

You just don‚Äôt fucking listen do you?

That‚Äôs why YOU FAILED ME

In my head I was like, I could never please her

Let‚Äôs say I finally take the premed route but choose another specialization they‚Äôll still be conflict would I still be happy?

I mean everything she said isn‚Äôt wrong either, it‚Äôs not like I have anything going for me either

I essentially feel blind to my own intuition as every mistake I make, not even mistake but every choice I make is always comes out as shitty and bad.

4235,sbvk12,SupaKoopa714,"I'm asking because I'm trying to mentally prepare for it. I'm almost 27 and I've been horribly depressed and lonely most of my life, but in the past 2 months, I've finally found a local community of weirdos like me and have probably been the happiest I've ever been. What sucks is I'll be moving 800 miles away in May, and the town I'll be living in is way out in the middle of nowhere. Like, it's a 15-20 minute drive to go to the grocery store, not to mention there's barely anyone my age around, and what few there are definitely not really my kind of people. On top of that, even when I was at my worst where I live now, I at least had some concerts and events to look forward to, but where I'll be moving to, everything like that will be 3 or 4 hours away; it's just a weirdly located remote place where any major cities are super far away.

I have no choice in the matter either because I'm currently living with my dad and can't afford my own place, probably not even with roommates, and it's got me totally unsure of what to do. All I can think of is to try and emotionally brace myself for taking 30 steps backward socially. Does anyone have any advice on preparing myself for this?",2022-01-24 20:24:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1359601425,19,/r/lonely/comments/sbvk12/has_anyone_ever_gotten_out_of_their_pit_of/,,0,5,Has anyone ever gotten out of their pit of loneliness only to get pulled back into it?

4247,sbx9lr,Juice-Leia,"Today is Monday and it‚Äôs my day off. I had arranged by email to start volunteering at a local middle school. So I went to the school this afternoon but apparently it‚Äôs a ‚Äúteacher work day‚Äù so I couldn‚Äôt even get into the building. The teacher I was supposed to be volunteering with just didn‚Äôt tell me, didn‚Äôt show up and it was a waste of time. Therapists always suggest volunteering but I‚Äôm jaded about it. I volunteered at an animal shelter to ‚Äúmeet people‚Äù and there was only one guy my age who mostly looked at his phone. Then I volunteered at a food pantry and everyone was over 50. Now trying to volunteer at this school and this happens. I‚Äôm just so tired. Tried going to the local dog park, again to meet people, and it‚Äôs almost never the same people. How tf are you supposed to meet other people in their 20s and befriend them without being desperate? My next plan is to take a weekly yoga class and try to meet people there.

I have a Hinge acct but got nowhere with it. My roommate stays in her room talking on the phone to her boyfriend or playing video games. It‚Äôs really awkward with her we don‚Äôt really ‚Äúvibe.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt have the energy to go to therapy again (if I started again this would be the FOURTH therapist tried) and explain all this shit. I‚Äôm exhausted, jaded and always alone.

I wake up alone, eat meals alone. No friends, no boyfriend. Whenever I talk to people it‚Äôs boring and awkward. I feel stuck.

4307,sc5u1r,dhfi4nb34,"I'm a 17M and I feel like everyone I meet hates me. For some reason no one wants to talk to me. I occasionally have small-talk with people, but its mostly just brief discussions about school. Even the people who I've previously considered friends don't talk to me about much aside from this now.

I can only assume it's a problem with me, as everyone else seems to socialize fine. I don't know what I'm doing wrong though. I don't think I'm that socially awkward--when people try talking to me I don't avoid the conversation and I try to be interesting. I don't think my personality is that bad too: I'm not rude/mean to anyone. I don't really talk to new people unless they initiate a conversation with me first, through--out of fear that they don't want to talk to me. Multiple times just in the past year when I have asked someone new something they ignored me.

I only have 1 person I consider a ""real"" friend now, as in he seems to be the only person who actually wants to talk/listen to me. Then again, our conversations aren't very ""deep"", just about a few mutual interests. I just wish I had someone to open up to and have personal conversations with, but I don't feel comfortable sharing with any of the people I know. If most people don't even want to even talk to me, why would they want to hear this? The one person I opened up to in my entire life was an online friend, who's since stopped talking to me, unfortunately.

I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to open up more and get more social. I feel like its too late for my current situation, as I'm graduating high-school soon.

I had left the house to actually go and my key fob wouldn't starty car. The alarm went off.  It took me over an hour to find my other key. The Court house was closed by than.  No big deal do it tomorrow.  I went and picked them up because they had no ride.  She asked did you get them and I told her what happened. She accused me of lying and got quiet. Now she's.nuts sometimes.  We get home I start making food. Everything is fine. Than she's watching TV and her mom calls.  She gets really angry and says no I'm not ok and turns to me who's behind her in the dining room and I say ummm what did I do?  She says fuck.you stay out of my life.  Than goes to the room slams the door. She does all this in front of our child.  I can hear her mom say why don't you stay with him he's always been good to you she says out loud. I'm not gay I've never been gay we've been together for 15 years ! She's full of shit.   I got up went and knocked on th door and she went nuts.  She opened it said I'm a liar I'm a piece of shit.

I am constantly told, learn to be happy with being single, you don't need a partner to be happy, not everyone gets partners, etc. Great. I've had plenty of time to exist without a partner.

I have days where I am feeling pretty down on myself and depressed at times and I do not know why. Things are not bad per say currently I help manage a hotel (which is a hour from current main home and the city) the hotel is owned by my foreign parents, they are pretty loving and I usually spend 2-3 days out of the week at the hotel assisting my parents while my parents are there all week(they also live on the property). The hotel has been a little difficult for my parents to manage because of the language barrier and technology barrier now since they are older but all in all they still manage, but me being there definitely makes things a lot easier for them. Managing hotels has always been the family business and something they have done for 30 years, while I love being able to help my parents and be there for them, I myself hate managing a hotel but I know my parents need my help for the time being. My parents also pay me decent for my time. Outside of the hotel I do photography which I do in the city, I am currently on a hiatus trying to rebrand my photography business but I have been struggling to find the motivation for it, many days I feel depressed and low and I do not get any work done. I get all in my head. I really want to advance in my career and find a path but I don't know how at times. I feel stuck.

Im also in a loving relationship and she is doing wonderful in her career something I would never say to her because I always support her and want the best for her but I do internally feel jealous at times at the amount of money she is making because its a good bit more than me and how she has a clear pathway for her but besides that I love her very much. I guess I just want to be on a good path like her, I get scared sometimes she will think I am a bum and leave me. I also struggle with also achieving my personal goals like working out, reading more etc.

Many days I have had thoughts of killing myself which sucks because I know I'm in a good position in life and I am still very young. I know my life isn't bad and there a lot of things to feel positive about but everyday when I wake up i think i want to do better. I want to do better in my career and get back to doing photography consistently and not struggling to work, I want to be a better boyfriend and son, I want to do better for myself. I struggle with staying focused and disciplined. So many days i feel lost and I do not know where i am going. I also find myself in the cycle of comparing to others.

Also last thing I am also addicted to porn and masturbation and it is so hard to stop like I have been trying and it is so hard.",2022-01-26 03:24:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597795726,2,/r/lonely/comments/scw0wk/i_want_to_do_better/,,0,1,I want to do better

My dad and brother couldn't go to the game due to it being in the mid week, they said I can just bring a friend along. I couldn't, I can't. I have one friend who made an excuse instead of saying he just didn't want to, and that's all. At 19, I couldn't think of anyone because I can't. I went to the football game by myself, got a pint by myself. And I enjoyed it for a time, but when I looked around and saw people laughing with their friends it just hits rock bottom.

It reminds me of my old friend who passed away every time, it makes me think ""what would we be doing? Would we go for a pint now that we're adults? Would we still have fun and go to the woods to make random shit like we used to? And most of all, would we tell each other everything like we used to, instead of hiding everything inside for myself to slowly break apart?""

I enjoy nature, healthy living, art and dance. Also movies, browsing the internet, travel (but that's expensive), and occasionally things like bowling or whatever. 

I grow a few plants and was doing more, but I got busy so some died. I plan to set up and start a compost pile very soon. ~~~

I like looking up art online, like all styles, including interior design and fashion. I sometimes doodle or color myself, or I do bigger projects like for example,

I made a collage from old birthday/greeting cards. ~~~

And I sometimes dance around, mostly in my house or yard, perhaps will go out one day eventually, but the pandemic is kinda rough lately so whatever.

I totally wrote this entire post once already then clicked off the page and had to rewrite this. Haha. 

Besides that my life is pretty simple and average. I bought a new pair of shoes last week, which was exciting because I get 1 about every 10 months.

4577,sdbw92,Akio_Taki,"Well, I just want to tell my story since it's been bothering me for like almost 3 years. But it still going to bother me even after telling someone but I just want some of the burden to get off my shoulders. So 3 years before, in the year of 2019, there was still no covid. Still had school and stuff. And for the 2nd time, I had a relationship with someone who's older than me again (sorry, I just really like girls that are older than me but smaller than me). She was 2 years older than me and I was 14 at the time, 2nd year junior high school student. We really had great times, well great is an understatement. The thing that I really like about her is, she's a really simple worth it girl. And I also really like when she gets angry or moody sometimes because it's like looking at a kirby that's holding a knife, that's how cute she is when she gets angry but anyway.. We always ate streetfood (If you're Filipino you'll get what I mean), always had fun in the most simple ways. Every day/night having video calls, talking with her and sometimes when her little sister caught her having a video call with me, we'll have a very fun conversation. It was one of the best moments in my highschool life. I realized that I loved her more than my 1st girlfriend. But one day, I introduced her to my mom but not physically at first because... it's complicated. I'll go simplify it. ""I don't like her looks, go find someone else who looks better). But don't hate my mom, please. After she knew what my girlfriend looked like, everything got complicated. I was being forced to break up with her, But I didn't tell my girlfriend because I don't want her to get hurt as well as be angry at my mom. So after a week or so, I get blackmailed again and again just so that I would break up with my girlfriend. I got grounded again and again. Blackmail after blackmail. Everyday after school, me and my mom will argue. She didn't even let me hangout with my friends outside anymore. And after a month, I got tired. I made the hardest decision I ever made that time. I called my girlfriend at night, it was by 9pm or 10pm maybe. I told her that we should breakup. Then our friend joined the call after my girlfriend told her what's happening. They both asked me why but I didn't told them. I wanted to protect my mom. My girlfriend.. I watched her cry, I listened to her asking me again and again why I was breaking up with her. I pretended to cry that time because I thought, she would think it's real. Then she asked me to let her see my face if I was really crying, but I didn't do it. I just said ""I'm sorry"" then left the call.
I didn't feel anything that night, I was just staring at my ceiling thinking ""Did I do the right thing?"" Again and again and again until I fell asleep. The following days were really akward. Her friends kept on staring at me like they were going to kill me. We broke up in march. I was happy for a few months. But right when july hit, I suddenly felt this sense of guilt. In my  birthday, I felt kinda happy but mostly down. July-december I felt so guilty because of what I did to my her (my ex-girlfriend). Then the whole year of 2020 until to this day. January 27, 2022... I still feel the guilt. I feel so bad, I feel so angry at myself for doing that to her. Everytime I attempt to talk to a new girl, I don't feel happy or satisfied. I still love my ex-girlfriend. I know it's kinda wrong because I was the one who broks up with her, but it was forced. But I can't do anything now, she may be happy with someone else or she may be having her best days of her life now. I don't want to bother her anymore because I don't want her to be sad again. But I guess that's life, we always regret in the end. Thank you guys for reading my story and maybe, just maybe if she's able to see this. I just want to say I am really sorry, and well here's the explanation that you were asking for.. sorry it took almost 3 years.. Love you always and take care and live the best life that you could ever have. Again, thank you guys so much. It means alot to me.",2022-01-26 17:52:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641653262,3,/r/lonely/comments/sdbw92/my_biggest_regret_in_life/,,0,1,My biggest regret in life..

4635,sdnf0x,PsalmoftheSad,"The GM of the store I work at just had sex last night with a stranger that walked right through the door at work. She walked in, saw him, talked for a minute and *immediately* began flirting. They talked for a solid twenty minutes at least before walking off with his number and they began texting the whole night


Come to find out, last night he had sex with her -- despite him being married. I don't want to get into too much of the details in the one in a million chance of him somehow seeing this post but it just baffles me how easy it is for some people 



I think the worst part of it all, though, was when the guys at work were talking about it earlier today and one of my coworkers said ""damn, this guy's pulling bitches. Psalm, what's your excuse for not finding someone?"" 


So I said it, without missing a beat actually. ""Sorry, you must be *this* tall to find someone"" and proceeded to put my hand over my head, palm down. It's not a lie -- I don't get taken seriously by literally anyone because of my height. I'm the butt of everyone's jokes and that by itself would've been fine, but **now** people started saying stupid shit like ""WelL I kNOw a GuY THAt's oNlY 5'1 aND He FouNd someoNe!!ONe!!1!!

4647,sdofq1,Skuiken666,"Hi everybody. Im a 29 years old woman from southamerica just really going through it. I‚Äôll keep it simple: App. 6 months ago my boyfriend for 7 years (and close friend for almost 15 years, since middle school) broke up with me. We had a home and 2 cats. It was very sudden. I didn‚Äôt expected it, so it truly hit me very, very hard.
I cryed a lot, i suffered a lot. It was the most difficult time of my life. I‚Äôve never experienced loss like this before, even considering that i lost my dad on 2020, just for reference. It was absolutly heartbreaking for me. 
anyways, it‚Äôs been 6 months and i‚Äôm doing pretty fine. I‚Äôve overcome the crisis. I‚Äôm a functional human being again. I laugh, i party, i work, i do sports, i act like myself. My ex and i even decided to keep our friendship as long as it was possible, mostly because we share a good amount of friends and it was easier for both of us to try to keep our lifes going as usual. 
I dont regret this, i really like our friendship, probably because i knew him first as friends (we started dating after almost 10 years of friendship). I really like and appreciate his friendship. 
Anyways, that‚Äôs the background. The reason i‚Äôm posting this today is this: i,ve come to the realization that he has moved one; he‚Äôs starting to date again, to be interested in other women (which is 100% normal, dont get me wrong), that he has decided to move forward with his life. And i‚Äôve not. And i feel lonely, really lonely.
I‚Äôts a very strange scenario: i‚Äôm young, i‚Äôm fairly good looking, i‚Äôm a lawyer, i‚Äôm really funny. I dont have major issues, i‚Äôm doing pretty well for my age, i‚Äôm smart, blablabla.
But, even knowing that, i can‚Äôt help but feeling like i‚Äôm not worth it, like everyone is destined to meet someone but me, like i‚Äô‚Äô not pretty enough, that i should loose weight, that no one is going go really, really like me.
I just feel hopeless.
I know that i‚Äôm in a good position,everyone tells me that, that i‚Äôll meet someone, that i‚Äôm just lost. Maybe i am. Mayb you are right.
But i can‚Äôt help but feeling absolutely lost and devastated as i walk home crying, no seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I‚Äôm not worth it. Everybody is going forward with their lifes but me. 
I‚Äôm stuck.
I‚Äôm lost.

4664,sdqsmz,Alert-Wishbone9032,"Has anyone else ever experienced this?

How have you ""managed"" it or changed it (etc)?

I've moved cities quite a lot growing up, I lived and was schooled in 4 countries and had 6 schools and 2 universities.

Because of this there was a lot of ""always the new kid"" time happening - being the new kid, developing connections, having to move on, trying to keep connections that don't last, start again.

I found that almost always the reason (as far as I'm aware) that the friendship/connections didn't last when I'd moved away was that it's so much easier to maintain a relationship with someone that you see in person regularly and have big/small interactions with, than with someone who you need to send emails to/facetime - it's almost like the extra effort is too much in comparison to everyone else that's still there around you and you can see in person - a situation of out of sight out of mind.

I've been in the same location now for 5 years and have made fleeting friendship and aquiantances, but I can't seem to dredge up the emotions in me to put great effort into keeping up regular contact to deepen the relationship, or to dredge up the energy/desire to try to enter new friendships from people that I meet. I don't know if I'm trying to be subconsciously self-protective, or have slid into seeing people as just transient now. I would love to have the deep connections that you hear about or see online (etc), but at the moment I just feel largely unmoored from everyone.

Because this is not exactly the type of topic that you would enter into at a dinner party or find someone easily who quite understands or has been through something similar, then I don't know whether this is something that others have felt before, or whether it is something that I have developed by myself alone.",2022-01-27 05:24:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601001057,3,/r/lonely/comments/sdqsmz/anyone_else_fatigue_for_making_new_friends/,,0,3,Anyone else?

I just fear the idea of spending year after year in isolation, only speaking to my very small number of online friends I'll have. 

And any attempts at socializing are dead in the water for a multitude of reasons that would take too long to explain (and frankly, they seem egotistical).

I've come to the conclusion I'm going to be stuck alone and as such might as well enjoy myself by soley focusing on my hobbies and things I enjoy. But in reality they seem more of just distractions. When they are done I feel empty, a sense of extreme loneliness returns and everything feels pointless and wasted if it isn't a shared moment.

Is it the depression? OCD intrusive thoughts/feelings? Or do I just not like the things I used to love? Why do I have this erge to need someone? Don't people keep saying focus on yourself, love yourself, focus on making money/completing goals/being successful? I mean, I don't really have the opportunities at the moment but I always try to keep going with my goals whenever possible. I just feel whats the point? I've never particularly cared about money, I'd be happy homeless if I was with someone I loved and who loved me. I mean that, I obviously wouldn't want to stay homeless but that sort of connection means far more to me than any ammount of money ever would. But why?
Everyone I've ever met seems to care more about money.

It's been the same with everything. What they can get out of me. About what I can give them in terms of anything and what's out there that's better than I can offer, so that I can be replaced after they get fed up or bored of me.
They seem happy. I got told several times I'd meet someone eventually who wants me for me. It's never them of course and it still hasn't happened yet and doubtfully ever will. But when people are like that, when I've been constantly hurt, nearly killed by 3 people and told I'm just being melodramatic because that was years ago and I'm a man so should just get over it, and when I've been involved in trying to solve people's dramas at their request many times in the past, and seen the things people do to each other. The risks of dating and constant rejection or outright ignoring of my existence, why on Earth do I still feel lonely and want someone? Am I stupid?

I know not everyone is bad, but I don't fit in anywhere, and don't really feel welcomed for long either. I'm not perfect and I never pretend to be. I've tried to work on myself, my therapist even said I was ""hyper self aware"", and I've ask people how I am and how to improve and so on. I've been more than accepting and open for others. I'm not a doormat either or unable to talk to people, but no one stays for long and I've often found I enjoyed my own company. But that feeling never goes. Even in my sleep or when I wake. It feels like I'm being punished for something. Why do I have all these, hobbies, goals, and aspirations if they don't really mean anything to me in the end and then at the same time I long for love and a relationship even though I know it can't happen no matter how I try, (yet I still try), and have been hurt so much before to the point I don't trust anyone and prefer my own company.
Am I crazy? Stupid? Or am I missing something?

I know no one can answer this directly, but I wonder if I'm alone, or if anyone has insight. I've had existential dread many times before, so prehaps it's related to that, I don't know. I guess this is a cry for help, because I really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to be trapped in this situation forever.

Thank you for reading. I know you all have your own problems and I sincerely wish you all the best.

When she went through her darkest moments during this time, she asked for my help and I would always be there for her. Yet when I was feeling low or depressed (admittedly not reach the depths that she did), I would get only the briefest attention.

As I've said, I've known this friend for 4 years yet we never did anything together outside of our place (we lived together in social housing before I moved out recently). We never went to the pub to have a drink or chill out somewhere even though I asked numerous times. Either something came up like a family appointment or she wasn't feeling up to it. Yet whenever she needed something from the shop, wanted money for her nefarious habits or wanted her supposed best friend to be with her, I would always be there. Yet I could never get her to go with me for a drink. I made sure I never persisted and I would only ever gently nudge her. She'd tell me how she wanted to go, that it was overdue.

Anyway, my frustrations towards our friendship came out the other day and I don't her exactly what I thought of her. And I also told her to fuck off before blocking her number. I felt so let down knowing how our friendship only ever felt one way.

Hearing that made me realize just what I had forsaken, not through the divorce but by being a huge asshole for the first 5-7 years of our marriage (which in turn led to her being equal but opposite after we both agreed to reconcile rather than divorce in '15).   


To put it bluntly, she was everything I ever wanted and more than I deserved - I was just an immature prick. I ruined my dream of growing old with one person. She's not without fault mind you, but at least she *had a reason* to destroy me. I was just an emotionally unavailable/hurtful douchebag because I don't know why in hindsight.  


I would never tell my next partner this but know that having a relationship would ease the regrets and self-loathing...I'm spiraling **because** **I'm so lonely**. I've decided I'm going to do my best to stick things out until my son graduates but that is 2.5 years off. If I don't have a relationship by then at the latest I'm going to kill myself by loosing inert gas in my vehicle with all airways duct taped from the inside.   


Everything I've read says it's painless, and while I have been terrified of ""what comes next"" my entire life it's going to come someday anyway, and it beats being trapped in my self-abusive mind.",2022-01-27 19:04:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638548664,9,/r/lonely/comments/se5wb2/suicide_talk_tw/,,0,6,Suicide Talk (TW)

4738,se7ppx,BriNeedsSleep,"I know you are lonely. I know that every day you wake up is a struggle because you feel so alone. But in this world, you are not alone. There is someone out there who is like you, who feels the same way you do. Someone who is longing for company, cuddles, laughs, friendship, romance, and just doesn't know how to get it. They're out there.

I think in the dredges of loneliness it's easy to lose hope. It's easy to feel like you're an island in a sea of people. I know meeting people is scary, I know a lot of us are introverts, and I know it seems hopeless at times. But there is someone out there like you, who is lonely too, who likes what you like, who would be so happy to see you.

My advice? Start feeding the pieces inside of you that are yearning for a good time. Yearning to be happy. Feed them scraps if that's all you have. Just get them some nutrition. Any. You like to read and haven't in a while? Read for five minutes every other day. You want to get to the gym? Go for a ten minute run once a week. You want to draw? Doodle one thing every day. You want to be happy? Give what you can to that piece of you that hungers for that.

Your confidence is key. And the road to confidence is through self actualization. Treat yourself kindly and feed the fun side of you, feed the side of you that yearns to do things. And go do them, just a little at a time. Your confidence will build, and you'll feel more comfortable interacting with others because you'll know that no matter the outcome of the situation, you're okay with who you are and you will be okay.

Then, you can start searching for that person. That lonely, sweet person who is like you. You'll start the hunt, and don't be scared! Sometimes it doesn't work out, that's nothing against you. There are so many people on this Earth, not all of them will like you. That's fine, you don't have to like everybody either.

But there is someone out there like you. You are not alone in this world, no matter how lonely you are. Feed that which fuels your joy and work up from there, and keep hope. There's someone out there like you, someone who cries themselves to sleep because they just want a friend, a relationship, some hope in this lonely world, and *they'll like you*. You all, each and every one of you, have an opportunity to find this person. It's hard. But it's worth it. And you all are strong people, otherwise you wouldn't keep going in the face of such an overwhelming emotion such as loneliness. So don't give up. There's hope for you. There's someone out there *just like you* and as long as you keep fighting for your happiness, there's hope you'll meet them.

My love goes out to you all, and wish me luck too! I know loneliness hurts. But that doesn't mean it's forever, and that doesn't mean it's hopeless. You are not alone in this world. You are lonely, but you are not alone.

Edit: This was a lot less appreciated than I thought it would be. I was just trying to spread some hope around. I even thought my little bit of advice was pretty solid. I'm sorry if I upset anyone.",2022-01-27 20:23:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1572408752,25,/r/lonely/comments/se7ppx/you_are_not_alone_in_this_world/,,1,20,You are not alone in this world.

4753,seb3hv,melancholyoctopus8,"Hi,

I guess I just need a place to write as my mind is buzzing right now.

My social skills have always been shockingly poor and so has my perception of women. I found porn really young and I guess got addicted. Along with being bullied at school with multiple comments about my appearance. That probably creates a me; a walking pile of insecurities.

In my late teens I could barely talk to women and kinda saw them as 'objects to fuck' inside of people. I also thought everyone was judging me for any action I did. As a result I became reserved and bland so there was literally nothing to call me out on, nothing to make me stand out. I also started going down a bit of an incel route becoming resentful of most people, especially other girls I was around. Also around this time I hated myself the most and was suicidal.

I did notice this and didn't like what I was becoming. I saw a fresh start as I was off to university. I tried to socialise as much as possible always just bring friendly and nice. That works temporarily but it felt ingenuine and I think people kinda knew I felt a bit off. Over the 4 years I kept at it slowly getting better I found you can still be nice but to you need the banter, a bit of roasting now and then. I felt much more comfortable and more genuine. I started working on myself, physically and mentally. Trying not to care what people thought and being more out going. But one thing that still remained was my insecurities around girls. I could make friends easily enough hand hold conversations which were great, but anything more than that is a hard no.

I'm so concerned not to be a creep or to be inoffensive that I am just bland again. And it is something I do want to work on but don't really know how.

After uni I moved to a new city for work and I'm in a house share with a couple of people, one of which is another girl that is also a recent graduate. I go into this situation like I approach all situations now, just relaxed and with the thinking 'what ever happens, happens' as in don't force anything (personally wise). Over the next few weeks we're talking and getting on quite well, I don't see her as an object and I really like her company and being around here. We've spent a weekend exploring the new city and another weekend going to a museum as friends, even watched a few movies together in the house.

I rarely feel this way about anyone this is probably the third girl I've liked in this way. The first two I was too afraid to say anything and ruin the friendship, of course I leave it too long and they end up getting boyfriends, but that's cool and does help reduce my feelings for them. This new girl I've known for about a month now and I don't want the same thing to happen again and be filled with regret. I spent nearly 2 weeks working up the courage and trying to pick a good time. Tonight after dinner I asked if she enjoyed the time we spent at the museum together, she replied she did. So kinda stammering a bit I asked if you wanted to do the same this weekend with as a date, maybe get some lunch as well. She looked a bit surprised and said 'we'll see'. I said cool have a good night then to which she said the same and now you're caught up to the present.

I mean it's not looking promising and that's ok I'm glad I did it because it was eating away at me that I hadn't, just like the times before. There's no resentment which is nice, I hope we can still be friends and it isn't too awkward.

That's pretty much it I just wanted to get my thoughts our there tbh. I'm still very much a WIP still occasionally have bouts of depression but not longer see women as objects. Just wanted to share, thanks :)",2022-01-27 22:51:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1565366414,19,/r/lonely/comments/seb3hv/asked_a_girl_out_for_the_first_time_23m/,,0,7,Asked a girl out for the first time (23m)

4761,sec8vr,HonestlyUpset,"No meaningful friendships, never been in a relationship. Every social interaction of mine is superficial. I can‚Äôt let my walls down and let love in, not that anyone cares enough to love me. It never gets better, and at this point my depression is too far gone that things can‚Äôt change.

The smallest tasks seem impossible and I can‚Äôt get out of bed. I don‚Äôt want to do anything, can‚Äôt imagine having ambitions or hobbies.

My perception is distorted and I‚Äôm constantly having flashbacks to each and every awkward social interaction and feeling incredibly guilty. I feel unworthy of life or attention but I just wanna be seen for once. I‚Äôm always extremely lonely and I can‚Äôt take it. 

I‚Äôm broken and I can‚Äôt even console myself. I have no self-compassion, my thoughts are so cruel and I‚Äôm doing this to myself. I grew up with a narcissist parent and now I‚Äôm *that* cruel to my own self. That‚Äôs a bully you can‚Äôt escape; one that‚Äôs in your own head. 

It doesn‚Äôt get better it never does. I‚Äôm 17 and I first wrote a suicide note at the age of 7 sooo I‚Äôve felt this way for a while now. It‚Äôs not sadness, it‚Äôs deep despair. There‚Äôs no hope in conventional mental health treatment. I‚Äôve never truly gotten better. It‚Äôs sad bc I try to convince myself that life is improving but fuck no.

First, thanks to the people that either reply with something positive or disagree respectfully without argue.

You know very good what it's like to feel lonely,  depressed and all the other bad things in life and also know how hard is to wake up everyday and push yourself to keep going..... yep, fucking  damn hard!! 
I'm a person that likes to try my best to be positive even though the world is falling apart, i can be giving advice on how to solve problems and my life be on fire, so when i have my good days i take advantage to do the most i can , enjoy things i like, eat my favorite food and make plans and obviously hop in here to share positive comments with other that feel down because maybe i can cheer up someone  else and share a smile while i still have a good mood.... 
then comes the people that laugh at the comments and tell me that being positive is a Fucking waste of time and life sucks and will always suck and everyone is horrible and we all will die alone.... why the fuck you want to crush others like that??!! Knowing how it feels to be put down from others why would you come here shaming someone for having hope and trying to cheer others, it's such a hypocrisy bullying others like that then come here complaining why people don't talk to you or doesn't want to answer dms and how selfish everyone in this sub is because they're  not looking for the same things as you.
well I'm  sorry but not everyone have the same problems or is looking for the same things in here, i like to read others , i dont look for friends or talk to people but i join this because you can always relate to how others feel and find support, if i don't  like something i just don't read it, if i read it and i have nothing to say or nothing useful to add then i just don't  say anything and if i think i can help or cheer up then i comment, but whatever my action is i shouldn't be shamed for do or don't,  we're all here because we're lonely for some reason and want to vent and look for support not being  judged on top of that......
Honestly i just became angry because i read a post from a 14 yo looking for sympathy and people in the comments saying stuff like ""yeah the world is shit and it wouldn't get better, oh wait until high-school"" and stuff like that... when you were little didn't you wished support love and someone that gives you hope? Didn't you lack of it?? There's a different between being realistic and kill others hope, and i get it, trust me i do know  how you feel when nothing has ever go right in your life and everything seems pointless and horrible but i don't  believe, at least in my case,  my bad experiences will be an excuse to put others down, i know how all of this feels and i never wish to anyone to feel like this, and i like even when someone is in a dark place other person feel the same and they conect because of the same feeling/experience amd that exactly is the purpose of this group, I'm  usually a person  that respect other's opinions but in this subject if you're going to add a bad comment please don't, you're  entitled to your opinion  but think it twice, you never know how can you affect others just with your words and honesty it hurts when you're put down by the people that share the same pain, thanks for reading.",2022-01-28 09:06:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616463323,32,/r/lonely/comments/semkmr/for_all_the_hope_killer_people_here_fu/,,0,13,For all the hope killer people here FU

She's cool and funny and smart, she makes me happy and what I like the most about her is how she takes care of the people she love. 

I was starting to fall in love but we live in different countries, so it's hard to keep up with each other. I try to connect with her as much as I can, I would initiate phone calls, conversations, anything that would help us make it work because I know I really like her. 

Since I don't know a lot of things about her (yes, she only wants to talk about me), I started to think that there's something going on with her. I stalked her profile and saw some evidences that she might be living with another man. I think she's married or at least have a boyfriend. I don't know how to take it all in because my mental health is really deteriorating. I cried about it but never had the chance to confront her about it. It hurts so bad but I don't wanna lose her.

4858,sex0ws,MyriadOfClouds,"I was going through old pics to find my old job password to get my w2. There‚Äôs a lot of pictures with my ex, whom I loved, or thought I did, idk. She dumped me out of nowhere, she was cheating and never told me but I found out anyways. A tall guy sponsored by Yamaha, then they broke up a year later and she matched with my friend (he didn‚Äôt know it was my ex, he didn‚Äôt message back), he‚Äôs a good friend. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be that happy again. Ever since we broke up I‚Äôve been a shell of a person. She was a narcissist. 

I haven‚Äôt tried dating in 2 years. I have no confidence. I live at my moms. I don‚Äôt make enough money to live on my own. I did try dating after the breakup, but people weren‚Äôt interested after I told them my height or living condition. So it made me feel even worse. For the past two years I‚Äôve been coasting. I don‚Äôt feel love anymore, I‚Äôm not attracted to anyone. I‚Äôm hopeless about the future. I know whoever I do date will either cheat or find someone better, because it happens again and again. 

Now I‚Äôm taking 3 medications. Bupropion, mertazapine so I can eat, and lithium so my mind isn‚Äôt going insane every day. I wish I could be happy, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm so alone, and lonely, even if I‚Äôm surrounded by people. I no longer allow myself to be vulnerable because that‚Äôs the worst pain (mental and physical) I‚Äôve ever been through. I literally start shaking if I allow myself to be vulnerable, I subconsciously protect myself and I can‚Äôt change it. 

I‚Äôve been in the military, prison, and graduated college. I feel like life has chewed me up, swallowed me, shit me out, ate it again and vomited and buried it with dirt. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of suicide for a long time now. It comes and goes. I‚Äôve tried everything. I used to be a gym rat, now I‚Äôm like what‚Äôs the point. I get tattoos because it makes me feel alive somewhat, I just got my armpit tattoo‚Äôd, it hurt but felt good. 

I‚Äôm just venting, I post here sometimes. I don‚Äôt answer dm‚Äôs because it‚Äôs just people trying to take advantage of others. Comments are usually nice. I know a lot of people here are just like me. 

Not even sure what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm tired man. I‚Äôm so tired. My grandma is 86, battling cancer and I‚Äôm amazed she‚Äôs still alive. Meanwhile here I am 27, and ready to die. But I can‚Äôt, because if I do my dogs won‚Äôt know where I went and my brother passed away, so I‚Äôm the only son my mom has left.

4874,seytnf,LookWhosInsideAgain7,"Hello, I am 21(M) and have reached a point in my life where something has to change. I just recently moved to New Hampshire with my father, stepmom, and younger siblings (The oldest being 10). I left college during the initial covid outbreak and never returned due to my health taking a massive dip due to untreated Type 1 diabetes I never knew I had.  I am now living in a town where I know absolutely no one and have no idea what there is to do around here. Another problem is that I never learned to drive, which is a whole other story of its own. All my friends are scattered across the country at college, and I can't seem to talk to any of them consistently over the phone. I have reached a level of loneliness and depression that I have to get off my ass and do something about it or watch myself slowly go insane. 

 My first steps to fixing all this is I have been taking driving lessons to obtain my license, which will take at least a month. In the meantime, I can get rides from my dad. I also have a prospect for an at home job, which should distract me partly from my depression, Loneliness, and overall lack of purpose I suffer from, but doesn't fix the meeting other people problem. I Love my family very much, but no one in my house can relate to me at all, so I need to make friends or I feel like I'm going To explode.

MY QUESTION: Does anyone have any suggestions on good types of places to meet people around my age both in person and online?  Also does anyone else feel like their life has so little purpose that most days feel like you wake up just to go back to bed and let the cycle repeat?",2022-01-28 19:38:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643396812,11,/r/lonely/comments/seytnf/fellow_redditors_i_call_for_your_help/,,0,14,Fellow Redditors I Call for Your Help.

4885,sf1py9,Change_sets05,"I'm 26 yo and I found myself in a weird situation. Because I've been craving romantic love for a long time and miss the chance to know someone, go to dates and slowly evolve step by step. I only go to work, then home and everything begins on the next day. I've been introvert in my whole life, so it's not new. I don't meet new people and I don't find anyone in the near I feel attracted to and see something in them.
I know a girl a few minutes away from work, we even meet sometimes because their place belongs to us a bit and we can meet sometimes. She's a few years older than me.

It's interesting because she's not my type but I can't avoid thinking on her in the last 1-2 weeks.
I may even find her more attractive how time goes. I basically like her style and she seems kind, smart and she's honestly way better than my past crush who was not this good. I mean I feel her a better person. I even said when I was in love with my crush she seemed like a bad person, althought I loved her but I used my heart to see the real person. But this girl seems much greater, that's why I like to be around her.

Lately, I visited her place often like 5-6 times. I had to go there for the first 2-3 times but I intentionally visited the place since then. Even her colleague said I recently go there quite much. Her other colleague told me that who I meet everytime there and we know each other since I started working here a few years ago...
She makes comments about it nowadays like today I was there and the girl was away. She said ""admit it, you thought she was gonna be here"". Or when she gave me some cookies she cooked at home the previous day. She didn't know if I was gonna go there or which day but I hit the day when she had homemade cookies at work and I ate some. And I told her colleague she didn't know that I wanted to go there, so she didn't cooked them for that. She said there are no accidents. Or how to say... everything happens for a reason.
There are lots of comments by her like these and I think she sees more in this thing than it really has. She said she's weird like me and forget everything like me. :) And after that, birds of a feather flock together because of these.

I'm sure this happens because I'm lonely and I didn't want anything serious because I got enough bad in the past and I was praying for not getting into trouble again.",2022-01-28 21:50:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643404842,1,/r/lonely/comments/sf1py9/im_feeling_strange/,,0,1,I'm feeling strange

4888,sf26vo,Shejku92,"It took me a while to start writing this, but today my internal pain grew much stronger, I need to vent at least a little bit altrough I usually hide everything inside..

When I was 20 yo, I had quite a lot of friends, some of them were my childhood friends and we were hanging out together for years. Altrough I wasn't a party-type guy, I enjoyed little house parties, hangouts in house of one of us, local pubs, going to cinema, etc. Typical things that young adults usually do. 

Then I met my wife, Aleksandra (We're from Poland BTW). We were dating for about year, and got married. Well, typical couple: we had some bad moments and good moments, but we stayed nearly always together, and we're still together.

Problems started when our first kid was born. As a fresh father, I couldn't spend that much time with friends. I always tried to divide my time between my new family, work and social life. Well, I tried, that's a key word. Time passed and my friends slowly stopped inviting me, messaging me, even responding to my messages. Through all this time, more and more friends forgot about me, just like I've become someone not worth hanging out with, because I had some important responsibilities.

And here we are. Now I'm 29 yo, I'll be 30 in the middle of december, and I have no one to talk, no one to meet with or even drink one fkn beer with. The only person that's still with me is my wife. Now I have problems with meeting anyone new, I gained some weight so people tend to avert their eyes when I try to talk to them, I think I got some kind of heavy depression cause sometimes my mood goes straight down below ground and I tend to cry a lot when it happens (just to remind, 29M - that must look pretty lame). I'm just overwhelmed by all my bad thoughts, my sad memories, my social loneliness - I'm trying to endure everything and stay strong when needed (I was even able to deliver my 4th baby when it was too late for my wife to get to the hospital, don't ask how I managed to do that without any help) but all of this feelings and memories that accumulated through years, it's starting to seriously damage my heart and head. Even to the point of getting physical pain in my chest when I'm so down..

I'm starting to lose against my loneliness, I miss my friends, I wish I could see them again, I wish I could meet someone new, I don't know how what to do, I feel like I have no strenght to do it, nor confidence or determination.. the other thing is, I have to work a lot to provide my family safety, food and everything that they need, so It's hard for me to take some time for myself, for regaining my social life. My wife is studying at weekends on medical university in Warsaw, 200km from our home, so I have to keep an eye for our kids. We got no one to stay with them, so I could go out sometimes. My wife's mom lives quite far away feom our home, and my parents...ehh, nevermind. They're too lazy to do it, always making excuses..

I don't know if anyone will understand my story a little..
Maybe someone will laugh at me, and it won't be a first time, but as I said, I had to let some off me..

I'm also experiencing a strong loss of my identity, sometimes I really don't know who I am anymore.

All of these is getting really weird, I have on fucking idea what is happening. All started gradually after iniitating an antidepressant. It worked pretty well and maybe now I'm experiencing a drastic change in how I see the world and in how I behave around people, how other perceive me etc. Maybe it's not a problem, just a transformation of myself.

4920,sf78w8,Dry-Worldliness-4861,"Hello all. I am 20F. I am dealing with self hatred. It started in middle school. I got bullied a lot for my weight and appearance. Because of this I was suicidal and angry as a teenager. I had friends in middle school, but I would reach out to them and tell them what I was feeling and they told me to stop and just kill myself because they didn‚Äôt care. After that I stopped taking my problems to them. Still getting bullied, I isolated myself because it was safer. I left the school eventually because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The first year at the new school was amazing. The change felt needed. I met a friend on my second day, she was cool. She was the first person in four years to be nice to me other than family. She help me meet a lot of people but I don‚Äôt know how to react to people being nice to me. It just makes me uncomfortable. Skip to 11th grade. The friend got kicked out of the school for having sex with students and I was alone for a while but I eventually made friends again. That year the school was being shut down, teachers weren‚Äôt getting paid, and everyone was unhappy and there was a lot of racial tension. I‚Äôm black by the way so it‚Äôs just uncomfortable all the time for me. My depression got out of control being there and I began to isolate, lash out, and didn‚Äôt show up to school. Because of that, I lost a lot of friends. I had unhealed problems coming back and I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with him and how to stop it. I hated myself for it. I hate myself for what I did to people. I hate myself for not trying harder to push back my problems and fake it. I would have friends around me if I faked it. At home, my mother was getting abused by my Half sisters father. My mother also has an immune disease that causes her body to attack itself. This is usually aggravated by stress so I never bothered to tell her much was going on. So I had to help her but I didn‚Äôt want her to help me. My mother also has depression from when my father died and also childhood trauma that she is getting through with the therapist today. I don‚Äôt want to burden her. After all of this, I have a lot of self hatred. I hate the way I look. I hate to think about my body. I hate that I want to be with friends but I don‚Äôt think I deserve them. The reason I‚Äôm still alive is that I love helping people. I love walking the elderly to their car after grocery shopping. I love helping kids with their homework. I think I would even pull someone out of a burning car . Helping people is the only reason why I am alive. It just keeps me going I‚Äôll always have somebody to help. And my mother. If I killed myself, that would be the most selfish thing I could ever do to my mother. She tells me I‚Äôm worth it but I don‚Äôt believe her. She reminds me of all the amazing things I‚Äôve done for people but I just shrug it off. I want to love myself but I don‚Äôt know where to begin and why I should. If I go to a therapist which I have recently, all they told me was to get out side and do things that I like. But it feels like I‚Äôm wasting my time. Right now, I am a college student. I do things online because I‚Äôm afraid of going to school and looking and feeling like this. But I also want to do some thing for the community because I‚Äôve never been part of a community.

Do you guys have any tips?

4939,sf933y,[deleted],"I am 17 and have been alone for quite a while, I have a few friends that I don't see much anymore (I am very grateful for though), but I have never had anything close to a relationship.


A few months I started college and slowly realised that I didn't have any friends with me. I spend everyday alone, most days not 1 word is said to me. I thought I could handle independence and didn't mind this, however the other day my headphones broke and I realized how alone I was. The music was just a facade that blemished an overwhelming void of loneliness, that nearly brought me to tears.

I was surrounded by people at my high school that I considered friends, but I now realise that I meant nothing to any of them. I was just used to laugh at and pick on, that it wasn't just banter and I just used to let them walk all over me, unknowly. I'll get a message from some of them every now and then.

I see couples walk past - holding hands and leaning on each other. I want to feel happy for them, but that is overshadowed by jealousy, guilt and self hatred; I can't help but feel like they are showing off and rubbing it in my face, like they know how much it pains me to see. But they don't. I just want someone that can love me like that.

I'm not suicidal, but everyday keeps on getting harder and harder. I know it's my fault that I'm alone but I don't have the confidence to speak up to anyone and the few times I do, I feel like I get laughed off. I'm stuck in this cycle of lack of self esteem, rejection and guilt. Forever forced to run on this treadmill of shame.

I've been bottling this for a while as I don't think I deserve this pitty, so many more people live harder lives and I'm whining about not having enough attention, anyways...

Thank you if you read all of that, I have never told anyone about how I feel before.",2022-01-29 03:45:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,,6,/r/lonely/comments/sf933y/a_bad_day_everyday/,,0,3,"A bad day, everyday"
4940,sf94l5,reignnote42,"Hi everyone. I am going through a tough time with my parents right now and if anyone has any guidance and support, I would greatly appreciate it.

I am 22 for reference. I am finishing my final semester of my undergraduate degree, and I am currently in the graduate application stage. I have a full ride (plus a 20k additional scholarship) to my current program, and I work 4 jobs while making almost $2k a month on my own. While not being fully financially independent yet (I don't pay for health, car insurance, etc). I have a full time job offer set up for next year, so I will be making more by that time. I have not asked or needed money from my parents in a long time. I study two areas and I am trying to do my absolute best to make accomplishments and please them.

But it never has been enough. Every time I bring up going out of state, it ends in them yelling at me and saying that I am selfish and only think for myself. They are very over protective of me. I currently live 3 hours away from them for college (in-state) and that was a huge stretch for them. My mom recently told me that if it was up to her, I'd be commuting at home with a closer college.

My field of study that I prefer requires for me to travel many places and be independent, which is something I told them 4 years ago before starting my undergraduate degree. And either way, no matter what field of study I choose to work in, I have been passionate about moving something new for my own career and life choice.

I recently got into a bad car accident which totaled my car (not my fault) and my parents are using that as an incentive for me not to travel out of state, because if something like that were to happen they wouldn't be there to help. The thing is, I handled the insurance myself and also took care of everything with my car. The insurance company even messed up some information and I got it fixed when my dad couldn't, and in return he just yelled at me for taking matters into my own hands.

Right now my parents are approaching my grad school dream as a ""if THEY approve of it"" outlook. They only seem to support me if I want to stay in my home city. Tonight I was told that if I don't get free tuition, they won't ""let me"" go and they also won't let me take a gap year to work for it again. There is 30k in college savings funds that I didn't need for my undergrad since I got a full ride that I currently have. Even so, I offered to fully take out loans and pay for everything myself. Even if I wanted to stay local, it would never be enough for them. I would never make them fully happy.

I have hit a very stressful bump in the road. I don't know what to do or think anymore, and I feel incredibly unmotivated due to the stress the situation is causing me. I REALLY want to move out and be on my own, and I know I can do it. I get told I'm selfish every single day, and I'm so scared right now about my future. My friends, teachers, and colleagues have been highly encouraging, saying that this is my decision and I should not hold back. But while my parents say otherwise everyday and that they can decide my future, I have thoughts in my head now telling me that.

If my parents say no to graduate school, can I still take out my own loans, commit to the school, and go?",2022-01-29 03:47:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643426306,3,/r/lonely/comments/sf94l5/please_help_parents_unsupportive_while_im/,,0,3,please help. parents unsupportive while I'm financially making my own decisions.

Usually people do not seem to want to be friends with me. The ones who did seem interested all eventually lost interest. I don‚Äôt know for sure why.

Is it something about my personality that makes people turned off? Is it something about my behaviors? Anyways the bottom line of the matter is:

1. I strongly desire friendships and relationships 

2. Despite my best efforts I am unable to acquire friendships/relationships 

3. People generally don‚Äôt seem interested in me

4. The people who have shown interest in the past all eventually stopped talking to me.

4954,sfb7zo,[deleted],"..If he fails to achieve something. Men don't get second chances if they fail in life. Always have to be an edge, always have to win, need to earn fast, take care of responsibilities, sacrifice personal goals for the sake of family (Eastern thing, west is more individualistic). On the contrary I see some women around me living the life they want, their money is their's to spend, they travel as they want, get fan following on Instagram, be in &amp; out of relationship as they wish.

I failed early in life to settle down fast, then there were family issues to take care of, it crippled my confidence, changed my world view forever, I don't find anything interesting these days, my life just revolves around earning, paying bills, single child, taking care of mother &amp; tolerate my father. I drink &amp; smoke once in while enough to not go insane, but now loneliness is slowly getting to me, it has started to affect my decisions, my ambition, my desire to work properly. For past couple of years I tried, I tried to improve things, to work on myself, switched jobs to earn better, but that has also led to some precarious situation, not going in that details. I have trouble waking up, don't have the will to go on like this. Can't take long break, can't start fresh somewhere else, I am not dateble anymore, I was already ugly, average, genes were not on my side, I have become this boring depressed hopeless person, un dateble, I tried once, gave it a shot, but girl had some gut feeling and backed out, I think it was fair, better for her. Now I don't think about it anyway, I never really wanted kids anyway, I don't wanna pass on my genes, so fine.. marriage always leads in that direction, so no point in pursuing it.

If not that life, &amp; not adventures life, no fun in life, feeling trapped even when I earn money, then what's the point of all this? I think it would be good bye once my mother is no more, but it's years away, hope I brain don't go berserk till then, it runs in the family.",2022-01-29 05:44:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,,11,/r/lonely/comments/sfb7zo/a_mans_life_can_go_downhill_quickly/,,0,5,A man's life can go downhill quickly

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been here. Almost a year... what a year. Started with covid, lost a month of my life to it. Then went straight to workaholic work - nice 300h/month, over time not paid... ended up below minimal hourly wage in my country (yay me!). Then they‚Äôve fired me without a word... went to company base for some shit and get ppl to my site. 

Was greated by HR with termination letter on wednsday with mandatory days off to take so friday was my last day of work. Then boss didn‚Äôt pay me over half of delegation fees, but oh well. I‚Äôve got home that last day and drunkedly procastinated weekend. 

Luckly my job hunt lasted less than, a week. Got like +1/3 salary and after 3 months with extension after ‚Äútrial‚Äù time another +16% raise. So after 3 months of getting fired I‚Äôm at +55% $$, less work time and some nice benefits! Just when I‚Äôve got that sorted out... 

I‚Äôve got letter from uni that I‚Äôm getting kicked out again. For not putting up thesis on time... and it‚Äôs final this time. I‚Äôve appealed, it got rejected. Appealed again, last possible time. It went throught! Dean gave me deadline on 24th that I have to put up thesis by 30th or get approval on paper from supervising doc that he‚Äôll accept it. I‚Äôve read that mail on 27th ;( Got approval mail from doc by 30th... at 23:14. Redirected that to Dean 10min later. Next day Dean accepted and gave some conditions to allow me to finish! 24th January was THE DAY - thesis defence with 3question exam! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I‚Äôve passed! Now I don‚Äôt know what to do.

 Last thing that was weighing me is gone. 

But what now?! 

Work is left. My ‚Äòhobbies‚Äô are glorified procastination acctivites.

5007,sfn6jj,pwnage765,"I don't like it, but it's true... I'm a 26 year old autistic guy who just can't do anything right. I'm morbidly obese because I'm too fucking stupid to actually take care of myself properly and it's hard to find healthy things that I can eat because of my stupid autistic sensitivities. My only three friends all moved over an hour away and they never invite me over or anything, and when I do go I usually end up alone in their apartment while they all do their own things for the day. I've tried to do things with my coworkers who I'm friendly with, but I assume they don't want me around because even though I've said that I'm free to do things and that I'd like to, nothing ever happens. I can barely make any money because I don't have any real useful skills and I live on Cape Cod, and just about everything here is catered towards tourist service things, retail, restaurants, that kind of stuff. I'm stuck in retail and only made $50 last week because they only gave me 4 hours for the whole week because of it being the off-season. I want to make new friends, or meet someone to date, or just meet anyone who just wants me around. It's so hard because everyone says to go to a hobby place and stuff, but there's nothing like that near me, and when I check things like meetup, there's nothing near me that interests me at all.

5058,sfunea,Monk_Shaolin,"I'm 19M. Before 18 I didn't really think about friends, I had them, but I never really ""cared"" if you know what I mean, I enjoyed my own company. I had 2 or 3 friends when I was 18, one I used to smoke weed with but stopped hanging around because I didn't want to smoke anymore, one that I could tell everything to, but overdosed. And one that I met at the pub. I've still been meeting the one friend at the pub a few times, but I feel like he has so many friends that I'm just one, I'm not really his ""friend"" anymore, more someone that used to be his friend.

&amp;#x200B;

After 18, I began to go out with my friend who I go to the pub with sometimes, but I only went sometimes, but I enjoyed going out, the only thing is I rely on my friend. If he's not available, if he got too drunk and has a bad hangover, what can I do? I ask him beforehand if he's available on the weekend, and he goes out the night before instead, with his real friends. So, I began to feel jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't met my friend since New Year's Eve, and we didn't fall out, but he kept saying he couldn't meet. Now recently I've started to feel really weird when I see people enjoying themselves with friends, anyone, people I don't even know. I feel on the verge of a breakdown, and I don't even know what a breakdown feels like. My heart feels unhealthy, weak, and broken but broken because of myself. My confidence has deteriorated, I feel like a loser, a weirdo. I'm not even a socially awkward person, I just feel like people aren't wanting to speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope something can change because I shouldn't be feeling like this. I've changed as a person, I'm a good person and I know good people probably shouldn't say that at all, but in terms of sympathy, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I even reached out to a God I don't believe, I do good things and get nothing back. What is the point? My heart is in the right place.",2022-01-29 23:20:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614700880,18,/r/lonely/comments/sfunea/ive_begun_to_feel_jealous_of_people_with_friends/,,0,9,I've begun to feel jealous of people with friends.

5134,sg2bei,_shadyblack,"I am one of the boring people you know. I am generally very nice and helpful to people (not gender specific, I swear I am not one of the nice guys). I do have people who I know but I don't have any friends. I have reached at the point I sometimes cry out of loneliness. 

I have been mistreated by many so called friends in the past, even after I didn't do anything wrong. I was diagnosed with depression few years ago, and I was taking medicines and therapy but had to discontinue due to some issues in family.

At this point, I doubt myself that am I even worthy of Love and friendship? There was this one colleague at my workplace who I was once talking to, and I casually mentioned about an another girl that she's hot and I should ask her out. She laughed obnoxiously at my face and said have you looked at yourself, she is totally outta your league. Needless to say, I was hurt even though I'm not sure if she was joking. I know that because of my low self-esteem, I would never have dared to ask her out, but that bluntness hurt me. 

I tend to overwork on weekdays and rarely leave my room (Currently Work from home going since last 2 years). I dread weekends because I don't have anything to do then and I often cry on weekends.

I don't know what should I do.

5148,sg3u8f,Loudanddeadly,It's been 7 fucking years since the last time I wanted to be alive. All I want is for someone to love me or someone to kill me. I hate existing. I wish I could bring myself to blow my brains out already so I never feel anything ever again. It's to the point where if I do try to kill myself I'm aiming for whatever part of the brain controls emotions so in case I survive I won't feel anymore. I'm so painfully lonely. The only time I feel I truly enjoyed life was when I was with someone and it looks like I'll never have that again.

5173,sg8hv4,Gaysensei,"TW// implied forms of abuse, stalking, bullying, homophobic family, entire life being ruined//

All my life I felt doomed.
-As a child, my family used me for money in ways I can only discuss with a therapist.. but y'all can probably guess what went on. 
-when they couldn't do that anymore after we moved to a rich town, they all ""mysteriously"" started to hate me
-living in a racist part of town, I wasn't allowed to play with other kids because I'm ""too dark skin"", but my brother with lighter skin was allowed to play with whoever.
-bullied in school thru elementary to highschool
-kicked out after I came out as gay
-when my family wasn't inappropriately telling friends in my life all these lies about me it was people who bullied me
-young adult life, someone who said he was obsessed with me in HS unfortunately became my neighbor &amp; after a year, I was forced to move far away and get a restraining order.

-his rumors and family's rumors destroyed my life and every single one of my friendships.

I have agoraphobia now. All of 2021 I refused to go outside and spent the entire year in isolation. The few times I did go outside, people I haven't talked to in years still had strong hateful reactions to seeing me.

Any attempt I made to befriend ppl in the past and these others would threaten to put them in danger just to get them to stop talking to me.

What do you even do about all this? I keep telling myself I should just live life and ignore the hate, but when EVERYONE'S become as violent as that previous ""neighbor"" of mine, it's hard. 

I don't want to be this lonely anymore. But there's literally no one left. I have no one to turn to. I'm getting life back together financially, but it doesn't feel worth it if everyone in town has fully rejected me. If these people say I'm not allowed to LIVE around here, unless I wanna risk my safety and my life... Then what the fuck do I do?

If you read all of this, thank you for hearing me out. I'm in the worst place I've ever been, mentally.

I've graduated from an engineering degree just over six months ago and with the pandemic impacting my degree length, i've moved back home to my parents. I was initially meant to be on a placement year in 2020/21 but we all know what happened.

Apart from my family, I have little relations here. I'm not from a very well connected city and jobs within my studied field are not anywhere close by. All my college friends have moved out of town or are still in university elsewhere. 

I'm currently working at an electrical engineering firm to get some experience and apart from that, I have no real desire to go out anywhere.

At the start of this school year however i got to know a girl, she's in my class. She's always been very friendly with me and we chatted here and there, she always seemed very genuine and it always made me happy to talk to her. She noticed that i wasn't doing well mentally and checked up on me. As small as that might sound, it was a huge deal for me. She was the first person in years to really make me feel somewhat cared about except for my parents.
Because I'm a dumbass i started liking her on more than just a platonical level. Around christmas time we texted here and there and once again, it always felt genuine. However now that school started again i feel like we are drifting apart. Some friends of her know that i like her and even made some hints she might like me back but i just can't seem to approach her recently. I truly like her and she often told me about how she relates to some of my struggles but on the other hand seems so unreachable. She's got plans for after school, good grades, friends..
I know very well that if i just ""wait for something to happen"", nothing will happen. I'll stay miserable by myself.

5247,sglozw,GoofyVW,"So there was a time when I was 17 and changed schools, for the main purpose of getting a fresh start and finding new friends... I wasn't insanely popular but I got along with a few people and even tried to ask my first crush out.... Skip to the end of school when I was 19, I was heartbroken but thanks to an online chatroom I found a few irl friends to talk to and even got over my heart ache... Now queue a few years forward to when I'm about to be 23 in a week... I haven't had a single relationship and most friends I've had have gotten into relationships and they're distant... But there were a few friends left still... Now during the new years eve I lied to my parents about spending time with friends while one of my best friends went off to celebrate with my other friend and another one of my best friends said she wanted to be alone but I ended up seeing her partying with people... Skip a few weeks into 2022 and it's her birthday coming up, since we haven't met for half a year then I figured I'd ask her out and we'd just see each other and talk and I even planned on getting her a few roses since she likes flowers, we have known each other for 4 years now and I've always been extremely supportive of her and always ready to listen.... She said she has no plans but said let's see when the day comes.... Well then that day came and she didn't even open up my messages despite sending snaps to me and when I was about to go to sleep I saw that she's with a guy she met a week ago ... It broke my heart and despite her saying we're still friends and she wants to meet she never makes an effort on her side and whenever I try to meet up she gives an uncertain answer... Now I feel like my one friend group doesn't want to hang around with me outside of gaming (people I met irl) and one of my best friends who I've always supported and at some point really made me feel like she cares about me, has also gotten tired of me and is trying to make me leave her alone despite my best effort trying to be there for her... I recently moved on my own too because my mum left for America and even though she sometimes writes to me she quickly starts sending me thumbs up emojis as if she wants me to leave her alone instead of trying to talk to me... At this point I don't know what to do and tbh I'd like to punch anyone who says ""treat others like you want to be treated"" because it's the most bullshit thing ever",2022-01-30 23:09:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601124953,7,/r/lonely/comments/sglozw/i_came_out_of_my_lonely_corner_but_it_seems_like/,,0,1,I came out of my lonely corner but it seems like I'm slowly going back into it....

5284,sgr8r7,rabbidbeare,"Let me give a little bit of background - So I‚Äôm 22, and I recently moved all the way from one coast of the U.S to the other (not kidding) to escape my toxic mother and try to scrape together a life for myself. I‚Äôm trying to finish my bachelors degree, and I‚Äôm living at school in the dorms. My father, my best friend and support system, died a little over a year ago. I have a brother, but we‚Äôve never been super close. I‚Äôve always kind of been an island of a girl, even when I was receiving serious medical treatments for a couple years in my late teens. I never asked for help, even when I really needed it. Never asked for pain meds, or water, I didn‚Äôt want to bother anyone. I learned over time that my mothers manipulation and emotional abuse shut me down and forced me to be as low maintenance as possible. But this also means I‚Äôm terrible at making friends, because I almost never make the first move on anything. I watch others, and then jump in when I feel confident enough to try, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done most things in my life. Hell, making an account on Reddit, a social platform, to try and reach out to anyone is really scary for me. 
 
But I have this weird pull in my heart. I want to be in love. I want to find love of some kind. Crazy right? I don‚Äôt even know how to make proper friends! I‚Äôm kinda shy and keep to myself, but I do know that I‚Äôm at least kind and patient with others because I always try my best to be! People tell me I‚Äôm beautiful, perfect strangers even, and that‚Äôs been true for years, so I can‚Äôt be too terrible to look at. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is a myriad of things. Has anyone else felt like this, or been in a similar situation? How do I start to find people to be friends with in a place I‚Äôve never been to before? How do I find love of some kind, without accidentally walking into a disaster because I‚Äôm looking for it so hard and so willingly? I can‚Äôt drive because I was under my mothers thumb for so long, she was reluctant to let me have any independence. People are kind of cold and distant here, so it‚Äôs really scary to think of approaching anyone. And the masks make it so hard to tell what anyone else is thinking, I can‚Äôt see smiles or the little expressions we all make that say so much about our moods.  So nobody even looks approachable. I just hide in my dorm all day or go to the gym. 

I‚Äôm desperate to find some advice. I want to have a life, I want to find warmth in a mans arms and laugh with friends. I don‚Äôt want to fail and end up on my mothers doorstep.",2022-01-31 03:36:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1635581911,6,/r/lonely/comments/sgr8r7/young_and_lonely/,,0,3,Young and lonely

You were my friend, and from everything We spoke about, I thought I was the same for you. You stuck with me when I was down and out, helped me feel happy. I tried my best to be there for you when you needed me. You were always there calling me when you felt alone and made me feel like I had a true friend that cared about me and that I wasn‚Äôt alone. We kept eachother company day to day, and with your company you helped me in many ways, made my life fuller. Maybe we haven‚Äôt been a good friends to one another lately. We should have sat down and explained how we felt, I would have understood that you needed space. An maybe I should have realized the signs and spoken to you myself. Then maybe we could have worked on still being friends, But now I‚Äôm not sure if we could ever be friends again. Which even through the bs, I still care about you and hope that you do somewhere deep inside. I hope that even though we aren‚Äôt friends and we don‚Äôt talk anymore that Maybe someday we could try and be friends again. It may never happen because honestly I don‚Äôt know your true feelings. I know I have my faults and I know my anger is one of them, but that‚Äôs no excuse for my actions so for that I‚Äôm truely sorry. If we wont be in each other‚Äôs life‚Äôs anymore, I hope you know that you‚Äôll always have a friend in me. I hope your life moves forwards and that you can be truely happy.

5298,sgst16,palette-259,"This crushes my ego, but I need friends. I also think it's pathetic of me. I'm just so ashamed of myself. Where else can I find friends? I don't go to school; I had to drop out at the age of 16. 

I only made friends outside school... They made me see how beautiful life is. If it weren't for them I would've had already took the easy way out.

I just have to find the right people, in right time. Though life is not in favor of me right now.

We had to go separate ways just last year. So I'm left alone again. 

I now finally admit I can't do this all alone. I thought I can do this all on my own. I'm so demotivated in life I can't do the things I have to do. I feel lost.

I want... and I need to make friends. If they are sad I, too, wish to support their emotional needs.

And someone told me I will have kids in 10 years from that exact day and I said to myself ""I definitely won't"". Not because I don't want to, it's just that I know people and being romantic and wanting only love from someone and loyalty is too much. Everyone gets bored of it, everyone wants bitching, etc.

2 years ago I found someone who made me want to kill myself and I survived someone and got in a psycho ward. I can't force myself better to avoid everyone.

5407,sheorf,Rentaaaan,"I keep seeing reminders that it‚Äôs valentines soon. (sorry to bring you another one üòÖ) I have mixed feelings about it because it‚Äôs a nice and cute holiday but it‚Äôs always sucked for me.

When I was in school I used to come in on valentine‚Äôs day with the tiniest hope that someone would leave me a chocolate or something. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt happen, but it was nice to still have that little hope that it might. I don‚Äôt even bother hoping anymore haha. 

It really sucks to see all the cute people around you getting gifts and confessions and compliments while you get overlooked. Obviously I was happy for them but it still sucks for me. 

idk. I‚Äôm just venting. I kinda wish this holiday didn‚Äôt exist",2022-01-31 22:46:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1539193940,8,/r/lonely/comments/sheorf/valentines/,,0,7,Valentines :(

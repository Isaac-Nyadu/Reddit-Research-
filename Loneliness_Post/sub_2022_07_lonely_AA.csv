Anyway, hopefully this isn't too weird I promise I'm not a creep or anything.

It's just that.... it's hard to explain lol.

I'm just a pretty weird and awkward 21 year old guy with not alot of friends (but do have some, though only males).

I don't really have that much interaction with them and they seem so different to me than males, and idk why I always become weird when around them (though I am getting better at this, thank god,lol).

It's not only sexual attraction, I'm just drawn to you guys, I suppose...curiousity?

Welp this was my awkward high rant, thanks if you've read.",2022-07-01 00:03:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1522660823,3,/r/lonely/comments/vomst1/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_girls/,,0,4,I can't stop thinking about girls.
1,vomvb7,Tataroonie,"In the UK, you either become apart of the sheep’s herd or suffer alone. If you decide to be yourself, you’re deemed weird and not worthy of basic human decency. I haven’t had friends since I’ve been at high school, I always ate alone and watched everyone else talk to their friends. I was bullied so no one in my school liked me, I was basically an outcast. I tried to socially do what I could to put myself in situations that would be worthy of making friendships but it always failed and it takes effort from both parties to become friends. After a while, my social skills went from decent to nothing. I have spent every year alone in my room and I have no reason to go outside. 

I fail to make online friendships, either everyone is the same or the fact I try is worthless since they live so far from me. I crave physical interaction, and i’m always jealous and envious of the fact that they have friends. Whenever i was surrounded by online friends, I wish they also didn’t have any other friends so we could relate and I would be the only one they had so I knew they wouldn’t leave me. It sounds selfish, I know that. 

I’ve became a completely different person as I once was. I no longer feel excitement, happiness, surprised, or any regular natural human emotions. I have no empathy for others, I’m starting to only care about myself and fulfil my needs and dip when they become fulfilled. I have lost my mind with the amount of time I’ve spent alone, I want to kill people. Therapy isn’t an option, I only see it as an illusion as it only works for some. 
No one truly cares, they’ll say a few things and go but they won’t actually reach out to you and try and associate themselves with you. Even the ones that struggle and are going through similar experiences to you don’t give a fuck. I hate this world and society, it’s a disgusting evil place and I wish it would burn or get nuked already.",2022-07-01 00:07:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630462967,3,/r/lonely/comments/vomvb7/loneliness_everyone_is_the_same/,,0,3,"loneliness, everyone is the same."

I tried to consult my friends at school, and someone overheard it. We all know how popular the fatherless jokes have gotten, right? I had them targeted at me.
Then my dog died from tick paralysis, and it was one I was very attached to as well. 
I cant even talk to my mom because she has to work overtime to pay the bills and I’m scared of what’s going to happen next.

12,vooadn,relayshionboats,"""Part of this is to allow yourself to have experiences and then decide how you feel, not make up your mind about how you're going to feel later.""

""It's ok if you don't know if he's the guy. You just date until you feel differently, until you know.""

""That's part of the unknowing of dating. We don't know how we're going to feel, but let's invest in our time that we have now and then see. It's ok if later you decide we're just better as friends. Or it's also ok to decide later, I think I want to spend even more time with you--and more committed time. Either one is fine, and neither one of them means you shouldn't do something today. The whole point of you dating someone is just to see how you feel and not make up your decision for the rest of your life today.""

""You, on your own, as much as you don't believe it, are perfect. We want you to choose to engage with people not to complete you but because these are the people you want to spend time with.""

""Part of this is just from spending enough time with people to realize that most people are blinded into themselves because, well, just think of the design of the body. We look out. We naturally get raised into looking outward. And then we receive. And so it becomes this sort of natural progression of I look to external sources to receive. [...] We grow up thinking that we need other people. And depending on how we were raised or the environments that either gets solidified or we're allowed to create space to individuate. And your family confused you enough that you felt shunned, that you just separated, that you felt you were less than. So then you really felt a desire to latch onto somebody that could help you feel whole again. And what we're trying to say is that's all a facade that you were indoctrinated into with your parents doing the best they could. But you are not broken, maybe just blinded.""

""Part of this is for you to not try and fix the external in hopes that it'll then improve your internal. We build within and then we encounter relationships from a position of strength, and that's how the healthy relationships get formed because there isn't an imbalance. As much as it feels good, it's always going to be an imbalance the way that you had previously been doing it. So then it's never enough because as soon as you're separate--it was so imbalanced that you're like, 'Oh, I'm less than now.'""

""What we want move to is that you want to be with people. We want that to be different than I need-- I am incomplete without it.""

""You're an equal partner. And it's ok that your needs are undefined. Even if he is sure of himself, we're not trying to rush you to catch up to him.""

""It's so much easier if we stay with what we know--even if it's you know that you don't know. Because it's the thing that is. Your anxiety and sadness comes with all the things that it could be or couldn't be and might be and may become, which is a lot of extra internal dialogue. When if we just stayed in the moment, it's just the thing. This is where I'm at. And there's no what if, what if, what if. If you stay with listening to yourself and your feelings, when you feel differently, then you'll know you feel differently. You don't have to wonder about the day you feel differently.""

""What we're trying to do is make things simpler so that you know what you're even deciding on. You're deciding on how you feel about things--not how he feels about things, not what other people may think of your relationship, or not how you think you'll feel differently about it later. The exercise is how do I feel right now? And then, you express either it to yourself or to others, not with the intent of them changing that; the point of the expression is just to express.""

""Just breathe into that space of being and not always doing.""

""There is some pressure that comes externally. But we don't need to add internal pressure preemptively based off of what might happen.""

""They can be responsible for the experience. [He] did things that directly affected you. We can hold him at fault for his actions, but your feelings are yours. [...] This doesn't mean you shouldn't feel hurt or upset or whatever feeling comes up or sad, but we don't want to start blaming people for our feelings. Because then the physics of it starts you believing then you can be responsible for other people's feelings.""

""You don't get a free pass, but that doesn't mean everything you do requires critical judgement.""

""Here's the deal: they're blind spots. When we happen upon an accident, it was in our blind spot, and then, we become aware. It's when you're aware and then you just callously disregard, then maybe we can sit in some sort of judgement of like alright I should apologize for that. But if it's a blind spot, you don't see it! We don't want to hold you accountable for things you don't know.""

""If that's what you needed to say in the moment, we don't want you to then go back and go oh, that's not what I wanted, oh, I shouldn't have done that. If you said something you didn't mean, then we can say oh I shouldn't have done that because it's not what I actually meant. Do you see how that's a little bit different? If you needed to yell at him because how you felt, ok. That's better than you not yelling and having it get really, really bad inside and then you going over and hitting him with a bat. If you yelling on the phone helps you let him hear you, ok. As long as what you said was true. If you're lying, then you can feel guilty about lying. Don't feel guilty about having feelings.""

""Save the I'm sorry's for the things that you deem necessary to say I'm sorry.""

""This comes from just a sense of you deferring. I'm sorry that I'm in the world. Please let me remove myself from your path so that you may go unobstructed from the barrier that I created for you.""

""I'm able to engage you in a way based off of my understanding of how you've described your world. Just to help you reflect on what's actually happening to you, and then you get to decide what you want to do with it. And what pacing looks like for you. I don't have an opinion on what the pacing needs to be. Other than I'm certain that when we feel anxious or sad, a main component is usually pacing.""

""You won't know something feels good if you don't know something equally feels bad. It's the physics of emotion. [You won't know if something] feels good unless there's a comporable negative feeling.

18,vooxgy,T_Paine_89,"Ever since my fiancé and I broke up, I’ve felt crippling loneliness. All of her friends were my friends, her family was my family, and she took them with her. Almost all my family lives out of town. I have a couple friends, but they, too, love out of town (one of them sounds like they’re moving back though, so… at least there’s that). I interact with some people through text or Facebook from time to time, but fuck I just hate not having a companion. A partner or a best friend—either would do. I want a relationship again, so I can build a lasting love with someone. I want a close friendship again, so I can create an unbreakable bond with someone where we’ll always be there for each other.

I’ll admit, after the breakup, I had to move back in with my parents, so I *shouldn’t* feel lonely. I do, though. We don’t share any interests, and I have an incredibly strained relationship with my dad. I’m basically isolated in their spare bedroom most of the time, unless I have to run errands. I’ll be getting my own place again soon, once I save up some money. Then I’ll be truly alone.

I just want to have that bond with someone again. I want to feel close with someone who I can always be there for, through thick and thin, no matter what. That’s what really sucks about loneliness for me… I don’t have that bond with anyone anymore. I no longer have anyone to whom I can look in their eyes and say, “I’m here for you no matter what. Whatever happens, I got you.”

65,vowd9n,TenchFromDelmakO,"Teased too much as a kid.

Loved and lost as a young adult and carried that flame for more than 20 years.

Down and out as an adult. Dropped out of school.

Working the same dead-end job for 30 years.

I realized I gave up a long time ago...why complain about it now?

Just got to keep reminding myself that the pressure is off. There is no greater happiness to seek and the happiness I have has been cultivated over years of isolation.

No need to get bent out of shape over people who don't care, hate me, or seem nice, just to be nice.

It still happens though. I give someone an inch and they take a mile.

I'm not going to fight for anything, what's the point? It's safer and happier just to walk away.

Doesn't matter what is said or done, there's no trust aligning anyone's thoughts. So there will just be misunderstandings every time I open my ears or mouth.

And now after decades, I am like everyone else. I don't care. Now that I know how it feels, I know all of you don't care about yourselves either.

I will end with this lesson. If you ever meet someone naive, old or young, don't burst their bubble or bust their balls. All the lessons of life are painful, spare them and save yourself.

Enjoy happiness when or however you have it. Enjoy it right then and there, not later, that's called a memory, that's something different and that means you missed it.

After you crossed over and learn both sides you realize every living thing on the planet is a scammer, whether they know it or not. At the same time, they are all just seeking the same happiness.

70,voykz1,EquivalentHorror1984,"It's been a while, long while since I've been in a relationship, I've never had much luck dating wise.
Longest relationship was just shy of 5 years.
When I was younger I'd feel strongly about the person, but I don't know if I'd call it love, at times I'd be filled with energy, but it was likely more just infatuation.

As I get older I just feel an emptyness, I've never really been close to people, just temporary aquantances that for one reason or another depart and become part of my past.

Earlier this year I reached a particularly low point in my life and eventually participated in some counseling, it helped to have someone who actually listened, rather than just telling me things and how I ""should"" feel.

I've found that overall, I don't become addicted to substances (alcohol, pot oil, stuff like that). Pop and the occasional game (rare these days), might be another story though, though I have cut down on the pop versus a few months ago.

Recently I had my first experience with magic mushrooms, assuming low quality because it took a fairly large dose for the effect. There was ups and downs for how I felt, at times I felt what I would describe as ""feeling loved"" very strongly, and the first in a long time.

To cut the story down a bit, I'll skip ahead a bit.
Since then I've begun to learn about growing my own (early stages to my first harvest), I've gotten alot of different stuff for the various stages.

I work a full-time job, so I know that it can't be an everyday thing (other than microdosing, if I try that route). I'm not sure if this will be different in not getting addicted, which part of me worries about. Overall I'm alone, and I don't see that changing anytime soon, though the happiness I felt from that experience has been wearing off, it helped take away the longing I had for a romantic relationship.

I know that I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life, though partly I may not have much choice in the matter as I get older based on different factors in my life.

I'm not really sure how to finish this off, I just felt I needed to say it somewhere.
To anyone who reads this, please try to find a good moment somewhere in your day and take a moment to appreciate whatever that is. 🍀",2022-07-01 11:28:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640587180,8,/r/lonely/comments/voykz1/just_a_story/,,0,2,just a story

81,vp1l3b,cockrobotcock,"This just got *further* validated after an old friend, someone who had already never bothered talking to me unless it related to me giving them ideas and writing for their personal projects and ghosted me because I vented a lot on a completely different platform (think of it as an online diary sort of thing; it was never sent towards anyone directly, there’s always a warning that it’s a vent before it actually starts, and you can swipe away from it if you’re disinterested or uncomfortable and no one will know) when I was going through a really bad period mentally, miraculously came back after months of silence because they claimed they ""miss me"" all of a sudden. This isn’t me speculating either; they told me this directly that they thought the vents that they *chose* to look at when they had the chance and every right to just skip when they saw the big red “VENT” warning right in the center of the video were too scary, but now that they need me as their substitute friend, it magically doesn’t bother them anymore?

I don't care if they wanted to cut all ties with me, whether it was because of the vents, they were tired of me, or whatever else; I'd want to cut all ties with myself too, but what irritates me the most is that now that they're bored and lonely, *now* they want to rekindle our friendship (that was just me composing their project while they ignored me every time the subject wasn't on that). No one’s obligated to be my friend, and if being aware of my declining mental state turned them off from pursuing our friendship further, so be it; I'm aware how strenuous it can be, but now that they need another friend, it’s all no biggie despite them choosing to watch my vents, express discomfort in being my friend, and ghost me after slowly dropping communication prior to all of that once I started exploring conversation topics outside of their characters and projects? Yeah, okay.

How stupid do they think I am? People don't just get the urge to talk to someone who they haven't even said a word to in months because they were in a silly goofy mood, because now it’s all ""BRO I MISSED YOU SO MUCH"" when you don’t have anyone else to talk to. Like, I’m lonely as hell, yeah, but I’d rather stay lonely than be in such a shallow friendship because you got bored and I was the only one left to talk to.

I’m sick of being people’s Plan B and I’m even sicker of them acting like I’m too dumb to see through it.

Im 17 and i think ive been having on and off depressive episodes since i was like 12 i think - mainly due to a likely case of autism (im waiting for an assesment) and general social awkwardness which makes me really alone. I feel like i can make acquaintances and i can talk, but none of my friendships really last once we stop being in the same place regularly. The more this pattern repeats the more i think im not just not made for friendship, i feel like trying to get one out of me is wasted effort because i just cant sustain them even though i try. 

I guess there isnt much anyone can do, im just looking for shared experiences. I have one very good friend IRL who says i connect better than i think i do, but i doubt that because i dont feel the human connection on my end. Like, i genuinely dont feel an empathetic link between me and others. They're alien to me.

Im very insecure of my voice so when I joined theyre party chat my heart was already racing due to another person being in the chat. I messaged him through discord saying my mic wasn't working and I had to go help my dad with something (both lies). I later unfriended him and deleted discord. My ""friends in school"" havent said a single word to me after my summer break started. I thought everything was fine until now. Making friends and shit in school, but now that im on break, Im basically all alone. I dont have any actual friends I can speak to outside of school and my life is miserable. I wake up, eat shit sleep and repeat. I dont do anything other than that and gaming and mindlessly scrolling on through Youtube. I been having some bad thoughts lately too. You know, killing myself. Although thats never going to happen, because im too pussy to actually go through with it. The only thing keeping me from ending my life are my parents. I love them to death, but I still feel like I cant talk to them either. I keep lying to myself every fucking day by saying shit like ""Im gonna stop watching porn"" ""Im gonna eat less"" ""Im gonna start exercising and going outside"". All lies I keep telling myself. This keeps happening to me. One day I feel alright like everythings going to be fine, and the next im thinking about killing myself. I think I need help. I dont think I have any social anxiety or depression or anything though, altough recently im starting to doubt it. Times like this keep happening to me more often, its like im going insane with absolutely zero human Interaction at all. Is there even a point in life anymore?

Which was fine, but they made a huge deal out of it, and the worst part for me was not even being coupled up or not itself, but seeing all the loved ones at my table that I was having pleasant conversations with blend into the crowd and walk away, and I couldn't really join them since I didn't want to wedge my way in or anything. Just didn't feel right.

I just kind of sat there awkwardly and tried to be mature and keep a smile on my face. When I looked around, there were almost no other people at their tables. The dance floor was full. It made my heart ache. I dunno. I'm the only one of my siblings who has never been in a relationship, and one of the only ones of my friends. So sometimes I figure this bad luck/what I haven't worked on enough was just a super lethal combo. On the bright side, my little sister pulled me onto the floor eventually and danced with me. I still don't think she realizes how grateful I am for that.

I can't bring myself to talk about this with anyone because I don't want them to feel bad. I wonder if anyone's had similar feelings, even if the situation wasn't the same. Hope you're doing okay today.",2022-07-01 22:18:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592286118,3,/r/lonely/comments/vpclw8/when_life_gives_you_singleperson_lemons/,,0,0,When Life Gives You Single-Person Lemons

167,vpe2yi,Charming_Oven,"I'm in London this week doing some travel (I'm American) and I ended up going to the Adele show tonight in Hyde Park.  


I'm a pretty extroverted person and I have no problems striking up conversations with random people. I ended up meeting this group of 8 people and they were really fantastic (at first). They were hugging me, making me feel super welcome, and just generally being nice people. It was really nice and fun.  


The closer it got to the show, I noticed they started shunning me. Small things like they were cheers-ing each other with drinks (which I was doing with them earlier) and then they just kind of ignored me.    I feel pretty socially self-aware and I don't think anything was said or done that would have turned them off to me.  


The loneliness really hit at some point (probably thanks to Adele's songs as well) and I just became a shell of who I am at my best. I will add that I've recently started taking Vyvanse (a stimulant) which helps a lot in my life, but as the day comes to an end I often feel worse. I recognize this and try to take steps to mitigate that. Rather than being in the moment with people, giving love and receiving their love, I became isolated and sad.  


I think what is most lonely is I genuinely know that I'm a great guy. I'm caring, loyal, strong, and funny. And yet, I often just experience the world by myself without anyone to share it with. And I don't really mean a partner, but friendships that really go deep and mean something.   


I used to live in a shared community living situation for about 5 years. I've done a lot of things in my life to foster community and help it grow. And I continue to try and do that, but honestly, I rarely receive friendship back.  


I hope you all have some type of positive, deep connection this weekend.",2022-07-01 23:29:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607401078,2,/r/lonely/comments/vpe2yi/lonely_in_a_sea_of_people_at_a_concert/,,0,0,Lonely in a sea of people at a concert

I hear the voices of my peers calling me a coomer or something, saying it’s unhealthy to focus so much on sex. And fine, yeah, I totally agree it’s unhealthy. But we were hardwired biologically to do so. The only evolutionary goal of any species is to reproduce. For us, that means having sex. It’s our second most basic urge, aside from the will to survive. Isn’t it obvious that not having that biological need met would cause issues?

Again, I feel silly writing this because of the conditioning, but it fucks with my head so much. So much of my life would be better instantly if I could get this stupid urge out of my head. In a word, it makes me feel worthless. But the only way to get the urge to go away is to meet it, and that’s just impossible. Due in large part to how fucked up my mind is because of never having the need met.

189,vpgrqq,vlewis97,"24F for context. I’m crying as I’m typing this so please forgive any grammatical errors. 

I’ve had a rough couple of years, especially this last year. Adjusting to adulthood after college has been difficult. I’ve spent more time alone in the last 1-1.5 years than probably all my prior years combined. I was okay with it at first. I am an only child so being alone isn’t completely out of the ordinary for me. But the last years have hit me like a train. Between most friends getting in serious relationships, married, or having babies, I feel completely left behind. I don’t have too many friends in the city I moved to, and I’ve fallen out of touch with most of my college friends. I haven’t been on a date since last year, so I’ve been alone in a dating context for a little while, which also upsets me. I wish it didn’t. I know a relationship isn’t the key to happiness, but I feel like my heartbreaks ever time I see a happy couple in public. I hate dating, hook up culture, and I would give anything to have a healthy and loving relationship with someone I felt safe with. I know I shouldn’t put romantic relationships on a pedestal like that, but I feel so intrinsically pulled to be with someone. I just feel like that’s natural? I miss and crave intimacy with someone so much and every day I just feel like I ache to be held by someone again. It feels like it’s been so long since I’ve kissed someone. And it’s turned me bitter. I struggle so much to be happy for others. I’m doing as much as I can to try to better myself. I’m going to therapy to work on myself, trying to make career moves, and volunteer on the weekends I don’t have alot going on. But I just feel so empty still the inside. None of it replaces intimacy from a significant other or a strong social circle. I’m tired of grocery shopping alone, eating alone, going to the park alone, sleeping alone. But most advice towards single women my age is to embrace independence and “live your best life.” To work on your career. And I’m trying to ..I feel like I’m an ambitious person. But that also isn’t giving me satisfaction right now.But I don’t know how much more I can embrace it. I pretty much do everything for myself, I cook and take care of myself and some weekends I spend Friday to Monday alone. Making friends as an adult is just so hard. I just so emotionally tired and broken. I wish I was wasn’t myself.  I want to see the good in this chapter and not waste my time, but I’ve been so lonely and depressed for what feels like so long. I miss feeling carefree and having fun, and I crave being able to love someone so badly. I’m tired of feeling like a miserable shell of a person at 24. I feel even more pathetic writing this shit on the internet.

i have somewhat diagnosed adhd (weird story, i love mental healthcare) and i get obsessive interests for various periods of time. i started stranger things after seeing some stuff about eddie munson’s character. i’m only on season 3, but i got the spoiler that eddie dies and i’m really fucking torn up about it. that sounds really dumb, but i don’t think it’s normal to have the kind of reaction im having to this- the death of a character i haven’t even seen properly. finding out is genuinely making me feel so hopeless. like so nauseous i can’t eat. maybe it’s just the topping on a pile of things wrong and that’s why it’s hitting so hard, but i feel so much genuine grief and sadness.

i feel gross. i don’t even know what to do with myself. my life is so boring. all i’ve done all summer is work, my friendships have become so stunted the only time i did manage to hang out with someone it was so awkward. i just feel like im rotting away at home. i use media to cope and had been using stranger things as my big source of happiness- it’s like the only thing really making me happy has been ripped from me and im just. fucking awful.

It would have been our 5 year anniversary of dating. We had a normal conversation just talking about where we were in our lives, and in that moment I realized I haven't moved on from her what so ever. She was my first and only girlfriend. She was my whole world for 3 years. However, we had lots of ups and downs. Lots of arguments about stupid higschool stuff. Long story short we broke up because of covid and we couldn't ever see each other which caused more fights. She was very insecure and controlling during the relationship.

But tonight I (very stupidity) went through snapchat and re-read damn near our whole history as boyfriend and girlfriend. It was heart breaking looking at all the good we had together... and realizing how easily the bad could have been fixed. I realize that I'm young and I have lots of life to live but I think I'm still in love with her and don't know what to do about it.

I can't really try to fix anything with her because she has a boyfriend now and I've recently joined the military, so I moved to the other side of the country. I haven't had any real companionships with anyone sinse we broke up and feel extremely lonely all the time. I fear that I'm never going to get over her and die alone. It's very irrational, I know.

Unique approaches are nice, asking how you are over and over again really doesn't do it for me. I need conversations and connections, shared thoughts, feelings, insight, and most importantly matching my effort and questions and engagement.

People say they want to get to know someone but then get discouraged by questions and the process. I can't be into someone if they're just presenting or pretending to be someone I want, the truth comes out sooner or later.

Who am I? Snoop dogggy dooooggggg (if you know you know), who doesn't love Snoop?

I'm on the west coast (PST) Vancouver BC Canada, what's that aboot? Chillin in my igloo with my wolverine and penguin crew. 37 M, married, kids, and mostly available. We all have our lives and interests and things we do, but I don't leave anyone hanging or gaps of silence between messages.

I like jokes, I'm full of sarcasm, lack bullshit, have emotions and feelings, know who I am and what I want, but don't know if my match is out there, at least not locally. I prefer to find someone local, but online would work if the vibe, flow, and conversation is a breeze.

I love food, binge watching shows, sports, technology, keeping current in events and news. Not big on politics.

I work fulltime, not a big partier or social event attendee, but I enjoy BBQs, dinners, attending certain events ... for the food and weed, not usually the conversation but hey, you never know unless you go right?

Very occasional drinker, but love my weed and dabs.

I trusted you. Or I at least WANTED to believe you..believe I was the one you wanted , believe I was enough. 
We never had a true relationship. I laid in bed all day and night at times because I was so stressed and depressed from working my ass off to make sure u didn't have to feel pressure. To make us both happy I thought.

But u left every chance u got. 
Was i not good enough? 
Was I not sexy enough?
Was I just like ex where I didn't sleep with you  enough. . .

There's no question in my mind that we were not right for eachother, but I would have changed myself to fit you. To be right for you and that's the problem. 
I should never have thought that was an option.

You're snoring right now, the lava lamp is giving u a pinkish aura. Ur hair is curling around the light. You're using the  blanket that we've had since the first apartment. 

I hope I never forget the last moments I spent with you... as my husband...

I hope I can keep myself from falling apart in the courthouse..
I'm a mess....
I keep crying.

Fuck.
It's so hard.
It hurts so badly.
Devastating.

I still see the look on your eyes when u lie to me.
You're always going to lie to me.
You lied to me earlier tonight
 And I saw the lie in ur eyes.
Like I usually do..
I recognize it now.
The guilt in ur eyes and face.

There's nothing to be guilty for my love.
It's over now. 💔 

Im broken.
My spirit is broken.
My heart is broken.
I'm a shell.
All I feel is pain.
I'm miserable 
I can't even breath.
It hurts  
Ans you're laying next to me, snoring.
Peaceful
You've always been peaceful 

I know you're going to miss me one day.
And its going to be too late.
And im going to find a man who loves me and makes me feel valued and validated.
And you're going to reach out and see my happiness and know you made the right decision to leave and stay gone.

The best thing you have ever done for me was to not come back when I begged you to.
I will always love you. You will always be my husband.  Idk if I'll ever have another one..but you will always be him. In my heart. 
I'm broken

248,vpsb6q,CherryBlossom889,"I’m 33, I’ve been single for over a decade now, I have several chronic illnesses and because of that, I still live with my parents and siblings (I can only work part time so I can’t afford to live by myself). I am super lonely. All my siblings have their partners and I’m the only single one. I don’t get noticed, men barely look at me much less approach me. I’m kinna tall and chunky (5”9 98kg) so maybe that’s why. And I don’t have a great body shape (saggy boobs, belly and no bum). Plus with my illnesses, what guy is going to want to enter a relationship with me? Knowing that they’ll have to help me for the rest of my life? (Help me with food, cleaning, financially). I just don’t see it happening. I don’t use dating apps cos I can’t sell myself, I’m not a good product and I don’t want to lie. 
I just don’t see the point in me being here. I literally cannot live by myself, I have to always ask for help. But eventually I won’t have my younger siblings around me daily or my parents (they’re divorcing and selling the house) so what do I do? The only option I can think of is killing myself. I don’t want to be here by myself. I don’t have many close friendships or people that live local to me. I don’t drive anymore so I can’t travel very often cos of the pain. So I’m isolated from people in real life. I don’t meet new people or socialise often. I just want someone who cares about me. Someone who prioritises me, someone who treats me like a woman. I just want in real life connections, and not digital everything. So where will I find this unicorn of a man that’ll be willing to put up with me? How long do I stay unhappy for, just waiting and hoping?

264,vpvqsd,Worldly_Practice_556,"last year was not a good year for me in terms of love and commitment. it hurt a lot. and i like to think it doesn’t but it does everyday. i’ve tried over and over to love someone and i do, but something happens. and they leave. and it sucks. i’ve gotten to a point where i think it must be something about me. 

but, the past few days i’ve noticed i miss loving someone and being loved. but my brain won’t let me feel that. the more i love towards that idea the farther i’m pulled away. i snap back immediately.
i was talking to this guy for a month or so and we had a very deep conversation, i was vulnerable which i have a strict rule against. and i got the ick. he said he cared about me and i felt physically ill. i don’t like it when people care about me or love. i don’t know if it’s because i think i don’t deserve it or a trauma response or whatever. i have such a wall around me all the time. even with family. i voluntarily seclude myself from affection and love and care because i’m so immensely scared of being hurt. i’ve been hurt so much. and i don’t want to be a victim. but fuck, im hurting. i feel lonely. i like doing drugs because i feel love for people and i accept love for myself. and it’s the only time i do. (i don’t do them nearly as much as i used to but still). i want a hug but i don’t. 

conclusion: i feel physically and mentally ill by the idea or prospect or presentation of love, care, affection, commitment. 

i think i’m just hurting more then i care to think or admit. 

thanks for reading, i think i needed to rant. if anyone has ever felt or is feeling anything similar, im sorry. i guess, in this aspect, you’re not alone. we understand each other. &lt;3

265,vpvsnf,Own-Fig-9874,"I am well aware enough of the fact that the problem was on me. But I feel like I just need an outlet to release these complicated emotions. I’ve been jobless for more than three years. And the whole job seeking process really took a toll on my health physically and mentally. I have been trying to avoid hanging out with a good friend, who happens to be also the only one that I have, but in a passive way. Like I‘ve been secretly avoiding those get-togathers that we had on a regeular, which means I wouldn’t initiate the interaction. Because I feel like I am in a really bad place right now energy wise. I am just simply not in the right place to be around her too much at this point of my life. She has achieved so much and I am still living with my father. I feel that we are not equal. But it’s anything but personal, it’s not about her at all, it’s me being self-conscious. But when she invites me to hang out I also find that I don’t want to turn it down. I still want to seem normal. 

And this evening we went to play squash and had dinner afterward. On the way home we ran into an Aesop boutique, the fancy hair care/skin care/fragrance brand which we both really love. She wanted to stop by it and buy some body wash. I was glad about this spontaneous stopover. But as the staffer patiently and kindly serving my friend, the joy out of the love for the brand and the excitement about a possible nice ‘’plus one’’ shopping experience gradually faded. Instead I started feeling uncomfortable and panicking despite a wonderful presentation on the deliciously upscale aromatic profile of a hand cream, which seems to be the most stylish way to get manually moisturized in the chic of the moment, elaborately packaged in an exquisitely small volume delivered by the sleek yet unobtrusive staffer. My brain started going crazy and wild, thinking every parts of my body must now be shouting loser. The entire universe was yelling at me “You can’t afford this. You are asking your father for money every month and you are freaking 29 years old. Cedar? Geranium? Vetiver? That’s funny. How about incompetency and patheticness? Please, look at yourself now, can you embarrass yourself more?” In the midst of all this, I still wanted to appear cool and casual. The indifference would only further showcase how hopeless and vulnerable and what a baby I was, which was annoying, as if I was not depressing enough. Particularly in this setting, I didn’t want to make my friend feel like she couldn’t be who she is just because I was struggling. And I also didn’t want to be rude to the staff’s hospitality. So I stood beside my friend, agitated inside, and listened, with the last hint of elegance left, plastic as it was, to their exchange for most of the time.

I know it was ALL IN MY HEAD. I know I made everything about me and everything I just said was hilarious. It wasn’t really the end of the world. I still got a place to live and wasn’t skipping any meals(even though I wasn’t paying for anything). But it felt so real. After we parted ways, feeling no less overwhelmed, all I was telling myself was to distract myself from all this. But I simply couldn’t. If I didn’t let them out, I knew I would absolutely be all night up for this tossing and turning. I knew somehow I need to do something. Just when I anxiously swiping right and left on my phone screen, I found this app I had downloaded some days earlier for the sake of learning real colloquial English. The idea of expressing my feeling and making it online popped into my head. And here I was typing first on my phone and now on my computer. Guilty as charged, I admit I am pity seeking. But anyway I feel so much better now. And for that I say thank you.

My IRL is always bad, no friends. I am shy and can't even reach out to most people. It's just scares me away to think. The only socialization I have is, when I go to the work. I work at a food joint, so I have to talk every single time. But seriously, that's not even a TALK. 

My school mates don't pic up call that often. College ones don't want to socialize and work mates, they are quite good. But not really as close. 

The only ray in my life, currently, is the guy, I am dating. He is probably everything I was looking for and I am grateful to God, I got someone. Hoping we go good. 

All i wanna say is, things take time, they fall apart. But, there is someone. There will be someone, who will make it feel right. Trust the process, and when you do meet you guy/girl. Don't ever let them go, at any cost. Prioritizing is must.

303,vq0nyq,RavingAnarchy,"This is not a healthy post, I'm not healthy.

I need help.

I am slowly going crazy, why? The love of my life left me 2 and a half months ago, we agreed to end the relationship and i agreed to let her go. Because we were both too far apart from each other to make things work for longer than the year we were together. But my heart doesn't feel that way, i still love her, everything, the whole shebang. And letting her go while i still love her doesn't work.

Worst part, she's with someone else now. My mind is broken, my heart is broken even though she didn't do this to me, it wasn't her intention, what's worse is that i can't hate her for it, i don't feel angry, i understand why she went and found somebody else, now she's feeling happy. And here i am in a coma. I have gone through the worst thoughts possible, my heart has broken in all the most shameful and degrading ways possible (Queue having a nightmare about her getting fucked by someone else), I feel like I'm scum.


I've been on antidepressants for weeks, going to a psychologist and everything, and I can't stop breaking down, nothing makes me happy, nothing helps me get out of my own negativity, I've got suicidal thoughts every so often when I'm at my lowest points, i can't get over this hurdle. My mind was too young I'm just 20 years old, never experienced love before. I feel like an incel, like I'm the lowest human there is, i don't feel like i deserve anything. I don't want anything, I hate myself and brought myself down on my own. Not her bringing me down, but myself.

And I'm going insane, i can't grip my own persona, i can't find him. All that happens is that i close my eyes and feel pain, excruciating pain. I twist around my bed and want to rip my own eyes out in anger, and after that I just want to pass away. Why can't I die and come back 10 years later when this is through.

My health is decaying as well, I've been sick for days now. My depression is pretty much breaking down every single piece of my being and I've questioned everything in my life up to this point. I've had one moment of clarity where i decided i wasn't gonna feel bad about this anymore, where I'd try to be happy and do what i feel and what i want. But then it came, the thought, the cursed love I have within me. That I want her back, I hadn't done anything of what i wanted to do with her, I didn't even get to hug her, comfort her in person, kiss her, love her. I'm in Argentina, she's in Europe.

She's so far away from me, and all I want to do is close the distance, go to her and try getting her back for all my heart screams for is doing that. But then reality comes back, she's loving someone else, my chance is lost, I am lost. And here I am with my broken reality, with the single love i had breaking me in more pieces than i can put back together. Everything hurts, living here on this country hurts, knowing another man is doing everything my heart yearned to do with her hurts, feeling like i still love her even through all this pain hurts.

I'm crying while writing this, on the edge of puking and coughing out my throat because I'm sick. I didn't write to her a single thing about this, she's living life and i want her to be happy because i love her, but I am in the most disgusting place of my life, and when I'm feeling clearheaded and happy and motivated to do something, all i want to do is do my homework, get a job, save up and move to Europe to try getting her back someday if she's single again. I'm crippled, i can't let go, time isn't helping.

I'm going mad, and I'll never come back to the happiness i had before at this pace if I don't do something about it, so here's the most honest and brutally straight up post i could ever write, because I need help. I'm seeking help. For myself and for my future.

Big deal, people lose their love all the time, everybody gets a heartbreak, get over it you idiot. That's what I tell myself, but i can't. I'm going insane, I'm going insane, IM GOING INSANE.

I don't want this to keep going, i want this nightmare to end. I want to move on, or I want to feel happy and try living life to meet her again and love her once more. But right now all I'm doing is going through torment.",2022-07-02 20:39:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595997404,8,/r/lonely/comments/vq0nyq/im_going_insane/,,0,10,I'm going insane

315,vq1tyh,Fickle-Elevator-969,"My mind fucks me over real hard. I just think all the time, consciously and unconsciously, and it never stops. Be it deep subjects and thoughts or random things that come up im always stuck in a never ending flow of reflection.

On one hand im pretty intelligent when it comes to problem solving or analyzing situations and behaviours. On the other, I have a hard time with memorizing stuff and I am lost as to how to behave with others.

I have a good amount of friends cos im a kind dude, I find it really hard to keep track of those who are far away so they think ive forgotten them.

Never had a relationship (20M) because my overthinking generally stops me in my steps even though I do have a good amount of options. So I just end up alone because i shoot myself in the foot.

Being with people drains me so much because I see and notice every small behaviours and attitudes from everyone around me and always try to act on them accordingly.
What comes from this after is that people that don't know me see me as either grumpy/mean and pretentious, because I don't know how to act with people that are other than friends (e.g. collegues or crushes, even family members that i don't see often)

Finding a career for me is a maze because if there is no deeper purpose and meaning to either me or others in the work I do, I end up coming home unhappy and unfullfilled. 
I tried biology, but the system in france values memorization and learning off by heart rather than problem solving and practical application (in other words i shred in group and solo projects with a practical application and a context but I am very mediocre in spitting out the 80 page course Im asked to learn off by heart). So my diploma isn't worth much because my grades aren't that high ( im in the top 30% relative to the other students)

Im kinda lost. Don't know how to deal with this

324,vq2tvj,RiskJunior2021,"I’ve been in an incredibly toxic relationship with someone I know for a fact is a narcissist. It’s taken a huge toll on my mental health for the last two years, and it finally boiled to the point of her hitting me, then calling the cops on me for dv. I’m facing 2nd degree assault and 3rd degree assault, which holds up to 6 years in prison. There is a lack of evidence to persecute the 2nd degree assault. The 3rd degree assault is written where if you accident hurt someone your still guilty. (I threw an empty water bottle and it bounced off a wall and hit her)
I am still in love with her for some reason. For some odd reason I can’t detach myself from wanting her in my life as my partner. We’re going through this divorce and she is toying with me telling me she wants me in her life, but then goes on reminding me about how I’m the biggest piece of shit she’s ever met. I can’t ever seem to get a positive response from her, but here a last I still got some stupid reason love her. 

It may be that we have a child and have another on the way, or that I go back to my childhood trauma because it’s the only love I know, but I can’t shake it. I totally wish I could. 

I feel completely alone right now. No seeing my family, and that results in me isolating and not seeing my friends.

364,vq7zil,Tough_Representative,"Hi. So yeah, here's some background. I've always been rather shy and timid and have had trouble making friends. Never had a GF or went on a date, never went to prom, no parties with friends. I don't even have a high school yearbook photo because I didn't care enough. I've also moved a couple of times as a kid forcing me to start all over again which was just double whammy. 

Now being 24 years old, I must say I have been slowly but surely coming out of my shell over the years and have been making progress in terms of loving who I am and interacting with people better on a social level in large part because my job forces me to do so. I've been getting bolder in conversations and dressing sharper as well due to the confidence boost and feel great.

A new change I've made now is simply starting to wear my glasses. I've had these prescription glasses since freshman year of high school but I've never got into the habit of wearing them in part due because I was self-conscious about how the glasses would make me look and on top of already being the quiet kid, I felt like I'd really then be a walking stereotype.  So I didn't wear them. But now that I'm getting used to them, the world never seemed so clear and I dig the way I look in them too. 

As I think back to me being that scared lonely boy in high school, there is one instance that I'll NEVER forget that has stuck with me over the years. I was late to lunch one day in the beginning of the school year. New town, new school. Didn't know anybody. Was absolutely terrified. I sat at the nearest table all alone and 4-5 tables away from me, there was a group of upperclassesmen who were looking at me. They then started to comment on me, laughing and mocking me at the fact that I was alone, watching my every move as I pretended not to hear them or that I wasn't bothered. That HURT. I can't even begin to describe how humiliated I felt. There were other instances but this was the worst.

I've moved on since then but I honestly still tear up thinking back to that moment and reliving it. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's made me stronger overall as a person and would absolutely NOT tolerate that kind of nonsense today. I wish I could go back in time and have done things differently and talk to myself and give advice. I can't do that. All I can do is continue to self improve and look forward to the future and see where life takes me. But the thing I'm most proud of right now is that I can actually say I'm happy to be me.",2022-07-03 03:09:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1552024057,5,/r/lonely/comments/vq7zil/ive_been_pretty_much_lonely_all_my_life_and_i/,,0,1,I've been pretty much lonely all my life and I have been doing some self-reflection lately and want to get some things off my chest and talk to somebody.

2. Stand outside at night and just breathe and take in the city. (Also works in the country)

3. Practice talking with as many people as I can find. I think sometimes when we’re out of practice engaging with people, it can make us bad AT engaging with people, and that negative feedback loop can make it easy to crawl back into your shell. So I figure it’s gonna be hard before it gets easy, and just try to embrace the hard parts.

376,vq987r,alrose46,"This is a problem that no one around me can relate to and I'm tired of no one understanding. I'm only 21f (almost 22) and I have severe asthma. It started getting really bad last December and it has not let up since. Every day is hard and I can barely move without feeling out of breath and I must bring my rescue meds wherever I go. I've always been an introverted/shy person and never really got out much but now I want to. I just graduated college and I now have the time to actually have a life. But I can't. I can not even hold down a job right now I'm so sick.

The thing is though, is that right as these symptoms got severe I got my first ever boyfriend. And every time I saw him I felt like absolute shit and I even had an asthma attack while he was driving me home once. He seemed freaked out by it tbh and seemed bumped when he dropped me off. Well, after almost 4 months he dumped me in a kind of harsh way and I partially blame my sickness for him leaving. Who wants to date someone who is sick all the time? The end of that relationship absolutely crushed me. Not only was I crazy about him, but I also got a taste of what I was missing for the first time in my life. I was not expecting to be in a relationship anytime soon until we met and then he asked me to ne his gf and only months after he ended it after lying about his feelings. Now I long so badly to be in another relationship that it's eating away at me so badly, every day. 

I have been saying yes to every social thing I get invited to even though I feel like garbage. Parties, hanging out, I even went to a wedding for people I did not even know (my cousin knew them and I was her friend's plus 1). I even had a guy ask for my number once but the second I told him I don't casually date, he stopped talking to me. Every time I go out I have an asthma attack. My one older cousin is like,""Go out!

Basically,  I want to go out and meet new people to fill the void and hurt from my last relationship but my asthma is keeping me isolated and sad. That relationship also fucked with myself confidence so bad, I'll never date anyone who was attractive as he was again. He was also really nice (or iI thought he was???) and I liked his personality. He was a 10 and I'm like, a 7??? (Maybe I'm just shallow) I can not fight this insane longing that I have for him. I'll never see him again. He's all I can think about. I need someone new but I can't get someone. I need someone to hold me. I have supportive people in my life but I feel like I need a partner.

I've always enjoyed my own company. always have. then again though, i am all i ever had. i can't recall one single time either one of my parents ever asking me how i was. how my day was. or school. our interactions was chores i had to do or more beers and liquor to hand them. not saying my childhood was bad. i was just... nobody special. my brothers were special. when my step sister would visit, she was special. i... was around. so everything i did was just me. i played alone, when i got older, i ate dinner alone. i had no supervision really. my teen years were great. ppl came to my house to party. i had friends because it was the party house. all of my friends (even the one person who i called my *best friend*) were pretty much superficial. nobody really bothered getting personal and deep with me, and i never volunteered to speak. my entire life has been built on superficial relationships. all of which I've made only because they were beneficial. nobody really knows the *real* me. the inside me. the person who has full conversations with characters in my head. the one who closes their eyes and can transport to another place. the imagination i have. the feeling i get from hearing certain songs. how my fingers tremble when i touch a tree because i can feel life. the one who talks to their Creator like he/she is there, beside me. never have i opened up. i like my cocoon. i love my company. i love knowing at the end of the day my only responsibility was/is making sure ME and ME ALONE has been fulfilled that day. i am responsible for only myself. which is why I've never cared if ppl liked me, or talked shit about me. I've never cared if ppl understood me.

408,vqcqyn,sadnesstakesover,"July 3rd, 2022 - 2:18AM 

I think I'm kind of over being single. I want to find someone who will love me for me.. Someone who will show me that real love actually exists. The kind where we can sing and dance together in the middle of night. Laugh at stupid jokes while cooking with eachother. I want to fall head over heels for someone who can show me new things. Add to my life instead of just staying stuck where I'm at. I miss the days when I could cuddle and feel loved. Not so much a chore. I love the men I have in my life now but I've realized none of them really make me happy. I want someone to spin my head around with excitement and passion. I miss being able to say ""I love you"". And then ""I can't wait to see you"". I miss everything about missing someone but knowing you'll see them after work. 


I'm getting sad again. I'm falling into a darker state of mind. I'm searching for love in the wrong places. The 2 am ""what are you doing?"", ""come over."", ""let's party"" 's are getting old and boring. It's bringing me down. Bad. I so badly want someone to want me equally. I want someone to think about me and buy me flowers or bring home my favorite snack. I want someone… to love. 


I've been feeling alive when I'm drunk and not caring about anything. No responsibility, free feeling. I'm falling in love with that. But deep down I know it's not love. It's chaos and destruction. It's tearing me down. It's making me sad. But I can't quit. I can't say no. I have the fear that my soulmate will pass by.. thinking it's the 2 am drunk guy telling me to come over. But it's not. I do this stuff because I'm not happy with my home life anymore. I'm missing something so important. Love. 


My drunk nights have been getting out of hand. I've been liking the feeling of being numb. I don't want to be numb anymore. I want to love and feel passionate towards someone. I want them to want me back..

I want the lunch date at 1pm. And the movie. The walk on the beach while the kids run alongside us. I want the hand holding and the forehead kisses. I want the slow and tender kisses… And love making. Not just fucking. But also I want the excitement of our sexual life to be something we prioritize. I want the being able to communicate with each other and work through problems. I want the make up sex after we fight. I want all of it. Again.

I guess I wasn't really good at making friends but I surrounded myself with good people. But most turned to a different road and others just left. I'm still lonely, no friends never had a girlfriend and i'm graduating. and it's not like I'm a bad person, I tend to help people out a lot and usually don't think of myself, instead I tactically use my brain to be as friendly as possible and interpret what kind of person someone is by the way they talk and how attentive they are to their surroundings. Usually when i meet someone I observe how they react to a tall black kid who looks like an adult approach them and say hi with his hands in his pockets looking down at the ground and usually at them.

In fact i look the opposite of what I actually am, i'm soft don't like sports and love writing and playing a violin. I really hate how douces and assholes can get tons of friends a girlfriend a life and yet the first thing someone sees when they look at me they assume that i'm unfriendly because i have trouble communicating and look intimidating because I just wanna die.

I just feel like a burden to others, family and the small amount of ""friends"" that I have. they only know me from the school and other than that they don't talk to me at all and the one who did I felt like I didn't deserve. so I told her that ontop of I can't be your friend anymore. it was harsh but i felt bad after like four days. so I message her and apologize over and over through the next four days and lone and behold she had me blocked and refuses to talk to me. and i quote ""...just stop"" which I did after respectfully saying have a good day. this is the ultimate fuck you on the you fucked your life by existing cake.

425,vqg93h,Ink-Dipped_Keys,"When he wants to be alone,
But in search for community
When old friends were chosen poorly
And new ones stay in their own walls
The lonely man doesn’t feel lonely
He just feels disconnected 
When he cares for a life he doesn’t live
And indifferent to the past groups he’s joined
Is he running backwards?
This connection is coined
Sealed only by motive
Mozart didn’t fill those halls
Without each note forming
When a commune calls
It’ll be one friend calling 
for me

Self Reminder:
Put value in everyone. At work, at home, online. Show the world who you are. Be proud of it, or you won’t attract the right people. Dress how you feel, connect when you feel.

Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

439,vqjgcl,United-Reporter7757,"Adulting life depressing for me.

1. career: I am not really passionate about my career but it pays the bills. Awhile back after working crappy jobs I decided to go back to school and chose practicality over interests. So here I am now. I think I dislike the idea of working. The job is tolerable just a means to an end for me. I think one thing that has killed me is work schedule. I have a crappy schedule like I work from 11pm to 730 AM on nights 4 or 5 days a week. I been doing that for 3 years and I think that has negatively effected my mental health.

Working that schedule I felt like a zombie. Drag myself to work everyday. Lacking good quality sleep. I remember not seeing the sun for months. I would go home from work at 7am sleep until 12pm, workout, play some video games. Take a quick nap again before work. That has been my life for past 3 years lol. However I recently got hired at a different company where I will work 7pm to 7am 3 days a week so I will have more days off. It is still nights but way more days off so hopefully that will improve my mental health more. Working days is too stressful for me. I like working nights. I just don't like all the other things that come with it.

2) Lack of relationship and friends: Getting older in my 30s feel like its way harder to meet people and make real friends other than work. Past 3 years working nights I only met couple of friends here and there and its mainly through work. We don't really hang out cause most of them got families. I have had some short term relationships those past 3 years but nothing real solid more like flings. My work schedule and nights one reason why it didn't work out. I mainly just talk to my old friends through video chat. I got 2 friends I really talk to that's about it.

3) lack of goals: Lacking ambition. For me its like what now. I make okay money little over 100k. I don't really have any debt. Only goal right now would be to find a wife, have a house, have a kid. That sort of deal.

I am pretty sure a lot of people in the same rut. Any advice? I know my dad worked from 4am to 3pm 5 days a week, never missed a day off for 30 plus years, and never complained. I don't know how he did it.",2022-07-03 14:59:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647182711,8,/r/lonely/comments/vqjgcl/adulting_life_has_been_so_lonely_and_depressing/,,0,5,Adulting life has been so lonely and depressing.

443,vqk6rj,boopsandpoops,"I stopped caring about things for some time. I've been on different medications for 15 years and have been to numerous therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists.
I was once in an outpatient program for two weeks of my life years back.

Without going into too much detail, I've been through more s*** than many people have and more than many people will deal with in this lifetime. Professionals have even said the same.
My anxiety and depression has gotten so bad now, No strategy or medication or physical activity has helped alleviate it.
I used to want someone to be a partner with me and love me for who I am unconditionally with flaws and all but I am married to the wrong person and we have a family now and too much encompassing it all that its not as easy as a break up, it would be a bloodbath of a divorce. Believe it or not, I married out of depression a long time ago.

This year I have finally accepted that I will probably never have the love I so desired because for some reason I just wasn't meant to have a partner that treated me with true human love and decency. I gave up on that idea and haven't been dwelling on it because the stress of so many other things in my life has taken that space over.

I also often think about how good it would feel to leave this life and daydream about ways to off myself. Mentally, I think about the mechanics of how to hang myself, and other types of suicide methods. 

For some reason I believe in reincarnation but I don't want to come back here if given the chance. I hate this world so much. I was once a religious person but came to the age of reason and realized how much it was bullshit and how it had this power over my life that in fact caused me to make permanent regrettable decisions that would have otherwise saved me from many years of headache.

I no longer care when someone tells me about anything sad in their life because 99.9% of their stuff is utter narcissistic 1st world problems and I just want to yell at them for how blind they are to the real problems people have.

So long story short, I'm lonely. I'm lonely in many ways, in many areas. It's not something I wanted, but I've just had to accept it and move on because it's not doing anything for me to think about it.
I would once sit in my feelings and every now and then I'd cry it out at night. But that didn't help me.",2022-07-03 15:34:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1573745129,5,/r/lonely/comments/vqk6rj/i_stopped_caring/,,0,1,I stopped caring

447,vqkcrh,AstronomerOne91,"Last year I moved from NY to Seattle for a career change. I'm lucky that my girlfriend came with me, I'm grateful to have her by my side and she's a great person. That being said, I have several lifelong friends who just disappeared the moment I moved away, and the lack of any meaningful friendships has me feeling really lonely right now.

The weird part to me is before I moved I didn't see my friends very often anyway because of covid, but we still played games online all the time. For some reason, me moving was reason enough to just be booted out of the rotation from every game, I see them playing all the time without me. After inviting myself a few times (among other efforts to keep in touch) and realizing nobody will ever initiate the invite to me, I realized nobody actually gives a shit about maintaining a friendship with me. 

I literally had to delete them off my friends list on Steam/EGS because it upsets me too much to be reminded every day how a simple change in proximity is excuse enough to drop someone from your life entirely. Nobody messages me, nobody checks in with me. Nobody made any effort to hang out with me when I visited my family back home, despite me reaching out.

The sad part to me is I made a few new friends last year at my new job that I hung out with a few times, and now that I moved on to a remote role everyone is quickly trickling out too. It really is human nature ""out of sight, out of mind"" but I thought I could have some form of a genuine friendship that doesn't rely on me being conveniently close-in-proximity.

Anyway, here I am, 30 years old, working remotely, across the country from just about everyone I know. I don't really get any opportunities to make new friends at this age being out of school and working remotely. I'm going to have to proactively do something if I ever want this to change.

Thanks for reading this if you did, I'm overall in a good place in life besides this, but sometimes it's easy to let stuff like this get to me. I just miss being younger and having friends that just hang out every day because it's what we do. We didn't need an elaborate plan, or to have a cooldown time of 2 months. I understand we all have our own lives now, and that's how it is getting older, but I feel like it's not a good enough excuse to just completely drop a lifelong friend.",2022-07-03 15:43:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,,27,/r/lonely/comments/vqkcrh/moving_across_the_country_showed_me_how/,,0,2,"Moving across the country showed me how ""friendship"" is a matter of convenience"

467,vqmmcg,gearsboxvti,"Yesterday the weather was good, hot and the breeze was warm, the kind of days where we feel faint and almost asleep (in the good sense). I thought to myself of instead of being in home looking outside and thinking about past lost summers in home, I went to the beach alone.

I go to the beach sometimes with public transportation, which takes some time but bearable. Normaly I spend 3h30m for the round trip. But yesterday I spent 5 hours in the round trip, just to stay 2h30m in the beach. I became exausted, specially waiting for the bus 1 hour standing, with lots of people annoyed and complaining, not to mention the lack of respect we get from other people, that got the nerve of passing the queue, and let others not get inside the bus because it become full.

I went with transportation because it is much cheaper than go with taxi or Uber, or even having a car. In this times with high inflation it is very important to save in a poor income country.

Instead of enjoying the beach, I became exausted and depressed. I was thinking to myself that not even ""the beach experience"" I can enjoy. For me ""the beach experience"" implies being very comfortable, having good food and good fresh soda, eating an ice cream and most important having company.

Instead of ""the beach experience"", I don't have better things to do than go see the sea, write in a paper, look at others and think I would be better at home and avoid the exausting trip. After a couple of hours I start to get annoying and boring of being by myself.

Yesterday I start thinking and writing, maybe I don't have a choice of enjoying the good things in life, like going to the beach, go to a nice restaurant, eating italian ice-cream in seafront of a coffee shop, have a pleasant walk in the sunset.Maybe I'm here just to be at home, to look at the window, or being in the computer pretending to learn programming, or doing things not related to leisure. Unfortunately I'm not a smart guy and hard working person, I'm slow thinker and not predisposed to thrive in growth hacking and and life hacking and all these buzzwords.

I'm tired of being alone and tired of having the effort and getting exausting in trying to enjoy life by myself.

I ask to myself wheter or not I'm losing time in going out by myself hanging in public transportation for nothing.

488,vqq0r1,icepick324,"This is a throwaway account. 

I have been on medication for major depressive disorder for two years now, around the same time I moved abroad to a foreign country. Integration for an introverted teenager like myself was almost impossible, especially due to the fact I am still not fluent in the local language. I have always been alright with being alone, accepting it as part of my experience so far, perhaps because I wasn't what people were looking for in a friend. 

School was tough for me; very few friends and I had a distinct impression of never fitting in or belonging to the already formed friend groups. I held my head my up whenever I could, but some people seem to be able to recognise when there is no one willing to stand up for you. 

I eventually sought out counselling, and after a particularly tough winter for my depression, everything seemed to begin looking better. Unfortunately, a series of circumstances led me to distance myself from my therapist just as I was getting through the last months of high school. 

Now, everything feels like it's back to what it used to be before I even started bothering about taking care of myself. The only two people who I sometimes hung around with are soon to leave the country due to university, and I am once again left to myself without therapy, acquaintances, very little family, and in a foreign country where people are hard to approach socially. Most of my nights are spent fantasising about making friends, being sociable and gathering a moderately sized group of friends with which to go out, drink, and have fun. 

One evening I went grocery shopping, and I came across a group of people about my age who were gathered around the alcoholic section to pick up beer together. They seemed to get along pretty well, and they obviously had a fun night ahead of them. The sight of something so simple yet unattainable that for so long has been dangled in front of my face led me to break down once I got home.

Sometimes I feel like giving up. I like the days on my own, between the gym and my bedroom for lack of any aspiration or motivation to make myself feel less terribly lonely.",2022-07-03 20:14:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/vqq0r1/just_when_i_thought_i_was_getting_better/,,0,0,Just when I thought I was getting better

My boyfriend a couple months ago was convinced that I was cheating on him (I wasn’t) and now he’s trying to act like it didn’t happen because he doesn’t want the relationship to end and he wants to just forget about it. But I can’t stop worrying about it and mentioning it to him either makes him upset or he starts telling me that he’s an awful human being and messes everything up. It makes me feel like I have to comfort him and push my hurt feelings to the side so I can make him feel better. He has many wonderful qualities and he is a good guy it’s just because he’s been cheated on before it makes him paranoid. I don’t want anyone thinking he’s some terrible guy because he is very nice to me. I just feel like he can have a tone with me that makes him seem angry or makes me feel like a complete idiot. Rn I’m dealing with really low self esteem and during covid I became 20 pounds overweight so overall I’m feeling very low. Currently I don’t have any friends except a girl I really liked that moved away and we are unable to talk often and my boyfriend. I tend to be a worrier and this is all putting me into a tissy.

Any advice on how to get out there and meet new people during summer break ? I’ve never felt this kind of loneliness and seclusion before and I’m not sure how to navigate these feelings, especially in a new and somewhat unfamiliar place.

576,vqy051,Kingkool72," 

So about a month ago this girl and I met on Snapchat and we lived close to each other, we flirted on Snapchat and calls for a while when I asked her to be my GF and she said yes. We met up in person twice and they were great. While talking with her on the phone so much I had thought that I knew her pretty well but I was wrong. Basically, over call, I had learned, that she was a shy 14 yo who was awkward in real life and the first time we met IRL she was really scared to talk to me and apologized in texts after the first meet-up. She apologized for a lot of things that didn't matter when she would text me sometimes she would say sorry for bothering me but I didn't know how to explain to her that I was awaiting her texts. Anyways it might seem silly because this relationship does not matter in the long run but at the moment it is a big thing to me, I want to get to the point of feeling indifferent and not like shit. So she started saying she loved me and stuff and we cuddled a bit the second time we met IRL and I thought it was going great. Then today at 6:00 she was texting me on Snapchat and I saw that she was typing for a long time, and in my head, I had thought that it could either be really good or really bad, and unfortunately it was the worst possible result, and extremely confusing I am so confused about her and feel like I do not know her nearly as well as I did. Basically, out of nowhere she just texted me that she wanted to be in a more 'toxic relationship' and she wanted a guy who was more of an 'asshole' and it was like a kink for her, and I was just like wtf. That was weird considering she was only 14, naturally, I was confused and asked her to elaborate and she said she wanted dirty talk and shit and I'm just shy and awkward in person and I couldn't get myself to do that. She said I was too innocent and she was too dirty and idk I thought she was the opposite of that type of person by talking with her, she seemed extremely sweet and this is definitely not expected. At first, I felt nothing and was just absolutely dumbfounded but rn I feel like absolute shit and its just overpowering rn. I feel like getting another girl will be so hard and that I just don't have game or confidence and I'm just back to square one back in the shit trying to start again. It feels like I just lost an entire months worth of progress which seems like a long time to me now. IK this seems ridiculous to adults who have experience but this was genuinely my first love and girl that has actually ever liked me back. Now I am just left lost and confused. What tf am I supposed to do, she was my first love and I have never felt anything like that before. Any advice, help, coping techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

TLDR: I'm 15 and got my first gf over Snapchat we talked for a month and met up in person twice and she seemed like a really shy girl and she suddenly broke up with me because she is more into ""friends with benefits"" and ""toxic relationships"" and ""asshole bfs"" Now I'm just left feeling empty and back to square one having to restart with some other person I don't even know.

I watch my fiance play online games with his buddies every day. They talk in discord and have so much fun. I'm happy he has that many people to play with and turn to...but I can't help but to feel lonely and jealous that he's able to make and have such friends. They spend hours playing games while I have no one. My only true friend doesn't play games and doesn't live close enough for me to hangout with them whenever we want. I try playing with my son and I try playing the games he plays but im often left out of the group bc I'm not in there discord so I can't join the voice chat. And when I play they just ignore me and do there own thing. Everytime I try to play I feel more and more alone. My own fiance chooses to play games with them for 8-10 hours everyday over spending anytime with me anymore. He tells me that I had my entire pregnancy to spend with him. That he now that he finally has a computer to play with his friends on he wants to play with them. I ask him to spend time with me and it doesn't happen. I beg him to do stuff only to be let down and having to spend my nights playing single player games or watching videos or playing with my son. I'm tired of being alone. I want friends. I want to have to ability to grind games like they do so I can play with him and actually have some fun. Maybe even make friends with his friends....

I guess I’m what some might call a people-pleaser or maybe even naive, but I honestly just find my joy and happiness in making other people happy. 

Lately, however, I’ve felt like I’ve had all of the hope, joy and happiness I once had sucked out of me and now all that’s left is an empty shell of who I strive to be and all of the terrifying and depressing emotions I’ve tried so hard over the last few years to make better. 

Nothing necessarily happened to trigger this feeling, but I find that I’m much more aware of lonely and alone I truly am. I’m always there for others but nobody is ever there for me.

I’ve had rough patches in my journey to better my mental health, but this somehow feels different. I don’t know how to explain it other than it feels empty, alone and scary. I don’t know what to.

593,vqzdxn,workingonitig,"I think the route cause of my loneliness is in my childhood. Im pretty sure I was neglected by my parents emotionally. I didnt get babysitters after the age of 6 because i had become so used to playing by myself despite having older siblings that they didnt even worry when i was left alone. My sister traumatized me and i'll never forgive her. I would try to show her my drawing only to be met with complete apathy and turned away. Whenever i played with my toys or club penguin or watched disney channel my sister would tell me that i couldnt do that in 5th grade or i couldnt do that in middle school or that i couldnt do that in high school. I never enjoyed my childhood because i was always being told to grow up. I dont even remember what my brother looked like before 18 because he spent all his time playong video games in his room. My parents didnt do family dinners, so i ate alone in my room. My dad worked a lot, i dont really fault him because he actually tried. But my mother is an alcoholic who drinks every day of the week. She is immature and lazy. She makes the house a disgusting mess and blames my dad for it. She would make me pay for my own birthday presents, or pay for my own school clothes at 11. She would tell everyone at a party my siblings private issues that we didnt want shared. I was never hugged and tucked in, my boundaries never respected, my emotions never understood. She never taught me life skills or social skills, most of what i learned came from my aunt. Its like she hasnt mentally aged since her time as an 80's cheerleader. 

I dont think i had any role models to help me learn how to healthily socialize. When i was kid i was pretty mean because of how my sister treated me and so i struggled to make friends. By the age of 12 i was apathetic and numb to the world from the emotional neglect by my mother. Ive had to learn empathy, i still struggle to be vulnerable and to feel my emotions as authentic. I got by high school telling myself that i would just make friends in college and now that im in college ive never struggled with loneliness more. Ive cried myself to sleep on several occasions. Listening to people talk i just dont understand how to get past aquaintances. How do relationships evolve to actually hanging out? And how do i stop oversharing to every person i do meet, it only scares people away.

595,vqzmxz,redsocialistpanda,"I'm a 29F from South America and I have been living in Western PA for almost 3 years. In the beginning I met a bunch of girls who I immediately connected with due to the same interexchange reality we shared. 80% os these people are from my home-country. 

Then I was lucky to find the love of my life, got married, have a house and a dog. I can't say I feel 100% lonely thanks to my wonderful husband. But as I just told him, he is not a girl and I can not throw on him all my expectations about having friends.   


In my home city I always had so many friends, there were a few of my birthdays that I would invite 50-60 people and would always have everyone making sure to be with me in my day, it always made me feel so special and lucky. Every weekend I had stuff to do with different groups of friends - not to mention that a few of them I know it's been more than 20 years. It is not about the quantity, I am just glad to have so many close friends, to the point that I am having trouble to decide all my bridesmaids for the wedding ceremony we are gonna have in my country next year. I was always told that if there is one thing about me is that I am a friends magnet. Also I have a solid 10 years friendship with people I met online that live in other states and I would always visit during vacation.  


And with all this, now I feel the most lonely. I ofc can message and call all this friends, but I feel really lonely in this city that I live now, because I don't have a friend to go to the cinema with me, to go play volleyball, to have drinks, to go biking. I don't have actual friends here, I feel like I have many colleagues - that I thought they were my friends. I used to have 2 really close friends that got divorced by the time I got married and I feel like they got divorced from me too cause they changed completely with me. I once thought being the only single girl of my girls group was hard, but being almost the only married girl is 100x harder. I feel like I lost connection with all my girl friends here, it's almost like we had connection enough for sometime but not deep enough to really bond. I try to invite people out and sometimes I barely get answers, as ofc they have plans without me. I wondered once if it was because I am not in single anymore, but I guess it's more than that, it is just that I am not important enough for them to include me in their plans and this makes me really sad, but at the same time, I would never go talk to anyone about it, cause I believe this should be spontaneous. The only friend I had is going back to her home-country in Europe and I couldn't be sadder that she is leaving.   


I hope this changes when I have my work-permit in hands and start to work.

To top it off this is the third time that this has happened to me, I get to know someone for six months to a year and ask them and then something out my control pops up and my date cancels on me permanently a few days before the date is supposed to happen.

I know I am not doing anything wrong, I've talked over my steps with my sister and friends every day leading up to the date to make sure I stay respectful, humble, and excited for the date.  I took all the right steps just for this to be taken away from me again.  

 I really am thinking I am destined to be alone and I don't want this.  I really don't, I've worked hard to improve myself mentally and physically and I'm ready to share myself with another person but it just seems like it can never happen.

I need help, I want to succeed and I come close to it only for circumstances out of my control to rip it away.

617,vr22se,Strong_Outcome_9811,Hi Reddit am a 13 year old male going in to my freshman year of high school. For all my life my so called friends would bully me my whole life up until the 6th grade. I got out of that environment and me and my family moved but not because of my friends. After I made some new friends in the 8th grade they all seemed cool and fun to hang around but I was wrong. They never invited me to places they would go. Sometimes I would ask if they wanted to hang out but they all said they were Busy but when I would check there Snapchat story they would be hanging out with each other. This would go one for 5 months and then I just stoped asking. I built up the courage to ask if they wanted to come over they said NO. One day they invited me to a party I was so excited but I never got a address or an invitation. Near the end of the year I met this one girl in my art class who actually liked me and we became friends I forgot to mention that I do not look the best and have always been insecure about my looks. Then I found out that 90% of my friends were fake. I found this info by hearing a conversation at lunch. Am not going to go into details but it was hard for me. And on the last day of school I built up the courage to ask the girl out and the one think she did was laugh in my face and walk away and now I have no friends to hang out with this summer and I am pretty lonely and I am pretty scared for high school because I will be all alone. anyone have any tips?,2022-07-04 07:44:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/vr22se/so_lonely/,,0,3,So lonely

633,vr53zo,Familiar_Ad_9941,"I’m only 23, but my life has been going downhill for about a decade now.


I had a healthy social life from my first memory until I was 14 or so. I was always relatively shy, but I had three close friends who I enjoyed spending time with, and I also had cousins who I was very close with.


Flash forward to high school, I’ve now lost two out of the three friends I had in grade school, leaving one friend remaining. I’m a quality over quantity type of person when it comes to friends, but the issue was that he was a douche to me constantly since he knew I didn’t have any other friends to fall back on.


I finally cut ties with him the summer after senior year in 2017, leaving me with zero friends. I wasn’t talking to my cousins anymore at this point either due to extended family drama nonsense. My family also stopped having family gatherings around that time due to the drama.


I made a friend in early 2019 at my old job, and we hung out frequently that year. However, we hung out only one time after 2019 ended. We still talked regularly, but it was an awkward situation where he moved an hour away and only wanted to hangout if it was on his terms, so we weren’t super close. He ghosted me about a month ago over a super small disagreement. 


That leaves me now with quite literally zero real life friends or acquaintances. Like, there’s no one (except for one online friend) who I ever talk to. It feels like I’ve never even socially existed. Most people have old acquaintances or friends from school/work they catch up with from time to time, but I somehow don’t even have that. It’s honestly almost impressive that I’ve lived 23 years and made zero lasting connections.  


I’m just wondering if anyone can relate? It feels like I’m the only person in the world like this most of the time.",2022-07-04 11:17:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/vr53zo/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_life_has/,,0,2,Does anyone else feel like their life has completely fallen apart?

Aside from work, I never leave my house because I don't know anyone who wants to spend time with me. All the friends I made from high school and college have deserted me and moved on to better things, and now I'm in a situation where I literally don't have any friends. I feel even worse whenever I open Snapchat or Instagram and see pictures of my former classmates hanging out with other people almost every single day. It makes me feel unwanted and that I'm wasting my life away.

I've been thinking that maybe it's time I make new friends, but I don't even know how. I'm not in school anymore, and all my coworkers have lives of their own and want nothing to do with me outside of work. On top of that, I'm not a very social person, and I dislike going to bars and clubs, which is where most people in their 20s seem to hang out.

678,vrdmyo,Jurez1313,"I am honestly just so ... sad. All the time. Loneliness has consumed my life and my thoughts. I'm at work with a pile of tasks that I have no intention of doing anytime soon. All I can think of is how daunting the rest of my life is right now. Because I can see it clearly. Another 30-40 years of getting up, going to work, coming home to an empty house, eating dinner, playing video games (until arthritis and carpal tunnel catch up to me, then just watching movies), then going to sleep to do it all over again. The weekends just remove work from the equation. That's all my life has been the last 5-8 years, that's all it will be until I die.  

Why do I not only think this, but absolutely *know* it, with every fiber of my being? Quite simply, because there's no way anything else is possible. I know myself well enough to know I will never have the motivation, discipline, or sheer willpower to change anything about my life. The ability to force myself to work out, or change careers, or make friends was bullied out of me at a very young age. What few friends stuck around are long gone. The only people that remain in my life are biologically programmed to do so. Once they are gone, I will have no one, until the day I die.  

So what do I do now? To say my future sounds bleak is a gross understatement of affairs. How am I supposed to move forward knowing that the ONE thing that I've always wanted, the ONLY thing I've *ever* wanted - to be loved, cared for, hugged and kissed, to have my hand clasped in my lovers' - has never been, and never will be, possible? That no matter how many strangers I try to talk to, no matter how many MeetUp groups I attend, no matter how many jobs I start and lose because of my poor work ethic, I will never make another *friend* let alone a partner?  

I'm really, really struggling to see the path that leads from where I am now, to actually being happy. Or at least, being *not* miserable. If such a path doesn't exist, if I really am ""destined"" to be miserable the rest of my life...why even bother walking such a path?",2022-07-04 18:14:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,18,/r/lonely/comments/vrdmyo/all_hope_is_lostwhat_do_i_do_now/,,0,25,All hope is lost...what do I do now?

Something very real that happened though was CPS was called on me years ago because of a misconception. for a week they visited my house daily. interrogated my child, got into my personal business (therapy visits, family interviews, drug tests, etc.), scared my daughter to death (because they told her she would be taken if anything came back false), and caused an even bigger rift between me and what little bit of family i did have left. 

the only thing about my disorder that might be considered *crippling* or *odd* is the fact i long for and can thrive with ZERO outside interaction. I'm not bothered by not having friends. I'm not bothered by the fact i never leave the house (when i DID have a home; outside of work, when i did work, i would go MONTHS without leaving). I'm not bothered by not having close, meaningful relationships, to be perfectly frank, I'm not bothered by having nobody. that's literally all that means. i am 100% content and happy with it being JUST ME, or just me and MY DAUGHTER. 

i know it probably sounds sad and depressing, but i am 100% content having nobody. HOWEVER, it doesn't mean I'm a dick to people either. I'm pretty intelligent, so I'm decent at carrying conversation, I'm really good at faking my *social personality* so i laugh at appropriate times, feign concern if needed, ask questions to seem interested/engaged, and basically just act like your average, empathetic female. it's completely draining when i do do that so that's why i would reserve that personality for work. 

But, in a nutshell, that's it. that's all schizoid personality disorder is. if everybody in the world (with the exception of my daughter of course) disappeared i would be absolutely content. i don't go insane if i can't talk to somebody, i don't start hallucinating ppl because I'm alone for days at a time, i don't need ppl to stay sane.",2022-07-04 19:45:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655947470,2,/r/lonely/comments/vrfmkb/misconception/,,0,4,Misconception

I’m a traveling construction worker and I think a big thing that has saved me was being able to go to a new place knowing I was safe from all the chaos and death. Even if it was in a bad part of town. I’ve been through it all and death doesn’t bother me.
I do enjoy being a loner for the wrong reasons. I know that eventually everyone will be gone one day or will leave me. I get so committed in a relationship on a spiritual level that I know I will most likely never get that sort of thing in return. I did once but, my ex GF died. A big part of me did too. I guess what I’m saying is it’s a love hate thing being lonely. It would be nice to have someone be there with me in the dark but, I won’t hold my breath the show must carry on.

Then that feeling slowly fades as you already start to feel tired and remember you don't have much of a life so you grab your phone and dive right into the overstimulating dopamine rabbit hole of social media to drown out your recurring negative thoughts. Lie there for a couple hours and refuse to get up until your on the brink of pissing your pants so then your forced to get out of bed. Might aswell feed yourself since your up so you head into the kitchen to grab a bite then remember your broke as fuck and have been for the past couple years because you cant find a job. Atleast there's some bread left so you toss a couple slices in the toaster and remember you forgot to buy butter. I guess plain toast is better than nothing. Shuffle on back to your room with your delicious and nutritious toast to just sit there and wonder how the fuck your gonna scrounge up enough money to buy those beers for tonight you so rightfully deserve after a hard day scrolling your phone and making that gourmet breakfast of plain toast. Then those negative thoughts start creeping their way back so you quickly boot up YouTube or some video games to distract yourself again. Before you know it it's 7pm and there's that slight moment of happiness as you realise it's drinking time, quick, better down that tin of tuna and questionable leftover plain pasta with cheese so your stomach atleast has something to work with. Down go those  beers into that dark empty void you try to fill however notice they gave you nothing but a light buzz and slight sense of  relief. Oh well better than no beers.

706,vrggyc,assburgersgrl,"Once my family have gone to bed, those whom I speak with virtually are preoccupied with their own lives or for whatever reason stop replying - it hits me hard that I am ''lonely'' when in fact in that moment I'm alone i.e. in my own company. As for me, personally, I have recently discovered I am autistic after years of trying to be neurotypical it is such a relief to be able to take off my mask and take a deep breath rather than wondering why I don't often respond to situations like others do but often many times for me I take it personally, as a rejection when for actual matter there is a time where we all go to sleep and someone can't always be there to talk to us which may seem blatantly obvious. What I'm getting at here is that for so long, even now, I have been terrified to sit with my own thoughts away from the outside world and I will always have some source of interaction, whether it be someone I personally know or a kind stranger who is willing to listen and the truth is, there always will be a kind stranger who is willing to give you their time and energy although sometimes that is not what you need. Sometimes you need to take time out to spend time with yourself. Whether that's going for a brief walk around the neighbourhood where you live or taking yourself out for your favourite beverage. For too long I have been running away from myself and scared of what I might find. A lot of the answers you seek are already inside you if you look close enough.

I've been accused of some very unfair things, and was hoping we can find a more effective way of making our point. 

(For those who are trying to help, for real)

Someone told me I was, making others responsible by blaming them - or not taking full responsibility for myself.

I've never blamed anyone but myself for my mistakes, and the way they have affected me. That's all me. People are just a relevant detail to the story.

Someone said I had personally decided to stick to my vices (stuck because it's easy).

I have a serious set of addictions, and have acknowledged them very much as a problem, that I am regularly fighting for my life to break away from. These vices and addictions and dependencies aren't my identity, and I never let them change the way I treat people. I never let it get in the way of my obligations, and never put it before my health. But this is not the only problem in my life, and it doesn't make it easier to quit.

I don't understand why he pushed for a date so soon and then cancelled? If he was nervous, then it would've been ok and I would understand, I was too. But he just kept lying.

751,vrlz1z,Drifting_SkeleTony,"Here we go again with another night of extreme loneliness that keeps you up at night thinking of how lonely you are, while I do have friends but they're not exactly friends, ya know, ""friends"", as we all know, it's the ""best"" feeling to hang around with people that you absolutely don't feel like you fit in at all. Of course you could make new friends... Oh wait, anxiety is a thing! Not only that, once you're lonely for a very long time, you become a gloomy and sad person, maybe even gain depression, then it becomes extremely difficult to keep up the positive act, or not, depending on how bad you got it. So yeah, not exactly the best chances of making new friends when you kill the good vibes with your gloom. Hmm? What about a partner? Significant other? You'd be wrong of thinking I would have one, once again, anxiety is a thing, I wouldn't dare to ask one out, besides, who would date a guy who just plays video games and rarely draws? Not many I assume. Oh, did I mention that anxiety, depression, and loneliness is an ""amazing"" combination? Because I can assure you that it can be life changing. So do I think anything will change by typing all of this? Probably not, but it does make you feel just a small bit better, it's good to let out your feelings out and pour your thoughts on a post, but sadly it's not the first time and probably won't be the last. I think the worst part of loneliness is that you become such a husk of a human being that compliments of any kind would not affect you, it's a sad thing, isn't it? In other words, life's a bitch. Now if you excuse me, I'll be listening to music on YouTube and probably daydream of things that will never happen.

781,vrp3li,[deleted],"Hey everyone,

So to start, I just want people to be kind and understanding of my situation here. I've been through a lot in my life, and especially a lot more in the last several months. That being said, I have made major improvements also so this post is gonna be not only a vent but a reflection piece as well. I just made a reddit after deleting and removing myself from ALL social media (facebook, instagram, etc...) as I found social media was extremely unhealthy and determental to my wellbeing. The only things I use online now is well, Youtube, hulu, online shopping sites and now reddit along with having a cell phone. I have found this all to be healing to not have the constant pressure to check how toxic people from my past are doing and then ultimately burning myself as a result as those people do not care for me anymore. 

So boring intro aside, here's my situation. My boyfriend of 2 years died 9 months ago from a overdose. It shook my whole world as he was my only friend besides being my significant other. And then to top the cake my ex best friend of 7 years turned out to have had an emotional affair the whole time with him behind my back and when he died she was the FIRST to find out from his family and nobody let me know for days while I worried and waited, ultimately having to call the police station in his town to find out. When I found out I was destroyed and let his family know I loved him and I shared in their grief. But when my ex best friend took the spotlight and started acting like SHE was the girlfriend I couldn't take it anymore and removed myself from social media. It was bad enough I lost him in that manner, the very fact that I had to deal with her being on the side was a double punch in the gut. So anyways, here is the cruel irony in the whole thing, my ex best friend who had the affair with my bf was friends with me for 7 years and was my only friend until she introduced me to my bf. I was isolated those entire 7 years with her being my only friend, then when she set me up with him she dropped me and hated me for falling in love. It only got worse as my bf couldn't let her go and it just turned into a really fucked love triangle. 

Anyhow, none of this really matters at this point but there's a little backstory. So that leads to where I am now that my boyfriend is gone and my best friend wants nothing to do with me and I didn't have any other friends or genuine relationships prior to all this, I am completely socially ISOLATED. I don't work at the moment as I am disabled with a heart condition, my family that I live with is planning on moving to the woods and nowhere urban at all, I don't have my GED or any education so college isn't an option, and I am stuck. I feel am trying not to feel hopeless but it's hard not to. Not to mention the grief, heartbreak and knives in my back that I am dealing with as well. I am 22 years old now and I feel like I am literally wasting away my youth and reminising on the days where I felt loved and happy and when my boyfriend was here and when my best friend wasn't such a horrible person. I apologize too if all this sounds incredibly dramatic and fucked up, I just needed to vent. It's been an awful year and I just want to feel happy again. I know too there must be others out there like me who I could connect with but I imagine people like that are so far away and I have zero clue how I will find these people. I just want to know that I'm not crazy for feeling the way I feel after being through all this???

785,vrpkp5,slattlover2,"I’ve been in the worst depressive state of my life the past 4 months and started therapy and antidepressants to help work through it. 

5 weeks ago my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. Being that I moved to this area just 3.5 years ago all my friends were brought into my life through her and now she’s taken them all with her since we’ve broken up. 

I really rely on my summers to recharge me for school but now I’m dreading every day, and then falling more heartbroken when I look ahead and see school in my future as well.

I cry everyday and have only seen my friends once this whole summer (when I invited them to go to a special event that I’m very fortunate to have access to) and I’m constantly alone and depressed.

On top of this I attend a university I hate and also have no friends at due to staying mostly isolated through Covid and being in a long distance relationship deterred a lot of my urges to party. 

This weekend my family all went away and I was stuck at home watching my dog all alone on what’s supposed to be my favorite “holiday” of the year. I love fireworks and being outdoors with “the people I love to be around” but now they dont exist in my life. 

With no invite to fireworks or my “friends” 4th of July party I sat at home cleaning my golf clubs and paying for an overpriced takeout burger since I didn’t want to buy and prep to just grill for myself. 

What really set me over the edge this weekend was the one person Who’s promised to be with me through it all and has arguably “saved” my life texted me today to “calm down with the messaging” as I just reached out to hope she was doing well and to please send me pics of the fireworks she sees tonight (since I love them). It hurt more than anything I’ve heard in any memory I have to hear that I even now annoyed the one person I felt was still left in my life. 

I truly don’t even like “going out” but man I wish I could have some fun for once this summer.

I know my problems aren’t worse than anyone else’s in here but I truly am proud of all of u and I hope we can all get through this to a better time in our lives.",2022-07-05 04:30:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/vrpkp5/not_sure_if_school_or_summer_is_worse/,,0,2,Not sure if school or summer is worse

At what point did you realize that you were the one making an effort in your friendships and when you stopped, all you got was silence for days. Then those days turned to weeks, then to months, and now to years. I miss having someone (especially a woman) to talk to about stuff. I’ve always had girl best friends but as soon as they got a boyfriend, I got shafted. I mean, I genuinely happy for them but they’ll never understand how how alone I have gotten. Every time, I feel like a piece of me is slowly dying. I’ve already gotten to the point of leaving my phone on “do not disturb”. Why bother, I’m not gonna get a text from anyone.

806,vrrnau,Facemam,"To sum up a long story, my mom is crazy. It’s a long like 3 years spanned story of sadness about how she got swept up by alcohol that collided with her mental health and fucked her up. But she’s always had those problems really. What that meant for seven year old me was therapy like two times a week. I barley had any friends in elementary school and when I did, my fun would be interrupted with therapy. The therapist diagnosed me with Asperger’s syndrome. Keep in mind I was only seven. Fast forward a couple years and I was going into middle school. I was so excited. So many new opportunities to make friends now that therapy wasn’t on my schedule. So I started talking to more people. And then COVID shut everything down. So I was very depressed going into my seventh grade year I was super sad. My best friend moved from right next door to another state. So he wasn’t there. I did online for most of that year. Super sad time for me. I’d say that was my worst year, but it’s only gonna get worse for me. Anyways, I went into school for the last three months of seventh grade. I made so many friends it was so cool. And it was even cooler that we were going into summer so I could hang out with them more. And that’s what I did. I was calling them, texting them, and most importantly, going out into the world with them. Best summer of my life. So, going into eighth grade I was expecting big things. But my school had other ideas. Me and my one friend were separated from all my other friends. So me and him would become super good friends. A couple months in, toward somewhere around April something happened. It was a normal Sunday. I was gonna get picked up by my mom and we were gonna go home for school the next day. That didn’t happen. She was supper drunk. Like way over the top. And she snapped. She attacked members of my family and we had to leave. So I called my dad and he got us. She was still in the other car outside the police station. To sum it all up again I ended up living with my grandparents for the rest of the school year. Some other things happened from my “break” from my mom. I’m never going back to her. So I finished my eighth grade year and I’m going into summer living with my dad. I have no friends here. My dad lives In the city and my mom used to live down the shore and that’s where I went to school and all my friends are there. To add on to that, my dad works five days a week and for undisclosed reasons he has to work weekends. So I’m usually alone for most of the day without much to do. And then, my dad gets a girlfriend. She’s nice I guess. Idk I’m just not used to him with a girlfriend I guess. The last time he had one was like six years ago. But anyways, today, (July fourth) my dad got super drunk. And we set off the saddest and most lonely fireworks I’ve ever seen. Now he’s asleep and I’m in my room listening to thank you by Dido slowed and on repeat. I don’t know. Am I just made to be alone? It’s like I’m in a loop. And it sucks. I just needed to talk to something. So if you got this far, it means a whole lot to me.

Despite that, whether or not I am with any close online friends, with most of them I feel disconnected, even when in a voice call or just plain text. I go to a really tiny school and I've already tried making irl friends there, no luck, and no longer will I make an effort. I enjoy being alone at times, but then I get this huge, aching, longing feeling of wanting to have someone to connect with in the moment. I have an anxiety disorder too so it's quite difficult for me to really communicate with people who I don't immediately connect with. No one seems interested in meeting me. I try my best to make friends but it all ends up going to waste.

851,vryh1n,res77777,"The one that ended in a dumpster fire weren't irl friends, it was on Discord. It was quite nice, I was closer to them than I ever have been to any real life friends. Most of them were actually really really nice. But with it being a public server there were shits who actively tried to ruin it and be awful. Some drama ensued and everyone just decided it was best to leave. No use in repairing. 

I don't use social media often, I know people complain of toxicity but I never used it for myself. I never realized how genuinely evil some people are. Man. I've had two friend groups my whole life (and only in the past four years) so that interaction seriously just made me feel quite paranoid about making friends again.

The other guys are real life. Knew them since 9th grade (am graduated). But they don't really like me as much as everyone else. It's sort of like I'm just there cause it would be kinda weird to not invite me but in reality if they could not invite me most would probably choose that. A few *do* like me.

But there's some who regardless of whether they like me or not, I for the life of me cannot fucking stand them. There's a few of them who are just way too edgy and immature really thin line where you can't tell if they're seriously sexist and racist or just joking. But I decided you know what? That's their sense of humor... I guess. I'll ignore them and me and the ones I like can do our sense of humor. Except those assholes will actively complain about us saying we're too annoying and ruining the group chat.

Those who aren't straight up racist and little shits find the humor funny, which again is their choice but it makes me a minority so speaking up would make everyone be like ""lol it's just a joke"" so I don't even bother. I know this is just high school shitheads being edgy and immature but it sucks cause I really can't just go and leave them. They're the only people I get to talk to. I struggle to make friends ever. Especially since I'm autistic. I went all of middle school without friends and made this friend group by pure luck. Who knows how long I'll go without making friends again?

Especially cause now I'm an adult. No more structured classes. No more structured playtime. No more youth sports. No more YMCA clubs. My therapist recommended autism social classes, but would those even work? I understand how social interactions work, I just fail at the execution. A bet most of those classes are geared towards ""low functioning"" people. There's rarely ever resources for ""high functioning.""

I'm significantly less active in the group chat because of those people now. I understand that if I'm in an uncomfortable situation to remove myself. But I can't completely leave cause then I'll just have literally nobody to talk to. I joined that dumpster fire because I saw my group growing toxic and wanted an escape. I've tried to join other public Discord servers but it's just so hard for me to make friends. That one dumpster fire, everyone there just clicked. Like we were made for each other. That's probably never going to happen again.

Anyways yeah guess I'll go cry now. Haven't left my room in months. I pretty much only leave to visit family. We're going on a trip soon, which is cool. But all my family is aged 40+, there are basically no kids my age. I do like to take care and babysit the little infants. I think has something to do with me kind of never having a childhood.

I work in the education industry so I spent ten years out of college foolishly trying to get a job here instead of another state or country. Ironically now more than ever I’m considering trying to live abroad but I feel trapped by this long awaited position.

I’m considering living abroad for the summer and ditching a summer position last minute at a different district that didn’t hire me for 7 years. I feel guilty, but they never helped me, and I’m so desperate and I feel like I need a system shock and living away could give it to me. Who knows maybe I’ll even meet a nice woman (which would then present other problems and decisions to make) but I just can’t imagine surviving another lonely summer like this with all of my bad habits and thoughts corroding me further. 

I don’t want to feel like a sex tourist and that’s not the goal but the American dating market has failed me and one been seriously depressed for a decade. Maybe if I just got a kiss overseas it would be enough to help me return with some confidence and self esteem. In hindsight I should’ve worked abroad one of the summers I’ve been off since 2011 but that times gone and I feel like it’s too late but I feel like I need to see something else but at the same time I feel guilty for abandoning this job.

892,vs4qm3,Happy-Investigator-,"Sorry if this is too much of a rant, but I need to air out. I’m a 27 year old female, and I lost all my social life from having anorexia for 10 years. I know it’s a very misunderstood illness so to simplify, I developed a fear of eating around people by my 4th year with the illness and because of that, I gradually started to isolate. In the times I would hang out with old friends, I’d have psychotic episodes from the prolonged starvation. None of my friends understood what was going on and of course, they couldn’t understand not everyone is functional enough to broadcast their mental illness on social media, so I was pretty much abandoned. Nobody wants to be friends with the person who can’t have fun or feel excited about anything because their mind is succumbed to calculate calories every second . Nobody wants to be friends with the person who’s going to have a crying fit at a party. People don’t understand the toll mental illness takes on a person.  It made me an agitated, detached, shell of a person but now after 10 years of nearly starving myself to death, I’m finally stable and better in recovery for a year.

The only thing I ask myself is “what’s left?”. Because I lost all my friends and spent so much time in isolation, it’s difficult to socialize the same way I used to. I still feel very alien and foreign to people in general. All I’d like is a friend. One single friend to hang out with or talk to. Spending everyday with just a call or text from my mom and only having my husband to hang out with just convinces me even more that I’m a low life and the cycle of regret that feeds loneliness that feeds more into depression is so hard to break without any change .

People say “join a meet up”, “go out at night to bars or a party”, “go to shows” without acknowledging just how disconnected 7 years of isolation made me become . Nor do some understand none of these activities guarantee you’ll find a friend. I’ve tried multiple times and I always end up a passive observer, which just makes the loneliness even worse. Most people just want to fuck. Nobody cares for friendship. And since I’m in a relationship, it only makes it harder. 

I’m tired . Idk how I could keep passing my days without a friend .",2022-07-05 18:33:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595534504,3,/r/lonely/comments/vs4qm3/how_much_longer_am_i_supposed_to_go_on_like_this/,,0,2,How much longer am I supposed to go on like this ?

I have one person that I call my best friend and she’s currently cold shouldering me.  On the 30th I went on vacation out of state and was busy for 5 days, i just got home. and I didn’t answer her call or really text because I was nonstop doing stuff and then got extreme food poisoning. A week before that I got married and no one (other than my best friend) congratulated me, it was a courthouse wedding and my best friend knew and said she was sending me flowers but never even did that. But other than that just my family who was there congratulated me (they are my only family). Any time something good happens to me I feel so ashamed and embarrassed because no one wants to celebrate with me. No one wants to be happy for me. My coworkers get jealous and pissy. I really only had one guy friend and he hasn’t said a word to me since I got married. Every time I try to make new friends it fizzles out immediately. If I go a day without talking to someone it’s the end of the world apparently. Everyone latches onto someone else or they already have best friends. I’m 28 and feel like I will never ever have a real best friend, or friends in general. It got so bad a few days ago that I talked to my best friend about how I feel like everyone abandons me in the end and she understood, reassured me, but now it feels like that was kind of a lie? My husband has friends from childhood and he makes new ones instantly. I just don’t get it. I’m not mean, boring, self-deprecating, clingy, cocky, nothing of the sort. I genuinely like myself and am happy and just living life, but clearly I’m doing something wrong. I am so desperate for friends I keep thinking “maybe I should just pay someone” lol. It’s getting pathetic. I initiate pretty much all conversations and being in my late 20s I would expect people to be mature and not get butthurt if I don’t reply immediately or even a few days later?

Even tough she has bf she talks on phone with me  for like 3hour and i just cannot understand if she is interested in me . Yeah i almost forget this thing she told me a secret, secret was about how she failed to get into relationship with some dude at that moment i just died inside .

I recently turned 19 and since the summer of 2019 I've been alone.

It started off as a result of a manic episode that caused me to act violently and erratically, which created conflicts with my existing friend group.

At the same time as a late teenager most of my friends were starting to direct their interests less towards our typical hangouts and more towards partying and drugs. I've had a lot of issues that prevented me from enjoying big social gatherings all my life so I refused any and all invitations.

These events marked my descent into a depression that made me develop self isolating behaviors and changed my mood, since then I find it hard to joke around or enjoy simple banter.

In the following years I found out all my existing connections were pretty much gone, people had moved on without me, I still had people who I could see, but it was just that, come hangout and never talk until we hangout again in like a month.

Since then things haven't changed much, I know a lot of people superficially, but nobody to talk to.

The closest friends I've made as an adult are people I've met through 12 Step programs. The combination of regular interactions multiple times per week; the themes of struggle, honesty, and hope; the containing structure of the program; and the intimacy of the sponsorship relationship helped me create bonds deeper than any acquaintanceships I've made in the ""normie"" world.

Now I'm not in 12 Step anymore, and I really really miss those deep connections. 

Are there any other groups similar to 12 Step which are secular and not treatment-based, i.e. just groups for normal people to come together and open up to each other for support and visibility?

978,vsfa50,pusillanimous303,"I see comments regularly on here about how women can’t really be lonely because it’s “so easy” for a woman to find someone. This is blatantly false. I’m not saying being a man provides the same experience as being a woman. I’m saying that women don’t have it as easy as some guys think. 

Since these statements are usually about romance, let’s look at that. Women, much more than men, have to deal with potential partners showing an interest just so they can get laid. They’re no longer human beings. They’re objects. And sometimes when the woman does sleep with a guy, that same guy could, the very next day, act like he doesn’t know who she is. Like their intimacy never happened. Being an especially attractive woman doesn’t fix this problem. Attractive women can be treated like a trophy. Something appreciated only if she can make the man look good. If she isn’t pretty enough or thin enough or outgoing enough, it makes the guy look bad—or so he thinks. Again, that isn’t being treated like a human. It’s being a trophy. Nothing more than an expensive watch. 

If the relationship progresses, she has to be on the look out for signs that the guy is a shitbag. A man-child. I see examples of it all over social media. The guy barely contributes to the household. He works part time and he spends all his free time playing video games. That leaves all the housework and child rearing to the woman who is already keeping the household expenses afloat. He was probably charming early in the relationship, and he has taken advantage of her commitment to treat her like a servant. 

Just because women might have guys pursuing them, that doesn’t mean they can’t be lonely. They can be trapped in a loveless and unappreciative relationship. Or they haven’t settled for just anyone, and they are alone and lonely because they can’t find someone who treats them well. 

I wanted to speak up because I see far too many r/lonely posts that cross the line into incel.",2022-07-06 02:39:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618504526,558,/r/lonely/comments/vsfa50/women_can_be_lonely_too/,,4,202,Women can be lonely too

She's weird too. I'm weird. I never found anyone who liked weird guys. I'm just inferior to everyone and am having a break down. The worst part about it is, there is no therapist or hotline to call. They dislike me and usually make me feel worse. I'm on my own so I have to get past the panic, take medication, then fall asleep because that's all I can do.

1043,vsln48,Jasey_Cones,"Hello,

I am a white British citizen of mixed ethnicity. I was born in England and when I was 3 my mother and father decided to move to Cyprus (mother is Greek Cypriot, father English).

Growing up I discovered that I was always the odd one out in any social group because everyone was either fully English or fully Cypriot. I cannot count the amount of times at summer camp, school, out with friends where Cypriots would ridicule me for being half English and English kids avoiding me because I was half Cypriot.

I didn't grow up in a good home. Mum and dad always fighting, he was always getting pissed (drunk), there were brief moments of knives being thrown, dad coming home from crashing the car drunk the night before with his entire face smashed up, mum locking me out the house for hours because I was accused of stealing at after-school gym, etc.

Well to cut to it, in 2004 I left cyprus to return to the UK for college and potentially university. The whole time in college I never managed to make any friends. I thought I did because some of us were hanging out at college but there was never any plans for any other interactions outside of college. I tried to initiate stuff like this, and no one was bothered.

I tried to keep in touch with my couple of buddies from Cyprus and all of them quickly started ignoring me online to the point where years passed without contact. I ended up just deleting my Facebook. I looked at the friend list and I just thought you're someone I used to know, but now you're no one... Just a pixel on a screen that doesn't even talk to me. So why bother.

Over the years it's been the same living in England. I've had many jobs / short careers where I've thought I've made friends with some people and when those jobs end or its the weekend... No one cares. It's all just fun and games at the place of work. But everyone always goes home to their friends they made from birth/school and they are not open to mixing with anyone new.

I'm married now with 2 kids and I still feel very isolated. I have literally no friends, no one to spend time with in life other than my wife and children. And there comes a point where enough is enough. Like, I have no one to play any games with either online or coop at home... I have no one to go to the pub with, no one to go fishing with, literally no one.

I spend each day of my life now, ever since 04, with almost no one.

And get this... I'm a white and typical British looking as it comes, but one day doing a delivery job to some estate agents... The owner at the back on his desk leans over and yells at me ""where you from?""

I said ""Bournemouth"".

He then said ""No no I mean where are you originally from?""

I repeated ""Bournemouth"".

""Oh really?"", He said. You just look a bit different...

""The fucks that supposed to mean?"", I said.

I just told him to fuck himself and walked out after that.

I guess since a very young age racism has basically removed any social ability I could ever have as a human to make any friends. I always wonder now in social settings with my Scandinavian wife's family... If someone has some kind of racist thought in their head about me. I sit at dinner tables and everyone is blabbering away in their own language despite knowing fluent English and I'm sat there in silence at the edge of the table wondering what the fuck I did wrong with my life.

And I don't even know why I'm typing this here. I accept I'm loser. Life isn't full of winners. Some people are just undesirable and are losers. That's how it is. I'm one and I accept it.

But is there a way I can be a miserable loser and have some friends / company, without being shot down the moment people look at me?

Do I have to resort to getting myself locked up in prison just to have friends? Well that might not even work.. probably get killed for not being fully English.",2022-07-06 09:12:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655732449,2,/r/lonely/comments/vsln48/i_have_had_almost_no_friends_since_2004/,,0,3,I have had almost no friends since 2004

I 21 (M) have been dating my ex 21 ( FM) for about 2 years and broke up about a few months ago. It was my fault, I never cheated but I just suck and have anger issues. All that aside she moved back to SC with her parents. About 2 weeks later  she came over to NJ and left polaroids of her and her new bf  i’ll say performing sexual activities and wrote a note basically naming every insecurity I have and saying how she missed out being with me sexually and any sort of confidence or means for anything is all gone. I’ve been suicidal. Every single day since i’ve been laying in bed with my gun in hand drinking. I have no reason to be here. I have hobbies like playing guitar, riding my bike, goes to the gym and has a good job with a close group of 3 friends. But, I don’t want to be here anymore there are a lot of other issues I have but this one ruined me. I don’t know what to do anymore I’ve tried getting back trying to meet new people but i’m not peoples first choice. I tried tinder and going out to malls coffee shops and bars with no luck.

1094,vsvzam,Jurez1313,"I am so fucking lonely it hurts. But I can't fix it the conventional way (make friends, find a partner), despite all the advice I've gotten on reddit over the years. What advice I have been able to follow has not worked, and the rest of the advice I have been unable to force myself to implement into my life. I am not complaining per se - I know that only I am to blame for my inability to force myself to do things I hate in order to manifest social relationships.  

I just want to know, how do you cope with this shit? I have a couple hobbies: watching movies &amp; TV shows and playing video games mainly. (Board games too but without friends this is difficult to continue doing.) They are good distractions when I am able to focus solely on them (whether it's an intense or exciting film, a TV show where I can manifest parasocial relationships, or a particularly difficult or intensive video game), but often I find myself distracted by the thoughts of loneliness to the point that it detracts from the enjoyment of my hobbies.  

I can't just partake in my hobbies 24/7, though. I have to go to work, for instance. It's gotten to the point where I'm bursting into tears randomly. Only a matter of time before someone notices and things get awkward. Just today I had to run to the bathroom and let some tears flow, luckily no one was in there and I was able to hold them back until I got there (I'm at work, to be clear). Focusing on tasks works sometimes, but I often have to distract myself with reddit in order to cope, which is negatively affecting my output and my co-workers are noticing and reporting me to management. Only a matter of time before I am fired, if I can't get my shit together that is.  

So, how do you guys cope with being alone? Especially for those of you who know you will be alone for the rest of your life? I can't keep crying at work, crying myself to sleep, being unable to sleep because of how badly I want to be held...there has to be a way to overcome this that doesn't involve relying on someone else for my happiness.",2022-07-06 17:50:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,10,/r/lonely/comments/vsvzam/just_got_done_crying_at_workhow_do_you_guys_cope/,,0,3,Just got done crying at work...how do you guys cope with this?

1100,vsx1v2,suelikesfrogs,"Three nights ago I found myself crying. Crying out of a feeling I haven't felt in quite some time. I feel lonely, not in life, not emotionally by any means. But it's physical my loneliness. And I pause for a minute staring out my window to process my emotions and all the overwhelmingly negative thoughts I have just to catch a shooting star. I've seen many in my lifetime but none out of my room window.

I'm 19, not the most social person but definitely not an introvert, I think I'm average looking but have really bad posture. My personality is okay I'm funny and I've matured a lot in the past two years. I am however stuck with unwanted mental health problems.

Back in late 2021 I had a time where I would cry myself to sleep every night for feeling alone. I had lost some friends, lost connections had nobody to really talk to and was in a very bad place. To my surprise I met someone early 2022 and told him about this. He pitied me. And I fell in love. He left me no two months later. No explanation in fact he promised he'd be back. Oh well, I'm over that and I've gotten better. Made new friends and feel so welcome and stable emotionally. 
One thing though, all my friends have gotten into relationships. And not me. I for the life in me cannot seem to make it work at all. It makes me question why and I try my best all the time to remain positive and hopeful that it is simply the course of the universe. But my body is one thing I can't help from feeling untouched and therefore undesired. All I want is to hold hands and hug and kiss. Sleeping in the same bed and share my time. And yet I don't think anybody is capable of simply liking me. For the longest time I didnt blame them, I didn't like myself. But now I do and this is the most alone I've ever been romantically. Its melancholic. Hard to deal with.

1106,vsxnz5,Slice_Equal,"I've had depression literally all my life and I've never been in a relationship or had my first kiss nothing really. I was already depressed during may because my best friend stopped talking to me out of the blue and then my out of nowhere i met this guy he was a co worker who just recently started working there we met eyes and instantly fell for each other we went to the gym together arcades and had so much fun together.

 Unfortunately everything in my life starts to come crashing down eventually nothing really stays positive in my life anyways giving backstory I was molested as a child by my older brother told my family recently no one cared not even my mom and told me to get over it and that it was a long time ago the only person who cared was my brothers fiancee at the time and it is still going on today ( not the molestation ).

But my mom constantly talking about it and not caring about it.

Because of my trauma I've never had my first kiss because as i see it its the last thing I have and the thought of a guy taking it and getting up and leaving me is enough for me to feel unhinged.

Anyways back to the story with my co worker I went over to his house and we were laying on each other and im never gonna forget this its the only time I've ever been that happen and I couldn't bring myself to kiss him because of my trauma and family drama that's still going on and my controlling mother.

He told me he lost feelings etc and I was extremely hurt and it drove me into a deeper depression he said saving a kiss is kinda like a like a middle school things. 

But mine was again because of my trauma and negative experiences with men and women. 

Anyways after our fling ended I still caught intense feelings for him and told him that I was ready to kiss him and he said I can but we'd have to be a friend with benefit ( and I don't want that I only want a committed relationship..)

So after that I fell deeper into my depression and the final straw was me and my mom getting into a argument while she was in the car with me driving (I was driving we basically cussed each other out ) and I lost one of my friends permeantly that same day they blocked me on everything.

I gave up I woke up the next morning grabbed scissors and mouthwash and told my dog goodbye he could since something was wrong and backed away from me.

I went to the park and wrote my letter messaged all my friends saying goodbye and just turned my phone off and deleted all my social media until I got two calls from both of my friends asking me what was going on I broke down and told them and my therapist called me and a voice kept telling me like a whisper turn back around go home it said.

It's the next day and I still don't feel happy I dunno if it's because my body is in shock or what not only that I'm always jealous of my friends who have romantic partners while me I've only have flings and rejection no one I end up liking sees me as girlfriend/wife material.

And yes I've ""dated"" someone in the past I didn't like and it didn't work out and I didn't kiss him either because he didn't want to get checked.

1122,vszr4f,alvida-tanhai,"I never had any friends in my life. I would be grateful, if you hear my story out and give me your advice on why such things happened with me and how to make friends. 

I never had any friends in my life, in school I was always alone, I never had any memorable moment of school. I have always been nice to everybody, not for sake of getting anything in return, but doing good for the sake of goodness.

Some peers I talked in school always came to me when their friends left them or they had a break-up or some other emotional problems. I always helped them, but in the end they all leave when their problem is solved by me, when I help them in solving their problems by listening to their problems, giving advice and so on. 

They never tried to start a conversation with me, it was always me who would check up on them, asking them how are you doing and so on. 

I always wished them on their birthday but they never wished me or even care to ask me when is my birthday. Even when in school they acted like I did not exist, never said hello to me, but would immediately come when they needed help.

They would always say that I'm a great person, a person who understands, a person who cares(I'm not boasting about myself). But would never even care to ask me how I'm doing.

I always wondered if they meant what they said, why treat me like a nobody or a ghost or a forgotten one or somebody who is left out.

Because of such experience I have given up on the whole concept of friendship. 

I will always try my best to help people who are going through difficult times because no matter what pains I go through, it is the kindness and sacrifice of unknown people who have made the world a better place.

I have no clue why am I writing, but It feels like my soul needs to let things out. I don't know, maybe someone would relate, as I am sure I'm not the only one. 

I grew up pretty much alone, It feels like I have seen the world through a window and that I have never belonged to it. Even though I tried, It feels like It's a competitive game of who's the loudest, and the prize would be having friends, people to connect with and never to feel alone, sad or empty. 

The only wish becomes too simple, wishing for someone, only one.. To whom I can give everything, loyalty, devotion, and be there whenever needed because I know, I just.. know how much *lonely* can feel like. 

I lay there, holding my phone and going through contacts, looking for anyone with whom I can share, talk. But It just hurts a bit more because I know, there is none. So the only thing left to do is battling the mind and the consciousness not to do anything silly about leaving this world. Even though, I feel like.. I just am not made for it. The aching grows greater than It was yesterday. Dreading the thought of waking up to a day where the only thing I'd feel is emptiness. I try, I try a lot, to find a group, someone, but It all comes down to the same end, at night once I lay back again on that bed, there is no escape from the thought 'another lonely day'",2022-07-06 20:40:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1476139520,1,/r/lonely/comments/vszzhi/27m_ive_been_in_loneliness_so_much_now_it_has_a/,,0,3,"[27M] I've been in loneliness so much, now it has a voice"

They stopped and stared at me . They didn’t say a word and just kept on going. I said hey again and they said “who are you? . It really hurts me even now.

I get that. World feels lost. Then you trust again, because you think you were happier back then. World feels lost yet again.


Then you stop the cycle, completely; you win.


Then comes days where even day to day interactions are becoming too much for you.

Then comes something personal, that's was so silly to you a week ago, and fucks up the order. You start leaking, you get emotional, then you're vulnerable, then you trust yet again.


But you never remember it being this way, this ""real"" or ""good"" at the time.

1143,vt3rq0,Haunting-Ad-4389,"So 4 months ago or so, I ask out my best friend (and crush)

Now, I was absolutely sure that she was going to reject me, and I was fine with that because, at least we could keep being friends.

But for my surprise, after 10 days (yes she thought about it for 10 days, which is already a bad sign) she said yes and we started dating.

That moment she said yes I thought ""this isn't going to last too much right, she will probably leave me soon"" and again, I was ok with that too.

But we kept dating for 3 months. 3 freaking months of being together. I was super happy, of course, and I even was starting to think that she truly wanted to be with me...

But then, out of nowhere, she sends me this really long message about how she needs some time because she had ""problems""

But I had been her friend for at least 4 years and I knew that was not true. So I kept telling her to be honest and that if she didn't want to be with me, she should tell me...

After 2 or 3 days of insisting, she finally admitted that she didn't even like me in first place, but said that when she said yes, she thought that she liked me??

Well the point is she was never into me for real, and those 3 months we spent kissing amd going on dates, I went to her house, she came to mine, we talked for hours...

Once I told her ""hey if you feel uncomfortable with kisses and that stuff you can just tell me, I won't get mad or anything"" 

And there she goes ""No really I am ok with that""

Which was obviously a lie.

When I asked her out I really put a LOT of emphasis on how she should not date me out of pity, because I knew that this was going to happen...

But she still did.

And I'm not mad at her for dating me out of pity, because I can understand that...

I'm mad at her because I literally told her one thousand times that she should not kiss me if she didn't want to, and she shouldn't date me if she didn't love me, and still, she endured 3 months of dating someome she didn't like in first place.

And of course I feel like a fool for thinking that we were going to end up together and happy.



And now we're on summer break, so I can avoid her, but when we get to school again, I'll have to see her again...

And EVERY SINGLE TIME I see her I either start to think about how bad I want to punch her face, or how badly I want to get back with her... or both at once...

Like, I hate her for what she did, but I really was, and am, in love... I really love her. And it is so freaking confusing to see her and start feeling like a mess...

The worst part of this is that one day, I will have to see her date any idiot that treats her like shit... I don't really know why some women are into that guys. I really tried to make her comfortable and happy, I did everything I could to make her happy, and there she goes:

""Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable dating you. I see you more as a friend"" 

Then why'd you date me for three months?

1158,vt5url,PieceOfPOS,"I’m 23 years old, but I’ve never been on a date or had a girlfriend before. I never get any likes on dating apps, and always get rejected by women in bars and clubs. Despite that, I’m a surprisingly happy person. I volunteer with refugees four days a week, I speak a rarely-studied foreign language which I picked up while studying in a developing country, I have ambitions to join the field of international development to help those less fortunate once I graduate from college.

Whenever I get rejected I always think “It doesn’t matter what random women think about me. I love myself, I know I’m a good person and I don’t have to prove that to anybody”. This state of mind never lasts, though. I can’t go too long without that fucking feeling I hate so much. That desire for romantic companionship strikes me before long and I hate it so much. It’s obvious at this point that I’m not attractive enough to date anyone, so I wish I could just do away with it.

I just hate the fact I’m attached to a desire for something I’m incapable of achieving.",2022-07-07 01:05:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644372773,3,/r/lonely/comments/vt5url/i_wish_i_could_take_away_whatever_it_is_in_my/,,0,10,I wish I could take away whatever it is in my brain which causes romantic desire because I’m not attractive enough to date anyone and all these feelings do is make me upset

I like it. Looks at everything and sometimes overthinks. The other is the exact opposite. Swayed easily, extremely impressionable and swears by denial. It will delude itself to live that perfect ""fantasy"", especially in relationships. This means constantly ignoring and justifying and uneasily denying HUGE red flags and mistreatment. I fall for this side. It's like my heart and brain are fighting in my *brain* constantly.

 I want to be collected and one fkn person as a whole. It's like they always have objections for everything, and the ""traumatized and strict"" version acts like a ""parent"" or guide and the emotional one as an extremely dumb child, even on purpose. Hence comes the inner world war and I don't don't know what to choose. As you can guess, I suck at making decisions. How do I sort this out and collect myself?

1185,vt889o,Snugglehumpikiss,"There is something called the dead internet theory. I did a bit of a dive on it recently and realized this is something that I have already known I just didn't know other people knew it too. There are so many ways for people to personally gain from creating programs that interact with people. Game developers will release multiplayer games and put bots in the games that pretend to be real people so that players come in and actually play the game because they think there are other people that they are playing with and if those weren't there they would just quit instantly and demand a refund. The dead internet theory proposes that a little over 5 years ago or maybe longer we reached a threshold called the inversion where we are no longer truly communicating with real people almost all the time. These are algorithms. We do this so much that we can no longer tell the difference between real people and bots furthermore when we do encounter real people the interactions are sometimes so off-putting and weird that we tend to believe those are the bots and then communicate with bots who are more predictable and whose interactions are more catered to our liking feeling as if our sense of belonging has returned. So the inversion is that our psyche is conditioned to prefer the unreal over the real thinking that the unreal is true. If it were the matrix we have taken the blue pill and stayed in wonderland. 
I know this to be the case of almost all dating apps. The majority of my right swipes are not real profiles and all of my matches just sit there and never talk back. Tinder is full of mannequin profiles. 

I am sitting here pondering this along with all the other things that people tend to ponder when they are profoundly alone. I was living with someone that I had very strong feelings for. We raised dogs together. If you've ever had a bond and by that I mean a true psychic Bond with a wolf hybrid, that is an incredibly devastating thing to lose. She left and she took our wolf boy with her. I'm now living alone a mile into the woods with nothing but my boomsticks for company. Not even a cat or a dog by my side. But I am real. I am a very real 40-year-old man with a good job, never been married and have no kids. I haven't been this alone for a very long time. Usually I at least have a cat when love and partnership falls apart. This really sucks.

I've also done some really bad things. I don't think I'm a bad person, but they kill me on the inside. I'm alone, I hate myself, and no one's ever really cared about my health.

I don’t regret leaving her and I miss her to a degree, but I’ll tell you what I miss the most more than anything is just those feelings associated with being in a relationship with someone. 

I used to have a bad day at work, but would get so excited to come home to my best friend and my dog. It wasn’t much, but it was the start of my little family. I worked hard to provide for that little family and we had plans on buying our first home together. Now I’ve been forced to move back in with my parents until I can get a place on my own and it sucks to come home to nothing. Not even the dog cause she took her too. 

I have had many sleepless nights looking over at the big empty space in my bed that used to be filled. Some nights we would just stay up into the late hours talking and laughing if one of us had trouble sleeping. Now I just lay here in complete silence. 

Everything from eating, watching tv and movies, going out, even taking a shower is done completely alone now. 
 
I don’t think I’ve healed enough from the damage she did to me to be ready for a new relationship, but I can’t lie and say that I don’t literally crave that level of human interaction right now. Because sure I’ve got friends and family I lean on and hangout with a lot, but that special bond you have with someone, sharing those intimate moments together is gone and I gotta be honest I’m scared I won’t find it again. If my best friend could betray me like that, then who wouldn’t?

It sucks that when I try to socialize and talk to people, they just stay for such a short time before finding someone else that is more interesting than me, or find their other friends. Those silent rejections in two days made me feel lonelier than me being alone for a year.

1295,vtpib1,_hearforit,"I've been doing a ton of research and recently I came across this study:

[https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tweets-and-Teens.pdf](https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tweets-and-Teens.pdf)

What it shows is that *how* we communicate with the people in our life makes a huge difference on how we end up feeling. In-person communication (when positive) triggers the release of the neurochemical Oxytocin. This has the effect of:

1. strengthening relationships bonds
2. improving mental health
3. lowering stress

Per this study, \*text-based\* communication (texting, email, social media, etc.) has next to no neurochemical benefit. It doesn't trigger the release of Oxytocin. As such, you can text all day long and still feel more alone than you ever have.

Last part: the most interesting part of this study is that \*audio-only\* communication (i.e., like a phone call) can have the exact same neurochemical impact as in-person communication. In other words, talking live with someone can make you feel less alone, build closer relationships, and ultimately feel better about things. That really blew my mind! That simply audio communication can do so much!

Those that were ever close to me, few and far between, are no longer in my life for either they left or I pushed them out. It’s hard for me to open up to people and trust is big thing for me, something that’s been broken multiple times. I finally was done trying to connect with others in a meaningful way. Too many bad relationships, broken friendships, or no one really took time to get to me/once they did they realized I was a mess and said “peace out”. Sure, I’ve had wonderful best friends but only one at a time, maybe two at most. Then, they would for some reason leave or we’d drift apart. 

Being lonely is a catch-22 for me. While I don’t want to get hurt again and don’t feel many really know me or stick with me once they finally get to know the real me, I also want a deep strong connection with a person or two.

There are so many lonely souls wondering out there. Especially with the pandemic hitting, social isolation and inability to be with loved ones, made the loneliness even worse. 

I was thinking how rad it would be to find a way to connect all the lonely hearts out there so they’d know they weren’t alone. Most often I can connect with other lonely people very well, there’s similarities in interests, thoughts and feelings. Let’s find a way to gather all the lonely souls and I bet beautiful lasting friendships would be made! After all, humans were mean to connect to one another and have strong relationships. So, who’d be down for a chill but fun getaway to meet other lonely people and perhaps make the connection of a lifetime?!
(Maybe this has already been raised as an idea, if so, I apologize I didn’t intent to “copy” from someone else.

4 1/2 years ago in highschool, I was sitting on a lunch table with my girlfriend at the time. She had her arm rapped around mine. In the distance a boy with a lunchbox was walking over with his head down, then he looked up at us. He stopped walking and stared for awhile, then he walked very fast away. The irritation he felt could be felt a mile away. 

The girl I was with looked in his direction when he was leaving, then looked at the table. 
Well it turns out that boy liked that girl, like alot. I saw him in the hallway even a few days after and he looked depressed, angry, and sad all at the same time.

We talked for about 8 months, I was obsessed.
Well it turns out that she didn't like me that much.

He's in a nice relationship. But here's the catch, he's not in a relationship with just any girl. He's with the girl that broke my heart. He of all people, is in a beautiful relationship with the girl that brought me to my knees.

Anytime I try to get away from this role, it is loneliness again. Not being able to fit in anywhere. I am just embarrassing. And somehow, just then people pay attention to me. Just to laugh, but at least they notice me. Then I cry. Because God cannot let me laugh at myself. I wanted someone to look up to me, or respect me. But I guess that is no longer possible. It feels so cold, why does no one want me...",2022-07-07 20:01:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647396623,4,/r/lonely/comments/vtrkr8/always_the_same/,,0,1,Always the same

1313,vtsayv,Which_Albatross_8085,"Hello everyone, I'm a 37m VERY SINGLE, lonely, depressed, stressed, and have no friends at all. 

I have been trying to figure a few things out over the last 12 years, since my last girlfriend cheated on me with her boss and I found them together in our bed when I came home from work early. 

A little back story. 
Then 
My ex (27f)  and I had been together for 7 years. I (28ml worked a wearhouse job making $18+ Fu benefits for both myself and her. She worked in child care. I gave her everything she needed and most of what she wanted, including a $3k 6karet diamond 4 piece set ( necklace, earrings, bracelet, and engagement ring). I never raised my voice, never hit her, always gave her the D when she wanted it, no matter when or where we were at. I PAID 95% of the bills short of her phone. I even bought her a car for our 2yr anniversary. 

One day I was at work, 4am - 4pm shift. We got done with all orders for that day and most of the next-days so the boss told us we could cut out 2 hours early. Since the next shift was already there. So I grabbed my stuff clocked out, and went home. 

As im pulling to the corner I see my girlfriends car in the driveway and a second car in my spot. Not thinking anything about it , I pull up in front of the neighbors house. I step of my car and hear music blaring from my house. The neighbor comes out and asks me if I could turn the music down and who was  the man the other car belongs to that followed my girlfriend?  I told.him I didn't know. But was about to find out. Before I turned the music down so they don't hear me come in. 

I Walk up to the front door and it's locked both top and bottom. So I unlocked the door and walked in being as quit as I could on tile floors. Thankfully the music was so loud they didn't hear me. So I walk to the back yard thinking they might be out back. Nope, no one there. So I check the basement to see if they where down stairs . I Walk down and no one there either. So at this point only two other places left in the house to look our bedroom and the study.  So I start walking towards the study and I start hearing her moaning as well as a guys voice telling her that her PUSSY was tighter today then it has been before. So I walked up to the bedroom door and it gets louder so being pissed off to hear my girlfriend cheating on me. I KICKED the door open as hard as I could. Walked in and found them both in shock, and to my surprise in was her boss, a short fat dude.  At this point my blood was boiling.... I walked over to the bed grabbed her boss by the hair and pulled him off her, and throw him AGAINST the dresser. They both freaked out, he grabbed his cloths and ran out the house slipping on the tile floor a couple of time. ( Thank God for the hidden cameras in Hall way, living room, and front door area. ) After following him out the front door an making sure he left , I went back to the bedroom and just straight up asked her why would she cheat on me and throw away a relationship of 7 years. Her response was so she could get a promotion at work , and because she wanted to and could. So I responded ok if that's the case then she can pack her shit, call her family to come pick her up , and she was to leave the $3k jewelry set I had just bought her the week before. As we as  the keys to her car that was in my name , as well as the house keys.  I walked out of the room grabbed her set of keys took of the car keys and the house keys , then I grabbed her wallet and took out the bank card and credit cards that had both our names on them as well as the check book. Then as she was getting dressed I called the bank, checked the account to see what in the account then had her removed for the account permanently. Then called the credit card companies and closed the cards . Cancelled the insurance on her car an removed the plates. Then I called her family and told them.they had to come get her and all her clothes and shit. Cause it was over between us, that I just caught her sleeping with her boss in our bed.  An that I was taking the car and the jewelry back so they would have to come get her that day. Because she wouldn't have access to the house when she leaves. 

Question for the women in this group. 

Why do most women cheat on their Boyfriend when the guy they are with gives them everything they could ever want and or need. An he treats you 1000% better than you do him. An he still treats you with respect, dignity, Love , loyalty, passion, and care. Has never raised their voice to you, never hit you. An puts your needs over and above his own an doing with out the things he needs so you can have the things you need and want ??",2022-07-07 20:32:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614028295,7,/r/lonely/comments/vtsayv/m37_lonely_depressed_stressed_friendless/,,0,11,"M37, Lonely, depressed, stressed, friendless"
1314,vtsoxv,No_Lake_1161,2 weeks ago my gf broke up with me. I'm not mad or sad at all. Just confused. She said that she was sorry and that we had to break up. Now that time has passed and I look back I can't help but think that she didn't feel bad at all. She wouldn't respond for 2 days when I texted her. She wouldn't even talk to me in school. But would go out of her way to add random people on discord get their numbers ect. I kind of knew that what we had was basically over when this started so I just rode the wave till it reached the shore of loneliness.

I am lonely, because of me.  I never learned how to care for and emotionally support people.  I never learned how to listen, and take my ego out of the scenario.  I always have played it passive, waiting for someone to come talk to me and validate me.  I have never thought of myself as someone who was worthy of talking to the more competent kid and pretty girls.  I go into every social scenario thinking ""no one likes me, I am worthless, I am not worthy of anyones time"".  I listen to those thoughts and then i isolate myself from people.  I feel like I am a burden to people, and i only bring sadness and pain wherever I go.  I am dead inside and aloof when talking to people.  ""why even bother doing any small talk if it's not going to lead to anything"" is what I play over and over in my mind.  I dont give myself any chance ever.

1345,vtxovt,realcesspoolofshit,"For approximately one year and nine months, I have been completely alone. I have no family and no friends. Besides the hardships that brings to my life, the loneliness is starting to become overwhelming to the point it is making me sick. I keep trying to remind myself humans weren't meant to be this alone and most people have at least one person to converse with. But I don't. And the few times I get the opportunity, it's almost out of pity. No one really wants to talk to me. 

I do try to date but it sometimes makes it worse. I've been talking to someone and we had a date and it was cool and fine. Some people feel a week of little to no conversation before the next date is fine but for me, it'll have been the one human willing to have spoken to me and I can't be desperate or I ruin future opportunities for conversation and human contact. 

And then I think about all the people they probably have to talk to. And I'm just one of 10 in their day and by the time they get around to me, they're not really looking for a deep conversation. Mostly they're just looking for me to fulfill the romance they're missing in their life because they're not inherently lonely. The same could be said for attempts at making friends - I'm even less of a priority and always someone they've just met so unless the conversation serves a purpose for them, they don't really want to chat either. 

My dream is for someone to truly empathize with this and put into action something that benefits me. That they realize I don't really have anyone and an hour of their time every week or so would be nice, but regular contact would be even better. Someone who really cares and can see the pain of being so alone. I'm tired of giving - I give and it just comes off as desperate. I can't just serve others for the greater good because I still suffer being alone when I'm not serving.

I noticed that they always kinda expect me to be there for them at a moments notice but whenever I really need them they won’t show up if it inconveniences them. I’m always the person they come to vent to but whenever I try to talk about what’s going on in my life the conversation quickly pivots back to them. I always consider them in my plans but they never do in return and I’m pretty sure they would prefer spending time with the other people in their life that they think are more fun.

They are all still bffs, but for sone reason that I will never know they just collectively agreed that I was no longer wanted around. I thought we’d be friends for life. It’s been three years and I’m still not healed. Then my boyfriend of 3.5 years left me for someone else, and the way he did it made it clear that he never even had basic human respect for me. I was nothing to the person who was my number 1. I’ve been trying to date since then. They lose interest after I meet them in person and weeks later I will see them posting with another girl. It doesn’t stop there. About a year ago I landed a job i was really excited about. After only two months I was “laid off.” I was told that they just couldn’t afford to keep me, but I recently saw them post about another person who is doing the position I was doing. Clearly I was replaced. I don’t know why. All this rejection and I never get explanations or reasonings. How will I ever change or improve if I don’t know what’s wrong with me?

I wonder where all the people gone from my life are doing now, where they are, have been, what their doing in this exact moment. It’s not easy to let go. Being stuck in that hole, the rut that reminds me of a never ending hallway with fluorescent beaming white lights that you keep walking down with a blank expression.

1407,vu661p,fupcupcyo,"I (f20) am feeling so much more lonely in the past month than i have in a while. This past October there was a rift between my best friend and I and it just hasn’t been the same since. She was one of my two close friends and losing her friendship has been such a struggle for me. I mourned the friendship but I was fine because I still had my one other close friend. Well, I did. I met my friend around 2 years ago online but we never got to meet until March. We both shared feelings romantically for each other but I was hesitant to start anything out of fear of harming our friendship, and since he was basically the only friend I had left I didn’t want to risk it. I told him this and he heavily reassured me that if we went on a date and it was weird then we would pretend it never happened, so we met and the date was great! We saw each other around once a week until the week after my birthday. I didn’t think too much of it until he kept dodging my questions when I’d ask when we could see each other again, or when I’d say I missed him he’d just not reply or change the subject. Last month he didn’t text me for hours and when he did it was a simple text saying he didn’t think we should see each other again. I wasn’t completely surprised but what he said next really hurt me. I asked him why the change and he told me I didn’t meet the expectations he had for me and he just didn’t fall for me like he thought he would. This was one of my biggest worries that I expressed to him back in March, and he told me that he had no expectations set for me and it just really broke my heart when he sent me that text. We went from talking every day to no contact in less than 12 hours and I’m just so bummed about it. Now I have no friends and am back on dating apps but I am just so miserable and lonesome. I just want to hide in my room forever at this point. I have a private snapchat story where I sometimes mention how lonely I am in the secret hope someone on it will invite me to do something, but it never happens. I’m going into my junior year of college and have no friends or anyone there to do things with and it’s all so disappointing. People tell me I’m fun to be around and good person but when it comes to hanging out I’m just left out. :( I just wish it was easier to accept the loneliness.",2022-07-08 08:51:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629256750,4,/r/lonely/comments/vu661p/disappointed_and_lonely/,,0,2,disappointed and lonely

1426,vu8k0q,ExistingCar3248,"17M - I've always been a bit of a loner but never a downer, happy to meet new people, always smiling and laughing.

Ever since 2020 my mental health has been spiralling, not sure why, but I started drinking hard liquor frequently and smoking weed.

I still had a good relationships with my family and close friends I talked to daily but near the end of the year I got into a fistfight with my alcoholic+abusive father and beat him up.

I left home for a couple weeks and when I came back I started distancing myself from my friends and family, stopped going to school and got fired from my job. By mid-2021 I was planning on killing myself and my family was getting very worried.

I ended up getting another job to keep myself occupied and to save up money but I was still directionless and would break down crying on a daily basis.


Fast forward to now: I've lived away from home for 3-4 months now working full time as a dishwasher and saving money up to go travelling. My friends have moved on with there lives and most of family aside from my parents; don't talk to me.

I love my family&amp;friends and want fix what I had but it seems insurmountable haha.. I still have 3 friends who care about me but we don't speak often, I know I could rent an apartment with them next year once they graduate tho.

Anyway...
I think I have 3 options for the future at the moment.

1. Rent with some friends, focus on advancing a career in cooking and dedicate a solid amount of time to powerlifting to get fit.

2. Live with my parents again and focus on finishing the rest of highschool (2 years I would have to repeat) so I could potentially go to university if I wanted.

3. Get a job on a farm as a Shepard, focus on learning how to hunt and possibly live in the forest for a bit.

I care for them yes!
Ofc!
I care for them and I love them the most but I did hurt them which made me cost that valubule bond.
That day I've lost two valuable friends in my life.
And the past hurts
Yes ofc it's been 9 months but still I'm still brooding over that past thing. I and it hurts and haunts me. Like nightmares.
I've been honest to people from that moment ever since.
Recently I've got into issues with people because of few of my faults and few of my friends faults.
May be i can't make friends. 
I can never make anyone as my friends because of my past. May be the mistakes rub them and they get like aghh this guy has done such nasty things and leave me in middle! 
May be thats what happening to me.. 
May be thats what happening to me and my new friend whom I've got attached with. 
May be they thought iam a bs person of all the things I've did and I guess I can never be enough to live happy..

having family issues in middle of all this. Is just like a catalyst for a nuclear bomb that's gonna explode..


I'm losing myself again and I really can't seem to feel anything. I've been facing this issue since March and in May It seemed like I got better and then in the half way of May and early June, I was hit with a brick on my face, and I couldn't process anything. I went through one of my toughest phases in life and now I'm in the deep rabbit hole of darkness or better call Abyss, which I've just came out in May.
I really can't sleep, focus, eat, or do normal chores. Iv became more and more lazy, can't find energy to do things, and im not doing good in my academics, single digits in my first internals and bunch of scribbles in second. Now I'm having finals and I can't even focus on my studies like I used to do before. I feel like I'm such a horrible person and I have theses infinite loads of sadness carrying around like atlas carrying the world, and I can't do it Any more.. I just wanna be happy, some one to listen and understand and help me through this.. Please someone help me through this

I actually have a lot of things which I want to share rn but all I just need is someone or some people who can actually listen. I've tried to explain this to my friends but no one cared.


TLDR;
I'm losing myself and falling deep into a dark Abyss which I've been before, I feel lonely and miserable and depressed can't find energy to do things, doing worse, having so much to share but no one to listen to

Edit:-
Day 2:-
It's not getting better.
It's getting even worse...
I feel like I have black holes in my eyes
I feel like my head is filled with parasites..
I just dont wanna feel like this anymore
I feel I'm a baggage of sadness
I feel like atlas, like I feel like I'm lifting a heavy weight which I'm using my both hands to lift but the weight is too heavy, and I feel like I'm covered with chains, strong heavy chains which are preventing me from falling into the dark deepest pits, or Tartarus or dark infinite Abyss, which I can never recover from
The chains which are holding me from all sides are also the chains causing me excruciating pain and slowly disintegrating and rusting and rotting that they're slowly getting loose.

I'm trying to move on from all these past incidents but looks like I'm having PTSD, cuz whenever someone even talk to me in raised voice I get all the flashbacks of harrasment and I starts to shiver.

I don't wanna think about her and let her win, even she is not any more in my life. I just wanna move on and live my life. But, sometimes I get these nightmares of her, that she is hitting me and rest of the people from house are laughing on me.

also, it’s like i get along so well with so many people at the very first moment i know them, then the mud slides off of the wall. why does everyone else chop it up so much with one another all of the time but as soon as i try to enter the conversation, they leave? it makes me feel like everyone secretly hates me and i have absolutely no idea what i did wrong.

Either way, before feeling left out and ghosted by them, I was a completely different person than I am now, I was organized, diligent and would often crack jokes with my friends. Now, I got so much lazier, always procrastinating on the small tasks, moody, messy and just can't find the energy to meet or talk to anyone. 

Am I the only one with this problem? Is this normal after being lonely for so long? And how do I move on from this?",2022-07-08 15:34:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646660535,24,/r/lonely/comments/vudi2g/does_chronic_loneliness_changes_your_personality/,,0,30,Does chronic loneliness changes your personality?

Wondering how many of you have this issue, and how you deal with it? 

Like all of you here, I am dealing with feelings of loneliness every day, lack of friends, no close family, etc... but normally  I can kind of deal with this, or over-ride these feelings/dark thoughts by entertaining myself with books, games and/or Netflix, but lately even that isn't helping.

I just spend 35 minutes watching previews of different shows and movies on Netflix, but couldn't settle on something to watch. My 'Watch List' is also growing but I just ignore it...

How do you snap out of this? Or do you just accept it and wait for it to pass?

For the past few years, I've been ignored, made fun of, laughed or even bullied by the people that I'm surround with. They pick on me for everything that I like, always try to correct wether I'm in the wrong or not and pretty much and pretty much looking down on me 24/7. 

I haven't the slightest clue how to get out of this. I don't have anyone else. Most of my family doesn't know a simple fact about me, I barely know my father and so only my dear Mother is here for me, but I want anything but her to be sad. I don't want her to be stressed, none of that. She is to pure of a soul to be involved in this..

I don't know what to do.. I'm not good at many things, even if I'm, my 'friends' never have a good say about. It doesn't matter how much love I put into my arts ( I love to draw and paint, but mainly in black and white, due to my lack of colorvision), or how hard I work on anything, it doesn't make a difference.

I don't feel appreciated one bit, and I haven't been able to get through a day without having a meltdown at least at one point.

I've come to hate to move out. And honestly, I'd rather live another life sometimes.. most of my happiness is all thanks to my Mom, for accepting me, and trying to make me smile, even if she doesn't know everything.

Do you Girls/Guys/Ladiens/Men have any tips on how to improve my life or simply how to move on? I'd appreciate every tip.. and to those who have gave my definitely not short post a read, I thank you.

Found the one and spend nearly every day together. Best person in the world for me. Loved life and loved her more. We broke up for complex reasons and I can't get back with her even if she wanted to. 

I'm 31 and live at home still as it's common in my country as rent is so high and it is better to live at home and save (plan was for me and her to buy on 2 to 3 years so now that's gone. May live her until my 40s). I have 1 close friend who is married and I don't see much. Was always lonely before I met my ex and just can't believe I'm back to where I was before I met her. Waited gor her to come along my whole life and just back to where I was before her again. I go out to town on the weekend and get drunk and talk to strangers to just feel alive. Otherwise my weekend would be just  scrolling tiktok like my evenings. I feel like the walking dead most of the time. 

The rest of the week I just work and feel stressed and tired. Just lie in bed on my phone once I get home until I can sleep which is always way too late. I was mostly used to this life for my whole 20s. It's been 8 months now and I haven't adapted back to it yet. Still not over her either. Cried about it all the other day. Thought I was past that.

Well, I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately and I think part of why so many guys don’t want to date me is because I won’t have sex unless I’m in a committed relationship. The grooming introduced me to the kink community way too early and for a long time I only associated sex with kinky sex, and now I have a hard time having sex or doing sexual things casually. I’ve even told guys this and they date me but after we have sex they soon end it because thats all they wanted. I just think so many guys just want sex and it’s really frustrating trying to date. My bios all say no hookups but they all ignore it and ask anyways and every time it happens I get more discouraged. One of my exs loved that I was so knowledgeable in kink stuff but I didn’t always want it rough and harsh but thats all he did and it made me feel even more used.

This leaves me with no best friend in the world and especially not in the group. I feel that all my friends are closer to each other than they are to me and it’s a really bad feeling since I care for them all so much and feel I try hard to maintain our friendships.

What do I do? How do I get over this feeling? They’re my friends of 13 years… I don’t want to lose them because I feel distant.

I picked up sports and i play volleyball, badminton and tennis every weeks to stay in a good shape, i also on weekends go for some jogging

I've worked during summer to pay myself a pc good enough to play some games and enjoy my hobbies. 

I've tried to be more social with people, trying to join groups of people and trying to make friends, i was barely successful since most people already knew each other because they are from the same school while im from an empty countryside.

I worked my ass off to graduate, got accepted into my university with a 16 in both english and oral exam. No one came to help me and instead i (when i could) ,ent out of my way to help other people struggling 

Because of acne and facemasks my face got riddled with pimples and blackheads, i've been using creams to get rid of them for the past months with some success but still have some areas where it's just a huge landmine. 


So why is there zero progress? Im naturally shy and an introvert yet i've tried my best with people to come off as natural and confident but never got more than just some smalltalk.

I have few very close friends, but i still feel very lonely
I can meet them, or talk to them but thats just temporary even though I am so close to them


I cry almost every day this year (like literally 99% of the year, )

Today I was at the mall and I cry out of sudden. I can’t stop crying
I am so sad

But you know this year, I started working out, taking personal training sessions, running, eat clean, writing journal 
had therapy sessions, 

but those just helped me for a short moment

heartbreak is difficult

I usually just fake most of the things I’m doing or saying to see if i can fit in but it’s hard for me. I don’t know it’s just so boring for me i guess i put on this fake face for my friends to see what it’s like to have friends. But recently I’m beginning to lose interest in stuff. After hanging out with them i come back to my room and just sit there questioning why didn’t I have fun. I’m just so bored of this idk. I don’t really enjoy things too much or motivated at all. My parents used to think i was shy but in reality i just didn’t see the point for me to have friends i guess. I wish i could, i see them all having a good time and having fun and then there’s me just looks at them.

1600,vuw01r,flame22x,"I(20M) have been chatting with this girl for a whole year during the pandemic (2021), countless nights and midnights watching movies together (most of the times  just the two of us), spend New Years together on a call on discord (cameras , champagne and all that silly stuff), and as time went by it seemed okay to go out since more and more people were getting the vaccine. we live in the same city, study in the same uni, everything seemed alright. 

We met before in a mutual friend's party, but never met just the two of us, so I finally decide to ask her out, it was near her birthday so i decided to get her something a few days earlier, as i didnt know if she was actually going to celebrate it or not, so i made up a story that we should meet up as it was something really important, i was going to surprise her.

The day comes and i wait at the place we agreed on, with the gift on my hand. An hour passes , but it seemed alright since she said she had a fame of being late . 

2 hours, and i start to get worried so i text her to see if shes safe, nothing, i get really anxious so i go and talk with my friends that were on a discord call to see if i could calm down a bit, still no reply from her.

On the third hour i was ready to give up and face reality, she messages me, says she is okay and that she is on her way. I wait a little more, still not there, I call her,  and then she asks me if i could go meet her somewhere else (a place i didnt know how to get to).

I was already so pissed off and upset, but i still found a way to get there and... No one is there... I still try to confirm if i was at the right place, I was.

 I then realised that during that phone call, she was already with someone else, about 3 or more people judging by my impression, so i ask her just to confirm if she was with someone, she confirms. I ran out of patience, then go to back my house, devasted, told her that i had stuff to do, she then asks ""What was so important that you had to tell me ? Can we talk about it on discord ?"" ,i say ""We deal with this later"", as i end the conversation. 

A couple days pass, then i messaged her to wish her ""Happy Birthday"" despite still being upset, as she still meant something to me, even if not romatically. My birthday came a few days later, she didnt remember. No one did actually, even my friends.

She never apologised, she didnt message me once since that day, and i still have that present with me, and i dont know what i will do with it, for now it just seems like a reminder of the day that i got stood up twice in the same day, while trying to make a surprise.

The worst part is, I am not mad anymore, in fact i still want to be friends with that person, we had a lot of fun despite only being through discord. In my head she is not as bad as i made her look through this post.

I dont have many friends, but im well aware that im forgetable, almost invisible. And even if some people, like my friends, treat me like i dont exist sometimes, i forgive them. I do it because i know that without them, i have no one. No love, no friends, nothing. 

I wonder if what i'm doing is right, or is there something truly fucked up in my head ?

Sorry for the long text, i just wanted to get this off my chest a little bit.

For all the other people my age I’m basically like some random pole standing randomly in the room. No one talks to me except when there’s no one else. I’m the last choice. I’ve been ‘friends’ with a group of people for almost a year now and guess what role I play? The random pole standing next to them that gets nothing else than a “hi” , a hug and a handshake and gets to stand and listen for the rest of the time. Whenever I talk I just get a faint smile or a slight nod or just a glance. I don’t know maybe I’m just not funny or interesting enough. 

I very rarely get invited anywhere. And when I do, I get left out anyway. I always have to listen to them making plans in front me which I’m not invited to.

My only online friend with whom I talked with everyday told me they wanted a break from talking with people and I accepted that. Later on I found out they’re still talking with another online friend of theirs. 

My family complains about me 24/7 anyway. Mostly because of my mental illnesses and my laziness. And also just plainly because of the way I am. Because I fight back.

How this happened: Working weekends makes it hard to socialize IRL so I spend a lot of time online talking to people in different time zones. After covid, I became even more isolated because my favorite coffee shop and bar closed down and my meetup groups dissolved.

I met a couple of these internet friends in person and got close to their extended families. These people are kinder to me than my own family. We talk almost every day, despite the time difference. 

But I still get lonely. I come home from work to an empty apartment. Holidays are spent in my room eating microwaved meals. If I want to do something in my city, I have to go by myself. 

If it was just state borders dividing us, I would have moved the day I got home from my first visit. But you can't move countries without valuable job skills, and my standard of living and safety would likely decrease if I left.

Now don't get me wrong, I did make a lot of friends in secondary, but none I can really hang out during the school holidays. There was this one girl I met, we became great friends, basically we met at art class as she sat opposite me and then we started to become good friends. I did give her my Discord tag so we could stay in touch during the holidays, but she never friended me. She also announced she was leaving the school, I even made her a goodbye card, but she left school a few days earlier than what I thought. 

Now don't get me wrong, I still have most of my primary school friends, but sadly the only one who hates me is my childhood best friend. We shared a lot of common interests, we played after school, and stayed best friends for around 9 years. In 2019, I joined Discord, and in 2020 me and her became friends on it. Then she started to cut ties with me all because of my immaturity back then and she said that she doesn't care if I changed. Sucks. Many other people I wanna hang out with are either usually not available or have moved on from life. 

All I want is to go to the beach with some friends, is that too much to ask?",2022-07-09 20:15:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593873106,1,/r/lonely/comments/vva4ge/i_wish_i_had_friends/,,0,4,I wish I had friends.

My birthday's over but i still feel depressed and lonely after spending it alone. The family that lives in another city called me and sent me a card by mail.

The annoying thing now is im over my social anxiety. (Sort of) im really bad with words but i care less abput other peoples thoughts now.

1763,vvfgj2,lisasguy,"My wife, Lisa, passed on this day in 2020, at 12:15 pm.  One of the many horrible moments of the day actually began the night before when she is a flash jumped out of a dead sleep grabbed her throat and passed out.  She was dead though. No question. So the only thing I knew to do was cpr, and I did cpr, chest compressions, the whole nine yards and after what seemed time infinite, the cpr worked. It brought us back together. Through a series of unfortunate events, like the extreme till covid began talking at around this time, hospitals are not interested in taking patients in if vitals checked out. So they refused, even though they're was something clearly wrong. But I brought her back and for that I was crushed and grateful and fill of rage and guilt all at once. Fast forward to the next mid morning. She was conscious, although extremely tired and everytime she made sudden movements, I my heart jumped into my throat. But she seemed to be recovering. At 12:02 pm, july 9th, 2020, the same thing happened again, so I got the paramedics on the way while performing cpr, but this time I failed. I failed the absolute loveliest person I've ever known, I failed her cousins, brother, aunt's, grandmother's and sister. The guilt in it was enough that I would of finally had the courage, no question, to take my own life. But she didn't not deserve the man she loved from the top of her heart, from the very tip of the tallest sky scrapers, down to the submarines. She deserved so much I couldn't give her and I don't think I could forgive myself for that. But she definitely didn't deserve to let me taint her memory by being a coward. I am lost without her, no question. And the colors she used to appreciate so much in her paint, in her world, I fight to see those colors, instead of the chill grey that clenches my heart and has overpowered all my senses. I've never felt so alone in a world that no longer makes any sense, a world where my dreams have been snuffed out by that very cold.

He would get anxious and overthink but I'd always be there to reassure him that i won't leave. He told me I was different cause I made him comfortable to where he could talk about his trauma. He talked about me to his Co workers and friends.  He stopped talking to me yesterday and all day today cause turns out he was talking to his ex the entire time. Should've known since they just broke up like a few months ago. He called me for an explanation and basically just kept saying idk and that I was a rebound that he used and feels bad for.  Everything I overthought was true. His ex was spending the weekend with him and was hanging out with him while on the phone with me. Turns out they were gonna get back together and he didn't know that she would be 100% into it but she is so now they are trying again cause he loves her. Anyway I wish I had more of an explanation but there's no point, I'm always being used and am the rebound. How will I ever trust anyone and get someone to love me.

1770,vvgitz,Available_Ad_3008,"Fuck it. lets post a fucking story... today I was out with a group of friend, about 14 people mixed women and men. I have been alone for so long and feel like no woman will ever actually like me. it ended with me ditching my group of friends to meet a hooker. I had not had sex in over 2 years before tonight, I know that it have been harder due to the pandemic but even before that it was very, very rare that I got the attention of a woman. this does kinda sound like some fucked up incel shit but at times I feel like no woman will ever like me.´

In my working life I'm very successful and don't work to access, in a high demand week I might work 45 hours but usually I try to keep it below 40. I make fairly more than most in their early 30s. I still play sports on the regular and keep in shape for that purpose. I have very briefly dated a girl or two that broke it of with me because they would not believe me that I actually was working out for sports and not just had them as a ""side piece"", I have never had a ""side piece"" I have barely even hade a ""main girl"" in all my life. I mean these two girls would have been two out of three I have ever had more than one date with...

So that leads to that I probably have a shit personality, makes sense to me. but I do have a large friend group that is always up for hanging out. Why do they want to hang out with me if I'm so fucking unattractive to date? They keep praising me but I'm still not worth dating?

it is not uncommon for me to feel like absolute shit like someone people like to use and don't actually like. what is wrong with me? Why do women call me out as a ""player"" while even more often deem me not attractive enough to even go on a date with?

I don't even know what is wrong with me but I just want to be close with someone, I just want to share my life with someone. Friends are good and all but I want something more. I'm not looking for someone special I'm just looking for someone that I can share what I have with and we can be there for each other when each one of us achieve something we have worked hard fore.

Not exactly a big fight and split type thing but more of a mutual agreement.  The feelings just aren't there anymore and we haven't acted like a married couple for years.  No actual plans for divorce or anything as of yet because we probably couldn't afford that anyhow.  Might as well keep getting the tax breaks.  Also not moving out because we can barely afford the one place.

Anyhow, I know it won't be long before I launch myself deep down into a pit of depression.  I can already feel it.

People will always lie to you and say you're pretty or attractive because they don't want to be mean but I wish people would just be honest so I could move on. I know that they're lying because if these things were true I wouldn't feel so overwhelmingly lonely

I don't believe any man has ever truly been attracted to me and that just makes me feel awful. I'm almost 22 and painfully inexperienced. It hurts to see everyone around you get so much attention when you're always overlooked, not even romantically, just in all aspects of life. 

It's not like I don't try. I go to a HUGE university and I joined clubs and one time even sat out in the grass w a ""random convo welcome"" sign as I worked. I'm kind to everyone I meet. I'm an introvert, but still talkative enough. I try to dress up and wear makeup, which isn't me acting out of character because I genuinely enjoy those things. I have many hobbies that I think are really unique. But those things just never work for me. I feel like I have to work 20x harder than the normal person to even be seen and it's still never enough

My friends say it's because I don't put myself out there or I'm too judgemental but they don't know the truth about everything. I'm never with anyone because nobody ever likes me and that's as simple as it gets. They act like it's so easy and maybe it is for them but I need them to be realistic.

1833,vvlk7v,[deleted],One person can only take so much. I’ve lost my grandpa and my dad recently. They were my two parents to me. I’ve gotten more and more unstable since watching my dad die in March after being on a vent for a month in a half. I cannot take it. I fell into a state of isolation. My own family turned their backs on me. The past two weeks have been just as bad or even worse than March. My mom called the cops on me for a suicidal comment despite years of it happening on and off and knowing how it would effect me. Three days in a row of them being at our house. My brother mocked my mental illness and breakdowns in my face. I punched him in the shoulder because I couldn’t take it. He called my mom she called my uncle and they both had me arrested and put in jail. I still feel the handcuffs on my wrists and the cold hard bed breaking down in front of the inmates. The mugshot. All of it. Since being let out I cannot see my brother or family. Despite the provoking and despite that he’s hit me too even recently. I cannot see my dog the only things that’s brought me happiness since my dad died. I have no friends left no family and no support. I cannot be home and have very little savings. I’ve been in a dark hotel room breaking down every day non stop for two weeks now since then. I have to go to court in august. What was already the worst year of my life has gotten worse than I could ever imagine. I’m so close to death and feel that it’s coming this coming week. If not sooner.

I'm not getting better, my 20 yr marriage is over, and soon I will for the first time in my entire life have the freedom to move anywhere, not be tied to anything.  I've wanted that my entire life.  But now I'm terrified.  Feel like I'm just free falling, that soon I'll be alone and even worse mental health-wise, older, and in some place that I guess I just choose off a map and figure out.  I just don't think I can live in the US anymore, although I'm not sure there are too many great alternatives. 

and the worst part is that I just can't deal with so many people anymore.  It's getting harder and harder.  I want so bad to try to help someone have a better day cause we're all going through hard stuff, but half the time I get so angry or stressed I end up making someone's day worse.

Can't stop craving romantic affection/attention for the life of me, to the point where it's eaten away at me on the inside for years. Probably just a broken creep. Why was I born to be an observer, constantly reminded everyday of what I don't have?

You could argue what I've seen isn't true or that I'm ""not seeing the full story"", but when I walk out of my house, when I go and be around other people, there is a 6th sense that I feel which just immediately isolates me from everyone else, and it's ""you're different, and not in the cool way"".

I can see it, it's in the way I talk, I move, I interact with others. It's in our posture, our body language, our facial expressions. It's in our lifestyles, our abilities, our weaknesses. The only difference between me and you? We simply have different privileges and deficits. And my deficits kill me emotionally. My social anxiety, my (likely) Asperger's, my laziness, my feelings. All of them destroy me, and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel that is supposed to encourage me to keep going.

And it is selfish, because I have caring friends, a loving family (even if they don't really understand me, they support what I do), and a lot of things that bring me joy. But for whatever reason, being 23 without an ounce of connected, intimate romance has caused me a lot of internal pain.

Despite using the app for a few years, this is my first full post. I’ve only ever commented on others before.

So I broke up with a girlfriend of 9 years last September, which was awful but I strangely never wanted her back. It wasn’t right and I do think it’s a good thing that it happened. I’m 28 now and starting to panic at the idea of reaching 30 alone.

However, I made the mistake of jumping into dating fairly quickly because I couldn’t stand being on my own. Anytime I start to properly date someone, I suddenly panic and become withdrawn and end up breaking it off. The problem with this is I end up feeling worse because I just can’t stand to think I’ve upset someone. 

I was just wondering if there’s anyone in similar situations and how you cope?

I sometimes feel like I might struggle to find someone who’s right for me down to the fact I’m quite different to most people I meet. It’s strange because I get a lot of compliments and people seem to like me, but my self esteem is non existent and I will often be quite upset when someone says nice things about me because I don’t believe them myself.

Now 6 years after the divorce I am still stuck, spinning in the mud, I am unhappy with my lot, I also have other problems which pull me down, Crohn's disease being the chief of them, if you don't know much about that basically it can be quite painful and debilitating at times and is very good at making you feel low, however I still aim to be positive, I know I want to be, I know i can improve my lot and i'm really not desperate for material wealth, but i do want to get back to social wealth, i just don't know how, or cannot see it through, or i back down all the time even after striving to get there.

I know i can be outgoing, a good friend and funny with a good sense of humor and a good ability to make friends, I do feel shame in my situation my small run down home, the fact i am aging \[36\] and I am no longer proud of my appearance as i used to be, tbh the mirror is not my friend, simply a disappointment, but in that I know that I am not alone, I've seen so many others feeling this way, I want to change, I want to move on, make new friends and if i was ever so lucky find a compatible long term companion, but again, I cannot move, the fight in me is gone, the ambition and motivation has all but diminished, i get trapped in my mind, fantasizing about new beginnings, about  finding real and true friends and simply enjoying the life i have, that's all i want and in my mind its so simple... so why am I unable to act?

I dunno, I guess i just want to voice and see if any help comes of it, either way to all of you lonely souls, you may be lonely but you're not alone, you're not useless, worthless or ugly, you are simply human as are we all and there are so many of us, surely we have the power to pull each other up, My heartfelt and best wishes to your day &amp; in your life.",2022-07-10 14:34:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639858984,2,/r/lonely/comments/vvsrhd/my_own_worst_enemy/,,0,9,My own worst enemy

And my thoughts are driving me crazy, really crazy..to the point of doing stupid stuff crazy. And i feel so ffn lonely. No one texts or calls because i need to be the first to do that.

It hit me today that this time last year I was happily getting to know my fwb without a care in the world. I was braving the new frontier of deep friendship for the first time ever, and we became far closer than I imagined possible. She was a little needy; there was a guaranteed text every hour and I felt smothered at times. But it was better than the absolute nothingness I'm experiencing. Again.

She found a serious partner which is fair-play, I can't criticise that. But her colossal presence in my life reduced to nothing in the blink of an eye, and it feels like my whole life progress has reset to zero; I'm in exactly the same position as before we'd met: Work, come home, speak to nobody, yet see everyone else happily hanging out together.

The worst part - by a fucking lightyear - is getting a taste of how good life can be, before falling back into this endless void. I honestly have no idea how I even managed to escape it - luck had smiled at me for the second time in my 29 years of life. The last time it did that, I was 21. I don't think I can wait 8 more years; I need it now. The nothingness is so much worse after you've managed to escape.

I'm putting myself out there and meeting swathes of new people - I've joined a running group with over 100 people, not with the intent of meeting people, but embracing that as a possibility. I've chatted to several people, but I don't know what to actually ""do."" The fwb thing just seemed to happen by itself; I literally just showed up. I suppose part of me is chasing that and hoping I'll find it again.

Oh, and if anyone has tips on how to meet people in my age group (25-35) that'd be appreciated, because it seems everyone else in their late 20's just walked off the edge of the earth.",2022-07-10 15:40:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595923940,1,/r/lonely/comments/vvu43u/ah_shit_here_we_go_again/,,0,1,"Ah shit, here we go again."

1895,vvuhye,snugglebunbun,"I really don't have anyone other than my therapist that I can confide in to tell them how I truly feel. After some certain incidents, I feel exceptionally lonely &amp; I am having passive suicidal thoughts. Honestly, I have been feeling this type of way since winter 2021. They say it gets better, but does it really? I'm still pretty sour about COVID happening because I blame that for ruining many things for myself &amp; for others.

Ever since I was little, I could not wait to grow up &amp; be able to do whatever I wanted to do, but I remember telling adults this at a young age &amp; they would hit me back with, ""trust me, you don't want to grow up."" I remember passing those comments off as, ""whatever!"", but now I can see what they mean.

It doesn't help that I am also not great at maintaining friendships &amp; relationships which also puts me in this pickle. At the moment, I would say I only have one ""reliable"" friend (note that the word ""reliable"" is in quotation marks because they really aren't *that* reliable, but they are one of the only friends I can shoot the shit with).

It doesn't help that my hobbies &amp; interests are geared more towards the older community since I am trying to meet people closer to my age (I know that this comment sounds ageist &amp; I have met great older people, but I do think it would be nice to meet others that are closer to my age). It also doesn't help that I am emotionally unavailable hence why another reason it is hard for me to maintain friendships &amp; relationships or getting past the acquaintance level.

I really do question whether I am a good person because looking at others my age seems to be in great friendships &amp; relationships &amp; then I'm just trying to get by. I know that it's not good to compare yourself to others which is what I am exactly doing, but that doesn't mean that I'm not lonely. Overall, I just wanted to jot something down about how I am feeling since this is an anonymous community &amp; I would appreciate the constructive criticism &amp; feedback if possible.

I am a 18 year old guy who will attend the last year of high school in a couple of months and I genuinely don't have a single friend. I kinda have a bad relationship with my parents, no siblings or any relatives near me and I have no friends since I joined high school. I am the kind of person who is very shy and Introverted at first and takes time to open up to others. I would consider myself an interesting and funny person but at first I'm just boring, unintersting and very insecure. Due to this bad attitude I always struggled to meet and know new people, since I was a kid.  In middle schools, thanks to an old friend know in elementary school, I managed to join a group and making a few friends. I was happy with them and i hanged out pretty frequently. But for various reason I stopped meeting with them. I started high school alone and in 4 years I didn't really make any friend or open up with my classmates at all. In the last year and half I think I started talking ""more"" with 3 or 4 classmates but I do not enjoy talking with them and I am sure that tey don't have fun talking to me either. We talk about school stuff, nothing interesting, just to pass time at school. We have nothing in common except going in the same school, different hobbies and different homur. I think a person like me  could never really open up in this situation and right now I actually don't want to since I want to meet new people outside school. Also the covid lockdown period has worsened the situation ( I don't want to blame external factors, since it's just my fault if I'm in this situation but the covid thing surely didn't help me). During lockdown I was appartelty okay, I spent more time online but after all it was not so different from my regular life. But when everyone came back to regular life I felt very bad for several weeks. Everyone was happy because they could see again their loved ones and friends and hang out with them again. I felt lonely than ever. Last year when I turned 17 I was having a hard time for various reasons and as you can imagine I was alone so I promised myself that I would killed myself if I was still lonely by the time I would turn 18. My 18th birthday was two months ago, and as you can imagine I didn't kill myself, I decided that no matter how thing could get bad I will keep going forward. But still, nothing changed, my 18th birhtday was one of the worst day in my life and I cried for the whole week. I am very young but I wasted and I'm still wasting the best time of my life probably. Some people may think that's better staying alone istead of having bad people around but honestly at this point I am just tired of being alone. I feel like my entire existence is pointless and I would like to restart everything. I hate my attitude, now I'm not just shy and introverted. I have low self-esteem, I'm scared of people's opinion and I'm socially akward. I need love, I don't care if it's the love of my life or just ""friendship"", I just want to be considered because right now I feel like I don't exist. The goal for this summer was to know new people and hang out with them. But honeslty I don't know how to start and I already wasted more than a month. I also considered to know people near me online and then meet them but I don't know if it's a good idea. I am not into sport and my hobbies are kinda  ""sedentary"" (idk how to tell it in english), but I actually don't like staying at home and I would love going out with someone. Anyways I live near a big city so the possibilities are endless, but I don't know how to start.I am scared of wasting another summer but I really want to change myself and this situation by the end of the summer.  

I would like to get some advice from someone who has gone through a similar experience (or anyone to be honest). If you read all of this thank you again. Sorry if I was repetitive or confused but english is not my first language and as I said its the first time I spoke about it to anyone, I actually feel ashemed of this situation and myself",2022-07-10 17:28:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/vvwfrg/18_and_completely_alone_im_reaching_my_limit_and/,,0,4,"18 and completely alone, I'm reaching my limit and I don't know how to get out of this situation"

I snapped and i told her that shes been treating me like shit.

1928,vvyp38,Masny_Basek,"Idk is that good subreddit for this but:

We both 15

I love her so much, I love her that much that I could kill myself for her, I could give her my heart if she needed. I love texting with her, if I could do only 1 thing forever then I would just text her forever. She is super sweet, funny. I just love her so much

But i hate my self. Not cuz im ugly, not cuz I dont have perfect body. I have my self cuz I love her. I hate myself for texting her everyday. She likes to ask me some questions, and if she would ask me what I like and hate then I would say what im saying here. I hate loving her, I hate myself for loving her beautiful smile I could look at for hours, I hate hate myself for loving her perfect brown eyes. 

Most of it all I hate myself for thinking that one day she will text me that she loves me. I know it wont happen but i hope it will. I am addicted to her. I tried many Times to forget about her, to stop texting to her, but I cant, cuz I think that she will forgot about me and conection we have.

The funniest thing is that she maybe love me. She is very sweet to me, she is always happy, she likes texting to me (she told me that many times). She send me her pics and I send her mine. I think we got great, even amazing connection. 

But I cant feel love. Maybe its some yk trauma of being the oldest brother and of that, that my parents havent care about me. I feel i love her, but I cant feel that anyone love me. If I say to someone i love her then I know its truth I can feel it, but when someone would say to me that (no one ever did that lmao) I wouldnt believe it, for me it would be just dumb words that someone just said not knowing what they mean.

All I want is to her anserwing faster, and her starting conversation, and to tell me that she loves me. I would be happiest guy on entire earth if it would happen, but it wont. 
And I hate myself for thinking that it will happen

Im 21F, have been in an 3 year online relationship with a guy who ghosted me 6 times. Told me all this stuff about how he wanted to marry me. I stopped talking to him because I couldnt deal with the pain anymore. He still tries contacting me.

Then met another guy online, everything seemed fine, asked me about my day every day, said i looked beautiful, that he enjoys talking to me, even sends video of him partying with friends.

Then a guy at school asks me on a date, I didnt think I could invest in him emotionally since I was talking to this guy online. I told this to him while rejecting him. I instantly regretted my decision. I felt this was a bad decision because I realised im talking to guys online and chance is always small it becomes something real. My ultimate goal is marriage with dating.

I sticked with the guy online because I started getting confused in my mind. A while later I found out on social media he has a girlfriend. I felt really bad and sad. He stopped initiating convos with me after. I stopped talking to him

So I went to the guy at school and asked if hes still open for a date. I texted him about it. He was quite unresponsive and I sent him then a text about that I feel hes mad at me and that hes distant.
He then said I shouldnt worry, he said he likes me but at the moment cant date because of finals. He told me lets stay friends for now and build on that. He was always nice to me and at school too and called me babe and put his arm around my shoulder. After school I walked with him and his friend to the metro and we parted ways.

After that he texted me a meme and we had a conversation about it. Then the next day i sent him a youtube video which reminded me of him, its about his home country. He is online but its been 2 day and he still didnt respond. I know he often text his best friend. Its now summer holidays. Im getting the feeling he lost interest. Or am I overthinking? Im so sad. I just want to marry ssomeone and be in relationship and have love, it truly gives me more happiness. I cant get it somehow. I dont want to go on dating sites, it feels unnatural. I want to build something substantial with someone in real life.",2022-07-10 19:19:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655529868,3,/r/lonely/comments/vvytn0/very_unlucky_in_love_what_am_i_doing_wrong/,,0,14,"Very unlucky in love, what am I doing wrong?"

1951,vw12ri,gearsboxvti,"This month is the anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide, an unthinkable  tragedy happened in 1995, where more than 8000 people were slaughtered  during the Bosnia War, although I think it was more of an aggression against civilians than a civil  war, from 1992 to 1995. It wasn't the only massacre. During this four  years other atrocities happened like concentration camps, mass rape of  women, shelling against civilians, siege, deprivation of food, water and  health care. Even hospitals with patients dying from cancer were  shelled.

I won't mention of who harmed whom, this is very well  documented. With a persistent, extensive patient research in Youtube we  can find documentaries, news clips and more important testemonies from  survivals what the Bosnia civilians has been through. All I can say is  that some politicians, media and more important intellectuals from a reputed university revived the dangerous nationalism, turning people against citizens of the other republics of Yoguslavia. 

I  was a kid and then teenager during the Croatia and Bosnia Wars. I  remember watching the news and everyday there was something reported  about the war. At some point I was bothered because cease fires were  being broken all the time. Four episodes stuck in my mind about Bosnia  all these decades: a news report about people eating flowers and plants  due to lack of food, a market being bombed with lots of people dead, the  Mostar bridge being destroyed, a concentration camp in some school and a  mass grave discovered by sattelite photos or airplane photos. 

I was a kid from a country totally apart from the Balkans and I remember this well. 

Something  that is keeping in my mind is how ordinary people are capable of such  atrocities but I can't find the answer the proper answer, just some  possibilities. I look at some of Youtube videos taken from the war, and I  note that many of that were kids just a little bit older than me. Not  that older just a little bit, like one year or two older than me. There are some videos where we see young soldiers, of 16 or 17 years old,  holding rifles, fighting and rejoycing the killings and the small  victories. Wasn't they aware the harming they were inflicting in others  that maybe at some point of their lives were their neighbors, school  mates or even friends?  


I realize that their morality and  compassion for mankind was very fragile, and reminds me my high school  years, where I was constantly ethnically slurred and being demoralized  due to my race or religion. Many times I felt alone, and if I had ""good  relationship"" with my collegues was to due my effort of getting along as  best as I could. I still remember one day being uninvited to my  friend's house in the middle of the road, saying to me that ""I decided  to not let enter black people in my house. You will not come with us  because you're black"". I was already 18 years old at that time, so I experienced how fragile their moral were.

1964,vw2bb4,thisisclsn,"I mean this in the most positive way and I’m just looking to get some advice from an outsider looking in…
So I’ve always been a “loner” for most of my life. Grew up in a broken home where I had to hide my feelings and become dependent on myself. Instead of going out and hanging out with friends (which I did sometimes) I would spend most of my time with myself or maybe one friend playing video games and making music. At 13, I started to have big dreams of being an artist and the dream had never died. I’m now 23, but around 18 I started going through a spiritual awakening (not just a small one, but now it’s apparent that this is a Kundalini awakening) and I’ve spent the last 6 years in isolation and solitude, and that’s not really an understatement. Yes I’ve hung out with people, I’ve met people, talked to people at work, but deep down and in my company I’ve been alone. In this time I’ve wrote, recorded, and put out A LOT of music to the world on all streaming platforms and have done everything needed to gain an image, take pictures, promote myself, etc etc all on my own. For real. Just me. Mixing my own music, taking my own pictures, being my own cheerleader, support, love. The thing is though, yes I do have a couple people in my life, but they don’t support me like that. It’s like they can see that I very well will achieve fame but they sleep on me and don’t show any love or support even when I am beaming with love and high positive energy. It’s like something in the universe blocks me from the world which might happen with this post and I’m just trying to figure it out. So the main question is, do you think some people are meant to achieve, work towards, and gain success completely on their own? Without the help of ANYONE around, because they’ve been counted out and treated like a ghost? I’m starting to think that I’m truly meant to achieve everything I’m after alone",2022-07-10 22:01:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/vw2bb4/destined_to_be_alone/,,0,0,Destined to be alone?

1972,vw357o,pockets2tight,"My entire life I battled with extreme anxiety.  This held me back in so many ways and eventually in my mid 20s, August of 2014 to be precise, I realized I was never going to be able to change and I would always be afraid to talk to women, take any sort of risk, and as a result, never be able to be happy and go after the things I wanted.

This led to a severe depression that's lasted the past 8 years.  Nearly daily thoughts of suicide, and not ""oh I wish I was dead"" thoughts. That was 2013 and before.  This was researching methods, thinking about how I wanted to do, who I should write letters to.  

Fast forward to now, 2022.  33 years old and never been more miserable.  Mired in smoking addiction, porn addiction, cam girl addiction, i've never been lonelier and more hopeless.

I've made so many poor decisions in my life, and if any single one of them was different, who knows where I'd be, how my brain would be.  But no, instead I have to live like this - depressed, anxious, neurotic, and probably some degree of psychotic. 

Every single moment of every single day is torturous.  I've tried explaining it, but my family just doesn't get it and just feels hopeless.  My friends essentially abandoned me, and I get it, but it just hurts.

I'm so pathetic, this life I ""live"" is so pathetic.

2006,vw7adw,Fedexgamespro,"Basically, I have a humiliating past. I was arrested for hurting someone I loved. Ever since then life has gone down hill. 

I had a bright future ahead of me, but I fucked it all up. I used to have passions and love for my hobbies but now I'm dead inside. I've lost all my friends but one: my best friend. At least he knows I'm not a complete asshole. 

The only people I talk are him, my therapist, and family. I talk to my coworkers, but nothing beyond work. 

My life is work, home (my parents house), and every now and then I'll go to the theater or museum or concert to have people around me and make me feel like I'm part of something. 

Yeah, I sometimes take my best friend, but honestly it gets to be same ol, same ol and I want to take someone new. 

I want a girlfriend, but I'm too afraid I will eventually get rejected because of my past once she finds out. I mean, I know my past is a complete red flag. I know she will be afraid I will flip out again and maybe hurt her. Shoot, I'm afraid of it too. 

I know I'll probably be lonely for the rest of my life. I do everything pretty much alone. Honestly, even before my arrest I've always been a loner. Most of the time I'm used to the pain of loneliness, but every once in a while it hits me hard (like today).

2009,vw7jmx,BetterSkirt3495,"Have been feeling lonely for the last 5 years. Weekends are especially tough. 

In my freshman year of college, I got really depressed, and in the subsequent years, shut down the idea of making friends or meeting new people. I focused solely on doing well in school and making money. 

I now am 25 years old, have a great job that I enjoy and pays me well. But I still feel extremely empty inside. And realizing it’s due to my lack of relationships. I have just one or two “friends,” whom aren’t that reliable. I haven’t gone on a date in years, and feel that I have no way to meet new people (tried every app).  

I feel constant regret for isolating myself for such a long time, causing me to miss out on so many relationships and experiences. Even though I was/am depressed, and It’s not right to be mad at myself, I can’t blame anything else for my loneliness. 

I’ve tried going out to concerts and restaurants alone, but am naturally an introvert so don’t find myself making many connections, and anxiety sometimes takes over, preventing me from being in the moment. There are things I enjoyed doing alone over the years, but at some point, I need people to enjoy things with. 

I have tons of interests and hobbies, and am a genuinely nice person. Every therapist I have spoken to tells me that I deserve all the relationships I desire. I’ve been on Prozac for years and it helped a little bit. But here I am, sitting alone in my room every weekend.

2014,vw7xke,Proud_Pressure_4085,"i’ve (21m) always been told that i’m loved by the people around me but i don’t really seem to get it. Since middle school i had this one habit of acting sad (at the time i didn’t know what it implied) for people to even notice me because in class i was the smart guy and that was just that. People just seemed to come towards me for my grades (the typical “be friends with the clever ones” trope). So basically even if i was surrounded i always fell alone so i’ll continue acting sad for the most part and at some point it became a character trait i couldn’t break. Even when i’ll feel happy i’ll just dive into negativity (often insulting myself in my head) just to get back in the state of sadness i should be i guess

i’ve dated this girl last year. I’ve never loved someone other than her but things got sour very fast. with her i was faking (i don’t even know if i wanna be anymore) happiness just so she could stay with me and not be a burden for her. But at the end of the day i started feeling more insecure about petty stuff to the point where i fell back on my old habits. We broke up peacefully enough (she ended up depressed because of me and i had to help her later with that as well) and i fell into the deepest state of depression i ever felt.

i stopped believing in every thing i believed in. My entire vision of the world changed. I have severe social anxiety to the point where i struggle to get to the corner store. i’m an awkward and very negative (i’ve been told) person. I just feel like sometimes i use people just not to be lonely anymore but they rapidly get repelled by my negativity and my lack of reciprocation

i’m not the same however with my family as i don’t even want my brothers to fall into thesame category as me or my mom to worry

i’m not on any social media whatsoever because it makes me feel insecure and bad 
i’m just on messenger and no one even bothers anymore to text me (i could go a full week without receiving a single “hey” or someone who is not there to ask for a favour). i’ve molded myself into a multitasking machine just so i could get close to a lot of people but it didn’t work and i’ve given up on everything already 

i just feel like shit these days. i’m here just to know if anyone is feeling thesame. I’ve worked on myself already and i don’t feel i could change right now because i’m pretty stable at the moment",2022-07-11 02:46:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600865506,1,/r/lonely/comments/vw7xke/why_do_i_feel_loved_but_so_lonely_at_the_same_time/,,0,1,why do i feel loved but so lonely at the same time?

2016,vw8150,MadamMori,"I'm married and I love my husband. But we don't talk like we use to. It's like we've said everything already. What's more is I don't have friends. He has a few, but I'm very reclusive and mistrusting because of the things that have happened in the past.  All we talk about is mundane daily stuff. Who's going to work, who's got the kids. I feel alone in my own home. I don't have any one to talk to about the books I read, the latest art project or whatever I happen to find online that day. I mean yeah I could tell him what's up, but it's usually ""that's nice."" ""Cool"" ""damn"". Like he doesn't engage anymore. It's just a bummer I guess. I want deep conversation back, to discuss true crime, my books, anything. He just watches TV all the time not shows I watch so other than asking him about said shows I have nothing to bring to that table..

(( UPDATE You guys, I tried to talk to him and we had a huge fight. He's saying stuff like this is my house and if you don't like leave. Or that I need to go back to the basement he found me in. (I briefly lived in my father's basement). He's telling me that I don't support him. But he just took two months off work and I did nothing but support him. We said when he starts working that I could take a month off. Now he's saying I need to find a better. That he won't help me or support me like I did for him. He also says shit to make me feel bad. Like calling me my abusive mother's name. I'm crying someone please help me. I'm so lost. I don't know what to do anymore. When it's good it's good.

2024,vw8thq,Secure-Panic692,"i’m a teenage girl, and i absolutely hate myself. i have a boyfriend whose the sweetest guy alive, sometimes. whenever were together he’s perfect and all over me constantly telling me i’m pretty and how much he loves me etc. but he wasn’t always like this. (TW EATING DISORDER) last summer i have a severe eating disorder and had to pull myself out of it alone which my bf knows about. he also knows i still struggle with just insecurities in general as well asa lot of pressure from people in my family to look perfect all the time. anyways, back when we first got together he used to pick on me and i looked a lot in a jaoking way and i told gim i didnt likw it but he comtinued until i relapsed and finaally told him i had an ed. he responded really well and iuat told me he lived me and that he was sorry. but throughout our relationship since then he’s had zero problems talking about other girls in front of me and while I’m not ther which has been really hard for me and uncomfortable since he knows I’m constantly comparing myself to others around him anyways. After talking about this he says he gets where I’m coming from and he will talk about that type of stuff around me anymore but I know he still says stuff when I’m not around even though he also said he wouldn’t do that. And after a little while I still just felt ugly because I knew he was saying all the stuff about all these other girls and he’s never complement me so eventually I just felt pretty shitty about it and I talk to him and he like apologized and promised like it would be different and all this stuff and then all the sudden he was just like all over me and like complimenting me and I was like OK well this is good but recently I found out that he was like getting other nudes from like other girls which is something I’ve never sent to him or anyone and like watching porn and like all that stuff and I felt like shit about it and I talked to him about it and he said he’d stop watching that stuff and he thought where I was coming from and he promised he’d stop but I feel like he promises to stop doing a lot of things that he just does anyways under the impression that I’m not gonna know. I also know that he’s giving a snap out to other girls and done stuff like that while him and I were together and it really confuses me because I feel like when him and I are alone together things are so perfect and he’s like do you like things with him and I are perfect and he’s perfect and then it’s like I find out all the stuff he does like behind my back and like lies to me about and I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m just looking at all these other girls he has all this stuff to say about unprompted because it’s just what he’s thinking and then I have to ask him to give me just a little bit of reassurance and he probably doesn’t even mean it. And with summer starting again I’ve been able to feel myself drifting back into the things I was doing last year like throwing up skipping meals etc. and I really do just need someone to talk to but he’s not there he’s never there anymore, I mean at least when we first started dating he was like my best friend I used to tell him everything but now he’s never there to listen he just wants to make out or not do anything at all and when we do hang out and I’m not in the mood to do anything with him he just wants to go hang out with his friends instead and since we have the same friend group usually I go with him and they always tell me and show me all the stuff you were saying when he’s not there when you think I’m not there and I don’t know what to do because I’m so sick of hearing myself and I feel like I would’ve been able to make it through the summer without relapsing if it weren’t for the way that he makes me feel but I also know that if I tell him that he’s gonna feel like shit and I don’t wanna hurt his feelings. But it just feels like I’m always running in circles around other people trying to pretend that I’m OK and it’s like I know that he says he loves me and he cares about me and that he thinks I’m like the prettiest well blah but it doesn’t feel like it and he doesn’t act like it and it just confuses me because I only have eyes for him I don’t look at any other guys like that ever and he looks at every other girl around him like that all the time even when I’m here and it just hurts my feelings a lot. And I don’t know if I’m over reacting because I’ve already had problems with this before but even guy friends that I talk to of told me that it’s weird and kind of fucked up and they don’t even know about my eating disorder so I don’t know what to do but I just I keep looking at myself and comparing myself to all the other girls and I hate myself and my body and I’ve been trying to work out and trying to eat less and trying to throw up what I do eat but even then I look at myself and I look nothing like the girls he wants so I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if there’s something wrong with me and there is but I don’t know if that’s what’s causing the Problem. also sorry for any bad grammar or English and this I do voice type it because the keyboard on my phone is broken",2022-07-11 03:33:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596336421,0,/r/lonely/comments/vw8thq/i_feel_disgusting_and_ugly/,,0,4,i feel disgusting and ugly

So I (35m) have been with my partner (45m) for a bit over a year. Prior to that I was in a very bad (10 year) relationship. In that old relationship I was confined. I couldn’t go places do things talk to people. No friends no social media. 

I met my new partner during that nasty divorce. He helped me and I helped him in a similar situation as he was going through a divorce as well. 

Fast forward a few months and our friendship became more. We developed feelings. Strong ones. Ones I didn’t know I was still capable of. 

I was moving to an unknown location just somewhere far enough to get away from the ex. One of the options was my location if my new close friend. Long story short I moved here and started a life here with him. 

That life has been great. I have never been happier but something still isn’t right. I can’t put my finger on it but something is off. 

This weekend is my first weekend ever where I am alone. I won’t see him again till next weekend. 

I guess I didn’t realize I had become quite codependent and that scares me. I thought I had moved beyond this. 

Anyways I am very sad and very blah about the whole thing. I don’t know why I feel this way I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t have to spend every moment together to be ok…

I've been using dating apps to try and meet new people but it never works out. Women that I do match with just send one or two word responses and never message anymore after the first two or three messages.

We don’t have any friends. We’ve tried going out to work events, local events, etc but it’s impossible to make friends as an adult. We left our best friend and a large group of friends in Atlanta and I guess we just really miss them. 

We miss game nights, people texting or calling asking to hangout, or getting invited to go out for a drink or two. Now don’t get me wrong, we’re very happy and the loneliness hasn’t impacted our relationship but it’s something we’ve talked about.

2059,vwcfue,Nualia2020,"It's been 3 years since college and I had a network of IRL friends and a support group. Once I left, I went back to online friend hangouts being it.


This year a lot hit the fan within my social circle and I realized that being nothing but online so much was toxic for me and not helping my life or career. I love those guys dearly still but it's currently best if I focus on me and my life... Or so I thought. 


I have immediate family in town and an decent paying job. But I work weekends (better pay) and more and more, for longer periods of time, I don't get to see or talk to that family. Making friends outside work has been real difficult since moving back to Michigan. 


The one friend I did make hits me up often for work stuff and advice all the time. Sometimes real late, and if I'm up I'll always help out. At some point she was having a rough night and tried to reach me, but my phone mutes after midnight.

So the next day, I felt real bad and made it so she can always get through that mute. I told her that I did so, and that if she ever needed to reach me, call at any hour, I'll be there.


She is not a very good friend at all, and reciprocates almost nothing let alone that. 


So now, here I am after one of the most stressful work weekends of my life at 3am (a rather ungodly time for my current life) wanting nothing more than to reach out to someone to just talk and debrief... 


But my family is there for emergencies and lead their own lives. Back in college I had about 3 different people I could hit up. Plus or minus depending on the time of year and day.


But now? No one but my roommates, both part family and men. It's hitting especially hard tonight. It's frustrating because I feel like I can't reach out to those 2 that I could, because we're men and we aren't supposed to need to talk to people like this. But that 1 girl I know, I know I'm definitely not the only one she could and does rely on to get through tough times. And this makes me sad.


This world is rough sometimes. I'll get through it, but dang does it feel like the odds are nothing against me during times like these, and it genuinely hits me how socially unacceptable it feels for me to even be in this position. How many people will say ""it's ok for men to have feelings"" but how it still feels not ok for men to have feelings. 


I know I'm not the only one though. Admittedly it's been a long time since I've felt like this(4 months?). But somehow, that makes it worse now. Hopefully things at work get less stressful soon and my career moves pay off. 


Thanks for listening.

2070,vwd1r9,Routine-Eagle-6649,"For context, I’m in high school and about to start my senior year and I’ve had basically the same set of friends since middle school. 

I feel like I don’t even fit in anymore because they’re all really into soccer(they’re all on the soccer team and watch/go to games). Whenever they talk about it I can never contribute to the conversation because I lost the passion for it a while ago. And during lunch they all play in the field while I sit by the goal nets and wait for class to start. 

For a while I’ve felt like the side friend and less important to the group. I’ve noticed that we never really go out as a group if certain people cancel. I understand wanting to postpone plans for someone, but it’s always the same few people that we all wait on. But when I cancel or cant go they make plans regardless. Sometimes I even feel used because in school whenever we have to get into groups I get left out but they always ask for my help or to copy my work. 

Just the other day I made plans with one of them for tomorrow but he just texted me a shitty excuse and bailed.

I feel unalive despite my heart beating, I feel like I am simply an observer of others who are the actual actors in the play of life, and I am merely an audience member. Other people have relationships where they're deeply connected to the other person, while I feel like I am only ever appreciated for the facades I put up.

Only when I play the version of me that's not ""creepy"", or is more ""understanding"" do I start getting more respected. But what do I really feel inside? Not much. Am I a sociopath? I've never thought so, although a lot of my desires for romantic relationships are inherently selfish, but I do believe that it is only ethical to reciprocate what you are given.

Still, on an emotional level I feel a lot of pain. Constantly chasing internally what I don't have. Dreaming too much. In a broad sense, just spending too much time inside of my head instead of just being alive like the rest of the people out there. It truly makes me feel invisible.

Maybe they're dead inside too but just better at hiding it. Maybe I am the one who is more in touch with my feelings. Maybe this, maybe that.

Gaming and YouTube/Netflix help a lot but sometimes they make me feel even more lonely and like I'm wasting my life. When I was 20, I told myself it's fine, I have plenty of time to get my life together and I'll end up living a regular life. Well I'm 30 now and I'm no longer saying either of those things.

I feel like I have to just accept the loneliness and hope I can keep my mind busy without losing interest in the few things left that are enjoyable for me. Online friendships aren't doing anything for me anymore and I feel like I have nothing left.

Not only do I not drive or work, but I have a dog that I don't leave home. So even if I did find someone that wanted to be friends, and didn't mind that I don't work or drive, now I have to hope they're okay with me bringing my dog anywhere we decided to hang out.

No you're not. You're a fraud. You're uncaring and indifferent. You're hurtful. I'm hurt. I feel worthless. I feel like I'm nothing. I meant nothing to you. When will people I try to be friends with stop using me. When will someone to consider a friend treat me with worth and respect. 

Perhaps I should not focus on trying to have friends. Maybe I should be grateful for what I have. I do have lot. Though it's not perfect, it's more than what many have. My family is there for me. Maybe I can't tell them all my feelings and emotions, maybe I can't enjoy all my interests and hobbies with them. But maybe that's okay because they are there for me and that means everything. They are selfless. They help me without expecting gain. They care. They want good things for me and are happy when I succeed. They want to be on my side. They look out for me. They care. 

I've realized that a lot of people on this world don't care. They don't care about you. You're a transaction for them. They get something from you and when they are no longer satisfied with what they get, or when they obtain something they feel is better, they move on to the next. A careless ""sorry"" may be all you get in the end. 

I feel really shitty and jaded about connection with other people.

2102,vwilox,ArmaDei,"Today is probably the worst day of my life. I had to go to the other city to finish some life important documents without which my stay in the country will be illegal... I fucked up. Everything was against me, EVERYTHING! I should have arrived by 9:33, but I couldn't do it until 14:30 which was the last chance. The first train was 30!!!!! minutes late, so naturally I didn't get the chance to go by another train which would lead me exactly to the city I had to be in. Next there weren't any places in the train I tried to buy tickets for, I had to go even later, after which the last train which would make it to the destination went just on my eyes. Everywhere were these 10 to 15 people queues which consumed at least 20 min.. FUCK MY LIFE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASY RIDE WHY NOW? WHY WHEN I NEEDED IT THE MOST, EVERYTHING HAD TO GO TO SHIT!!???? I hate myself. I'm fucked. The documents will be cancelled, and I will not have an opportunity to re-do the process.. I'm riding home totally destroyed, knowing that additionally to this fucking disaster I wasted moderate amount of money on the tickets, I just rode around and will come back with nothing, but sorrow and disappointment, moreover the rain was accompanying me throughout all of the misadventure and the wind broke my umbrella, so coming home wet like a dog. I don't know what to do, I guess my life is over, because I can see how it all might end because of this one day, maybe it's just dark thoughts, however judging how today went, I think it's entirely possible lol. I know no one cares, just had to spill this out otherwise I don't know if I would stay sane.. It's a big deal for me, I know that I'm not mature, but I am really afraid of the future, it doesn't seem bright. If someone read it, sorry for that, I just can't handle the situation.

2103,vwixbs,henker220,"I'm 24 years old (male) and have never been in a relationship before, have no local friends I can see IRL, and am still a virgin. Literally, every woman I've ever been interested in has turned me down or is already taken. I've tried approaching women IRL and usually get ignored or told to go away. Needless to say, I don't approach women that much anymore because of that. Dating apps are my only option to meet women and predictably they don't work no matter which ones I use or how much money I spend on subscriptions/extra features. Whenever I do get a match, I usually get ghosted after a couple of days.

The closest I came to finding a partner was a Russian-American girl I met on a pen pal website. She emotionally manipulated me when I was suicidal and vulnerable, then she ghosts me for another man because (in her words) he had more money. Fuck that bitch! I fucking hate her and I hope she burns in Hell forever for what she did to me! I wish all kinds of horrible things upon her! Fuck that stupid whore! 

Then, there was a stupid Bible thumping bitch I met at my community college who only befriended me just so she could proselytize. She literally believes that LGBT people live sinful lifestyles and that abortion should still be illegal so fuck her! I hate that Bible-thumping slut too! If I ever see her again, I'll wipe my ass with the Bible in front of her. Fuck that bitch!

The population in my area skews older, so there is not much around for people my age besides the community college and I already graduated.

2106,vwjsl4,Prehistoric_Lama,"When I first got to university, I only knew one dude who was in the same high school I went to, we never talked much before but as we didn't know anyone else we started hanging out, he wasn't really trying to make new friends, but I did and I met 4 other students who I became really good friends with, therefore, I decided to get him in the group.

Progressively, the group got bigger as we added 3 other people, who formed a subgroup but who still spent time with us. At first it was alright, we all spent time together, laughed, etc... unfortunately, after about 3 months, they started ignoring me more and more every single day, by this I mean that they wouldn't listen to whatever I had to say, they wouldn't invite me when they had something planned, they hanged out together and avoided me, and whenever I joined them I could feel some kind of tension and discomfort from their part.

What started it was the addition of that old friend in the group, since day one something felt odd, but it took 3 months to be inevitably noticeable. It felt like I wasn't needed or wanted anymore, I got replaced by someone cooler and more interesting.

During summer break, I got no DM or call whatsoever, like I didn't exist, and when we returned to classes, it was clear I wasn't a part of the group anymore. I don't know why it happened, I'm not the coolest dude it's true, but it's not a reason to get cast out so abruptly. 

What I found the most hurtful thing in all of this, is that I didn't get any kind of explanation, and since then I've spent endless days thinking about it. It's been more than a year already and I never felt this lonely, I tried making new friends but everyone is already in a group and they made it clear I couldn't join any, so I spend all my time alone both in and outside college, to a point where my older cousin, who's in the same college asked me last month why I'm always alone when he sees me.

It's hard to be rejected by everyone, there's no one I can open up to or even just have a chat with, so I stay alone in campus listening to alternative rock and grunge, which I've discovered during my lowest days and are the only things that give me some kind of solace.

So, has anyone been in the same situation ? if so, what did you do to forget about it and make time pass ?",2022-07-11 14:30:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1635780414,8,/r/lonely/comments/vwjsl4/has_anyone_else_been_kicked_out_from_the_friends/,,0,1,Has anyone else been kicked out from the friends group that they created ?

She would mention how she wanted to make other friends to “not scare” me when it came to drugs and stuff despite me already having smoked. She met some guy at a party and he invited her to his birthday party which is on my actual birthday… She’s only known him for a couple months and we have been friends for like 5 years. 

NOTE: this isn’t a romance thing, he’s gay

Keep in mind this girl used to get incredibly upset if I would talk to her sister instead of her. She would literally lock herself in her room and not talk to anyone at the times where i had a separate conversation with her sister. I understood her emotions at those times and we were able to talk things out with her… but it just feels so hypocritical that she would get upset just by me talking to her sister without her involved and that now she wants to go to someone else’s birthday party on my birthday… I don’t even celebrate my birthday, but she said it would be nice since it’s my 21st birthday and that I should celebrate… but now she says she wants to go to someone else’s party? I can’t say no since that would be so selfish of me, i know for sure she would have way more fun with them.

Also my coworker quit and didn’t show up after her 2 weeks notice, so my job has been more stressful since we are understaffed and I feel too guilty to ask for my birthday weekend off (working weekends is required and there’s only 2 other people that do my job so they would be REALLY short staffed if I wasn’t there).

I've realized since that I have absolutely no confidence or social skills to be able to date whatsoever.




I don't want to sound pathetic but I honestly feel very very lonely. Seeing people every day all around me in happy, loving relationships hurts. Yes I get not every relationship is as happy as it seems but still a lot of them are. I can't even hold anyone's hand and other people get such loving, happy fulfilling relationships. All I want is a hug, a hand hold, someone to ask how my day was and actually care about the answer.

2155,vwqqfq,AnEntirePeach,"He was my best friend, we played a lot of video games together during lockdown, but things took a turn for the worse around 2021. He began treating me like crap, and I obviously tried to do the same to him.

2022, yay ig. It’s now the time I should say I am very introverted and have hanged out with friends no more than 2 times. And I’m 13 as well. Both times were in May 2022, and were absolutely horrible. Just like the online interactions with my friends. I couldn’t figure out why they were so horrible, until recently, when a combination of that “best friend” taking a few-days hiatus from the group chat and him even leaving it for a day when I realised - I actually enjoyed talking to people. Oh my god! But only when that guy isn’t there.

The SECOND he joins a social interaction, the atmosphere switches - against me. 

He was brought back into the group again. I have no idea how I’m going to survive not talking on that group until he leaves (if he leaves - probably never), because that’s the ONLY place I ever talk.

In fact, I had to create this new account because he tried STALKING me on my old account.

I have not went out with anyone for 50 days. I have nobody I can go out with, because that guy would get invited as well. 

And it’s not like I haven’t tried joining other friends groups - they were TOXIC AS.

And it’s not like there are any more friend groups I can joins until I go to high school next year (after the year after this summer). 1 more year with THAT TOXIC GUY. AND I’LL PROBABLY HAVE TO STAY IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM IN SUMMER CAMP. *FOR 7 NIGHTS*

AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I’m unskillful. I do not have ANY skills, I have no idea how to cook, or how to do a lot of things for myself.

TL;DR Whenever this former best friend enters a social interaction the whole vibe changes against me - can’t hang out with the only group of friends I have because of this. Have tried finding new groups, but they’re toxic, can’t find any new groups for over a year to come. Unskilful, lonely, depressed, shy, and so on.

2163,vwrrg1,Strong-Document-7368,"Hi guys I wanted to share with you my experience and ask you for suggestions
I started to like this girl 6 months ago since we started working together.
After 6 months I decided to shoot my shot, but only after being sure she was interested too.
So after getting clear(?) signs of interest I asked her out.
Well the night I Asked her out we stood outside her home  for 2 hours straight talking (and It already happened once or twice) then I procedeed with the big request.
She said yes, she said she was sure and she asked me when we were gonna meet.
So I went home all happy and excited.
After a week she texted me she should have never said yes, that she was probably tired that night etc...

Well we still work together and I started ignoring her (maybe on purpose but also because I really don't know how to behave towards her, I always try to be myself but it seems to me that I am not able to do it anymore when I Am with her)
So after two weeks of ignoring her at work she went to me, also in a little angry mood, and told me that she can't go to work with that negative atmosphere, that she does not want me to behave like this, that she had good fun with me when I did not ignore her and so on...
She also said that she expected me to ask her out that night indeed she told me that she was seeing me thinkfully, and asked me If I had to say something. And after this happened I asked her out.

So after this conversation I tried to be softer towards her and tried to talk to her, I managed to do it pretty well when there was all our group of friends.
However today I met her again in the gym and I could not talk to her, I didn't even wave her but I actually don't do it on purpose. I don't know why I am blocked. I feel betrayed, I feel sad I really feel that my heart is hurt yet I still ""simp"" for her and with her behaviour she keeps hurting me even more even though she probably does not it on purpose

So I am not understanding why, despite rejecting me, she  keeps showing this kind of toxic interest towards me. from my pov It's like I MUST consider her.

Guys tell me something because I am really desperate about this situation I can't handle.
Because I understand that she changed her mind (I don't wanna kill her for this) but I don't understand why she acts like this",2022-07-11 20:09:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/vwrrg1/dont_know_ho_to_behave_towards_her/,,0,0,Don't know ho to behave towards her?

2195,vwxb80,randtime78,"First time venting on the internet.

I  am a 21 years old male. In school, I was the weird kid, always picked  last in school sports, made fun of by the majority and asked for answers  during tests. I was the class nerd, always fixing school computers and  talking to my IT teacher. My grades were high all around. I had a group  of friends who liked me but I often degraded myself in order to make  them laugh. For whatever reason, I also was the odd one out in the group  and not often invited on nights out.

My  parents do not (try to?) understand me and leave me to my own thing. We  never talked much. I was afraid of them, to their eyes I was not  enough.

My interest has always  been programming and tech. I did not care that my social connections  were few and poor because my focus was on something else.

I  moved country to attend uni a couple years ago. I lived my first year  abroad in complete solitude, a very dark period of my life. One day I  decided to go out for a walk, I wanted to finally give myself the chance  to restart my life but me being me is the stopping factor. Started  trying new things and social events. I found out I can only  superficially connect with very few people but that's about it. I often  take solo walks (I have no one to invite) and see friend groups and  couples and often wonder how did they end up there. What were the  actions and decisions they made in order to be there with a group of  people willing to talk and listen.

I  always felt unhappy, even got a few suicide attempts on my belt, but  still here. Often I go to sleep and hope to never wake up, as the next  day will just be as dull as the previous one.

In  some ways, I hoped that writing this post would make me feel something  but that's not the case. Maybe some replies will do, if I receive any.",2022-07-12 00:11:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647259887,3,/r/lonely/comments/vwxb80/life_for_me_is_dull/,,0,1,Life for me is dull

I only caught on while I was having a panic attack about having sent that money, because she asked if I wanted to use a condom or not. When I asked if she was on birth control, she said no, but that I could just send her $50 to pay for half the bill of Plan B.

2213,vwz1je,ryan77999,"Let me just make a disclaimer that I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, (which has recently been renamed “high-functioning autism”) when I was around 3 years old. That said, I’d prefer not to get answers like ***“It’s normal to have social shortcomings if you’re autistic, OP! Just give up and accept your fate!”*** . I just want to live a normal life like a normal person. Also, I’ve heard of many people on the spectrum being able to form platonic and/or romantic connections during their youth, so the problem must be something else - my condition can’t be the only thing to blame.

So, here’s the deal: as the title suggests, I was my high school’s resident Quiet Kid™; before you ask, I did have a few relatively close friends in elementary school, but one moved away and the rest slowly drifted apart (there was no dramatic ""falling out"" or anything). I did have a couple of acquaintances I would chat with during lunch for the first couple of years of high school, but even we drifted apart around the last year or so. The last time a classmate actively invited me somewhere was to one of those acquaintances’ houses during the summer between 9th and 10th grade, and even then all we did was talk and watch one of the group play video games - I never went to one of those famed high school parties. I decided to change this around February of 2020, halfway into my final year, when I started going to the gym hoping that exercise would give me the confidence to approach people. As if almost on cue, COVID-19 hit a couple of weeks later and my last day of high school, which we assumed to be the last day before a three-week break at the time, ended up being on my 18th birthday (03/13/2020). I have yet to see any of my classmates since, and I can’t stop pondering how things could have gone different; without Covid, I would have gone on the graduation trip to the beach, to prom, and an in-person graduation ceremony; all opportunities to form last-minute connections. Speaking of Covid, it feels as if the past two years were “skipped” almost, like I’m still mentally eighteen. Granted, I still sometimes post photography on Instagram with the hopes of seeing notifications saying *”[former classmate] liked your post!”*, which I do occasionally get, but I wonder if it’s more out of the “be nice to the special needs kid” kind of social obligation rather than genuinely trying to reach out to me. TL;DR: Even though I technically did attend high school, I never really experienced it. I just took it for granted and let it pass me by. I’ll be remembered as “that creepy, quiet background extra” when I could’ve been remembered as “that guy who used to be quiet and creepy but turned things around at the last second and became part of the group”.

***“Maybe it was your off-putting wardrobe/hygiene/physical features/posture/etc.?”***

It’s probably worth mentioning that I have a noticeable slouch, facial acne, and a fairly large nose, as well as an extremely thin and delicate build for my sex. I would and still do brush my teeth twice a day and wash my hair with shampoo; all the general necessities. As for my wardrobe, it would depend on the weather (which has a wide range in Canada); usually a T-shirt and athletic shorts in the summer and a hoodie with jeans or track pants for the rest of the year. I didn’t exactly dress up fashionably but I can’t think of anything “off-putting” about that, although I will admit in hindsight that I would’ve benefitted from a belt. My parents would advise me to look at what others were wearing for ideas when I would hit up the clothing store, but I would always forget because when I see people in public, what they’re wearing is one of the *last things I pay attention to* unless they’re wearing something particularly outrageous. If I did those above things were “wrong”, like if I stank, or if my clothes were indeed uncool, or if my posture was unnerving, *then how come no one ever called me out on it?* I was never what you’d call “bullied” in high school, but at this point, I would’ve taken that over practically not existing. Speaking of which, all these self-help subreddits have said things like “You need to work on yourself first before getting friends”, but they also say things like “Just stay yourself and wait for the friends that suit you to come along eventually”. Which one is true?

***""Did you do anything embarrassing that could've turned people off from you?""***

I rarely interacted with people I didn’t know well other than for group projects, and even then I didn’t speak much. I usually spent time between classes sitting in the hallway on my phone, hoping that the giggle of a passerby wasn’t directed at me. One notable thing that may have turned people off from me would be my piss-poor performance in team sports during gym class. Whenever I would often make a ridiculous blunder during a team sports game my teammates would act reassuring and motivative to my face but the gossip I would overhear from them in the changeroom was anything but, confirming my “acting nice solely out of social obligation” point from above.

***“Did you try joining clubs?”***

Ah, see, there’s the funny part - joining clubs requires having actual interests other than consuming media. Speaking of those “interests” of mine, I *did* join a cinema club in 9th grade with only a few members, the others being all in 12th grade. I also joined a “games” club that never really took off; the first meeting only had one person (myself) show up, and the following meetings only had people I barely knew playing chess, Jenga, and the like. Plus I joined a science club in which people did experiments, but that never really got me anywhere either. I was also part of the junior band in 9th grade but didn't rejoin the next year so I wouldn't have to attend practice after school anymore.

***“Did you try just being yourself?”***

I don’t even know who “myself” is. And besides, for all I know, my true “self”  is now buried behind two decades’ worth of social masking and could be unretrievable at this point.

***“Of course you never made friends - you never put yourself out there and approached anybody.”***

If that’s the case, then why have I seen posts on the internet about being “adopted by an extrovert”? And besides, if the “put yourself out there and approach people” lesson is given to more people than just me, then why didn’t another person put that into practice and approach *me*? As for *why* I never approached anyone, I guess I was just too empathetic for my own good; I put myself in their shoes and imagined another me (the school’s Creepy Quiet Kid™) shuffling towards me and figured any person with taste would make a run for it - I merely didn’t want to bother anyone or ruin anyone’s day with my presence because I assumed everyone hated me. After all, I assumed I deserved it for some reason. I basically subscribed to [this mindset](https://old.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/usbcpx/my_mama_told_me_stop_smiling_in_everybody_face/), and look where it got me.

***”Maybe it’s because you don’t have a personality?”***

Well, then how do I *get* a “personality”? Like I said, my only interests are consuming media; TV and video games and the like.

***”Maybe it’s because you were coming across as trying to evoke pity from people, which is a huge turn-off, like you’re doing now by posting this.”***

How was I “trying to evoke pity” by not interacting with anyone? It’s not like I was going up to people and saying things like “Please be my friend! I don’t have any.”.

***”So if you didn’t excel socially, that means you must’ve done very well academically as a trade-off, right?”***

………

***”You said you still have your classmates’ contacts on Instagram; why not contact them on there and arrange something?”***

I shan’t do that because I just picture a former classmate receiving a message from me and thinking something like *”Eww, it’s that weird quiet kid from high school. Why is he messaging me? Blocked. I should let everyone else know that they should block him too.”*. More than a couple have rejected my follow requests, so my theories about them not wanting me to contact them can’t be *that* far-fetched. Also, most of my former classmates have moved across the province to attend various universities, and since I can’t drive nor have a car (even at 20 years old) visiting them would be hard anyway. Plus, I’m not sure if I *want* them to see me and find out that even at this age I still don’t have a job, residence, car, friends, purpose in life, or my own residence like they do; I don’t imagine a friendless, unemployed virgin living in his parents’ basement would be an interesting person to hang out with.

***”What about making friends at university?”***

My university currently has around 50,000 students. Compare that to the less than 1,000 in my high school, in which a lot of my classes had a lot of the same people. Even though I’ve technically been a university student since last spring, the first time I actually set foot on campus was this February due to Covid, and in between lectures I was killing time the same way I did in high school; sitting in the hallway on my phone, hoping the giggle of a passerby wasn’t directed at me. It was then that I realized that nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change. Besides, I feel like if I didn’t have any connections during high school, which to me is all that matters, then there’s no point in trying in the future, partially because potential friends could perceive my lack of social experience even at this age as a red flag, and partially because if I change things now then I wouldn’t be able to stop thinking about what could have been had I changed things around earlier - I’m a sucker for consistency. Also, I’ve heard many times that making friends is astronomically more difficult as an adult.

***“Why do you even care?”***

Because I can’t even think of people younger than me participating in things like friendship, drama, violence, romance, sex, etc. without seething with envy. Any time I see teenagers hanging out together in public or in a video on social media all I can think is *“That should’ve been me.”*, as pathetic as that may sound. I even feel that way watching/reading any sort of fictional story that involves teenage characters interacting with each other, so much so that it affects my enjoyment of the stories.

***“Can’t you just let the past be the past?”***

No. I need closure. I need to know exactly what they thought of me.

***“You sound in desperate need of medication.”***

For the record, I *am* currently taking Effexor and Abilify, and switched to those after being on Prozac for several years since I was around 12. Whether they’re actually working or not is arguable, though.

***“You sound in desperate need of therapy.”***

Also for the record, I *am* scheduled to see a psychologist in a few days for the first time in over a decade. But my question is this: I’ve seen so many replies on these self-help subs saying things along the lines of “Whining to other people and feeling sorry for yourself won’t solve your problems, you can only rely on yourself to be happy, learn to never rely on anyone else, take the initiative and responsibility to fix your own problems instead of complaining to others, etc.“ . How is therapy any different? Would going to therapy not just be me whining to someone else and expecting them to solve my problems for me? What if I accidentally pull a Rorschach and make the therapist depressed instead? Not to mention the fact that it’s far from cheap. Sorry if it’s painfully obvious I’ve never seen a psychologist before so it might be a stupid question. Then again, I don't know *how* to fix my problems so even just being told what exactly I'm supposed to do wouldn't hurt.

was told growing up that it was all a phase. I'm 30 now,

depression and anxiety have left me severely

intelligent or experienced enough to hold a

able to even type this is because I can take my time and
edit what I want to say. Throughout my 20s I was able
to block out the negative thoughts with various hobbies
but that's become harder and harder the older I get.
I've turned to alcohol and weed, which both have their
pros and cons but.. there has to me more than this.
This can't be all my life will ever amount to. I have so
much love to give.. I want to hold someone and be
held. I haven't been even as much as hugged in over a
year. I crave physical and emotional intimacy so much

Or two rich people enter into just because they know they don't have to worry about the other stealing their fortune. Whatever the case, there are surely lesser versions of love.

And I'm sorry that you watched me build a piece of that wall... but there are parts of me behind that wall - that fucking hurt. It still does, it will in times to come. 

I... I personally broke something that meant the world to me, so I'm sorry you watched my cry, I'm sorry you got somehow stuck in the middle... but my emotions tonight, however unrightfully there (because it likely was my actions that broke that world) are still valid. And I'm going to be sad. 

Asking for that key was acknowledging all of it - my faults, the problems, who I am and how I made it untenable for them. 

Honestly, I don't think you'll read that much into it - i get the 'fuck you' model of the world... it's a nice haven... but I do own my mistakes and how I fuck up my own life - it's not fun, but it's necessary. 

I know, I'm not supposed to be thinking anymore, but my brain does not stop. I don't know what this message was supposed to share, but sometimes I feel like I get overshadowed by those trying to make me feel better - I am me.  I fuck up. I own my life, even when I fuck up.

Even when I cry, I don't need someone to fix it - I just need someone to listen. I'll grieve this loss for a long time - I thought I had my shit maybe together when I met them - but no, different mistakes, same ending point.

I also don't know why I had to share all that, and you might (most likely) not want to read it all... but that is me. That is me.

Sorry for me in your life. (PS - this is not some crazy girl fake suicide note or some shit- I'm going to sleep and it WILL be better tomorrow - I know that, but I apparently had to share my shit with you).

And yes, I will still be sorry for sharing my shit. I do not want to burden anyone - ever.

2228,vx0u9i,Pretty_Soft_548,"
For the past 5 years I’ve been living in an emotionally abusive household. Yknow those very hot and cold adults who like making you feel small and second guess all your decisions. Parentification as well as infantilisation the whole works. It has really made me disassociate from myself and just throw myself into my studies. Now that I’m done with my Exams and I have nothing to throw myself into, I think I’m just realising how truly alone I am. And the abuse has really done a lot of damage to my sense of self. I’m constantly having self-deprecating thoughts and I have a huge amount of self-loathing.  
So I’m particularly struggling cause I like being alone but I hate feeling lonely. It’s insane cause  being lonely isn’t the problem. The problem is  that I’m by myself. I’m left with this irrational, indecisive,worthless over sensitive, over thinker. 
And I don’t think I need to know explain to the people on this sub how much I hate that. I’m starved of touch, affection, warmth and anytime someone is nice to me I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
I go off to uni in a bit and I’m going to try very hard to change all of this when I get there. But I would be lying if I’m not kept awake at night terrified at the thought that nothing will change at all.

Time passes by and me and my cousin went to prepare to go to sleep and she said that she will be picked up by 5 am since her grandmother (her dad's side) wants to be home by the following day since she will be enrolling to her school so we went to sleep. aunty came at the house exactly by 5 i was surprised and woke her up after shes gone i felt anxious sleeping alone i said to myself relax theres already a little bit of sun light theres nothing to worry about. it took me time to fall asleep i never felt so lonely in my life the vibe of the house and how quiet it is i just like the feeling of the presence someone's actually beside me i did not know that it feels so lonely here i used to sleep in this house all by myself. I should probably get a cat to sleep beside me when I'm going to bed.,2022-07-12 04:11:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/vx235o/i_feel_anxious_sleeping_alone/,,0,0,I feel anxious sleeping alone

I was an outcast in high school and in college; a loser even when compared to other losers, and I'm pretty much a hermit now in my mid 20's. I used to crave attention and affection, but recently I lost those desires, and it seems like my loneliness has developed into a sort of cold hatred for everyone. I don't want friends because I've convinced myself that other people are useless when it comes to providing emotional support, and humans have no value to me beyond basic, transactional interactions.

 I'm no longer willing to trust people or let anyone in. I have no patience for anyone anymore and I end relationships over the smallest things. I don't even want to interact with my family, so I've avoided going to holiday gatherings and other family events. I know that this makes me a terrible person, but some part of me feels more at peace than I used to.

2261,vx35yz,Sudden-Emotion-2993,"I don't know if this post is in the right place, I apologize. I'm just writing what's on my mind, sorry if it is messy.

I'm 25 years old male in Toronto.

I never had any friends in my life, only colleagues and the only thing they and I say to each other is ""How are you? I'm good."" I tried asking about their lives but they seem to have a barrier around them, but when I see my colleagues talk to each other I see their more cheerful and more talkative, so I gave up trying to know them.

I don't think I know how to talk to people. I tend to practice smiling in the mirror to seem friendly.

I don't talk to my mom as well, I just have nothing to say to her and I don't want her to worry.

I'm either working or at home in the comfort of my room watching Netflix or playing games, but I'm not very interested in it anymore.

I tried therapy and all she did was ask me questions and say ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."" and just told me to write a diary of how I feel each day. It didn't help, just makes me realize how pointless my life is.

I told my doctor I think of suicide sometimes and he told me ""Is okay, everybody thinks that sometimes, just get some exercise and go out more"". I started exercising and felt nothing.

Sometimes I would stare at the incoming train and move closely to see what it would feel like. I sometimes hope those assaults happening in subway stations happen to me.

 I want to live but I don't know how. Suicide seems much more easier then to live.

I know I probably need help but I have no idea what else to do. It feels like I'm crawling in life instead of walking like a normal person.

2276,vx46np,Scoop_Troop-08,"* Trigger Warning- Very Slight Refrence To Selft Harm*  
In May my two year old ferret passed away.  He seemed fine the day of, I just noticed that he was laying around alot more than normal.  Then about 4 hours before he passed, he went to the bathroom and I could tell something was wrong, I Googled what it meant and it told me that he had a stomach ulcer.  My parents left me and went to the pet store and bought medicine.

They were gone for about an hour and I could tell he was in pain, he was laying on my bed with me, heavily breathing.  But I thought I knew he would be okay, I just assumed because he's had medical scares before and came out okay.  I was just sitting next to him watching fuckinh YouTube while he was in pain.  I know there isn't much I could have done but he was in so much pain he probably felt so scared and alone and I could have atleast comforted him rather than petting him every few minutes. 

I don't know what took my parents so long at the store but when they got back they had the medicine, they mixed it with pedialite so that it would hydrate him, he didn't want to drink, he took a few licks and layed back down, my mom told me to just offer it to him every couple minutes.  

Later it was dinner time and I left him laying on my bed, when we were finished my mom asked to hold him.  While she was holding him on the couch I was sitting on another couch doing something online, I don't even remember.  I remember my mom saying "" come here ayva"" I got up and took a few steps but I knew by the look on her face he was gone. I can still feel my self collapsing to the floor.  We burred him in our yard, I wish we had gotten his ashes so I could still have some of him with me.

I blame this on myself, I could have done more, it was the weekend so no vets were open near me.  I'm a 14 year old girl so it's not like I can drive to a vet.  That night I hurt myself, I guess mabey because I felt guilty, I was so worried about social media that I just sat there while he died.  Thinking about this makes me feel so horrible and guilty.  I know no one will probably read this because it's long and quite frankly no one probably cares, whatever, mabey one day this guilt will stop eating at me",2022-07-12 06:13:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655317751,2,/r/lonely/comments/vx46np/this_affected_me_so_much_and_i_dont_even_know_why/,,0,0,this affected me so much and I don't even know why

2284,vx56vn,SprayTanBabe,"This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please be kind. (I have been a lurker for many years, but I've always been too timid to post anything) 

I used to cry from loneliness. Besides grieving loved ones passing, it is the worst feeling in the world.  

I made it my only mission to figure out how to make friends and be interesting and to be like someone that others would want to connect with. Literally my only mission, at the cost of grades and opportunities. 

Looks wise, I was a late bloomer, but when I had my “bloom”, that’s when I started receiving attention. This made me really suspicious. Suspicious of men, who heretofore wouldn’t give me the time of day, or would make fun of my appearance…. And suspicious of women, since before I “bloomed”, they had no interest in being associated with me. 

This felt worse in some ways. The feeling of loneliness has never left me, despite having opportunities to connect with other humans. This is why I prefer animal companions. Unconditional love, no judgement, no ulterior motives. 

I’ve been thinking of becoming like an emotional support friend. Would anyone actually pay for platonic companionship, though? I would be worried about unwanted sexual attention. I’ve been reading this sub, and it seems like the women get plenty of that when they post. Assuming there was a way to fix that issue, do you think people would pay for that kind of thing, even if it were just texting a couple hours a day? 

I feel I could actually make people's lives better, in an area that I feel I truly understand, and I would feel these connections would be made with people who genuinely want a shared human connection. Maybe it’s too weird a concept? And then, is it wrong for me to have the motive of making money through this? Even if it’s not a concealed motive? There seems to be something very bizarre about paying for friendship. 

But then I think, I need to work (student debt isn’t going to pay off itself!) and will I truly be helping people by getting some boring office job working for a company that doesn’t care about me, nor I it? People pay for all kinds of support. Therapy, massages, assistants, childcare … etc. Is this kind of service any weirder than hiring someone who take care of your baby? 

I'm wondering what you all think. Thanks in advance. Peace and Love and Blessings.",2022-07-12 07:18:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/vx56vn/turning_loneliness_into_something_productive_and/,,0,2,Turning loneliness into something productive and helpful?

I don't keep with the latest netflix series, I have like 0 followers on social media and i feel like i lost all my hobbies, i was really into bikes, computers and gaming when i was younger, kinda grew out of it, i got into cars but ive kinda realized you need alot of money if you want to really want to do anything with a car, and im sorta jobless and broke right now to do any of that.

I also just don't have any energy like i do have a few friends irl and they all have insanes amount of energy or can make people laugh, and i just feel like an alien whenever i hang out with them. And also when there is someone i don't know i just become very silent and awkward. I have no idea what to say or engage with them in any way. If i go to a party i just end up being that weird person standing in the corner drinking insane amounts of alcohol until i blackout and do some stupid shit.

I spent months with perfect chemistry with them only to have them reject me. Apparently some manly man was her one. He had money and all the things I don't. I thought, it doesn't matter, she has perfect chemistry with me. Life said, you can't be happy. You can't find the one who likes you. Remember, I have never had a relationship.

2291,vx6i50,ventingbento,"I'm at this point of craving relationship things without wanting (not being ready for) a relationship. I'd love to go on dates and be really affectionate towards someone, but I know I'd be stunted at the emotional aspect. My fear of being vulnerable mixed with trauma and trust issues would result in faltered communication. Not that I don't want communicate, I'm working on it, it's just that I believe I need to work on my issues as much as I can before loving someone fully again. It's especially been getting to me lately because all of my friends are in relationships. It's not that I want what they have with their partners, I just want to feel okay, not feel so lonely. 

So I've gotten back into playing Valorant and I've made a couple new friends on there. But I'm a huge flirt and I've definitely thrown out a pickup line or 10. For as long as I can remember I've been like this, but lately I've been more aware of it. Throwing this out there now, I would absolutely stop if someone was upset or uncomfortable and I usually let them know they need to let me know if they do feel that way.

I think I'm really just projecting all of things I want. I go on about kissing, hugging, fucking, dates, hand holding, and things of the sort. Some people acknowledge and indulge me, we laugh and move on, but sometimes I really wish they were serious when they respond in the affirmative to ""let's kiss."" I remember one guy I played with told me something along the lines of: ""you must not get a lot of affection IRL."" He was so right that it didn't hurt, I just felt... seen.

What's on my mind that's gotten me writing this whole thing was when I blurted out ""cuddle me, idiot"" to someone I met yesterday (in game) and how genuinely taken aback they were. I just don't know how to get rid of these feelings of longing. How do I distraction myself from wanting love when it's always surrounding me?

2297,vx7tee,DyslexicCumShelf,"TW: mentions of Su*c*de and SH

Im a 15M and I’ve been suffering from depression from late primary school (10 years old) mostly rooted from racial discrimination and looks related bullying. I’ve always been more of a quiet person with relatively low social skills and this along with my chubby tall Indian figure made me the hub of bullying as a kid. From such encounters I became fearful of talking to people and extremely conscious of how I look. Throughout the last few years I’ve never really talked about how I feel or even had anyone to do so with. Most of my feelings I would bottle up and suppress deep in the back of my mind hoping it doesn’t come back to haunt me later on.

However some time late last year I met a girl who seemed genuinely interested and happy to talk to me in a non judgemental manner. She in fact helped me through many of the long nights that would have usually gone without any sleep whatsoever. At some point I decided to open myself up completely to her, talked about things that I wasn’t even comfortable talking to my parents with (such as the suicides of 2 good long distance friends of mine). All this talk and other casual talk led to a pretty great friendship, so good that she even invited me to her birthday (the first time I went to a party since age 7). All went fine until around a week later I found out she liked one of my classmates who she thought I was close with. This classmate had also been invited to her party. All in all she had basically convinced me through possibly some of the toughest times in my life with words that seemed so caring that could very well all be lies.

The whole thing broke me and with it a few other friendships in which she was an active mutual. With this I started suppressing my feelings once again. Although lately with the pressure of school rising and my relationship with my parents fading further everything has been a lot more tolling. I started not knowing how to control my suppressed self and I even committed some forms of self harm. 

I really want to make friends but I’m afraid people will either make fun of me because I’m a male with problems related to feelings, because of my ethnicity or because of my now physically signs of depression or try and use me again.",2022-07-12 10:18:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604886069,3,/r/lonely/comments/vx7tee/i_put_myself_out_there_for_once_and_dont_know_if/,,0,1,I put myself out there for once and don’t know if ill ever be able to do so again.

2304,vx9efr,RealNotBritish,"I’m a 15-year-old teenager. I will be in 11th grade after the summer break. I think that since the 8th grade I feel quite lonely. I’ve never had many friends, but I did have people that I could hang out with. But I think that it all started in 8th grade. I had friends only at school. The Corona pandemic didn’t help the situation. Two years of home. Well, then a normal year – the 10th grade. It started not nicely but got better and better. And still I had friends only at school. In this year my best friendship ended. He was my best friend since 4th grade, but we just split up because of a very stupid story that happened. Now my only friends are net-friends, and even there I have only two. One is a girl that I had not the best past with her, but we’re trying to work it up. I feel needy and afraid that she’ll leave me too, but she also doesn’t have many friends, so I hope it’ll work.
My relationship with my parents isn’t good, especially with my dad. So not nice that I barely talk to him and don’t call him ‘dad’ but by a nickname (his name, kind of). My relationship with my mum is way better though.
I feel that I shall stay lonely for the rest of my life. Even if I get married or have a girlfriend, she’ll probably cheat on me or use me for money. I mean, I do believe that a girl might fall in love with me, but it seems highly unlikely to happen. I’m not afraid of loneliness. I shall not stay with a person if he’s toxic towards me, but it makes me feel… not nice (?).

2317,vxc0zl,Sparkie_Dime,"Recently found a girlfriend, I thought she was perfect at first. Then it turns out she was cheating on me with a lesbian and gave now completely ghosted me. I then tried to make friends online, and after being ghosted and ignored as usual I met a really cool person. Then a few days after having pleasant conversations, they said goodmoring to me today and said I was ""amazing"" then said they'd be busy with studying so would talk later. I said okay and I hope they had a good day. Then I check after an hour or 2 too see if they messages yet and see that I'm blocked. It feels worse because it felt like that got me well and had some of the same situations in the past. They said how they hated people who ghost, were always direct if something was wrong, and would never leave without having a conversation to sort any problems out first.

Seems typical to find hypocrites, liars, and cheats these days.
Also just noticed before I started this, some posts now have statistics, so I can feel extra unwanted as when I checked my old dating posts I can see that not only did I get a downvots so it currently reads 0 likes, but it was also read by over 1,400 people and not a single person messaged me. Meanwhile I read a post the other day saying how she gets flooded with messages so couldn't reply to everyone. I can well believe it, I've tried talking first before and often get ignored or they say they've already found someone and apologise for taking a week to reply due to the amount of messages they got.

I'm at my wits end. I just don't know what to do anymore. Is it something about me that's inherently wrong, am I looking in the wrong places, or am I just exceptionally unlucky. I can't list everything in the past, but this current situation isn't new to me what so ever.
Also I appreciate people saying lets talk here, but whenever people here have they ghost. Some even right away. They say Hi wanna talk. Then never reply after. It's the same when I offered to help people here, they want to talk then ghost even half way through a conversation while also saying they hate people who ghost. I just don't get it.
Still feel free to if you actually will talk, as I'm  told to be optimistic always maybe I'll even get a relationship from this, though pigs my fly first.

All my life, I've only ever feel lonely. Whenever someone ask who do I talk to whenever I need someone, I said none. No one. Everytime I opened up, it always ended up being my fault. I'm didn't talk enough or I didn't socialise enough blah blah blah.

So I ended up with this massive weight that I've been carrying for years, decades even. It twisted me so much until it left me being a broken husk of a man, jaded by the world, who never really done anything with his life. Still alone. Always will be. Until the day I die.

Talking about today… I’ve always hated my birthday because during summer everyone “vanished” and didn’t acknowledge my existence.
This year not even all the people I frequent regularly wish me a happy bday or anything, and I don’t think I deserve such treatment.
I love being around people I genuinely like to be with, but these past years are getting the better part of me… I feel like I’m isolating myself, but I’m not doing anything to do cause that, it just happens…
Everyday I just feel part of a “wall”… I feel like a decoration to everybody else, one that’s not important and it’s presence or not doesn’t change anything to the overall.

2379,vxo3l1,Gaberrade3840,"So in 2020, I moved to a different state after Sophomore year, and to a different school. I had to say bye to all 3 of my friends. My Junior Year was...well, it could've been worse, I suppose, but certainly could've been better. I made no real friends that year, and it was miserable towards the end. Then Senior year hit, and...it sucked. I hated it so much. However, one saving grace was that I actually made some pretty close friends, and after my shitty day at school, they were there to make me a little bit better. They're great.

However, it isn't going to last. The majority of them will be either going into the military, or university, and we will probably have to part ways. I will only be able to hang with two of them, but without the others, it won't be the same. Then, next year, I myself will be moving to another state AGAIN for university (for some context, I will be taking a gap this year), and like the last couple friends I had before, I will have to leave them behind.

I don't know if I will be able to handle this. They are my friends, and I love them so much. And I can barely stand the thought of leaving them. I've had so few friends for so long, and even when I get some, I have to leave them behind again and again and again. It fucking sucks. 

When will this sick cycle end? When can I have friends that I won't have to say bye to once every few years at most?

2392,vxppsi,[deleted],"Get, so about a month ago I posted on this same sub about how lonely my life was, I was having no friends and the devastating loneliness I was facing. (my that ID is unavailable, hence using this one to post. Just wanted to clarify) 

In that post, I had the last segment about my life getting slowly on track, all that because of my boyfriend. He is the blessing, which has been in my life after a lot of troubles and bad people, I have run into before. Never felt so sure and warm before, which is not the case now. I am having a good relationship. I got a few friends online, with whom I share my experience. 

I had the belief that one day, one day I will have a partner who will make me forget the world. And will give me what I need. I am hopelessly romantic, clumsy, and whatnot. But forever grateful to God that I met him. His family, omg. They are so supportive. I wish the way his mom supports me, mine did that to me. I would have been so better. It's all about the right time and continuous efforts which we make, they pay off guys. They do pay off, slowly but eventually. 


The sole purpose to write this post and making every guy and girl see it and read it was to tell you that you my friend, deserve all the happiness in life. And if you will make continuous efforts for your life to be better, the destiny will lead you to something better. If that happened to me, it can happen to everyone.

But they can never see me. Not truly, anyway. I try to fit in. My life goal is to be kind, that's all I ever want to be. But I suppose I must be failing somehow.

2424,vxtbw3,KratomFiendx3,"Today is my birthday and I'd say it was incredible for the most part. I went out with my 2 closest friends and had a great time. I turned 18 today, I wanted to go to a few of my favorite places as a child, and it was all fantastic. No complaints, I'm eternally thankful for my 2 friends and the experiences I've had with them.

The feels started when I came back home and my friends left. I was tired, but I wanted to continue to wonder around my city listening to Tool. I went to an arcade that I frequented quite often as a child, just to reminisce. 

My god was every person there hand in hand with another. There was a very very attractive goth girl there that I was about to talk to, but then she went to hug her very large boyfriend, and she looked happy. Just to be clear, I'm not, nor will I ever be some incel who has a problem with that.

I'm kinda severely physically disabled, I am wheelchair bound and have many medical problems to deal with on a daily basis. My 2 closest friends are in a relationship together, I couldn't be happier that they found eachother and are so happy together. Holy fucking shit are they constantly all over eachother though.

I've been so excruciatingly lonely for as long as I can remember, having next to no one to relate to ever. Lately, it's been especially rough for me. Every single person in my life is in a relationship and I truly am happy for all of them, but god fucking damnit is it hard for me to watch. 

I know that I must continue to be patient, and the right person will come into my life when I least expect it and most need it. I know that the loneliness I'm feeling now will make whatever relationship I find myself in that much more satisfying and pleasurable, but it doesn't make this feeling any easier.

I've been in very sever pain every single day I've been alive, and I know how to deal with physical and emotional pain well. I'm telling you now, this loneliness hurts more than any amount of physical pain I've ever experienced. 

I really do love my life, and I want so desperately to share it with someone. As a wheelchair bound guy, I'm accustomed to people and children staring at me then averting their eyes when I look back. I know for a fact that people go out of their way to avoid talking and interacting with me, even though I do my absolute best to treat every living creature I come accross with the highest love and respect. 

I do everything I can to make people smile and laugh. I do everything in my power to spread the highest love and light with every living thing. I do not intend to stop being the best version of myself, but my fucking god is it painful to go without physical touch for so long. My god is it hard for me to watch everyone to be all over eachother all the time.

TLDR : I'm disabled and my loneliness is more painful than all of my chronic pain and problems put together. I love my life, all I want is to share it with someone who thinks I'm worth some energy and time. I will continue to be patient and as good as I can be, I know all of this is leading to something beautiful.

Thank you so very much for reading my thoughts and feelings. I honestly do feel better now that I've typed them out. I give you absolutely nothing but the highest light and love possible. I know this is all simply a symptom of duality.",2022-07-13 03:25:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637434010,3,/r/lonely/comments/vxtbw3/this_is_the_most_painful_thing_ive_ever/,,0,8,This is the most painful thing I've ever experienced

2426,vxtsz0,ysra9,"Right, so, my family and me moved to Spain two years ago, more or less, and as every migrant process, it has been (and it's being) something hard to deal with. I came from Chile, where I was an immigrant as well, but there I actually felt comfortable and in peace, I didn't have a big group of friends nor had many acquaintances, but I had a few of really close friends who helped me to make it through. I would like to point out one of my relationships with one friend, which was, certainly, something life-changing to me and her. We were both naive preteen who had to face things we shouldn't have at that age. In our friendship, we found a secure and familiar place to share our fears, questions and insecurities, something that we never had before. She was my first close friend, with whom I reached to levels of trust and intimacy that I have never reached before with someone else. 

Things like that is what I've been looking for ever since I leaved Chile, and I can't seem to find it. Here I have met many people, but none of them has made me feel again the same level of security and comfortability my other friends gave me. I have a group of friends here, but most of the times I feel out place when I'm hanging out with them. Also, they tend to make things without me, and I don't know how to feel about it. People in school cherish me, and lately I've been getting more in touch with them, but I feel like I can't connect with any of them to a more familiar level. I feel like I can't be the best friend of someone, or someone's first option. That when the weekend or summer arrives, I'll probably be by myself or that I'll never have anyone to be my confident.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about all this since I got here, so everything is pretty condensated. I have come with many conclusions; cultural differences, the fact that I don't love people as I used 3 years ago or problems of mine that I've been dragging throughout the years and I haven't found a way to solve them.

2438,vxvlls,RedApollo23,"Hello guys,

Cutting straight to the chase, one tip that helped me tremendously was shadow work. Illuminating my core wounds, childhood trauma, and limiting beliefs allowed me to transcend my destructive (and limiting) thoughts, and move to a better headspace and start attracting more (and most importantly the right) people in my life. 

For example, one limiting belief that I had developed after years of loneliness was me thinking I was unworthy of putting myself out there to meet new people. I would constantly have the thoughts that people would not accept me for who I am, or see me in a vulnerable state, etc.

It is once you start the shadow work, you can start attracting the friends (and romantic partner) in your life!

I grew up in a cult, and long story short, I lost my big group of friends when I left, the girls I loved the most, who I spent nights talking about nothing, playing, etc. They left me and ignored me like I didn't exist after I left their cult. 

 I had 2 non-cult friends growing up, one was my best friend since we were 5, the other eventually became my partner. We broke up two years ago and remained friends until last year.

I never got an answer as to why we broke up, but after hanging out I just got a message saying ""You don't make me feel good"" and got blocked. No explanation, no goodbye, no anything, we ate ice cream in the day and they blocked me in the night. 

I still had my best friend, but after a conversation she accused me of doing things I didn't do to our friend in common (the one who blocked me), she then ghosted me, again, no explanation, no communication or talking our issues, nothing. Just like that I lost my best friend who always said she'd love me no matter.

So I was alone, I started meeting people and now I have a group of three ""friends"", but I feel distanced, I don't like some jokes they do, we have different humor, they do some stuff I'm not particularly okay with, but I don't say anything because I'm scared I'll loose everyone again. 

I'm so lonely, I had everything, I'd hang out with my friends and laugh, have sleepovers, text until 4am, talk about feelings, listen to them, etc. 

Now I have no connection to anyone, I'm just going through life, hanging out and laughing with people on the weekends, sometimes going to their house, watch a movie, act like we are the best of friends, but they don't feel real, I'm afraid if I start truly loving them they'll too leave.",2022-07-13 11:12:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614724097,23,/r/lonely/comments/vy0olg/i_have_horrible_abandonment_issues_and_feel_so/,,0,12,I have horrible abandonment issues and feel so lonely at 20

2477,vy3mzl,ObscureUsername420,"This is the worst I've ever felt in my 19 years of being on this Earth. This depression diagnosis has slowly by surely ruined my life and lost me my job, friends, and even the majority of my family, who decided to kick me out of the house and cut all contact with me. I have kept in touch with two close childhood friends (both female) and they are quite literally my only reasons to live. They listen to my problems, comfort me when I cry, and reassure me that things will get better. They are amazing people.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same about my mental health. I thought I had hit ""rock bottom"" about six months ago, but I've reached far below this level and I don't know what's up or down anymore - it just blends together. I don't have any structure to my day - I'm crashing on one of my friend's couches (bless her soul) and everyday is me feeling a cocktail of negative emotions, most prominently regret and disgust. I'm trying my best to help my friend's parents with whatever they need in order to help compensate them (cleaning, washing cars, mowing lawn, etc.), along with paying some money for rent here and there. I managed to hold onto my savings account which had a good amount of savings, but It's slowly seeping away since I don't have a job. 

Everytime I think I've ""recovered"" I just sink further into the dusty couch which I lay on most of the day. I discuss my emotions with my friend, here and there, but I just feel an overwhelming sense of disgust for myself whenever I see her - I am nothing like my younger self, and I feel like a huge burden to her and her family. Because of this, I feel like just leaving and living on the streets - it pains me so much to be in this situation. I don't think I can keep going much longer. If I die, I'd want it to be in a place where it causes no issues for anyone - I'm not about to Kurt Cobain myself in my friend's living room.

2552,vygt86,No-Caterpillar-1384,"Rant
I’m 21 years old and I live in the UK. I’ve had quite a large group of friends through out my teen years and they’re still around today. They’ve been very kind to me, looked after me in ways and have had a lot of laughs. Im not exactly treated as well as I’d like to be at times especially in certain situations I can feel that I don’t have needs met and I’ll question if they are true friends. I believe most of them could drop me in a second and forget about me. but they’re great in a way and I am quite lucky to have people in my life in general as I know a lot of people my age can not have such a luxury. 

However, over the last few years it’s faded slightly. I don’t think it’s them entirely. My ambitions in life have changed greatly, I guess is the way to put it. I wanna do a lot of things that they don’t seem very interested in and because of that I can’t live the life I want to live especially in my young years. I’m also done with questioning if they like me (which Ik could be my own self doubt) or not and if I really have a firm, strong place in this group. 

I love them though (some more than others :/ ) and I don’t want a sudden and sour goodbye but I really do want people in my life that have similar interests as me and are actually willing to go out there and do them. The main ones are being traveling skateboarding, nights out and making terrific exciting memories that I can boast about when I’m older and genuinely living life to its fullest. Now I can’t say what there ambitions are at life but I can feel that they don’t match up with mine and they show very little interest in the above. 

I feel extremely lonely because of this and I feel like I’m wasting my life and missing out on a life that I know I could be living.

I’ve self harmed a lot ( I don’t often now to avoid scarring but the urge is there all the time) and I constantly fantasise about committing suicide.

I feel extremely lonely, depressed and feel as though my ambitions and myself are not welcome to others. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe I don’t deserve it or try hard enough. I’m lost someone plz give me advice. Sorry for the rant.",2022-07-13 23:12:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627472825,4,/r/lonely/comments/vygt86/friendship_life_advice/,,0,0,Friendship/ Life advice

I did what i wanted that was to talk to a girl i talk to her everything went good, another time i talk to her again, everything went good again. But then i say hey do you want to  accompany me to buy a backpack she says i can't because i need to go to another place, i say ok, but in my mind was like ok it will be another  time.

Well, that time came and i asked her if she wanted to go eat burgers..... she says i don't like dressing on the burger so she did't came, i said ok. Then in my mind i say again ok it will in another moment, that momentt came again, i sad to her hey do you want to go eat with me, she said i been eating (The food i invited her to eat) a lot so i wont go, so my classmates convince her to come and ate with them and me. Well i felt like i was a left over there all the time i was behind, my friend wanted me to not be behind but i felt like no one cared about me so i stayed behind and i felt soooo lonely it was horryble. 

I'm good with the girl i made the first step to talk to her, first i was shy then i was like ok i like her i need to talk to her, now i don't even feel anything for her it's just sad for me. Because i lost every feeling for her in like 3 days for everything she ""did"" to me now i don't even know if she likes me, hates me, or it's just like saying hello just because the other person talks to you sometimes.

The funny thing about everything is that with her the first time we talk i feelt soo happy, but now.... well i don't even know what i feel for her. But my friend is being the best and it's supporting me alot in fact the first time i talk to the girl, he helped me talk to her and always did that but now as i said before i don't even know what i feel for the girl if i even feel somthing.

And something to add it's that i haven't cried in like 2 weeks i think, but today i just broke and cried and i know i shoud not cry for this things becaues this will happen all the time, but this is the first time in my 16 years of life that i feel something real for a girl and i just lost that feeling because i do my best to talk to her, to invite her to eat something, but she does nothing about it and she is like, well i don't feel good or i don't like something and i'm tired of her being like that, but i guess i have to keep going no mather what.

As an adult I’ve had a couple of live-in partners or roommates. I’ve found myself to be alone after breaks ups and I’m not sure how to handle it without reaching out constantly for anybody’s attention. 

Hobbies are hard cuz it’s not easy for me to focus for very long whether it be watching tv or listening to a podcast. I tend to find myself wondering in thought and not long after I’ve started a show I will end up on my phone. I feel like it just allows me to disconnect and escape my mind for the moment. I can’t help it. Otherwise I find myself bored if my phone isn’t an option. For example, if I’m watching YouTube and I can’t open another app I get bored. 

I don’t want to start dating again cuz I feel like it would just be a distraction and I might go fast and hard trying to fill the void. I want to be comfortable being alone.

2605,vyn1yw,Xoroshego,"I often feel very lonely, so much it hurts my chest, in the moments before and when I get into bed. It's not exclusive to that time of day, though it feels more hopeless at those times of day. I often desperately crave cuddling, kissing (and yes sometimes more than that too, let's be frank) or like playful tickling when I lay down in bed. These are things that you can't really give yourself.

I feel like most advice on how to deal with loneliness centres around making your life better as a whole, which could then lead to meeting new people. I agree with this, though it doesn't help late at night or 'in the moment'. It address the bigger picture, though not the smaller picture.

I often get as comfy and cosy as I can with my weighted blanket, pillows and do my breathing exercises etc. though it doesn't provide too much consolation.

I don't want to play any more games, or do any more gym workouts or read any more books, I want that compassionate touch from another person that can't be emulated by my own hands.

I suppose I should say that I sometimes masturbate, obviously, though often it doesn't scratch the itch as I don't really feel horny.... it's that I'm lonely instead.

Doing all of these things in an attempt to cope feels like learning Spanish and then going to Portugal. Similar, yet not the same.

I’m friendly with my coworkers and people around me, but I can’t seem to be able to form strong, close relationships with anyone. I tend to get attached to coworkers, those I click with and understand, but never hang out with outside of work and always end up leaving anyways.

I’ve always been distant in all my relationships of the past, familial, friendly, romantic. It just makes me wonder if I am the reason that it has been so long since I’ve had someone who truly likes me or wants to be around me. I’ve tried using online matching apps, dressing better, changing my personality, but it attracts no one. I’ve even tried focusing on myself and not trying so hard, but it just makes me feel like another speck of sand in a desert. No one cares, but I wish someone did. It feels like some part of me is missing when I don’t have anyone close. I don’t think I could take the redundant advice of focusing on myself again. It doesn’t work.

I may not be the smartest, have a lot of money, be the most attractive, or be the most athletic, but what I am is super super caring and loving, and I just fear sometimes I’ll never find someone who wants to have that love, and give me theirs in return.

After graduation my life started going downhill, lost contact with the friends in high school and wasn’t able to work at the job I was working at as well, which resulted in even more friends lost. 

Then college started an literally it was the worst time of my life. Imagine going through hard science and math without physical help from teachers or others. Freshman and Sophomore year of college just made me literally depressed I lost all motivation to reach out and do anything, I barely ate most of the time. 

During the end of freshman year the vaccines started to roll out which sparked some hope in me. I felt like I was able to go back to work and talk to the friends I used to have. Unfortunately, my parents prevented me returning back to that job due to them distrusting them. The process of me leaving my old job felt so dishonest it made me feel weak. Then I got a new where everyone is assholes and it sucks everyday.

In conclusion, I’m not good at explaining stuff in text or in words but this is how I think my loneliness started. I still continue to exclude myself from others in person because I feel useless and that I’m not interesting.

There was this one time where I was a sophomore in highschool sitting on a concrete divider across a what seemed to be a worn down soccer field. I was sitting perpendicular to it facing the cafeteria, alone. This was back when I didn't give a single crap on how I looked. I was just minding my own business, swimming in my thoughts. I was looking to the side occasionally...but then I noticed 2 petite girls facing my area from across the field. I didn't pay any mind to it all. I just sat there, enjoying the peace and then a few minutes later I was taken by surprise. One of the two girls walked all the way across the fucking soccer field and said ""Hi, how come I haven't seen you around here?"". We exchanged words for 3-5mins. I can't accurately remember what I said but I remember thinking Wtf! Who? What? When? Where? Why? It just seemed so odd to me haha. Then I stood up cuz I got uncomfortable and I think she said like ""am I making you uncomfortable?"" I said I was fine but then she walked away ""I was like noo...wait"" She didn't hear me 🤦🏽‍♂️. Everytime I rethink that memory the song ""Baby come back"" always plays and by now I would've had experienced a relationship already lmaoo.

Now all my old classmates and batch mates have cleared college and have good jobs. Some are pursuing higher education from well-known colleges and universities. Meanwhile I can only hope to get a bachelor's degree in the next four years through distance learning from a regional open college.

Wondering how things got to this point,
It seems that everyone has given up on me,
I'm a broken, loser of a man,
I never felt I was a crying person,
But tonight as the shadows fall in the window,
The tears are like rivers running off my face,
Trying to think who can help me,
I know I can't, because I've tried so many times
and nothing else has worked for me,
My family tells me that I need to surrender,
So I can only think of one thing left,
But I never have been a religious man,
Is there a God or even a Buda,
I've never seen a miracle, so who's to say,
How does one pray, I've never done it before,
Do I do the 'Hallowed be try name...' Pray,
Or do I just suppose to talk to him,
Who do I pray to, what's his name,
I hear people say it could be just a chair,
somehow that can't be my higher power,
Will he answer because of the bad I've done,
Things that are unforgettable in my eyes,
But I have to try, I have nothing left,

God, if that's what you want to be called. Please look down on me and give me a hand. My tears are tears of regret and of being broken. Your help in any small way is what I long for. I know I don't deserve it, because of my ways, but there isn't anyone left except you. I remember stories how you helped others and I really am lost and don't have a clue.

Hi. I'm a 17 year old boy and I have nobody, and I'm starting to lose myself. Literally nobody but my family. There's some people at school that I'm talking with but not in a friend way. I tried to talk to girls but I don't know where I fucked up. Last time I met a girl at a park. (Before we go on I must tell that I know I'm not an ugly dude, I don't really consider myself attractive or hot but I'm an athlete, I work out a lot, and I have a decent face.) So I met a girl. In a more accurate way she started to stare at me. Constantly. I first thought it was just a coincidence but I was wrong. Me and my brother played at a Teqball table for 2 hours when this girl and her friend showed up at the table. They sat on a bench and watched us play. They just sat there, laughed and joking around for hours straight, sometimes I exchanged words with this girl I'm talking about. She's beautiful. She has dark hair, green eyes and freckles all over her face. So when It started to get late they started talking about quiet loudly about that they were going to head home. I thought now or never and I asked for her Instagram and she was shocked. She's started to smile but not in a weird way, it was the purest, most beautiful smile I ever seen. She said of course and i handed my phone to her. 

Later when i got home I thought I text her. She replied quiet fast and I asked her to go out tomorrow. She said yes and she added that she was about to ask for my instagram but she didn't know if she was symphatetic to me. (Ofc she was). We talked for hours we even talked about deep stuff. She said that she was taken advantage of many times and cause of it, she's got little self confidence I tried to comfort her in a polite way. She said that I'm not like other guys she used to talk, but in a good way. It really meant a lot to me. We texted each other goodnight about 1 am. 

So later that day we went out. Everything went fine, we talked about a lot of things. I mentioned that I'm living somewhere else, not far but somewhere else. She was a little dissapointed but i reassured her that if it comes to that I can catch a train and I'm here in 1 and a half hour. We planned an another date tomorrow and we were both excited about it. 

When we said goodbye it was a little awkward. She just stood there and looked In my eyes. I could help but stare in her emerald gems and because i found the situation awkward i hugged her. Then we parted. 

About 2 hours later I texted her if she was okay, and got home safe. She ignored me for hours. Long-long hours.

Hello I am a teen (not gonna be specific because of creeps) and I’m so fucking bored. I have friends online but they are in completely different states, so we can never actually do stuff. Im surrounded by adults, which isn’t a bad thing, but I just wish I could have friends that were anywhere near my age. Im started to feel genuinely so depressed that I stopped eating as much, and I feel extremely lazy. I keep thinking of things I actually want to  do, but then I just automatically feel too.. lazy.

2680,vz331e,Ohokayigetit94,"I just want to vent about my experience around people pleasing and loneliness. Apologies in advance for the rambling

I’m learning I’ve been a people pleaser for a long time. So much so that sometimes it takes me a minute to process when I was doing it vs being myself. Sometimes I feel like idk who I am outside of that behavior. Then that gets me down sometimes and has me feeling lonely. 

I’m starting to understand that it’s difficult for me to build strong and genuine connections with people as a people pleaser, which also has me feeling lonely and disconnected. But at the same time, trying to figure out where I am underneath of all of that has been pretty heavy and confusing. 

I’m 27 and feel like I used to have a lot of friends, but now pretty much all of those friendships fizzed out. (I wonder if that’s because we didn’t genuinely connect or what the reasons for the friendships not lasting may be). I’m not close with my family that lives here just because it’s not healthy for me to maintain a consistent relationship with them. 

Idk I’ve never had an experience where I felt so alone so often and when I to try to fight feeling alone, I end up people pleasing and not actually connecting with people.

It’s a vicious cycle that I badly want to be out of but some days I feel so lost and fearful that I can’t get out of the cycle. 

One thing that’s also difficult in this cycle is the shame. Sometimes I am in situations where I feel I am connecting with people, but then the shame monster comes in and I think about how I must be the only person (Ik it’s not actually true but the feeling feels real) who doesn’t really have friends and what if the people I am potentially connecting with find that out and think I’m weird or something is wrong with me. Every time I see someone my age that I know, they have solid friendships that have lasted years and the fact that I don’t makes the connection process with new people feel more shameful if that makes sense. People will reference their friends and families and ask about mine and that’s when it hits me. 

I do have my good days when I’m more hopeful and confident that things will turn out ok, but lately it’s just felt so hard. Sometimes I can’t escape the feeling that things may be like this for a long time.

However I started to get a bunch of red flags before we eventually stopped talking, between them stealing from me, constantly making plans over our plans and then asking me to reschedule, ditching me and ghosting me when we had plans. I stopped talking to them because it hurt, especially with how much I would go out of my way to help them sometimes. I needed a boundary, but then I just became very lonely, because I haven't been able to get that close with another person for a really long time, other than my partner. And while I absolutely love my partner, we need to have our own friends and activities that we do separately too. But I don't feel comfortable with ""casual"" friends, it feels so weird to hang out with people I don't know that well because of my anxiety/autism.

2721,vz90pi,dwgilbert007,"I'm 54 this month. My mother was social slut, had her first at 16 the 3 son of 4. I was conceived in 1967. You know free love and all. I was not a wanted child. Father bailed out before I was born, mom didn't want me just another financial burden and slowed her social life. 1st half brother 8 year gap had no time for baby. But second half brother 3 year gap was no longer getting all the attention anymore and I did better than him so he was jealous ( the Kane and Abel syndrome) type of hate. So he would beat me up, punching, kicking, using thing to hit me with. As far back as I remember, I was still wearing diapers. At age 5 she hooked up with her 4th son father, for 2 years he would beat me twice a day. Along with big Bros beating. 

At age 7 I am walking home from school and am Run down bY a drunk driver, breaking both legs and almost completely bleeding to death ( Left leg was compound fracture and the bone (tibia) ripped through the flesh about 6 inches. So now I have to learn how to walk again after recovering and additional injuries from hospital incompetence and falls during rehab. But thankfully I got a break from the beatings. Pardon the pun. That was maybe a year. I had recovered so the beatings started again. Mom left him by my 8th birthday, so now she has tO go to work and didn't have day care, leaving the older in charge, ha all he did was hit me and belittle me, then leave. Leaving me alone with a 1year old. She worked 8 hours, granted I was in school most of the day. But she's still going out after work to play, spending time with friends and look for the next man. So I was home alone all night watching after baby. 
  
Well big Bro was hitting puberty so he started molesting me, him and some of his friends. Then beating and belittling. That last until I was about 11 years old and got big enough to make him regret me learning to defend myself. But I still had to not only fight him almost daily I no had bullies because I am intelligent (since birth) but the fact I went to a primarily black population elementary school, and I had to wear clothes that were originally my 2 older brothers handed down, or home made by my grandmother who grew up in the 1920's so I looked like BoB Hope and Bing Crosby actors from the 30's and 40'. So I was probably fight for my life everyday to go home and sit alone. 

I hit puberty technically at 13 but because of the abuse both Physical and sexual I developed a mental condition known as hypersexuality. Ok let's take stock.. never really been shown love, only violence. Never had a positive male roll model to show me how to be a man, nobody to give advice on the opposite sex- dating, spent most of the time alone or on the battlefield, and had a strange urge to masturbate often. Plus social anxiety, poor self esteem, and severe PTSD depression.  And a big brother bully, now Everytime he saw me talking to a girl, he would bully and belittle me, while trying to get her to have sex. So of course she would not talk to me anymore
 
I had a few girls that wanted to experience with me but I had no clue what so ever about what I was supposed to do. And the only guidelines I had to go by was a bunch of sluts (mom and her friends) complaining about how the men they dated treated like crap and them telling me to be nice to women treat them like fragile queens to be worshipped. Be the nice guy and everyone knows that Nice Guys finish last. so I had to figure that part out myself Too. Then started working at 13 washing dishes  full time at a restaurant so I could buy modern clothes. But still trying to Get a girlfriend. But whet to school all day working a 8 hour shift 3-11pm had no time for dating.

2739,vzcu9q,Tobeastrife,"Men, especially straight men, are so often expected to wholeheartedly seek out, accept, and cherish sexual relationships with women; to take what they can get, essentially. Meanwhile, women are so often expected to remain virginal, chaste, ""pure""; to resist the predatory hands and gaze of the lust-driven men who wish to corrupt them.

Both of these expectations are attempts to control human sexuality.

I'm male. I feel lonely just about every day. It's a hollow, aching feeling, and I don't think I've ever truly escaped it. Ironically, I feel the least lonely when I'm alone, maybe because then there is no reminder of how inescapably *different* I am, how *incompatible* I am with the people around me.

But this loneliness does not come from a yearning for sex. While I am mostly a virgin, my sex drive has always been lower than that of my peers, possibly due to my anxiety(?), and the antidepressants I am on (and have recently reduced the dose of) which made me basically asexual over the period I was taking the higher dose. I felt no drive for sex. I was in bed with someone who I was previously attracted to and who wanted to have sex with me. I felt no pull. In that moment I felt lonelier than I ever had before. Sex is the most extreme and obvious symbol for human connection. It is a literal connection, a melding of bodies. I couldn't even do that. How am I supposed to ever feel truly connected to others if I cannot even do that?

The truth is, sex is irrelevant when it comes to loneliness, at least for me. My loneliness is a feeling of division, separation from the rest of not just society, but the human race. I don't want sex, I just want to know someone, and I want that someone to know me. And I mean *truly* know. I want to be understood. And, I suppose, by extension, I want to be loved. Not even necessarily in a romantic way. Just *loved*, by someone who looks at me, sees me for everything that I am, and for whatever strange and wonderful reason enjoys that sight.

I suppose the reason why I felt motivated to make this post was seeing the number of discussions on here about virginity; how to lose it, fear of losing it, fear of not losing it, remorse that you have lost it, etc etc. And the stereotype of lonely men as virgins, ""incels"" even, bitter at the world for not showing them the sexual attention they're looking for, envious of women who they perceive as being guaranteed sex, and by this (hopefully) mostly-fictional stereotypes own extension, a cure for any potential loneliness they may feel. Which is, of course, nonsense, as sex is certainly not a cure for loneliness, in fact it can intensify the feeling by quite a bit, going off my own experience I mentioned earlier. (Not that this hypothetical person would know that, of course.) It feels isolating, as a lonely and rather sexually inexperienced male, to see this narrative perpetuated. I couldn't care less about getting my dick hard; I just want to be seen.

So I guess my point, if I even have one, is... Loneliness goes deeper than a simple yearning for sexual, or romantic, attention. Everyone is lonely to different extents, the promiscuous and the pure, the celibate and the salacious. And yes, the man and the woman and the variations thereupon. All of these equally wonderful genres of human have the potential to feel the pain that we all feel.

So, have sex. Don't have sex. Want sex. Don't want sex. Whatever. It doesn't matter, and should never divide us. We're all in this same, awful boat. Maybe one day we'll reach the shore. :)

Love you,",2022-07-15 02:06:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623233080,11,/r/lonely/comments/vzcu9q/loneliness_and_sex/,,0,3,Loneliness and sex

2758,vzfwmn,Emotional_Dot7472,"I don’t know how to deal with the onslaught of loneliness that has overwhelmed me since I regained some old friends. This is a long story but for the sake of you readers, I’ll shorten it. 

I grew up around the same people my whole life, we each knew each other in different ways (met at school, since childhood, through another friend) and we’re all great friends. We did everything together and one day I was thrown out of the group. I was only told that it was because I was selfish and heartless. This destroyed me for a while because I couldn’t figure out where this had come from. 

Fast forward about two years, I had made friends with two new people, they had also been thrown out of the previous group. We bonded over this unfortunately. We had so much hatred for the previous group, it was unbelievable. But eventually, I realized I was wrong. 

I ended up making up with the previous group who admitted that they had been wrong. The group then merged again and we became whole but it didn’t last long. I ended up being thrown out again, this time though they couldn’t think of a genuine reason. They did it just because. 

It didn’t hurt as much this time, I have no idea why. I grew accustomed to being alone, it was actually very nice at some points and at others I felt horrible. Until recently they decided they had been wrong again and reached out to me. Apparently I forgive too easily because I told them it was alright and that I held no grudges. And I honestly don’t. But now that things have progressed and I’m actually hanging out with them, I feel horrible. Like my social battery instantly drains the second I say hello. 

I just don’t feel like I’m actually there. Like it’s a dream in some ways, or more like a nightmare since I always feel uneasy. I do still care about these people despite everything and some of them have shown genuine remorse but it isn’t the same anymore and it just makes me uncomfortable. I hate how lonely it feels to be in a group that has shown they’ll leave when or if it conveniences them. I can’t figure out why they’d reach out again though if they weren’t genuinely sorry.",2022-07-15 04:42:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627267016,2,/r/lonely/comments/vzfwmn/i_made_friends_and_feel_more_lonely_than_ever/,,0,1,I made friends and feel more lonely than ever.

2764,vzgz90,dwgilbert007,"I didn't mention that we Also moved like every year. Most times to a different city. I was the new kid every year. I never learned to build lasting friendships. Plus new bullies and girls making fun of the wardrobe I was made to wear, nobody showed me correct color matching
, Nothing of fashion. But I now had a job and getting paid so I was reading magazines and watching TV.. Shopping at the popular clothing retail stores. Then bought a Street Motorcycle. I started to be admired but went to school by day and worked all night. Dating was not ony schedule. 

Then about 5 months before the 8th grade finish Mom decided to move to the area I mostly did elementary school. Well I got lucky to scored and won tickets to Heavy Metal day of the summer MTV summer Concert Series Event known as The US Festival 83 in California. Memorial weekend 5/28/1983. I was a minor so an adult had to be present to claim them and attend too. I made arrangements with the girls father who I asked to go. I would meet at their house. Get the tickets. Have fun I was really into music. 
 
The concert was only about 3 miles away. But I was riding my BMX 20' bike to meet up. As I was crossing the intersection in the crosswalk a car driver paying more attention to adjusting the radio dial ran the stop sign hitting me a cause me to be flung at a centrifugal force of 65 mph head/face first into the windshield. I awoke in the hospital 6 days later watching the concert replay on MTV. Trying to understand what happened. 

I sustain massive head trauma and post traumatic amnesia, that was starting to regain. Forehead and face looking like raw hamburger meat. Recovered over the summer. Because of my elementary grades and what scores for What little 8th grade I attended there they passed me to 9th grade high school  and gave me the Pre SAT placement test. Telling me I am in some subjects college level and 12 grade. But due to math being low and PE required I will not be promoted remain in 9th but attend 2 classes at Cal State University. The reminder will be at the high school almost next door to the college. 

When I got home and told Mom the news, she informed me that she had already arranged to move back to the city of my Jr high school. In that district Jr high is 7th, 8th and 9th so I have to go back to the same school. Her friends live there and we are returning to the restaurant to work.  I return to Sequoya Jr high where they say they know me better and disregard the high school recommendations. I need to take another year in 8th grade. 
I was pissed but had no say in that case. Start to work, got promoted to cook more money, but had to go to the graveyard shift. I didn't care they cheated me out of a great education opportunity so  I rather work a good paying job then put up with their BS. They didn't like that I found a way I could legally ride my motorcycle underage obtaining a learner permit only to JR high. And there was nothing they could do. The vice principal of the school was a former police detective of 25 years and had a problem with me being smart Mouth long haired punk.  And I dropped out, Working. 

Not being able to hang out with people my own age, I hung out with the older crowd. Reunited with my former baby sitter. Mom beat friends daughter. And we kinda became attached. We married 3 days after I turned 18. 3 months later she's diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They said it was due to a botched abortion,  at 14 she was a victim sexual assault.  3 months after that we buried her. 

Another young lady I had met earlier that year at a Bon Jovi concert and kinda friended started spending time to console me. And keep me on track focusing on my musical dream of being lead vocalist and guitarist of my in the works Big Hair Heavy Metal/ 70's-80's cover band. She got my affection and became my GF.  6 months into our relationship we get into an argument. She leaves mad heading to her dad's in the mountains. At the steepest Cliff about 200 yard straight shear wall. She attempting to pass a 18 wheeler on the right lane. Realizing his position was wrong attempting to get in the correct lane, not seeing her. Pushes and forced her over the side. Police say she must have rolled over more than 100 times before landing on the roof and crushing her. But she was probably already gone before hitting bottom. I was devastated, dead from the inside. Started to drink whiskey heavily, meth, cocaine, smoking, plus screaming lyrics I blew out my vocal cords. Ending my music dreams.

6 months ago when she got together with my friend, she said she ""sort of"" lied because she was afraid we will go out of touch with me. I don't know how to process this.

The couple of those I’ve had have since ended in disaster and caused me lasting emotional pain. I’ve done my best not to become embittered by this but 10 years without anyone to talk or really open up to have taken their toll. I sometimes wonder if this is really it for me.

I don’t even cry anymore, I just go through the motions day by day completely numb to everything that happens, like some sort of robot.

No matter if you are male or female we don’t give the people who may be good for us a chance and at the same time society is also likely skewing people to behave in a way that makes them a poor candidate for dating 

I’ve crushed on people of different social statuses in terms of wealth though maybe they all came from the same poor ish background. My biology hardwired me to look for attractiveness and society sold it and fed it to me

My standards for marriage may be high but not unreasonably so. I’m not looking for anything in terms of appearances, it’s ok if someone is a little ugly or fat. I myself score decently for attractiveness 


We put a cap on relationships 
There is a limit to how close you can get to friends and family
A cap based on whether someone is within you league or beyond it
A cap on whether we could consider someone a lover someday or not based on if we see them as a fiend or romantically
And we don’t ask or teach me  and women to grow and develop te skills needed to lift their marriage ability or databilty number

I get discouraged. I go from the one with a open heart to shutting everyone out because I can’t get close enough to anyone. I know the theory behind choosing and finding a good partner, but I can’t latch onto it. Nobody sees me the same way even though I’ve been told I am attractive.

I feel like that I don't need to write a suicide note, a goodbye to someone or something like that because I don't have the courage to do that and also no one to dedicate to. 
These days I'm realizing that no one cares about me, yeah it's tough, all the friends that I've made through the years are gone, I'm like a ghost now, no texts, no calls, just a simple ""how are you?"" Would be great...but not a single soul...and also not even my parents care about me anymore they blame me for my depression saying stuff like ""what kind of son are you"" ""no one wants you that's why you don't have friends"", making me look like I’m a sort of criminal, like they didn’t get the perfect son who’s great at school and have no mental illness, first of all I didn’t ask to be born.
During these months I'm starting to realize that I'm not myself anymore, I lost my happiness, my smile, my craziness, I lost my personality, basically everything beautiful about me…completely gone.
Now I'm just a human being that wakes, eat and sleeps and that's all…all I do now is waiting something beautiful to happen, an help, a hand from someone who can lift me up, a blessing from a superior being to make a change in my life, but all this waiting are making seconds feel like hours, days feel like years.

I have poor social skills. I think I’m slightly autistic, and at the very least have bad social anxiety. I overanalyse every interaction.

Quite pessimistic. I can’t imagine flirting or anything like that. I can do small talk, but can never really connect with anyone.

I’ve never had anyone express attraction for me. I’ve never felt attractive in the slightest. If I went to the gym for a year, got into good shape, and dressed well, I could maybe be a 3-4/10.

My whole life I’ve been moving, never had a constant home, never stayed in one city for more than 3 years, I don’t mean to sound cliche but I was always the new girl. It sucks. Even though I’ve been moving my entire life, I’ve somehow managed to make some really good friends who I still keep in touch with. Recently we moved again when I was already halfway through my senior year. When I transferred to the new school I told myself I didn’t need friends and to just get high school over and done with already. I didn’t even try to talk to anyone or befriend any of my classmates bc I believed I didn’t need to as I grew up without any constant friends. But a week ago one of my best friends from the last city I lived in came to stay with me for a few days. We were supposed to go to a concert but it was postponed so she stayed longer than we had originally planned. During the time that she stayed we went to the mall, visited different shops and stores, tried boba for the first time together, went to the pool, blasted music in my room and had dance parties, we had late night conversations and laughed till we our stomachs hurt, we went on drives and just hung out. It was so much fun and I didn’t realize how much I missed doing those things with my friends. She left this morning to go back home because she was getting really homesick. We didn’t go to the concert together bc we still don’t know when it’s going to happen. But honestly, i don’t care. I’m lonely as shit. Now that she is going back home, I’ve realized that my life is super depressing and lonely. The mattress she was sleeping on is next to me and it’s empty. I feel like shit.

2814,vzq74d,Archon_of_Prism,"Growing up I was always an outcast from the other kids. I always got picked on and had to settle for what substandard human interaction I could get from the other outcasts. I've only had a few true friends who would hold conversations with me. Up until two years ago, I thought it was normal for people to just talk at me instead of having a conversation. The other outcasts did it, even my father and sister did and still do.

This is problematic since the other day one of my friends got annoyed with me that I don't seem to ask questions or respond to things he says. Some of that is likely attributable to ASD but I think a bigger part of it is because I never learnt how to hold a conversation since none of my family and very few of the people I hung around ever had conversations with me. Two big things should have been different, the first is that I needed to be diagnosed with ASD earlier on than I was and the second is when I talked I needed people to respond to me but they didn't.

It's a little depressing for me, realising that I expect people I want to know more about to just tell me with no regard to if I asked. When they don't I panic and don't know how to respond. An example is the other day my friend sent me an image of a character he made and when he didn't say more I didn't respond because my brain couldn't handle it.

The most annoying part is that I can do it when it comes to friends who are distressed. I can ask questions when it's about deeper things and the purpose is to let them vent or to help them. It makes me feel quite alone even when I have people around me.",2022-07-15 14:34:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596984763,3,/r/lonely/comments/vzq74d/ive_come_to_expect_that_people_just_talk_at_me/,,0,1,I've come to expect that people just talk at me rather than to me.

A bit of complexes developed over the years and now they are coming out in the form of self hatred... Whyyyyyy do I feel that I'm really ugly? NOBODY loves me, except from my family, there's hardly anyone that would love me or even like me. I even forgot how to smile properly and GOD KNOWS WHENEVER I SMILE I THINK THAT MY SMILE'S MAKING ME LOOK MORE UGLY!! I just open up my camera and start taking selfies and judge myself.

After clicking some pictures I look at them and curse why am I such a sucker? Plus I see those model looking girls and think why tf are they so beautiful and I'm not. I LOOK AT THOSE CELEBS AND MALE ACTORS AND ASK THE SAME FRICKING QUESTION AGAIN... Why am I such an incel?

When I finally got invited to hang out with her and our ""friends"", I found out they did things together but just without me. 

She then invited me to go to an amusement park with the same people, I told her that if it was just to keep the promise of going to this amusement park, then I'd better not go. She responded that I was a very good friend of hers. I believed her and agreed.

But the day at the amusement park was awful, it felt like I was alone, I was just hearing her and her friends talking to each other about what they've done during the week without me. Even though we were 10, I was always alone. This day broke me.

I just don't understant why even bother texting and inviting me to, at the end, just ignore me.

They are sought out. My sister can pick up friends easily. My roommate has a guy she’s dating, and sees him multiple times a week, and I can see their relationship developing.

I don’t understand what it is about me that no one is particularly drawn to me. I’ve been described as “kind,” and “sweet,” but at the end of the day I’m a background character in everyone’s lives. I feel like an invisible ghost walking around that no one really even thinks about, like I am irrelevant. And it’s getting more painful each day.

I am tired of being lonely and not having anyone in my life, but each time I try to hang out with someone, nothing ever ends up coming of it. And each time, it reinforces the pointlessness of even trying to socialize at all.

I wasn’t able to tell who were and weren’t my friend since I assumed people liked being around. Later did I know people were making fun of me and used me as the butt end of the joke.
I remember being invited to events where I had to “dress up” but I was always the worst looking one and people would point out my insecurities. I’m high school, I ended up filling my days up with school, study and games… and this was a consistent cycle I kept. I always told myself that I didn’t have time to be in a relationship since it would be a waste of my time. I guess this is also from my trauma of being bullied and people would do pranks about liking me and I took it serious.
Now I’m 23 years old, and I can’t take any compliments. I always think people are joking or just trying to be funny.
I’m now enjoying spending a lot of time along as I can pass time from working and playing video games.

2954,w08ma0,ExcellentCollection8,"I live on a small remote island in Scotland. I love it here but the loneliness of being a young adult is unbearable. My age group (mid 20s to early 30s) is the smallest demographic. Almost everyone I went to school with has left to study and actually have a chance of getting a job. 

I have tried to make friends or try dating but it is actually impossible. And I am not exaggerating. My Tinder is a desert, just a few people I would never want to date and a few tourists that don't respond. The app may as well be a wallpaper of the no people in your area screen. I tried meeting people in real life by going to events and clubs for my interests, but the only people my age were married (usually with kids). The average demographic of these events were boomers that completely look down on me and make stupid insulting remarks about my appearance. My closest friend is twice my age and just uses me as a therapist for her own dating issues (desperately seeing a 60 year old married alcoholic because there is no one else even though she is rich and beautiful). 

I tried long distance dating but it just doesn't work. I spent so much money on travelling back and forth multiple times just to find out that we are incompatible in real life.

2957,w094k5,Adventurous_Lion2068,"Recently every single one of my friendships I've been trying to grow and make a meaningful connection with have just fell through. What am I doing wrong? I know to not come off too strong, but also friendships do take some effort on both sides. I put my effort in, and I never get the same returned to me. Many have just fallen through, but tonight another one did. He and I have been talking a bit more lately since we've been very lonely and depressed. Come this weekend he hits me with ""Oh I'm going to go head out and see the girl I was talking to this weekend"" and proceeds to rant about how he won't be single after this weekend and how he'll get to do all the things I want to do with someone. He invited me over to his place, for it to be a safe haven. So I could be held by someone and cry before watching a show with pizza to stuff our faces with. But now that he has a girl, that's not gonna happen. I'm not going to exist in his world anymore. I was simply someone he could talk to while trying to find someone to date. I never liked him more than a friend, but I seriously want my person to find me. All around I see people meeting their person and their life falling into place, and then there's me. The complete opposite. I'm honestly really doing well mentally, emotionally. I'm at a bump in the road currently, but I'm doing well. I told myself don't date until you're to this point. Now I just want someone to share life with. Those spontaneous adventures you take before getting ice cream or food on the way home to cuddle and watch a movie before taking a nap together. Staying in on rainy or snowy days, baking something together, doing hobbies. It might sound cheesy, but I just want to build a genuine connection with someone. And it to mean something. Not something someone could throw away in seconds. I want a bond that grows and grows and only strengthens with time. I want something real. I want love. I thought I've experienced what true love feels like, but it turns out I really haven't. All my past relationships have not been the greatest. I always feel super happy and lovey dovey, before the red flags start to really shine and show themselves. And then I'm the bad guy for ending things when in reality, I know it's better for the both of us. I don't regret any of my past relationships. But I wish I could find one that lasts for years, that's safe, comfortable, healthy, real. I feel like that's all we want. But there's a part of me that's just longing so badly for that connection with someone.... It's all too much to ask for isn't it? We all have our standards and expectations. And I feel like mine are too much, even though I've been told countless times it's just the bare minimum. I'm not used to common human decency. See, I'm someone who used to bend over backwards to help people as much as I could. People like us never get the love and care we give, back in return. We don't know what it's like to be cared for, feel worthy, loved, wanted. But that's what I want more than anything right now.

The only social activity I look forward to all year is Anime Iowa, and I haven't missed it in 16 years, aside from the year they didn't have it because of the pandemic. This year though, I had it all planned out, including the fancy hotel to make up for the trash hotel I stayed at last year. The price tag on the fancy place seemed like a good idea at the time, as I wanted to splurge, but the closer it got, the less confident I was in dumping that kind of money on the con for just me. After a while I essentially talked myself out of going at all and cancelled the room reservation. I have my cosplay ready, and I still have a week, I could potentially find someone to stay with, but I can't get myself to ask anyone. It would have to be an acquaintance at best since my usual crew has dwindled to nothing, so that doesn't help.

2996,w0edvp,SincerelyJackson,"So I’m entering my senior year after summer break, and to give some background I’ve always been pretty lonely. I would only really ever have 1 main friend and sometimes just none, and it never really bothered me. I’ve never had a girlfriend or been really close to it, I’ve had girls at school ask for my number but I usually end up ignoring them at some point, honestly I’m not sure why. But the main point is I feel like a complete failure, this has never annoyed me up until recently and I’ve realized how much I’ve missed out on and how much of a loser I feel like. Why am I like this? I create this emptiness in myself. It’s my fault, i don’t think I’m ugly, I think I got decent style and stuff. I don’t really struggle with social skills, at least like small talk or whatever because I’ve never gone deeper than that. Maybe I just find the loneliness easy. Now, I feel it is too late to try to create a ton of friends and make these high school memories and enjoy my ending teenage years as I should have. I just feel like a loser no memories, no first kisses, no stories to tell, just a damn loop of everyday being the same. I’m also just a boring person. Deep conversation would go no where with me, I haven’t really experienced a whole lot. I don’t really have hobbies, maybe playing games but I have grown tired and bored of that as I’ve grown up. I’ve been playing basketball and hitting the gym every once in a while but at the end of the day I still feel unaccomplished, behind, lost and alone. I’m worried this will never change; that I will live life like this forever and it’s starting to hurt me as I grow because I should be having these experience or should have already had them. I don’t want to live like this, but I feel as it is too late to escape. Unless I go to college and maybe have more opportunities there, what will I do?

3000,w0frtz,itaukeimushroom,"I lost my best friend a few months ago and I feel like I died with that relationship. 

I’m in limbo between teen and adult right now, and they say that these years are usually the hardest. 

This summer would have been a year since we first met. She was like a sister to me, and I can’t stop thinking about all of the memories we made together this time last year. I wasn’t allowed to have friends growing up, and for the first time, I found someone who seemed at the time to genuinely care, even though it turned out otherwise.

Ever since she left I’ve been frantically running around trying to make friends. I’ve been taking care of myself, working my behind off, focusing on school, going to therapy, etc., going out to social events, but nothing seems to work.

This crippling emptiness that I feel in my chest where she once was can’t be filled with “self care” or “therapy” or “medication.” It just feels so empty.

I don’t miss her because I know she wasn’t a good person, but I miss the feeling of having someone there. Someone to go places with. Spend time with. Someone to care for.

When she left me, she had other friends to turn to. People who call her every day, multiple times a day, people who care about her well-being, go out with her, send her gifts, or text her. I see her almost every day. She seems to be doing well without me. 

But I don’t have any of that. Not a single person checks up on me, and all of my efforts to socialize have been in vain. I take myself out to events in the city in hopes of meeting new people. Nothing. I volunteer. Nothing. I work, but still nothing. I’m in school, but nothing there either. 

I don’t even see what’s the point of having a phone anymore, other than to tune out the loudness of my painful thoughts. No one texts me, calls me, or checks up on me. No one really cares about me. 

It’s hard not to feel worthless when people could care less whether you live or die. It’s hard to keep trying when the only results you see are in your head. I have friends there, but I can’t touch them, and I miss the feeling of hugs. 

I know if I keep going, one day I will reach happiness and find a friend. But this in between is so agonizing, and I’ve never felt more alone before. 

I was conditioned to see people as bad and stay to myself when I was younger, and I did. I was happy then, by myself. I tried doing that again as a teen, but it’s not the same anymore. Once I got a taste of friendship and it was taken away from me, it was like a drug. The physical and emotional pain I feel every day I spend alone is like a withdrawal symptom. I can barely function. 

Therapy isn’t helping. Seeking help isn’t helping. I have a job but no friends there. I volunteer but I have no friends there. I have no friends in school, but I’m hoping this year will be different. I’ve tried so hard. Harder than you could even imagine.

I feel like I’m destined to be this way forever, and if I am, this isn’t a life that I want to complete. Maybe if I go now, I can get a better chance in another life. A chance to finally be worthy enough of someone’s time.

I just really wish I had someone who genuinely cared. Not because they have to because it’s their job, not because they want my money or they feel sorry for me, but because they see me as someone worthy enough of love. Because they care somewhere deep in their heart, about someone as worthless as me.",2022-07-16 12:40:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641405450,1,/r/lonely/comments/w0frtz/i_just_want_someone_to_care_genuinely/,,0,0,"I just want someone to care, genuinely."

Here’s goes my story:

I have no friends, no family (all passed away / abandoned me when I was a teen), and I’ve just gotten out of a LDR (4 years) 2 months ago in which it was a blindsided breakup, basically ghosted me after I’ve confronted him about him chatting with his former FWB that he knows I have problems with even before I met him. Then I later found out he cheated on me while we were together with his tutor who I’ve warned him to stay away from since I can clearly tell she have a crush on him. I caught him and her together dining in our favourite restaurant just a week after our breakup and had a public meltdown. He confessed that he reached out to her while he was ghosting me. After our so called breakup, he been seeing me sleeping with me behind his gf back, told me he is 
coming back to me multiple times, called and ended things with that girl via phone call in front of me, and then disappeared and went back to her afterwards. 

He was my entire world and my life revolved around him and only him. I have absolutely nothing and no one to talk to. I’ve tried to kill myself but I guess I was not brave enough to go through with it and ended up staying in the hospital for days. No one visited.

Life fucking sucks and it’s a lonely path. Though it feels good sometimes just to have someone to talk to :)",2022-07-16 16:30:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623553369,10,/r/lonely/comments/w0kis2/lets_chat/,,0,8,Let’s chat!

Everyone ends up lonely sad and miserable. Deciding how someone feels based on what they have is always a bad idea. Who is to say which is worse? Who is qualified to make that call? 

 I think the goal of this sub was not to create this division but was intended as a place where men and women could be lonely together and find ways to improve. with the men not harassing the women and women not cutting on the men. If that could have been achieved i wonder how many people might have been helped. 

 Doesn't it kind of suck that we cant even get that right ? The men hating on women and the women hating men. The men sexually harassing the women even online and the women cutting them down saying they cant be lonely its just their dick. Idk it just makes me sad the division is not worth it.

I don’t know if it’s just because I was dating them to have someone there or it’s just me. I like to think I’m very charming and I can make people laugh and I’m decent looking but maybe I’m only good on the surface and when someone gets to know me I’m scared and don’t think they’ll like me so I just end things. My longest relationship has only ever lasted a few months and then I found it to just be stale. On top of that every time I’ve had sex I honestly did not like it. I’m not sure if it’s been because of the people or it was just me. I’ve only ever really liked one girl(H) but fucked it up way too early and hate myself because of it. I haven’t dated anyone in about 2 years and honestly think I’m just doomed to not be in a relationship. I have very low self-everything and I just think I’ve come to the conclusion that I won’t really ever find someone and I think I just have to come to terms with it.

Not just in terms of relationships and that stuff, but life in general. My only friend is too busy because of all the inflation and crap to hangout with me. My former friends don't even remember me. And every member of my non immediate family only sees me once in a blue moon. The one time we did come together this year was for my Grandma's passing and subsequent funeral, which made 2022 the worst year of my life by a long shot. I do have one thing to look forward to though. Next month, (shitty though it may be due to officially becoming a 20 year old virgin) is when Dragon Ball Super: Superhero comes out. I am of course, going to see it, as it's one of the few good things I have to look forward to this year. But even it will have a drawback. That being, I'll have no one to go see it with.

I'm gonna be quite honest,
it's a long one.

Have you ever felt like all the conversations and connections you ever made were meaningless.
with friends, work friends, sexual partners, Ex's and even famly. 
makes you feel like you never fully open with them and it shows, and that is why all of those connections fade away so quickly.

I recently broke up from my 3 year GF(long story)
she was the world to me,
after we've lived together and talked to each other everyday(before the breakup).
it went from once a week to once a month and now to not at all in just 3 months.

feels like most of my friends and people in general that i made contact with never actually stood around for long, a big part of it is my fault, Because i dont like to go out asmuch as everyone.

but still that makes me wonder if i'll marry someone will those so called friends will even come to the wedding? or we've lost connection for so long that everyone will think I dont really want them to come because we have'nt stayed in contact

and oviously the famly will come but its the same here is it only because they are supposed to? because i've been losting connection with them too. (i live in a diffrent city)
and we cant communicate that well because my weak foreign language, It became really bad after  19 years living in a diffrent country.
so slowly they contact me less on phonecalls and via text.

bessically i feel irrelevent.

3075,w0sfl1,NovelLongjumping4501,"Hello, I've been having thoughts about reconnecting with a friend of mine who I have cut off earlier this year because of my bad mental state. This is the second time I've left for some time to collect myself, the first time we were apart for 8 months and he reached out to me when he noticed I was back because he was waiting for me. However I unfortunately was still not in the best mental state during that time either, so we talked for one last time. 


This time I had said that I don't want to make anyone wait (referring to him) as I made it clear that I maybe not returning again and that this is something I had to do alone, he was very understanding, he stated that he'll unfortunately be fine if we never speak again but as long as I got better and then said he'll miss me. 


I've been missing him a lot today, our friendship was a really kind one that I hold dear, but I don't want to let my traumas and toxic traits ruin what we have, I don't want to hurt him or myself in the process. It makes me scared. I told him I would get better but I find myself just repeating that to myself without making any actual healing. I'm still a trainwreck mentally and emotionally, and I really don't want to burden that onto him, my traumas only appear when I'm getting close to someone, and the fear and anxiety of it overwhelms me that I have to distance myself from them. 


I would love to have him in my life still, but I guess I'm just too afraid of what can happen if I reach out and what may become of our friendship. Is it best for me to leave things as they are and just hold close remembrance of him and move on to keep working on myself, or do I take the risk of rebuilding the bridge? I can make new friends but I just feel like I won't be able to find another friend like him anymore.",2022-07-16 22:41:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/w0sfl1/should_i/,,0,1,Should I?

I thought things went well enough, her profile suggested she wanted nothing serious, so the entire night I was attempting to flirt with her and enjoy the night with her. She seemed receptive enough. The music was a blast, she said she was tired and wanted to go home. Understandable, this was kinda last minute (she invited me a couple hours prior). I walked her to her car and left her with a kiss. I like to think I didn't force it on her, we hugged and then I looked at her and believe I got the nonverbal queue for a kiss. Afterwards, I messaged her if she was free anytime this week and she said she was going out of town with a friend. Ok cool. Today I messaged her hoping she was having a good time. She told me she wasn't interested in me and didn't feel a connection.  


Okay, no big deal, it wasn't going to be serious anyway, I apologized for bothering her, and she told me I'd probably find a girl someday.

Out of the blue, I stopped talking to her. She noticed that and asked why. Told her I don't wanna be in the friendzone. She said she really admires me and likes talking to me and insisted on staying connected instead of letting go off the friendship.

But I think it's meaningless, because she isn't even good at being a friend. She just likes how I validate her and put her on a pedestal, she admitted it herself that she likes it when I praise her.

So now I'm home alone , sitting on my sofa and thinking when everything went to hell for me , no friends no anything , i just got texts from some family members and three friends but that's it .

Not sure what's going to happen with my mom , it's not looking good , but i just feel tired and exhausted , sometimes i just feel i can't do this anymore.

It seems like the ""friends"" I have just spend time with me because they have to, they never talk to me outside of when we play a video game together and lately they don't even do that anymore. Today I was on my Playstation in the main menu of Fortnite waiting for them to invite me to play for almost 2 hours straight and the invite never came, even though it's something we used to play together and they saw me online.

I feel and think these horrible things multiple times a fay, every day, for years

I physically tic when I feel or think about them. It’s the only way I can stay moving 

It’s so much harder when I’m alone. I’m so thankful to have my boyfriend but recently he’s been busy and hasn’t been able to see me after my work a few days out of the week and those days, when I come home to nothing, I find myself swallowed in my own feelings of pain and intrusive thoughts 

When I spent some time in rehab I would write in detail the horrible things in my mind and read them to my therapist but I don’t think that is going to help me anymore 

I cannot shake the thought out of my mind that I would trade anything I have now up to not have ever existed. 

I don’t know what to do to fill the void. Recently no games have been fun so all I do is try to start conversations in Instagram comment sections and watch YouTube videos about cars 

I didn’t know how to start this or how to end this. I just wanted to unburden myself of these thoughts and to possibly get insight on what I could do.

I want to give her everything and show her how much I love her, get her everything she wants and deserves, but she wants to break up. For some background I just graduated 2 months ago and my girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years now, long distance, when we first started dating things were great but somewhere along the way I stopped caring ig and got used to just saying the same thing over and over like ""oh ok"" or ""that's cool"", things like that. I didn't realize that's what was going on, I talk like that with everyone else, I am very boring as a person in general anyways and like I said before don't find interest in anything, so apparently 2 years of me just being vege she was trying everything that she could, sent me messages, wrote letters, and a lot of other stuff, we saw each other a couple of times when we could but was probably a total of 7 times in 4 years. During one of the times that we saw each other I was very pushy about certain sexual things, I begged and pleaded to touch her and she said no but I did it anyways, I'm very ashamed and hate myself for what I did, all I wanted to do was give her pleasure but she said no and I didn't respect that, I'm a horrible humanbing for what I did, and on top of that I wasn't  able to show up for things like here 18th B-day and graduation big life events that will never happen again. I thought things were ok because every time I would ask her if she was ok she said that she was and smiled and laughed, but after she graduated she changed. She told me about everything, that I wasn't trying hard enough and about what I did, so then I tried as hard as I could, I did everything that she wanted me to do, I found different ways to show her that I love her over long distance, but during that I didn't do one thing and that was give her space, the one thing that she really wanted and I didn't give it to her and I again didn't realize that I was doing something that was hurting her. I want to keep trying and make it work but she doesn't because of what I said and did over the years, if we break up I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't care for anything else but her, she's the reason why I live.

3126,w0z90s,SiberianPureHerbs,"So I was supposed to get a job abroad. I was extremely stressed for almost the entire month, thinking about how I would have to share a room and possibly a house with strangers, in strange place for a few months. I didn't want to leave friends I could at least play, talk or watch something with. I was afraid if I'd make enough money for it to be worth it going. I could only hope to get hired by a company or go back with enough money to invest it in better living, maybe finding a place to live on my own. But I don't have to worry about that, they said they're full and I'm back at what it was. I don't need to say goodbye to my friends, I don't need to meet any strangers and live with them. But I also feel like all my perspectives just closed. Yet again I'm stuck with no job, a lot of pressure, a lot of stress. Maybe they will call me again and I'll be double, if not triple, stressed about going abroad again. I don't even know if I want it, I hate everything related to strangers and losing my internet life. I only wish I'd have someone close to talk about it. Someone I'd not be afraid to open to. As I like my friends, and they're great, I don't feel like opening to them. I'm afraid of breaking our relations, of being hurt, of making them feel uncomfortable. I'm just so lost and stressed, if I could, I'd move to the forest, disappear, become a hermit.

3127,w0zh0v,kingcrawly,"Hello everyone. I’m 20F, I go to college and work a pretty decent job, and have a pretty amazing boyfriend who i spend most of my time with.

I had a decent amount of people i went out with in highschool but only about 3 actual friends i spent most my time with throughout my highschool career. Ever since covid happened and i’ve been working this job since i was 18 and found a partner, i feel like a shriveled up old woman. My best friend moved across the country a little bit ago and my other “friend” is actually a pretty terrible person and doesn’t ever include me in the off chance she does leave the house. 

I feel like a shell of the person I once was and i struggle to make friends. I feel like a loser and it doesn’t help seeing people I used to know go out and party all the time. I want to feel like partying isn’t the only thing that can lead to w fulfilling life. I would like to go out and party sometimes but have no where to go and no one to go with. i do enjoy my free time because i do love to be home and hangout with my boyfriend and pets and play video games. But sometimes i feel like i need social interaction outside of him and work.

I feel like a loser because i’m not gonna have a 21st birthday party like everyone else, i’m wasting my good years being like a grandma. I just want to feel like there’s more to life than going out and getting drunk and seemingly having fun like everyone else is doing because i feel like i’m missing out and possibly wish in the future thst i tried harder to fulfilling this unrealistic idea of mine.",2022-07-17 05:01:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651175602,12,/r/lonely/comments/w0zh0v/feels_like_im_wasting_my_good_years_is_partying/,,0,4,Feels like i’m wasting my “good years”.

3128,w0ztt3,Reaper_02,"back home i have amazing friends, ones that i wouldn’t be able to live without, ones that if i lost i’d really be alone. now that i have been in for a few years it’s gotten harder to find people to hang out with. yes i understand that all the people around me are from different walks of life but i think that just makes it harder for me personally to click with people. i grew up very fortunate on the upper end which i am beyond blessed for and my friends back home that i grew up with are the same. i can never relate to someone when it comes to things to do, i grew up an introvert and still am till this day so i don’t have the same motivation as the majority of people around me to go get fucked up every non working day or fed holiday. sure i’m a peoples person but i just do not like the party scene and the majority of social gatherings. i go play lacrosse which no one does and i work out. 

1. i have met probably 3 people with a background of lax but they don’t have any desire to pick up the stick again 

2. people i’m around don’t like crossfit 

i joined an adult league that starts up here in september so i’m extremely excited abt that and making new friendships. the things i do to surround myself with people are go to community church which ive been doing for the past year and it’s great but i always go alone which sucks but the people are amazing, go to costco cause you get a lot of social interaction there (great deals to) anddd that’s it, it’s been wash rinse repeat every week for the past year. i try the whole tinder bullshit but i think it’s stupid and i believe something natural is the absolute best way. inside of all that i get super depressed and only once have i had a moment of time where i didn’t think i was worth it anymore but god pulled me out of that and hope not to return but i just don’t know if i’m bound to the lonely life forever cause it damn well seems that way (yes i plan on doing a good amount of time active). i don’t have anyone not even a pet to spend time with and even talk to on a real note not the military me but the personal me. i do still live in the barracks sadly and i have never had a roommate that i have actually genuinely liked so hopefully soon i get bah lol.

3132,w10qt0,uuniversal,"I graduated from college last year and I'm already doing pretty well in my career. I've already gotten a raise and a promotion in a field I really enjoy. I've always been someone who is career-oriented, but I feel like it's affecting my ability to feel connected with people. In high school and college, I was always pretty popular and well-known. However, after graduating, I realized how many of my relationships were surface level and based on my proximity to them. Part of me feels like people don't reach out to me as much because they assume I'm always busy-- I've confronted my friends on why they left me out of things before and it was because they felt like I was super occupied with school and interning-- a misunderstanding that we resolved so I'm pretty sure they know now that I'll always want to make time for them.

I work from home so I spend most of my days alone. I keep myself busy with work and the gym, where I can only have small talk with people. At the end of the day, I really just crave a real conversation with someone. I used to have deep conversations with my friends all the time. All of my friends are in relationships except for me so I always feel like they're already occupied with their partners. My friends don't go to me with their problems anymore because they have their partner. And when they have relationship problems, I'm not the go-to person because I'm not in a relationship. Whenever we've hung out recently, they always bring their partners too so the dynamic is not the same. They'll go on double dates together which I'm not obviously not invited to.

I secretly envy people with friend groups where everyone is single because since I'm still in my early 20s, I still want to go clubbing and party. I haven't had a night out where it was just me and my friends having fun because they always bring their partners. I already feel like my youth is being wasted especially because of the pandemic. I just want to have fun with my friends again but they respond more in the group chat with their partners than the group chat with just us! When I ask them to hang out, they'll tell me they were already planning to do that with their partner and still invite me but a part of me feels like it's also out of pity.

I'm on dating apps, but I haven't met someone I could see myself with so far. It still doesn't fill my need to actually talk to someone since dating app conversations are all texting. I also don't want to jump into just any relationship because I just got out of a toxic one. And yes, I've done the self love journey, I still take myself out on dates, and I do love myself but.... I'm an extrovert by nature and want to feel connected to people. I guess I'd rather be alone than be around the wrong energy but it still gets lonely.

Although I have some friends who could relate to my life, it's hard to make plans with them now because everyone is so busy. There's still no one I can talk to while my emotions are still fresh at the end of each day. No one to share my highs or my lows with. When I tell my immigrant parents my accomplishments, they don't seem to understand it or seem to recognize how hard I work when I just want them to celebrate with me. I feel myself getting more disconnected and falling into depression. I used to be a really happy, extroverted person but now I feel like I seem more emotionless and empty. When I talk, there's less enthusiasm in my voice and I'm less invested in other people's lives. When I spend time with my friends, they love to gossip so I basically have to listen to it even though I don't care. No one really asks me about my feelings. And if they do, it's in front of their partners so I don't feel comfortable being open. They probably don't ask because they don't think I'm secretly depressed. A lot of my friends say they live vicariously through my social media updates. They only see that I'm doing well at work, hitting PRs in the gym, and traveling every month.

I also feel like everyone in my life is in such different phases. It's really hard to find people who can relate to the things I'm happy about, stressed about, or the things I'm going through in general. I also don't like being as open with people anymore because I don't see them as often. Maybe the same way I find gossip to be boring, they find my talking about work to be boring. 

Regardless, I still have a lot of people in my life and I am grateful for that. I'm grateful that I'm doing well in many aspects of my life. It's just been a while since I've felt connected and understood by someone. When one of my friends hugged me I realized that I haven't been embraced so long, I forgot how good it felt. Sometimes I think about going to therapy just so I could pay someone to listen to me.",2022-07-17 06:21:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1495343354,1,/r/lonely/comments/w10qt0/doing_well_in_my_career_but_i_still_feel_lonely/,,1,0,Doing well in my career but I still feel lonely.

3136,w1144h,Funny-Meet8871,"I had a wonderful life. I had friends and I was even married with a child on the way. Through my own choices my wife and I ended up divorced. My friends ended up moving on with their lives and now are starting families of their own. I don't get to see my daughter much and therefore haven't been able to build a relationship with her. Tonight I went to a company function at a water park and I saw one of my coworkers and friend of about 7 years there with his wife and daughter. It didn't hit at that moment, but it's really hitting home now. The life I could have had. Now most evenings are spent alone. I feel empty and hollow. My life lacks fulfillment and whenever I try to find it again nothing seems to fill this hole I have. I have no one else to confide in so I have to do it anonymously on Reddit.

3150,w11wuo,Used_To_Being_Used,"It's been about a month and a half since I deactivated my social media accounts that had any of my friends attached to them. I did it for a mental health break because I was sick of seeing all of my friends getting engaged, married, announcing pregnancy, getting a great new job that pays well, completing a project that's been years in the making, moving along with their lives, etc, while I'm over here extremely lonely, touch starved due to a recent break up, feeling completely stagnant, and lacking just about everything that they're sharing. While it's been great for my mental health because I stopped comparing myself to what I saw, it's been awful for my already established loneliness. I used to consider myself a person who could confidently say that I have friends, or at least people that would make an attempt to keep me in their lives. Not anymore. 

I've had exactly one person reach out to me asking if I was okay. That person has since not contacted me. I'm in frequent contact with yet again, exactly one person. A friend I made back in high school 13 years ago. The friends I made in elementary/middle school, that I thought I was closer to than this high school friend, don't bother talking to me unless they need me to work on a car, borrow a tool, help them clean up a backyard, etc. All circumstances where my value as a friend is based on my ability to perform a task, not because we're supposed to be friends. I'm not invited to just hang out, party, go out to dinner, anything that friends would typically do. I'm only summoned when I need to be used. I try to make a point to contact the people I would like to include in my life but more often than not, calls aren't answered and messages aren't responded to.

It really fucking puts it into perspective.

If it's any insight, I have a history of depression, suicide attempts, hospitalization, treatment, and therapy. Sitting at home alone every night is weighing really fucking heavy on my mind. It feels like this constant, extreme loneliness nullifies any progress I've made through my journey of trying to get better. The only thing that I know works to keep me somewhat satiated is to keep my brain occupied. Because of that, starting next week, I'm going to be working 7 days a week between two jobs.

He is really the person I talk to/ see and seeing him hanging out with so many different people, watching him with his close group of friends, it makes me want that. I want nothing more than a group of friends that invite me places and want me to hang out with them. He told me tonight that he’s going across the country with them all for a couple weeks of concerts and honestly it kinda hurt hearing that he’s got friends to do that with. 

I know it’s stupid, I know I don’t need that many friends but it still is hard hearing about all the things he does and it honestly makes me feel like such a loser like I do nothing but talk to him and he’s out hanging with so many people I’ve lost count.",2022-07-17 14:24:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1580783243,9,/r/lonely/comments/w18km1/jealous_of_boyfriends_social_life/,,0,8,Jealous of boyfriends social life
3188,w18ybs,pvals_4life,"It's not like I have any reason to complain about. I think objectively things are ok, probably more than ok. In fact what more could I ask for? I'm studying abroad. 

I have a loving family. I just don't want to burden my mom anymore. She does so much more than I do and it's not like she can help me anymore than just telling me it'll be ok and giving me a checklist. That's a lot more than everyone else gets. So why aren't I grateful? 

My roommates were lecturing me about religion yesterday. They said it helped them have a purpose. I think I believe there's nothing after death. That the world isn't fair and there is no forever and that we have to accept such things. Maybe I'm paralysed by fear of fucking up. I thought religious people would use the existence of an afterlife to find peace and be satisfied with what they have--to live a smaller unambitious life. Why can't I believe in God? I have no faith in things I've never experienced that lack sufficient explainatoin or appear arbitrary. They asked me what I would do if I died and God exists... I don't know. Burn in Hell I guess. I've never thought it was real for a second, but if it is? 

I think what's bothering me is how I waste my life online. On YouTube or Netflix or some other entertainment whatever dopamine is readily availible. At least I'm not playing videogames anymore but I just replaced it with something else. 

I get joy when people are vulnerable with me and when I overshare. Can I change? Is it ok for me to say such statements about myself? Is it a reflection of my self-knowledge or self-limiting beliefs. 

I have no drive and yet i still convince myself I could change the world if i gave something my best effort. It's pathetic. I think I'm afraid to try. Or I convince myslef that I don't want anything. I think I really dont. 

I have a test tomorrow that if I fail, my parents may pay for another semester of college. I have barely studied and I'm reasonably confident I'll make the cut. But I hate myself for not preparing. For what? to watch another episode of a soap opera and learn spanish? 

I wish I had a purpose. I wish I were afraid of something. I wish someone forced me into I don't know. I don't want anything. My life is destined to get worse from here. I miss confiding in my girlfriend. I wasnt there when she needed me and well. It wasnt a happy relationship anyway so... For the better still I guess. My childhood was great and I'll have to actually support myself sorta. I'll get a job I'm not passionate about so I can binge watch anime on the weekends till I die and game over. Black screen. Whats the point? 

Jordan Peterson mentioned finding a perception of time that works. That keeping your perspective limited to the next couple days might be better. 

Maybe it would be fun to get into a fight. I've never really done that. I enjoyd the kickboxing class I took that one time. What is there? What am I doing? Why can't I just shutup about it? Why do I have to vomit my sour thoughts onto the internet? 

I used to think I wanted to learn to figure out how to socially engineer humanity to prevent climate change. I barely have the patients to do my math homework.   
I think if no one had expectations of me, I'd bake desserts in the kitchen all day. That's not quite true. I have phases, hobbies, things to procrastinate with. Language learning, guitar, drawing, reading (if I can concentrate). It's all just vanity. No matter what I bake or draw or what language I could speak or what guitar song I learn I'll feel the same. 

Sometimes I get chills of excitement if I play guitar in a pretty way or when there's an excellent plot twist in any anime or I don't know occassionally when I'd write essays in highschool. 

I don't think there's a place for me. I don't think people want my whining privileged apathetic ass. I've lost all my friends just by not keeping up with them or ignoring their messages. I rarely plan social events because i'm scared. i can only stan to be around friends if I think I'm better than them in some way. 

How did I get so fucked up? It's overwhelming. I don't think I'm at risk of killing myself but somehow that makes me feel worse. And I know no one will take me seriously. I guess I'm supposed to be my own parent and help myself out of this situation. How? One step at a time? Will it be worth it? Why do all the anime characters have so much drive? Where do they get the energy? 

I'm supposed to rewrite my story so I don't feel so sorry for myself, without lying. I'm not so creative. And I don't trust myself at all because I always find out the right thing to do and never follow through. 

Maybe someone on reddit can save me lol from my thoughts. Maybe I should just spend my life meditating and not thinking about anything to enjoy the moment whatever that means.  Give me a job that I can throw my entire being into that doesn't get boring and that I'm remotely capable of.",2022-07-17 14:42:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648574241,3,/r/lonely/comments/w18ybs/another_aimless_rant_into_the_void/,,0,1,another aimless rant into the void.

3197,w1anyq,Inidae,"About 4-6 months ago I decided to change my life around to get out of my depressive state. Not only that but work on some healthier coping skills. I started journaling again. I have a book journal and I have an online one. If something happens that makes me angry/sad/upset in public ill use the online journal. I use to vent my issues to any people who were just nice to me and that created problems in the group chat so I stopped. 

Along with journaling, I would have a more proactive mindset instead of being negative. Being positive, happy, and a funny person with no self-deprecating jokes. I have lots of flaws and a shitty personality. I wanted people to know me in good light so I can get more connections and hopefully, this would in turn make me a naturally positive person. Others have told me that people are attracted to positivity. The one thing that couldn't go away was my trust issues so I hid them behind an “if I get to know you More I'll tell more about myself”. It would be my first step in creating a boundary- or an illusion of one. There were ups and downs like struggling to jump into conversations without being rude or desperate but I kept on going because this was training my perseverance as I'm known to give up at a slight issue seen. I even went back to the rp scene to get comfortable talking and writing with people again with a new mindset. 

But it went downhill from there. I joined a lit rp server.

I found myself journaling every day or even on the same day because what someone did or said to me pissed me off. I found myself angry all the time because I became the butt of the joke. But I didn't want to ruin the dynamics because I didn't want to cause drama and it was a rule in the server that if there's drama you'll be kicked with no warning cause the owner has little to no patience. At the time I didn't have anyone else to trust with these thoughts so I kept journaling and treat a day like a new one. I've known to hold grudges so I try not to take things personally. Any topic I brought up about my interests, someone (most likely the owner) would talk about the bad side of it and it made me uncomfortable and I told them to stop. Another person would have a “know it” personality and would dominate the calls and chats on a topic I brought up. 

Not only that but whenever I stayed up, they would tell me to go to sleep when they stayed up at the same time. It was infantilizing and they have been doing it since I joined. I told them to stop and that they were treating me like a child. Then the owner comes in and tells me my comment was uncalled for and I should communicate like a adult when I just did. Then I got a strike. I would take the time to cool down and when it was appropriate to talk about the situation. A few days later I get put into a “timeout” corner because I didn’t tell the owner about my issues in two weeks and they had low patience. So I was forced to tell everything  there even when I wasn’t ready to talk about the situation. According to her people have been having issues with me since June that I wasn’t aware of and knew until now. They claim to have defended me in the background. So it took them a month to tell me people had issues with me (that I know nothing of or the reason why) but they expected me to tell them everything in a timed manner despite me having high intense emotions. So, I said fuck it and left. Currently, I'm falling back to the same things I did before because this experience left me more broken than I ever was.

“Now you can say, oh but that's your side of the story and we don't know theirs” if you did that would be doxing and I'm framing this story unbiased to the best of my ability. 

I don't expect any sympathy~empathy from this post and you're free to say I'm lying to get attention but I've been trying to change my life around. I didn't want to be lonely, depressed, or negative anymore. I didn't want to rely on video games or sleep throughout the day to cope with problems. I'm an HSP with autism and it's torturous to go through with little to no support system. I was friendly, I allowed people to run over me if it meant I could socialize, improve myself, build connections, and my resistance. I always struggled with who to trust because that's when you are your most vulnerable. Maybe everything I did was “masking”, being fake, and calling that progress. I wanted to change and now I'm just hurt.",2022-07-17 16:01:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607770198,5,/r/lonely/comments/w1anyq/tried_to_change_my_life_and_it_only_went_downhill/,,0,9,Tried to change my life and it only went downhill (long post)

So yeah, I made a new account and pretend to be a female. I really hate people who catfish because its kinda evil but I tried to be as nice as possible. I made on this account a post on r/meetpeople as a guy of course and I got 0 DM's. Now I made a post on the alt account as a girl and I got 100+ DM's. I've been DMing the whole day for hours now and its just depressing. So many horny fucking people its unbeliebavle. Now I understand why Girls hate being a girl on Reddit because damnn. I understand also why a girl isn't intrested in boys anymore. We are all the same, we are no diffrent nor special. We are fucking sex craving animals or somethings. So I did pretend to be a 19 year old girl and I got fucking 35 year old motherfuckers messaging me. Like wtf would people think if they knew? ''Hey mom and dad I got a girlfriend and she's 19''. Their parents must be so fucking proud. What did they wrong in life to be like that? Never got laid at age 19?  


Its really depressing, Reddit is the worst platform to be on as a female. So many horny fucking man. I got so exhausted talking to every guy. Even showing a bit of intrest makes them horny and they believe anything. They even send pictures of them selves without asking. Wtf is wrong with the world? really wtf man, they should delete reddit. I thought men being horny was okay and woman had it actually easy but now I got a whole new perpective on men. I hate being a man holy shit. And the girl has to choose who they like. You have to choose between the hundreds of men who are mostly boring. They are all the same, same messages. ''How are you?'' what you being up to?''.

3218,w1fe2b,No-Worldliness-6682,"Hello people of Reddit. 
To cut the chase ,what I'm waiting for is to be happy by myself and with the way my life is in general , I'm afraid I'm slowly becoming someone I don't want to be with the way things are right now , my dream of becoming reliable and independent is closer than ever but I've become a selfish person with no clear goals who'd rather spend her day at home doing nothing , all of this waiting and praying for something to change my situation made me bitter and resentful, I feel like the world failed me and I didn't have to suffer the way I did but most importantly I didn't have to be the reason why other people had to suffer so much too (good people who did nothing but suffer throughout their whole lives)
Now whatever it is that I was chasing I don't think it's going to be enough for them, I think it's just damage control at this point, I don't think I'll ever make up for the fact that I exist on this earth I don't think anything I will ever do will be enough as a pay back and I hate myself for it. My life isn't enjoyable either I didn't even get to have fun out of this shitty deal , I'm just constantly miserable except when I don't think about it, I don't know what to do with all of this bitterness and resentment that I have in me I'm only 23 years old and I feel like I've wasted so many time I've hurt so many people and did many things that I can't fix back to normal , I feel like a bystander, never showing an ounce of character, never actually saying what's on my mind , never caring enough to try and change the things I hate about myself mostly and the world as a whole, I just see things that I don't like and feel pain endlessly and for what?

3242,w1jtkv,Thutex,"not really sure what to type, tbh... just need 'something'.
the days of talking to someone back on icq or msn messenger when we were teens is long gone and right now i have nobody to turn to anymore.

i have some 'friends' in real life, but not the kind of friends that actually care to hear about or help with my being lonely.

i'm not depressed - i dont think i can really get depressed as such because i objectively check my feelings - but i am over 35 and have been lonely all my life.
i have been wanting kids for over 20 years (yeah, when other kids were learning what a d*ck could do i was fantasizing about the whole house, yard, kids, dog thing)

i look like crap, i feel like crap, and i don't really see myself ever being happy for more than a few minutes a day, max...

only thing that makes me happy is seeing and talking with kids about whatever makes them happy, because it just feels so innocent and simple - you can hear they don't really have any of the scars or worries adults have.
they are less back-stabbing, more honest and open, and when a kid asks you what the matter is, they don't automatically assume you will say you're doing fine.... because they haven't learned yet that ""that is what a normal person does""

but... ofcourse, as a single, adult male... liking kids is ""not normal"" either, so :(

i honestly don't know if i want to die or not.
part of me is scared of death (either it is worse, or there is just nothing), but another part of me is wondering if it really is worth the effort to just go on like this another x years until i die.

3266,w1m4wk,AndreiTD," I don't want to kill myself or even attempt it because the idea of eternal nothingness is too scary and not a solution in my book, but there's no reason for me to live either. Everything I do seems to be only to survive: have a job, eat, sleep. I'm a very lonely person, living by myself with no nearby friends, no pet and just recently started a relationship that just threw me more into this dark place.

Can't say I've got much love when I was a kid and definitely didn't get much or any until now either so I know my problem and what I desire the most: feeling genuinely loved by other people. I just want to feel appreciated and loved for who I am, not what I own or my skills. I'm at most needed. I wonder if I would cease to exist tomorrow if people would really care.

Yes, I've read everywhere you should be happy by yourself, only give and not expect anything in return. Theory sounds amazing but I can't be like that. I can give a lot of love and care but there's a limit, I'm not some infinite spring of happiness. That was just how all my relationships have been so far. I did my best to offer my attention, to be affectionate, but I got nothing in return. I was the one initiating everything: hugging, kissing, anything. If I did nothing, I would probably be a bad partner and get dumped immediately. I really envy those guys who have amazing girlfriends who care about them. This time with the new gf seems to be no different. It's true we are into this for only 3 days but she seems to be the same. If I don't text her, she never does, if I don't hug or kiss her, she never initiates herself. I'm just tired of being the only one actively trying.

I've tried so many times to not care about friendships and relationships, burned my mind into series, books, video games, the job and to what end?

3271,w1mjo1,Cool_Dark_5471,I am a 20 year old Indian woman. My parents have always been strict so when I moved out to go to college 4 hours from home I got my first taste of freedom. I met this boy and we started dating. When things started to get serious I told my parents about him. They were extremely mad because he’s white and didn’t think I was ready to date and told me to break up with him or they would pull me out of school. I didn’t listen to them and continued to date him without them knowing because he was a very nice guy. We began to be intimate and I missed my period. I freaked out and went to the doctor to get blood work and an ultrasound but I was not pregnant. They sent the bill to my home address and my parents found it and I had to come clean. I was naive to think that I was going to marry him but he ended up leaving me after that. My parents called me a whore and said that no Indian man will ever marry me now that I have been used. They seem more concerned about how if this gets out it will ruin our family name. I feel like a disappointment. I am the oldest daughter and they keep telling me that I have ruined my younger siblings lives as well.

I feel like I trapped myself and now there's no hope of ever repairing the gap I created between us. No one to lean on, make jokes with or talk about things that no one but the two of us would care about. I thought I could fix things but now she's going away and she won't even have a reason to think of me anymore. Like I was never there at all.

The saddest part is I've always been afraid of growing apart, even when we saw eachother every week I would cry wondering if she saw me as an obligation. If she spent time with me because she wanted to or because its what she had always done. One day she left while spending the night at my house to go a mural friend's birthday party at an amusement park. She needed money on a gift card to go, so I gave her mine even though I wanted her to stay more then anything.

I know this isn't how she acts, she's never been the type to do something just because it's what's expected of her, but a nagging whisper in my head keeps telling me she only answers my texts to spare my feelings. Because she feels bad for me acting like a lost puppy dog that doesn't know its not wanted anymore.

I wish I could take all these horrible feelings of mine and beat them with a hammer until they leave me alone.

And then. And then... Slowing down. Shorter responses. Less interest. Broken promises. Life happens.

3314,w1pn7z,Theia13,"Pretty much what the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse by the day, and I just don't know how to fix it anymore. For most of my life I always had the unhealthy belief that I was just meant to be alone. So, I just accepted going day in and day out not talking to anyone. Occasionally I would try to talk to someone or make a friend. Always we'd just stop talking. And eventually I figured I'm the common denominator, so it has to be something about me.   
I know the whole ""you only fail if you give up"" but I isolated myself. Which I knew wouldn't make me feel better. But feeling better wasn't the point. I truly believe it would be better if I'm around as few people as possible. I just feel I've become insufferable. It's almost funny, younger me I feel like didn't have a personality. And as soon as I try to figure out my own personality of course it's insufferable. And now the last few days I'm stuck in a loop of maybe I should try to make friends again. Maybe join a site or app or something. But then it's right back to it would be better if no one has to deal with me.   
I tried posting a bit in a fandom and I already wish I'd just kept my mouth shut because I hate everything that comes out of my mouth ever. The feeling is even there about family. My dad reached out for the first time in a long time. And even though I'm \*so\* desperate to feel like someone cares about me.. A part of me doesn't want to see him.

3326,w1qsc1,vent1667,"cause i feel like no matter what i do, its always gonna be the same, same stuff everyday, same feeling of crippling loneliness, same fear for the future, same anger because of the past

everytime i tried to change it or make it better, it never worked, i ended up in the same place over and over again, and you know what? im tired of it all

i planned and tried everything for years, and i still couldnt do it, im still here, im still alone, still, nobody even cares a little bit about me, and no matter how much i try to change it, its always the same over and over

out of everything that's happened, at least i thought by now i wouldnt have to go through everything alone...i thought i would've finally found that person that'd make me feel alice again, happy, someone that made me understand that maybe life isnt so bad, and that maybe there is a good future ahead of me, a future where someone finally understands me and just, loves me for who i am

you know? i think i needed someone like that the most when i was in school...not being alone in there would've just fixed almost everything

i always wanted a high school sweetheart, i'd see my classmates have their own love stories and i'd just, hope that mine would come soon too...instead i just lost two of my best friends and felt horrible all year

i just want someone to love me

i've always wanted someone who'd hold me and made me feel safe

3330,w1rdtb,ohcowboyy,"So I (NB17) had been dating a girl (F17) for about 2 months, from early April until early June. We had been best friends for over three years. I will call her L because that is her first initial. She texted me apologizing if she had been a bit short with me lately and said that she feels like her mental health isn’t in a good spot and she wanted a break from dating so that she didn’t hurt me. Sounds fine right? Well, it turns out this would be a load of bullshit. Anyway I get upset and whatnot because I am an emotional wreck and don’t like containing emotions and got mad, which I will say was inappropriate for the way I reacted.

So a couple days later I apologize and L says it’s cool, and we don’t talk for a few days, but before then we were having a conversation and she just straight up left in the middle of it when I was talking about something important regarding her, and I texted her days later asking why it felt like she was ignoring me. I told her she had been active on discord and was even posting memes in the same channel I was talking in the previous day and ignored me. L gets mad at me telling me that it’s a shitty reason to get mad at her for not acknowledging my existence in a discord server when she doesn’t even want to talk to people. Would be an okay argument but she had literally been talking to people on discord, lmao.

So I decide to take a break from social media for a couple weeks to try and clear my mind, and when I came back I told L I wanted to have a serious conversation about us, and we planned it to be a few days from then. Well I pussied out, scared that she would react negatively towards me, so I told her I was scared and backed out and L said she didn’t mind since she didn’t even want to talk in the first place.

In the days leading up to that, I had noticed that she constantly updated her status to be something somewhat targeted towards me, with one of them being “the freedoms of being single are both relieving and suffocating”, as well as a few others. Well, I’m venting to my friend about the entire situation and her dumb ass decided to take screenshots of our conversation and send them to her, which obviously caused issues because I said stuff that I didn’t want L knowing yet. L simply just texts me with “the statues weren’t about you they were about my mom” which I immediately knew was somewhat bullshit but whatever, go ahead and lie. Friend adds both of us to a chat and we both leave as she keeps spam adding us saying to fix it ourselves since she’s tired of being a messenger so I block her since literally none of us asked her to do any of this and she’s acting like we’re treating her like shit.

So the next morning I tell L that I want to actually save our bond since it’s clear that she’s not even trying to, and she says “well I don’t see why we would need to save our bond since I’m not even mad at you at all and still see you as a friend”. So I told her that I felt neglected since she’s my best friend and she wasn’t talking to me, and since I have attachment issues I felt like she was distancing herself from me to leave me. I asked if she’s doing okay, and she said yes. Awesome! Well, not for me, I’ll get to that in a minute. I also asked if she’s wanting to stay single because I wanted to know if I should just move on, and she said yes. What she said next set me off so hard:

“Also, I’m distancing myself from in person friends for the summer because I’ve seen them on loop every day for months on end and got bored of them and I wanted to catch up with my online friends.”

Excuse me? You’ve still spoke to your online friends, I was with you pretty much the entire school year and I remember you texting them. Also, BORED?! What so you are shutting out all of your friends, even your BEST FRIEND that you had plans to do things with over the summer, because you are BORED OF SEEING THEM?! So I went off on her, calling her out on all her bullshit and asking for a further elaboration since k felt like I was missing something, and L says:

“My adhd will make me stop talking to them all together if I’m bored. Also, I don’t need a reason because I’m my own person and can do what I want. I still see you as a friend, I don’t need to talk to friends often to still see them as friends. I don’t know why you can’t understand that and have to go around telling everyone that! Don’t tell me I need a good explanation for this like you fucking own me.”

Lol first of all, don’t use adhd as an excuse, I know people with adhd who don’t act like this. You know I have attachment problems so obviously I won’t see someone as a friend if I’m ignored. Also, am I not allowed to fucking vent to my friends about how I may lose my bestie? Sorry that I called out on your bullshit logic! IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY, but that would’ve caused more issues.

So I apologized, even though I meant none of it, because I wasn’t ready to lose my best friend over me calling L out on her bullshit. Well, she ghosted me, and she hasn’t said anything to me since. I woke up this morning and looked at her bio, and the hoe added “taken” to it. Later found out that it was the same boy she was dating online in the months leading up to us.

Yeah.

I immediately blocked her on everything. You don’t tell someone you wanna be single because of mental health and need a break, when you are actually fine and just want to avoid all your in person friends and give up a partner who did everything they could to make you loved in the worst way possible. At least if you just straight up broke up with me and we’re honest I’d just be heartbroken and I wouldn’t feel like a fucking toy.

My only other in person friends aren’t in my every day life anymore as well, with one of them moving states and the other one graduating and moving cities. I don’t know what to do, I’m starting to enter a darker state of mind with each passing day. I don’t know how I’m going to find a new best friend easily once school starts and I don’t know how my future with L will go, considering that I don’t even think I can look at her the same until she gives me a reasonable explanation. I don’t even really want to date her anymore, I just want a bestie again!

TLDR: Ex and former bestie ditched all her in person friends and said she wanted to just be single because “her adhd made her bored” and disguised it as needing a mental health break, I called her out since that’s a pos way of thinking and she painted me like the bad guy. Now she’s taken by her previous online bf despite insisting how she wants to be single.",2022-07-18 05:28:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1566789874,2,/r/lonely/comments/w1rdtb/delete_if_not_allowed_ex_said_she_needed_a_mental/,,0,0,"(Delete if not allowed) Ex said she “needed a mental health break” and wanted to be single, a month later she’s fine and just didn’t want to talk to in person friends and now she’s back with her online bf she had before me"

Now it's the same thing again. I had found so much joy in those daily conversations where we shared ideas with each other. Now, I have to go back to journal everything. To talk to myself. To read expecting to hear something relatable from authors who died a long time ago. To watch movies just to feel something. 

It makes me even more sad that until I stop having feelings for them, I have also lost them as a friend. And I'm not good at making friends based on my interests. I had 2 and now 1.

Currently I’m having vacation. I have previously had part-time jobs in my related field, but this is the first summer I have nothing. My partner just went back to work after their vacation, and was offered to go on a trip to a sister location in a different country sometime next week. 

For context, I started my degree during covid. Everything has been online, and so I haven’t made really any friends from my degree. My partner is really happy in their new job, and gets along with their colleagues super well… and that makes me feel like a failure, and like I’m being left behind. 

I have so much anxiety about my partner potentially leaving to go to that sister location, because I’d be on my own for the duration, with nobody to go to or hang out with in the meantime. It’s not necessarily a problem of not being around my partner, but it’s a problem of not having anyone to talk to or go see, if I wanted to or needed to. I have over a month left of lonely, nothing-to-do vacation, before I go to finish my degree, and I feel like my partner is acing their life, getting to do fun stuff, while I’m stuck at home with nothing to do and no people to see.

I could be doing useful stuff. I could be putting more effort into learning a new language, I could be writing my novel, drawing my comic, I could be doing research, I could be working out everyday so that I'll be more ready for when the agonistic season starts in September, I could be playing my instrument more.

But I'm doing nothing. Cause it doesn't matter, nothing matters, what's the point. So I just stay at home all day long, alone, cause I don't have friends to hang out with anyways. The only people I consider friends that I could hang out with are 3 16 year olds from my gym, but as much as I love them, we're not same-level friends. We have different age related interests, it'd be sadder to hang out with them than it'd be to stay home alone so that's what I do. I'm so tired.

Well my cousin (F17)(that's my best friend) and 2 other (F17) friends called me and asked me what happened. I told them and said that I was very stressed. Their response saying I'm an idiot cus I quit and that I should've expected those living conditions they kept saying we are your friends and we're looking out for you whist I was telling them I was very poorly treated. They kept on telling me how they knew this was gonna happen and I should've known too. I mentioned how they don't to anything so how would they know (all 3 of them are spoiled rotten) and they said that people told them. I ended the conversation by saying ""enjoy your vacation and please don't contact me"". Since then we haven't talked and I've been at peace. Now let me tell you what I was to these girls, whatever problem they had they would call me up , if they needed to vent I would listen and I didn't get that treatment and I was fine with that. I just now realise that I was carrying 4 people worth of problems and they were just using me as a problem dump. I would love to hear your thoughts,were they in the right or was I ?

I've been feeling lonely and ""stumbled"" upon this subreddit. I feel like the very first step for anyone lurking here, is to introduce yourself to r/lonely.

Maybe another lurker can be just what you needed in a friend, and sometimes it's not, but that's okay, life is full of ""quests"".  Doesn't mean we should all have ""main player syndrome"" but it does mean we have to try introducing ourselves to new people, be considerate of others feelings, and not to overwhelm others when they haven't shown interest.

1. Intention: It's when one don't want to chat with anyone. One feel depressed or demotivated when one see someone better than self. Or one have some inborn attitude from childhood that one find hard to get rid of. Or even if one have any abnormality like being weak, he/she doesn't want other people to see him/her.
2. Compulsion: If someone is orphan, if he/she was left alone by his family, due to his own mental or physical capabilities, he is compelled to live alone, or he/she is aged. Or He/she can't find anyone whom to share feelings with.

In whatever the category you are, each one has a different solution and yes there is a solution, one shouldn't leave hope anyday.",2022-07-18 15:35:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654784679,6,/r/lonely/comments/w22bp7/loneliness_intention_or_compulsion/,,0,2,Loneliness: Intention or Compulsion

3449,w29ert,leozaur1808,"You would probably consider this problem unimportant, and yeah, that is exactly what I am trying to take this problem as, but I haven’t got rid of this yet. Probably you have any methods that would make me forget about this problem completely or escape it. This is exactly what I am asking for, because solving the problem seems impossible.

This story must be started from a bit far away, when I was 14 years old. It was when I started noticing indifferent attitude towards be from the opposite sex. Maybe, you think, I shouldn’t have been concerned about it back then, and I would definitely agree with you. However it had proceeded when I was 16. That was when it started to kick me really hard, I hadn’t had any female friends whatsoever and got various examples of this kind of indifferent attitude to me. For instance, the most common situation was: the girl gives a hug to everyone except for me, she doesn’t talk to me at all and so on. It was kicking me hard, so I tried to evade this situations, and I was pretty successful in it, I have found people who seemed to experience the same problem, and I nearly forgot about this. I even had got a first female friend and after some time we started dating. I think you have already predicted what had happened after. The girl said that she likes another guy, and many of those described earlier started to have female friends, so I couldn’t evade this problem with them anymore.

Bearing this in mind, I have develope a strange attitude to life, which was completely dreaming only about the future. It is described with cite “to be something”, so I had been hoping to get rich and was working towards it. I hadn’t had any other dreams except this. And that had been helping me all over my life since I first developed it in my brain. But, unfortunately, it is completely unimaginable without the bright future itself. If you read the news, then you probably understand what happened after. My country invaded the neighbour and so has been imposed to unprecedented economic sanctions and the future now seems to be the worst thing you can think of.

3450,w29gem,Mymelodykoala,"Friends, lovers, whatever it may be. 
I've always been the type to desperately desire to be around others, I don't do well on my own. I have awful anxiety and, if I'm going to be honest, depression. I used to be the kind of person that was a chameleon and would do or say whatever it took to fit in with others so I wouldn't be alone. 
I've done some growing up, maybe from realizing that being around the wrong people makes me feel more alone, but perhaps it's because I seek more meaningful relationships. I'm married, and if you do your sleuthing, you'll realize that's not exactly where I want it either. I've been the kind of person in the past to put the blame entirely on him and that's not fair. We both have our faults and have slowly began to resolve them. 
Anyway, I realize, I am more alone than I would like lately and am seeking a friend. Maybe one who lives close, I am in DFW, Texas. I am also open to others that are further away. 

Here's some more about me. I'm 33, female and live in DFW. I have been married for 12 years and have a daughter in elementary school. Have a house and pets and whatnot too. 

I love to cook, craft, watch movies, play games, and a bunch of stuff like that. I have tattoos and long hair. 

My favorite music is Elliott Smith, Bright Eyes/Conor Oberst, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Belle and Sebastian, basically stuff like that. I also love jazz, mid 2000's emo, and a lot of random other stuff.

My favorites movies are Punch-Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, Magnolia, A Clockwork Orange, Goodwill Hunting, Mad Max, Aliens, Trading Places, American Psycho... you probably get the gist of it...

Books can probably be broken down by author, my favorite author is JG Ballard, although my favorite book is probably Infinite Jest. I also love reading Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, William S Burroughs. Thomas Pynchon, etc...
I used to be really into comics and have a large collection. 150+ long boxes of them. The current state of super heros and comics in pop culture really put a bitter taste in my mouth about them and caused some disdain. Everything has to have an agenda these days it seems and with the MCU being so popular it started bleeding over into most comics.

Television shows I enjoy quite a bit are The X-Files, Twin Peaks, Fringe, The Wire, Community, BSG, Forensic Files, IT Crowd, Peaky Blinders, Lost... There's a lot more. My brain no workey right now. :)

Message me if you wanna chat. I am open to chat with anyone. &lt;3",2022-07-18 20:33:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1489249178,2,/r/lonely/comments/w29gem/im_not_so_great_at_maintaining_relationships/,,0,2,I'm not so great at maintaining relationships...

I live in a small town where there is never anything to do, my only friend I have here will be moving to the city for college in a month, and I don’t drive so I can’t go anywhere myself. I am terrified for the winter to come because I am scared my loneliness and suicidal thoughts might get the best of me. I have tried to distract myself with my hobbies but that hasn’t worked. I’ve tried to find a boyfriend but dating is extremely hard in this area. I’m not that close with my family and I’m not even allowed to have a cat in my apartment. I am completely alone. 

I genuinely don’t know if I will be able to survive this winter if I don’t manage to find a companion to help me through the worst of it.

Was a completely virtual thing but the human mind cannot understand difference between real and imaginary, so talking in psychological therms even virtual was real, so…

We never real met up by my fault but, all the time we passed together was like the love of our most beautiful dreams - and for her too because all things she told me during our entire time together.

I have my failures and she’s her failures, but use to understand each other, accept and never real break-up or fight - and even when we fight, we used to come back mutually better.

When I was with her company (even virtual), I really felt me someone, I felt me loved, important, stronger.

All I wanted is to show her that she’s didn’t choose a looser, but I didn’t.

I never dream about really live a love but if it could happening so the person have to be exactly what I want and she was this person, exactly what one day I dreamed about.

I’m dream about her a lot of times and I always feel good when it’s happen, but I remember that I’m alone now and don’t wanna me anymore. I mean, I’m no one to her - only girl who I had something real, intense and truly by a time, so why someone more will consider me something?

I could Mary her but we can’t obligated someone to nothing and, people would consider me “toxic”, but they don’t understand what really is love someone, but if aí can’t get her so at least I hope someone like her or… better if exists.",2022-07-18 21:28:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/w2ari5/i_miss_my_ex/,,0,1,I miss my ex

3506,w2gslu,Prometheusatitangod,"I do everything in my power to sleep little as possible, I could give you the numbers, if you live to be really old you will have spent a quarter of your entire life basically in a willing state of unconscious . Talking 20 to 25 years of your life.  When you been lonely for as long as myself and you get to my age of 51 . It basically means that you're life is 75- 85% over . to waste a single minute is horrific. But spending it alone or striking out for the millionth time.  Isn't easy.  But my odds are still better than the toucherous dreams and nightmares that always await me in sleep 
I know people say you need 8 hours of sleep I am 51 I sleep 2-3 hours a night and 1.5 to zero at least 3 times a month.  Been doing this since I was 19 or 20 . My nightmares aren't your typical kind.  I actually feel things I shouldn't.  I once had a dream I was beaten to death infront of every one I know and they didn't do a single thing to help me.  I felt every single blow felt my bones break the blood pouring out this person caved in my skull.  I fist went blind then my sinus made a sound like air coming out of a slashed tire under water.  The ring in my ears when into a buzzing humm . I felt my exposed nerves like rusty hot nails screaming in pain. The weird part my teeth hurt the most.  More like where they used to be. With the final blow my head came apart like a jack-o-lantern in November.  I had an out of body experience saw the carnage my twitching body my head looked like a pealed crushed banana I even saw the steam raising from the neck hole.  As I floated around I saw my friends and people I knew just looking.  I remember thinking.  It was just one dude a really strong dude. But they had numbers on there's side why didn't they help me.  
The traumatic after effects from this dream scared me for life it was just a dream representation of my loneliness and it destroyed me as the people in my life do little to nothing.  When I know if the all tryed the could have saved me. 
Another one I was starving to deth and dehydrated . Close to death the I found every single person I knew sitting at a huge table filled with all kinds of food the where eating like pigs I ran over to eat I was stopped buy an invisible chain that just kept me from reaching the table. I could smell it . S yelled out to several people I knew they looked at me then turned away engnoring me . I say Mr best friend and I said please help I dying give me just a little bit.  My friend looked at me sadly and said I can't.  I'm not allowed.  I said not allowed why who said.  Friend said I don't know no one said it specially.  So you can please I dying I feel to the ground took my last breath smelling the very thing I needed to live seeing the people in my life totally able to get it to me yet refusing to without even having a reason.  I felt the hunger the weakness.  
Just two examples of how my dreams toucher me  this is why I fight sleep.  I rather be tired then feel pain like that every night",2022-07-19 02:04:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616270211,8,/r/lonely/comments/w2gslu/the_reason_i_hate_sleeping/,,0,7,The reason I hate sleeping

OK in the past I understand why some of my friendships have failed. I stopped reaching out. But this isn’t the case this time. 
 
I have been friends with this lady for about 18 months. 
For the past little while, it seems like she doesn’t want much to do with me. I can’t think of anything I’ve done wrong. Did she just get sick of me or something?  

Without going too much off-topic in addition to being friends we volunteer as admin’s in a group. A while ago the owner wanted to her to stop doing a post she makes every Wednesday. I volunteered to tell her as he had to run out. It was around that time that she started being distant towards me.

I really hope this is a coincidence, if she’s gonna stop talking to me over something so ridiculous, I guess she wasn’t as good as a friend as I thought she was. But in the long run it doesn’t even matter . A  failing friendship is  a  failing friendship no matter the reason. We also have a small group chat with us and another lady. She doesn’t talk in that either, but I know her and the other lady message each other. I am also friends with the other lady. But now I wonder how much longer I have her friendship.",2022-07-19 02:05:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1537827930,2,/r/lonely/comments/w2gtdz/another_friend_is_slowly_walking_away_for_me_youd/,,0,2,"Another friend is slowly walking away for me, you’d think I’d be used to it by now."

3542,w2lfsz,Outaboutand,"I can't find any social group where I belong in. I've never known what it's like to have a loving family or to be in a strong social group or to be close to anyone. To have a group or to have someone that I can trust and be myself and be comfortable with, who knows me and wants me to be around and cares about me.

I want so badly to be in those cartoon or family movies where a kid or teen has a loving family or a strong social group that's supporting him and making him feel like someone cares. 

It's so cold being an adult. I think about trying to make a friend or join social groups and I just can't believe it could ever develop into a welcoming social group or a friend who would care about me. What's the point... I talk to someone and they either have close friends from college or high school or I'm too weird or shy or awkward for them to want to keep talking to me.

It feels so depressing to think about. It's something I want so much but that I can't get. I want to have people to hang out with. I want to have a group or someone I can depend on for socialization and to make me feel like I belong somewhere and that someone cares. I can't concentrate on anything when this primitive need isn't met. I can't do my job and will probably get fired soon but I don't even care anymore because all I care about is finding social belonging.

I can't make any friends. I can't find anyone who cares. I can't find anywhere I belong. I'm all alone.",2022-07-19 06:10:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634447015,9,/r/lonely/comments/w2lfsz/no_human_connection/,,0,5,No human connection

3550,w2m8ij,CatsOfTheGraveyard,That's all there is to say. I'm 14 and summer break just makes me feel like shit because I see people I know on their Instagram and Snapchat stories posting about them hanging out with friends while I'm sitting in my bedroom scrolling social media because I have nothing better to do with my time. I just want someone who'll love me and cuddle me and make me feel like a person. Even during the school year when I've been in relationships they're always just because I fall in love with someone because they're mildly nice to me. Then they don't live close and we can barely hang out so I don't get the physical affection I so badly need. What do I even do anymore. I can't fucking take it. I'm faking a personality and happiness to my family and I haven't gotten a text from anyone since school ended. I'm just crying because of how much I miss hugs and cuddles and just feeling loved.

i’ve greeted past friends on their birthdays, but i guess they’ve forgotten mine… that’s okay. at least i didn’t forget theirs? idk. still. 

but i am glad to live another year, even when things haven’t been easy atm. i’m gonna try to enjoy this special day, dress up, put some mascara on and feel my very best :)

What i think is receiving msg from an stranger is somewhat risky and unfulfilling. As it have happened to me some of them will DM you saying you’re a loser or other who try to help at first are unable to give find time for later msgs. And the cycle continues. 

My suggestion is that we have audio support group kinda thing where others share there fears, anxiety, stress etc And we as a community should be able to relate that experience and provide solution. 
I guess this will help us filter out the bad crowd and it will genuinely help us work on out social anxiety.

For me I often... very often feel like the place i'm in is worth leaving behind, I don't have much tying me here, and all i have is old memories of youthful failures, I hate the area, its all so empty here, I own a small house which I don't care for and could sell, there are only 2 people that I consider close to me, My dad and brother so in essence I know I could take the plunge and be quite content but... its the feeling of being alone, I don't wanna just be alone all the time and if my adventure ends up in more loneliness I don't think I could take it, but if I don't get out of here I feel I will be here like this forever.

Where as If i took the chance for adventure, I fantasize that I might just meet ""Hopefully"" my future partner who is all about the adventure and escaping the loneliness also... lol it's a pipe dream I know, knowing my luck, i'd sell up and set out to find myself rouging it in a field alone mid winter lol...

But what do you do to escape, I need out of this place, not just get out and walk around and enjoy the outdoors, I need out of this area! but to do so is to throw myself into potentially worse isolation and loneliness, and while I can talk to people openly, I can be outgoing and seem happy, inside It's always a fight, I need companionship I know but true and honest companionship.. does that even exist anymore?, i'm sure it does but how do you find that when you're locked away?

The title suggests I feel romantically attracted to my friend, but that's not the case. He's in his 40s and I'm in my early 20s (I'm a woman). We have a very unlikely friendship but it's been working for a few years and we enjoy each other's company.

Now he's back into dating and lately, he's been seeing a woman and taking her out to do all the activities we used to do together. I do have other friends to do things with, but I don't connect with them the way I connect with him. 

I know I should be happy for him and all that stuff.

But at the same time, it bothers me to feel replaced, I liked what we had. I'm kind of jealous that he's feeling the ""new person"" excitement. I've been in long-term relationships before and I've been in love.

They would say your gf ! I asked who told you about this.  . It was always my parents.

I'm not attractive, I'm not good at conversation or particularly interesting, I'm sort of depressing to be around and I'm really overall awkward and shy, and I'll probably always be that way.

3615,w2y230,wishIcouldloseweight,"I'll begin this by explaining my situation, I was physically and emotionally abuses as well as gaslight for years of my life by both of my parents. I now suffer from suicidal thoughts and have a history with self harm. My mum left that house after I turned 18, I still lived with her and did not recognise her abuse as abuse as well as believing that she was my only way to escape. 

After we left she made it apparent that she was leaving because of mum saying that as well as telling me that me cutting him him off was ""destroying the family"". I've always been scapegoated for everything wrong with my house. My defence mechanism was rebellion and anger issues. 
When she left she went through a variety of mental health crisises and I had to support her through them like her Councillor. 
Recently I've been uncovering what she did to me, I have no support, my family is pressuring me to play pretend and my grandmother is actively communicating with this abuser to get them back together again. Now because I cannot forgive my mother she is planning to go back. I've been trying to protect her, doing anything I could to stop her, she has been told by mental health professionals not to go back. 
I can't play councillor anymore, I'm dying, I feel like I am just barely alive, I've escaped that house but everyone is trying to drag me back. I keep researching narcissism to see if I'm just responsible, for everything. I feel so betrayed by her, she kept telling me she was on my side, that she believed it was abuse now she is victim blaming me again. 
He has a history of violence, he was arrested for assaulting a police officer when they came to question him about his abuse, I was manipulated to take back the charges because I expressed to my mother that I thought I ruined his life when he returned I was made to apologise to him, I was 16. I was treated like a monster, like the worst human to live, could I be a narcissist? Is my anger and my reaction to her actions over the top?

3616,w2y3i3,duskywired,"I live in a South America country, in a city with \~ 180k population but I just don't have anyone I'd want to be/hang around with. There's a friend of mine who lives in the same building and who I've known since childhood but I don't really like to talk to him because he's homophobic and sexist and has a religious and capitalist view of the world.

As a matter of fact, most people here is either sexist, homophobic, transphobic or racist or all of them, since it's a relatively small town in a predominantly christian country. There might be other kinds of people who are as diverse and as respectful as I would like but how to find them? Most people seem only interested in showing themselves off in social media and everyone's already got their group.

Considering I enjoy being around other people, laughing with them, having a good time, that is, I'm a social being just as much as anyone else, and that I need to take care of myself first, finding a group and interacting with others is part of that process. But I don't know where to start, what to do.

Anyway, I feel I have to prioritize myself above all right now. I'm still struggling dealing with my own thoughts, feelings and my identity, since I was deeply psychologically abused/censored just about my entire life.

I just can't stand people who don't respect others for being/expressing who they are.

And well, I'm in my late 20s which makes it all even more difficult as almost everyone that age (at least here) is having kids and you know, following the scripted life they've been programmed to. And even if I looked for younger people to be around with, I would just come out as a creepy dude (due to my clumsy ways and the way I look and talk) and thus would be rejected.

There's also this: online interaction is not what I'm looking for. I've been trying to use internet sparingly because I've had online addictions my whole life (in fact that's one of my main issues).

3639,w3177d,Happy-Investigator-,"Title pretty much says it all. I been friendless for 6 years with the exception of an awesome husband , but still. I’m not really socially awkward or even introverted though I can be terse if I feel too disconnected. Anyways, without a life, I noticed people I do meet seem to find me all the more peculiar. Sometimes it’s with intrigue but like I’m a total enigma, like I don’t make sense somehow or it’s obvious I have “no life” . There are basic small talk questions I can no longer answer without them seeming complicated : 

“What do you do on the weekends?”
“What do you do for fun?”
“Have you been to xyz club?” 
“Can I get your IG?”
Even a fucking “what do you do for a living?” gives me an existential dread because I feel so disconnected from the life I’ve lived. 

Sometimes I feel like the only solution is to continue meeting fellow aneurotypical “weirdos” like myself as we might be able to understand each other’s alienation because at this point, being around people who have active lives , regardless of how generic and superficial they might be, has become too strange for me to talk to . 

I hope it gets better y’all but damn this loneliness feels like an abyss. Can’t make friends with guys because most just either explicitly or secretly want to fuck ; can’t make friends with females because they all have their lives established and aren’t desperate for friends like I am.

3659,w3488x,TheAverageSpaceTroll,"Hey everyone just joined this subreddit, and since I can't sleep I might put my thoughts in writing on here

Little background, I am 22 year old neurodivergent guy with my baggage never really had a relationship and the one I had I was emotionally abused and sexually assoulted. This was 4 years ago ish, and now 4 years later I have tried getting back in the game

Now to me trying to get back into dating, I know some are gonna suggest therapy and shift but not really an option due to some reasons I won't disclose. But I also know I need it in some ways, but I have managed until this point so I think I will be fine as I worked through the most of it. Trying to get back in the game is hard wherever I go I never seem to find anything, and the times I try to open up cause I feel like it's time to start building something deeper due to them feeling right they leave. And yes it might seem like a pattern when they leave as I open up, but I am have never really gotten to a point of very deep. It's more like I have just started scratching the surface an nothing more, but yes there is a possibility that it is me and not them but I worked through most of my encounters and I feel like I haven't done anything that should warrant them leaving. 

Either way it feels like no one my age is ready for for an emotional connection and everytime they leave when I try to open up they leave. And it hurts and gives me this massive hole of loneliness and every time it gets harder to open the massive steel gates to my heart as after every encounter end with me picking up the pieces of my heart. Like what happend to romantics what happend to people wanting something real, what happend with people wanting to get to know the other person without having to jump to bed first. I view the issue of jumping to bed right away as a reason alot of relationships end quite fast as they let their brain do most of the work with hormones until it works it doesn't work anymore. And the then relationship either lives or dies with that, and yes I could probably do this but it leaves me open to world of hurt as it could go both ways. 

Well either way sorry for my rant, just needed to get some shit off my brain. Hopefully one day all of the people in here will find that someone that makes them not feel as lonely anymore.

Talking to people, even with mutual interests, has become difficult. Even if I can manage to get passed my depression, and not be a bummer.

Some, are just plain boring conversationalist, lacking professional attitude and passion. No sense of humor, no outgoingness, leaving the whole conversation up to me.

Some are unrelatable, have a bad understanding of mental health, not very empathetic, and expect way too much of me in the conversation. They are extremely active in their hobbies and interests, they cannot believe how uneventful my life is.. They cannot believe that I have nobody to talk to. They don't believe my depression is in the way.

3671,w35tmn,TedShock123,"Sup

So I met this group last year, we talk a bunch usually everyday but honestly never really had any issues with them.

I had a misunderstanding with one guy about feb who treated me like shit saying I'm making a fuss over nothing, so when this happened again we had another fight so after that I just gave him space, I didnt want more shit so I left him to do what he wanted. The fight was over a stupid situation as twice I had a strong feeling I wasn't wanted as I joined a vc call between a couple of friends and they didn't say a word to me, even when I directly spoke to them which again they said I'm making shit up.

I spoke to one or two mutual friends after the second fight for advice, I was never really told that I'm in the wrong for anything so again I left it. We often play on a Minecraft server together and one day I find someone took one of my Shulker chests I was using to build a tunnel, but writing F U with my materials in a separate empty normal chest next to it, I spoke about it to a friend and said idk what to take from this but its super petty, I had my suspicions on the guy i argued with as out of the two who are on the server the most he seemed the most likely. Eventually I decided to leave the group, not maliciously but I told one friend I just wanted space to think on shit etc as I don't want shit to get more out of hand.

I came back after realising sure maybe I took the situation wrong, but I was told that now everyone didn't feel comfortable having me back or talking yet as I wanted to talk to everyone apologise etc. About a week goes by of nothing when I get dropped a message from the main Admin of the group; telling me here's my options and then just saying apologise to who you feel inclined to, so not really giving me a option anyway.

Messaged everyone involved with an apology, just saying I misread the situation etc as sure I can admit when I'm wrong. Its now been about two weeks since, I haven't recieved any message back aside from one saying that the guy I fell out with was upset I was talking about him negatively to friends behind his back which I didnt try to, again even with the FU chest I was told perhaps it was a joke between others when pretty much everyone knew I was the one working on this tunnel.

i don’t really mind that too much but it’s the making friends in person that is weird. i don’t ever go anywhere one would find friends at. bars and stuff aren’t my thing anymore since i sobered up, and sobering up has also stopped me from using alcohol to get past my shyness. i’m now just a raw unfiltered version of myself that’s still scared of exposure except i’m looking for real people instead of just company. i’m rambling at this point but i guess i tend to get into my own head a lot during the summer, and i’ve been spending an awful amount of time alone. i really should be sharpening up some hobbies and skills with this spare time. but getting to know people seems more fun. my biggest problem has just been maintaining relationships, god knows i’m awful with housekeeping.

3691,w37t16,PersiaStillStands,"I’m a 38 year old male, and I’ve been single for about 7 years now. I’ve had a few dates here and there but they weren’t really relationship material. I’ve noticed it’s getting even harder to find someone these days, I’ve tried dating apps, approaching women in shops, cafes, parks, libraries. I’m not ugly, but not really a stud either. I’m not too short either (169cm). Not full of muscle, but not too skinny either. What’s the problem? Is it me? Am I a turn off? Or is it women’s expectations? 

I dress fairly well, have good hygiene, I’m polite and respectful, I’m also confident approaching women. I’ve been rejected so many times in the last few years that I’ve just pretty much given up altogether on dating. Covid didn’t help either. I don’t go out much anymore because I hate seeing couples laughing and having a good time. It just really hurts. It feels like I wasn’t destined to be in a relationship. It’s done a real number on my self esteem. I see ugly guys with girlfriends and it angers me so much. Or assholes who don’t deserve to be in a relationship. 

I don’t want to live this way anymore, life just feels so damn empty and dull without a partner to share it with. It feels like I’ll eventually die alone and that thought really gets me down. The loneliness is too much at times, especially at nights and mornings. I can’t do it anymore, and I’m so damn tired of all the cliche advice like “love yourself first” or “work on yourself” or “you can still be happy being single” well I’m not happy no matter what and I’ve been working on myself for years.

But I honestly can’t imagine not being sad forever. I was lonely all through my childhood. And now that my moms dead I just feel even more alone. I feel like she’s the only one who would get it and she’s not here. And all my fiancé says is that I’m being stupid and things will get better because they always do. Which just feels like such utter bullshit. I went from being suicidal at 14 to my mom killing herself to me being 25 and suicidal again. Life doesn’t get better for me. I honestly just feel like my life is like a video game. I keep waiting for something better on the next level only for it to be just a different type of shitty. I don’t know how to explain to him that of course I can’t fucking build hope up for my life. Hope never fucking did shit for me. And it definitely didn’t make any of it any better. My entire life before my mom died I hoped she’d get better, that shit didn’t happen. My mom lived a lot longer than me and her life was mostly struggling and depression. I don’t want to live. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my fiancé. But he makes me feel so alone and misunderstood sometimes that I just want to take off. He keeps insisting I tell him when I’m having a bad day like it matters. What’s one more day on top of the nine months I’ve already spent feeling like shit. He keeps telling me he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around me on my bad days because he thinks it’s about him unless I expressly tell him it’s not.

My friend has issues with alcohol and she promised me she had a handle on it. Her mom took her daughter and told us to enjoy the day. So we went out eat dinner walked around and she told me she wanted to go bar hopping. That was my first and last mistake. By the first bar she was already cut off. She started running away from me she hit me and told me I was nothing which I can handle fine. The last straw was when she got 2 separate people to hit me because you told them I WAS ABUSING her!! The person that has stuck through all her bullshit, all her mood swings and everything else abused her! I never ever raised my hand at her. She knows more about me than my own family more than anyone!! I opened up to her to have fuck me over constantly. Not to mention the fact that she never even apologize. I gave up and called her mom to help find her because she had ran away again, once we found I drove her car because she was still to intoxicated to drive. When we got to her moms house she ran to her room. My luggage was i her room and I had decided to getting a hotel room would be best. When I went upstairs to collect my things I saw her slumped over with red covering her. I knew what it was she cut herself with a knife. I jumped on top of her throw the knife away. Her mom and her refused to go to the hospital because she of her daughter so I stitched her up and bandaged her wound.

Reach level 52 in X game (I’m not even a heavy gamer)
Learn Y language or skill or hobby
Get Z class done and get a certificate 

I’m so pissed at some people right now too
I imagine doing terrible things to hurt them without killing them just because I get so mad

I started crying over everything that I feel I’d messed up on and couldn’t undo for my younger self
Now something else bad has recently happened
I don’t know how to cope with it

The more this kind of stuff happens to me
The more it seems like suicide isn’t a feeling of sadness or pain or anger but of setting things right
There’s emptiness in almost every aspect of my life and I can’t control it a lot of the days
I think some of us have a biological disposition toward nonexistence. Sadness that lasts decades. An inability now partially caused by society and partially biology that makes death not sound appealing but like the long rest we were always looking for

Finding lasting love is the one thing I ever wanted in life
More than the money
More than the job
More than anything else I’ve been lying o everyone about

So, i've always had a really big fear of being abandoned which has brought me to the point of not wanting to make friends because they've always abandoned me in the past.

Anyways, i had a best friend, which has now abandoned me to stay with someone else and now we barely do anything together and he probably knows me better than anyone in this world, but he still decided to abandon me without saying anything.

I had another friend, which i thought would never abandon me, but apparently to him i was just someone to take from since i always offered myself to help him in any way possible, and now that he can't take anything from me, he has abandoned me.

I also had a third friend, for some time i thought she was the first person that really was my friend and that could be one for the rest of my life. She has love bombed me for a month and a half, then she stopped.
But now i feel like she barely texts me if i'm not the one texting her. And the little she texts me i think she feels forced to do so because she knows how lonely i am. I feel like i'm such a burden and that she just got bored of me.

I think i have to come to terms that i'll be better off by myself for the rest of my days, but it's so hard not to have anyone when you once had people you thought loved you.",2022-07-20 07:00:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636457718,4,/r/lonely/comments/w3fqxj/i_feel_abandoned/,,0,0,i feel abandoned

There was a point where I suddenly snapped out of it and realized how I've been removed from the rest of society and floating with the bubble communities. Just these random conversations I would have with people or moments that would snap me out. 

And then I realized those communities I was in are people like me. Others who are alone. Mostly made up of the same people everyday. I started noticing all of the posts were by the same 50-100 people. And all of a sudden I realized what I was doing. And the more I started to put myself in other places, the more I realized I had secluded myself with this group of 50-100 people who were also social recluse like me. I had spent 5 years of my life in internet communities. Everyday. Every hour checking online. And I had spent the 5 years of my life with 50-100 people who I don't know if I even like. I had just convinced myself this was the community I was in. I don't know if this makes any sense but I'm having a jarring moment of reality shifting. I feel like I'm in a mental daze.

3797,w3mbce,-Living-Dead-Girl-,"today i told my only friend to get the fuck out of my life. 

he treats me like a joke.

 i'm intensely lonely, and very open with him about my struggles with it. yet he spends all his time hanging out at cool parties with loads of his other friends, always at some kind of event, always with people. he hangs out with me a lot too, but he wont ever invite me anywhere with anyone else, he wont introduce me to people. 

he's not only entitled (never been told no, gets childish and loud when something doesnt go his way) but he's constantly yelling at me because he expects that everyone gets things as easily handed to them as he does. he's gone on multiple capital letter rants at me about how i ""wont"" get help and ""wont"" go to therapy, since for him it's as easy as walking into the hospital and asking for it. he wont listen at all when i explain to him that i've literally been trying to get help for 7 years and that not everyones mother works in the mental health ward. 

he's constantly getting involved with different social groups whenever he gets into a new thing. uni, diving lessons, stripping, music school, wrestling. every time he gets involved with a new group, he literally just ditches me for them. i stop seeing him, and he spends all his time with his cool new friends. then when he leaves the group or things fall apart, he's back hanging out with me. 

he always ignores the things i say, rolls his eyes at me and ignores me. but then if he hears the same thing from someone else, suddenly he's telling me about it like he didnt ignore me saying the same thing a few days before. my suggestions are stupid, my opinions are stupid, until someone else says them, then theyre great. he has a habit of copying what others do and think, he becomes extremely into the hobbies of all of his other friends. but if i even suggest doing something or attempt to so much as speak about anything i'm into, i'm either ignored or stared at like i'm the cringiest loser in the world. his other friends have even told me they see this about the way he talks to me compared to everyone else.

he's always literally insulting me and then glossing over it when i point it out. for example: sometimes i tell him something, like something i do or think or have. and he'll laugh, tell me how dumb it is, give a reason for why, and then literally low key insult me by telling me something like ""that's what you get for not finishing school"" or something else insulting my intelligence. i'll then send him either a screenshot or a link to an article, explaining how his reasoning wasnt correct and i'm actually right. and he will literally just not respond to it. like, ever. he goes dead then pops back up with something completely unrelated, like he didnt just literally insult me for something he was then proved wrong about??

a few months ago, after a particularly hurtful insult aimed at my intelligence, i told him i don't like being insulted, and then just stopped responding. he made multiple posts on snapchat and facebook about me being a bitch and ignoring him for ""no reason"" and then blocked me everywhere. i wasnt bothered and just left it like that for a while. then i started to feel bad, and started thinking that maybe he really didnt realize he was being so hurtful. so i sent him a very calm, well worded message, just detailing how i feel. i made extra effort to not word it in a way that could come off as an attack. this started a very slow back and forth messaging for a while, where it became apparent that he doesnt see anything wrong with how he treats me. he literally admitted to treating me different than his other friends, but tried to make out like it's a good thing? like he called me his ""anchor friend"" which to me just sounds like justifying treating me badly? i dont want to be a backup friend, i dont want to be treated differently than everyone else. ive had enough of that my whole life im fucking done with it. 

so my last message was just saying how i don't want to be thought of as different than everyone else or used as some kind of ""anchor"", and that i wasnt interested in continuing a friendship where i didnt feel valued. i said goodbye.

would you put up with this treatment if it meant having a friend?",2022-07-20 13:26:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1543170544,23,/r/lonely/comments/w3mbce/is_having_a_friend_worth_giving_up_self_respect/,,0,11,is having a friend worth giving up self respect? (long)

3817,w3s71k,matteo_nanni23,"(19M) When I was 14 I was quite fat, and I've never thought I could be lovable and with nice friends, but that eventually changed. However, I occured to be in a group (or perhaps more like an association) based on the ideal of a friendship that was so true and genuine that it was almost impossible to find anywhere else. Honestly, some of theme were actually pretty good friends, but with most of them I tried to take the most care possible with those friendships, despite not always receiving something back. 

Time passed, in 2020 I also managed to bind with my current best friend, who wasn't actually in that group, and also kept advising me to leave, but whatever. By the way, I feel like I've chosen to be friend with him: he's two years older than me, we don't attend the same school. I could and still can end the friendship with him at any moment, but I don't, and that's what gives value to this relationship. 

Flash forward to January 2022, I was 18, my best friend got COVID. He eventually was good, but that meant that during his quarantine I couldn't rely on him. I was alone. I also stopped eating for more than a week (for the first time in my life I wasn't overweight). All those friends, my relatives, all those relationship that, in the end, I've never chosen, were a lie. I've basically never had a real friend but him, and now I'm alone. I promptly left that group, just to see how almost no one asked me where I was. 

I started reading a lot, especially philosophy books, but as I got to know more, the more I felt alienated. Knowledge has become a way to grow, but maybe I'm growing too fast.

I'm afraid of bonding. I'm afraid that all of this will happen again.

Who's my friend now? Is it possible to forgive? Is it possible to go back from where I started?",2022-07-20 17:28:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1570514951,3,/r/lonely/comments/w3s71k/i_dont_know_what_happened/,,0,1,I don't know what happened

I spent all I had  
Trying to get you to want me

Losing sleep, losing focus  
Being there, always there

You are on my mind so much  
Oh, so much of my mind is you

I wake up, longing for you  
I stay awake, dreaming of you

You push me away, I fade away  
I gave you my mind, body and soul

I gave you everything I could think of  
And I don’t regret any of it

\-

Maybe  it's because nobody had ever paid that kind of attention to me before. I  didn't know what to do - I just did what felt natural. And what felt  natural was trying to give you the entire world, however I could.

I'm  embarrassed to admit how much I wanted to please you. How much of  myself I was willing to sacrifice for you, even without you saying a  single word. When your reactions became colder and colder, my reasoning  wasn't 'she is letting you go - let her let you go'.

My  reasoning was 'I must not be trying hard enough - I'll double down'.  When you double down enough times you end up in a hole you can't crawl  out of.

I am trying to let you go,  as much as I can. But I still can't. Your messages brighten my days,  and the lack of them darken my nights. And cutting off completely seems  too painful right now. Maybe tomorrow, or the next day. Or the next day.

Basically, I feel like I'm just a straight-up failure at life. I had so much potential. Such gifts.
I was in the gifted program in elementary school.
One of the most attractive girls in my grade asked Me to prom.

Now I'm a 27 year old virgin who's been in one relationship that lasted 2 days and one other that lasted maybe a month or so. I've gone on about 5 dates outside of those relationships. Ever.

I don't know how to meet/talk to those I'm interested in. How a relationship is really even supposed to work. I waste all my time on video games and my porn addiction and can never get myself to do things I know I need to or things I used to enjoy. (Maybe I'm just lazy. My psychiatrist indicated I may have ADHD to go along with my depression and anxiety, but how much difference does it make?)

I didn't get  accepted to pretty much and college I wanted so I chose a college because it was Cheap. Now I work a stupid boring office job. At one point I thought by now I'd have a place and situation where I could dress and behave how I wanted, but I'm living with my parents (partially because I get too anxious to function when dropped into a new setting with people I don't already know.)

I'm one of the submissive creeps who basically want a partner who will be their mommy, so the number of people I'd be happy in a relationship is even less (though I'm aware the perfect person doesn't exist and I need to make compromises and commit to someone real).

I have this stupid Idea stuck in my head that if I want a more dominant partner I need to let them make the first move and ask me out, but even that might have had some success by now if I was willing to (or even knew how to) meet people and/or flirt.

I used to hate myself, but it's gotten to a point where I'm too numb for emotions as strong as hate. 

I guess I just wish I had the strength and will to change.

From there, you go to sleep and wake up with the exact same routine of playing games until the day is done, which continues until school holidays are over. This sounds pathetic as hell as I read over it, but I think it’s what I’m experiencing and just want to know if anyone here gets that same feeling and maybe has some advice, if they’d like to share?",2022-07-20 20:26:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/w3wjx2/anyone_else_experience_a_sort_of_daily_wave_cycle/,,0,1,Anyone else experience a sort of daily wave cycle of loneliness during holidays?

3846,w3xr7l,happy-alone03,"I'm a 19 year old (almost 20) male from Brazil.

From the age of 13/14-16, I had only a goal in my mind: to get a girlfriend.

I talked to a lot of girls but all of them rejected me. I thought my physical flaws were the problem (I'm a short guy and I don't like the way I look so much), so I decided to forget about getting a gf and I started a ""self-improvement"" journey. It was exactly when the pandemic started.

I started to read useful books, started exercising (running and started going to the gym when they opened back), start learning how to code, started training my communication skills (on Discord groups focused on that, they are really useful), started taking care of my appereance the best as I could, learned english (the only thing I could say was ""Hi my name is X, how are you?"" - and now I can write this full text without a translator - it's not perfect, but WAY better than what I knew), got into a good university and this year I got a really good job at a good company etc.

If you compare me to who I was before the pandemic, I'm almost another person - and I'm way happier. I'm really satisfied with my life, I like the person I'm and my life in general, and, to be honest, **that need to get into a relationship is 100% gone - not only that, but I think if I was in a relationship rn, it would only bring me problems.** Me being single wasn't the problem. The problem was that I didn't took care of myself and didn't have a good self-esteem.

I even was approached by girls 2 times last year (both at my friend's brithday party), but I just didn't feel like it, I just wanted to stay there and celebrate it with him and other friends. My friends when they discovered started asking if I was gay or what was my problem.

And here comes the problem: everyone now is trying to push me into some relationship. Here, around the age of 16, everyone has a partner already - and I'm turning 20 and never had one. 

My parents never talked about this, but this last month I heard they talking about it. They were asking themselves ""when is he going to turn himself into a man and get a girlfriend?"", my friends (all of them have gfs) make jokes about me being single all the time, my aunt was shocked last week when my mom said to her that I never had a gf, and the funniest situation: my grandmother in the nursing home, when I went to visit her in March, asked if I had already found a girlfriend. When I said I wasn't into it now, she looked disappointed and called an employee there who was my age. She said ""look OP, she's your age and she's single! Ask her her phone number!!"" - It was pretty awkward lol.

I have so many things going on in my life, so many projects (I'm making app with a friend, studying/working a lot, preparing to run my 1st marathon in november etc) and goals that honestly, I don't think that right now it's a good time to add a ""relationship"" into this whole situation. Maybe next year, but not right now - at the same time, this pressure from EVERYONE is really annoying me, and, to be honest, I'm starting to feel embarrassed.

Am I the only one?? How do you deal with it??",2022-07-20 21:15:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/w3xr7l/im_happy_being_single_but_society_is_pressuring/,,0,0,"I'm happy being single, but society is pressuring me to change it. Am I the only one?"

3854,w3yymr,jmoss_27,"Im so tired of trying to date someone. Its like no matter how hard i try how much effort into it it just all falls apart at the stage. Typically after the 2nd date i start to notice the texts taking longer. Getting one word responses like lol nice or lmao. Just took a girl out on our second date. We were really vibing for weeks now then at the date I started to feel that “this isnt going to go like you want it” feeling. Honestly im just waiting for the ghosting. It happens every time. Its starting to eat away at my soul. Ive always been taught to respect women and treat them like i would someone to treat my mother or sister and i do but i guess its just not meant to be. The pain of putting myself out there just be thrown away like trash is hurting less and less with each girl. I started working a job i hate because the hours are long so that means less time to be alone with myself and breaking down because i feel like I’ll never escape. I know my problems start from my childhood when i was bullied so badly i never made any friends until high school. And late high school like junior year. And now im a junior in college. I played football as a kicker and would stay after school and kick for hours just to decompress and let the pain out. It hurt so much being all by myself. I trained for so long i got a scholarship to kick in college which im so blessed to have happened. I thought the loneliness and single life was behind me. I was so wrong. My freshman year was no different then high school but i wasnt going to let being lonely hurt me anymore. Then it happened. Met a great Christian girl with great priorities was on multiple scholarships for community service and she took me I thought my pain wad being rewarded finally. Then after what I thought was an amazing date and the perfect and most romantic way possible to ask this girl to be my girlfriend, took her to a wildlife refuge, her favorite thing to do, we walked around on the trail cracked jokes held hands then I decided to ask her out officially. 
I never thought this level of emotional pain was real. Worse than any other ive felt before
She told me that she wanted to break it easy to me that she found a better guy than me, im not perfect far from it but that hurt to my very soul. She told me i didnt have to take her home. Her new boyfriend was on his way to pick her up. 
When i got back in my car i drove off just out of visual distance and just stayed there in my car. I was so heart broken i could feel some tension in my chest. Felt like something was ripping in my chest near my heart. I stayed there crying, i couldnt tell you what was hurting worse my chest or my self esteem. I wanted to get even with her. But i cant hurt a friend or someone i used to call friend. I decided to go back to what i did in high school. Find something thatll take all my time so i dont have to think about being lonely 
I changed my major to chemical engineering with a minor in petroleum engineering industrial engineering and chemistry. All that to not feel alone. It was working great but then i met a new girl. Just transferred in. Knew noone and was looking for someone to sit next too in class. We ended up hitting it off really well went on a date and about a week later she invited me to her house for a party with some of her friends. It was fantastic loved every second. After the party we just laid outside feeling the cold 2am breeze as we watched the sky taking about the james webb telescope and betting on what they would discover next. She crawled on me and finally we kissed. She kept pulling me in and it one of the happiest moments for me. Went on the 2nd date. Where things always go wrong. I thought it could’ve gone better on my part but she assured me I was doing fine. After the date she went home to study so did i.
Im getting the feeling again that im going to get hurt soon. I want to fight this feeling but its never been wrong. 
I just want someone who play with my heart. Its been played like a violin, beaten like a punching bag. And left out like a dead animal on the interstate. I just want love right now.

Basically my girlfriend is pregnant and idk if it’s hormones or she’s rly just done with me but she broke up w me and I really want to be with her. I love her and I want to be there to support her thru the pregnancy. 

She gets mad at me when I text her so I am hoping to make a fake Facebook account of someone she would find attractive. Make them a carbon copy of me (same job, school, music taste etc) and start DM her and slowly build an online relationship. Eventually tell her it’s me and see if that might help her see that we do have a serious connection. If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. But if it does I get to be a husband and a father instead of a distant baby daddy. Please help.

I have started so many, but due to not being mindful of actually messaging people once in a while, I haven't maintained many. But I miss some of them. They were honestly great people and I wonder about them today. I wonder how their lives are, if their plans became reality, and if they are even the same person anymore. But I feel like I only have myself to blame here. 

I especially miss the friendships that are kind of flirty, but very friendly and we get to know what each other's lives are like on the other end of the screen. 

Not sure if this is relatable or not. Not sure if I sound like a complete asshole here saying all of this. But if you feel similar, let me know. If you have feedback, let me know. If you want to try to keep up something online with me, feel free to send a message.

For the last two months things have been hectic with my job and training new employees on a system not designed to be taught remotely, and i havent had a moment to myself.  Finally get a break and reach out to a ""friend"" to go out and do something.  They are busy.  I get it i have been nonstop for the last two months and we are all adults, no problem.  Message a few others and get about the same.  I start going thru my msgs and realize none of them have reached out in a long time and when they did it was because they needed something.  So im sitting here realizing that i dont really have any friends.  I havent done anything fun or social since i broke up with my ex last october and most of that was stuff she wanted to do with her friends and i was just a tag along.  Its just disheartening to realize that you are in your 30s and have no friends.  Be careful out there.

3884,w42w1q,sinn333,"I lost my heart when I was very young.
I fell in love with a girl at school and never told anyone.
We were in the same classes all throughout grade and middle school and when we both graduated we had grown to be good friends.
Even after finishing school we spend much time together and we shared many intimate thoughts and dreams.
I was a friend to her and she was a love to me.
The years passed as we both grew older.
While she often told me about dates and her ever changing relationships, I didn’t have similar stories to tell.
She never rejected me, I tell myself, and still I’m a broken man. It’s a stupid way of thinking about my life, nevertheless I’ve gotten used to it.
After all my heart wasn’t taken from me, I gave it up willingly and it disappeared.
Nowadays I don’t know what to do with myself.
Of course I have an intense longing for Love, having never experienced it, but the idea of being loved also feels distant and impossible.
No girls have ever shown their interest or much friendliness towards me.
My isolation leads me down a path of self destruction and I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to change course.
It’s a shameful thing to admit, but on New Years, my birthdays and when I see shooting stars I always wish for love, as I’m quite desperate and hopeless.
A wonder would be a welcome solution.
I’ve seen such wonders happen: on a long bus ride to Italy a girl approached a friend of mine and within a couple moments they fell in love. 
I’m scared and rejection would kill me, as I have already been rejected by my father.
This must have left marks.
Never being able to open up to my childhood love must have left scars too.
I feel quite unwanted in this world.
I’m sure If I could start all over again, I’d fail the same. Somehow I’m broken.",2022-07-21 00:59:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630518434,93,/r/lonely/comments/w42w1q/hey_i_suck_at_life/,,0,29,Hey I suck at life

Then I got another best friend from 5-9th grade. She really was the best friend you could ask for we talked on the phone everyday. I went to her house every weekend. But I believe she was afraid to come out to me, which is why we drifted apart. I would have accepted her cause she was like my sister. Then I had little friendships here and there that never stuck until I met my best friends in 11th grade 1 girl, and 1 boy. She stopped talking to me after I graduated. She was a year below me. And me and him stopped talking cause I was in a controlling relationship (from when I was 18-22) where I wasn't allowed to talk to him. Now he only calls at midnight when he's drunk to talk to me. And she is always ""too busy"" to talk to me. I reached out to people after I got out of that relationship finally and told them I'm sorry and that I miss their friendship and more and most people didn't respond. And if they did it was one reply and when I reached out a couple more times I never would hear back again.  I'm now 27. I have one other person who I've never lost touch with since 8th grade.

It really showcases the utter lack of individuality they've been subjected to.

I hate my job, myself, my general position in life and am extremely depressed. 

Yet somehow the loneliness is what hurts most. 

Like I think I am alone since I was taught to hate myself. I think I look normal on paper but looking at my reflection I feel contempt. 

I fear trying to reach out. Once forced to talk I am alright at it. I’m weird but not to an alarming degree. I’ve dated before but with the depression being the worse its ever been I don’t see how it was possible anyone thought they loved me. How anyone was my friend. 

I work from home so I see literally no one on a regular basis. 

I enjoy none of my hobbies anymore. 

It’s hard to want to try a dating app or anything because of insecurities. 

I honestly don’t care about sex. Due to work haven’t done it much. I just want someone to care about me and for me to dote on. To enjoy things with. 

I can’t explain how hard it is to do that when with every action my inner voice goes, “why try? You’re afraid to talk to them. Shut up. You’re intruding.”

About a year ago for my 10th sucide attempt I had 100$ each to my friends as a goodbye gift. So how did that turn out?

One friend I found out dose insults about me being alone and having no ""real"" friends and how I'm a virgin

Two others have called me the meanest person they know to my face.

And two others while sweet, I can clearly tell they hate me and are only hanging out with me because they know what I'm struggling with.

It really makes me think that I don't deserve to live.

3942,w49dh0,onohki,"I (18M) been lonely my whole life. I don’t feel normal. I don’t feel human.

This loneliness is present everywhere,
don't have any close friends to talk to, I’ve never had any friends,
never talked to a girl in a romantic
manner and I don't feel loved by parents.
It's been eating me alive especially
whenever I talk to someone, I start to recognise that I never had a childhood. I was the guy that never had a girlfriend, was never in school group chats, never noticed by others unless I ask for other people to acknowledge my existence. In my household I wasn't allowed to leave the house to do anything so as a result I was never invited to anything, I also wasn't allowed to purchase game consoles for a long time - so even online friends wasn’t an option. For a while I spent time endlessly binging one tv show to the next but recently it’s been harder to engage in one because I feel this looming jealousy- especially when there are romantic subplots. I’m aware of how silly it sounds, but it doesn’t just apply to film/tv even in real life it’s seems my insecurities have formed some form jealously that is triggered whenever I see another couple or a group of friends. I can’t help it.

It’s also getting really hard to hide my loneliness because I try to never mention it and I’ll even lie about it something but when I’m questioned by others they’re able to work it out and start looking at me weird thinking that if  he’s  so lonely he must be a shitty person, I don’t blame them because I understand their thought process.

I’ve been writing as a hobby to keep myself distracted but my work doesn’t seem genuine - I can’t draw from any experiences in my life. I’m even surprised myself how someone can go 18 years without any human connection or intimacy.

I sometimes get suicidal thoughts but they’re all a bluff because I could never do it, I’m curious to see if I really am destined to loneliness.

The reason my loneliness truly bothers me so much, is because I don’t feel like I deserve this. I don’t hate myself.",2022-07-21 06:28:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1555190099,10,/r/lonely/comments/w49dh0/i_dont_want_to_feel_like_this_anymore/,,0,2,I don’t want to feel like this anymore

3953,w4aj4m,AdrianLoves,The truth is I’m very lonely. It’s been 4 months since my ex girlfriend and I broke up and I have dreams about her quite frequently. She’s mad at me in a lot of them. She was a very negative depressed person and eventually I had enough and my ego took control and fucked up whatever was left of our relationship. Despite all her faults she’d comfort me in my worst of times and I failed to comfort her in hers. The last time I reached out to her she told me she wasn’t interested in talking to me as it hadn’t been enough time since our split. It’s a really long story but I believe her father has had a heavy influence on her leaving me. Her father decided she was important after 15 years of neglect. Had her move 1000 miles away so it’s safe to say it’s been over. I guess that feeling of loneliness is truly terrible. I feel like true intimacy is something that’s such a foreign concept to me.

3972,w4d74r,luvUxs86,"You see there are people who sacrifice everything beyond their capacity to make their loved ones happy. They give everything they have, to feel valid, not to feel like a burden. But as soon as they slightly slack off or give up because they feel tired is the moment everyone turns to their real face. Treats them like burden, as if they didn’t ever put their heart, soul and strength to keep things in place. Families are overrated. even some parents only expect what they want from their children. As long as their children start to think differently from parents’ expectation they start showing rage and anger. Taunt them every now and then. Still a child/partner/friend with a good heart always gives even after being treated badly, they always care even though their loved ones don’t. At the end of the day what these people receive is agony, pain that can’t be described. They are the loneliest because they are always there for everyone but no one is there when they break down. Trust me it hurts. So if you ever feel like you’re developing into being the bigger person in any sort of relationship, be that your family, partner or friends; ask yourself if you can take this much pain alone. If you can then it’s always appreciated to be a good heart but if there’s a choice don’t become one.

3974,w4dla2,suffocatedbattery,"I get it, I'm posting with 200 other lonely people.  


I have been very lonely recently, not because of a breakup, but because somehow, I am a magnet for happiness. And you might think that makes me happy, but it really just makes me more depressed.

I see people and their couples, kids, girlfriends, boyfriends, hell even regular friends, and I feel like I've never lived.

And I'm so young! I'm not even 18 yet. But I have one online friend, 2 IRL friends, and so many people that were my friends. But I keep losing them. Every time. I have never had a big group of people to hang out with.  
And people say that's 'lucky' cause ""you don't want that many friends!"" or ""quality over quantity!""

So I cope with it. I find something I like. Something that isn't out there. But every time I discover something that's a hidden gem, that makes my life tolerable, that makes me feel better, it immediately becomes unearthed and super popular.   
This happened with Trevor Henderson, SCP, Jack Stauber, Minecraft, and a dozen other things that I forgot to mention because I can't remember them.  
And I don't want to stick with them cause it feels insulting for whatever reason.

All of this makes it so that every time I wake up...  
I don't want to wake up. I just want to sleep forever. But I don't want to die.

I'm just not ready to be lonely and feel this way until I find another friend who would abandon me. Until something I can really like and feel so connected to becomes popular and kids ruin it.  
I cannot take this anger, sadness, and stiffness for another week but I know I'll still be as empty in a month. No matter how hard I work, I never did enough, I'm just simply not worth it.  
I have a voice in my head constantly shaming me for not doing something different.   
Maybe if I said this, I'd be checked on. Maybe people would care.  
I just feel like I've hurt more people than actually helped.  
And even when I do help people, which I have been doing more often?  
Nothing ever comes back, it's like I am living proof karma does not exist.

I just cannot be lonely for any longer. But I just can't do anything about it.

I've never had people stand beside me, or support me. I should be used to this. But I don't even have a fragment of a memory to hang onto. It's just been this way since I was a kid. And that's the hardest part. Not even having that shitty feeling.",2022-07-21 10:50:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/w4dla2/i_cannot_take_this_feeling_for_another_minute/,,0,0,I cannot take this feeling for another minute.

Yesterday, I had a date with a lovely girl. She seemed great, we had lots of things in common, and a similar view of life. She seemed to enjoy our time spent together! And, I got ghosted when asking for a second date in the end. I understand that nobody owes me anything, but, it hurts a lot. The thing is that I can't cry. My body doesn't seem to allow me. I am just dull now. I guess I just wanted to say this out loud.

On another note, my mind won't stop spiraling.. it hurts. The thoughts, the emotions, the numbness.. existence. I know it does, and I know that whomever you are reading this have felt this too. You're not alone.

Is it just me or is it really that hard to find people that are not judgemental or is it that hard to find people who dont thi ks the internet is full of creeps? There are some weird people online for sure... but some just want to feel less alone... like me.

As a 25 year old guy I always struggled finding people I click with... to be fair I never really went looking.. but lately i really felt alone and not accepted in society as I imagined I was ... I try to talk to people. Make new contacts but one way or another I'm not good enough.. may it be my looks or where i come from. That fact my english is not always as good as i wish it to be..

Sometimes you start the wonder... Am I not good enough for others? Or am I i to chubby or to skinny ??.  Is it because i have a disorder.. or because i look funny..?

Man... when i hear my parents talk about hoe life was back in their time... they made friends on the fly... and people of my age don't seem to be able to do it anymore... ... its frustrating:/ All i want is to make friend.

They always say there is someone for for everyone other there.... maybe the other person didnt receive the directions pointing to me... hella sucks
What i really try to say is that i try so hard making new people and actively chat with others just to be forgotten 1 week later... its not fun.



Is it just me or can everyone relate?



I know people feel the same and i want you to know that you are not the only one who feels that. Alot of us feel like it. All of you people deserve to find nice people to hang out with...

Her reasoning is partly because she is moving away for university in September but she also said it’s something else that not even she knows and she’s frustrated because she can’t give me an actual explanation. I do believe her on this because since getting to know her I’ve learned that if she wants to say something on her mind she will.

But since cutting her out I’ve been missing her more than I thought possible and I’m fighting the urge to start talking again but I feel like I’m losing massively. Since having to cut her out my family life has gotten worse along with other problems that keep cropping up and I feel like I’m struggling. All I want is to bring her back into my life because I genuinely do care about her and she made me feel like being myself wasn’t such a bad thing. Seeing her made me happy and she told me that she liked me for who I was.

But the whole reason I cut her out was to try and protect myself from getting hurt because I don’t think I would cope very well but I feel like that’s failed because I’m feeling worse than I ever have and I really don’t know what to do.

4119,w4zyqx,Anonwriter47,So recently I found out my parents never really loved me . And my whole life I felt lonely . Been trying to find a good relationship for 10+ years ever since I was 13 but have been unsuccessful. How am I supposed to feel ? I feel numb each day that goes by . My love language is affection.. I been touched starved for years now . And now I’m accepting the fact I’ll never get genuine love . How do I accept this more easier ?,2022-07-22 03:20:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626546704,1,/r/lonely/comments/w4zyqx/unknown_feelings/,,0,2,Unknown feelings .
4120,w4zzlq,Mission-Individual34,"My story it is not a sad one, I'm not a victim... I always had it easy. Always. Had pretty much everything that I wanted materially, have parents that they love me dearly, even though they had to divorce because of their own miss understandings, I've never suffered because of it, I had good friends... That I mistreated, I mistreated them a lot and I regret it. But why? Why did I do it? And how did I mistreated them? Well, to begin... I'm not a rude, cocky living with an attitude like '' I'm above the rest... '' , NO. I didn't do any of that. No harsh words or physical altercations, but I do ghost people... Yes, I'm one of those fucking assholes... We speak one day, we hang out , everything seems dandy and then... Baaam! You won't hear from me for at least 8 months... At least ! In public, best way I can describe myself... '' I'm a ghost '' ... That's who I am... I avoid eye contact, I don't say hello to my neighbors... For fuck sake ! I live in this building for 25 years and I got no idea who are the people living here with me... I'm a total fuck up, from top to bottom, from left to right... Nothing but flaws and flaws. Now, some people and myself included feel like being a Ghost is quite rude, in poor taste and all in all something you shouldn't strive to do in a human society. But why am I like this? What is the reason? I'm not a shrink by any means but for the past years I had to do a lot of hard digging in my fucking ugly self... And I probably think that I got it... I think , not sure though... I feel extremely... EXTREMELY , there you go , i wrote it in capital letters so you know that I very much mean it... Extremely Unworthy... Unworthy of love ( I never had a girlfriend who hanged out with me for free ), Unworthy of someone's friendship, just not a pleasant human being, physically and mentally. When I go to the gym, I never say hello to anyone, especially if they are groups of friends working out together... I feel like I bother them, I feel like I'm in the way... There's this girl who's working there as a receptionist, we salute each other have a small chit chat, but tonight, she was out for a cigarette , talking with some other dude, so I didn't said anything to her, because I felt like I was in the way, I felt like it would bother them... When I finished my work out, she gave me a rude look and it was perfectly understandable. I hate myself, I hate the way I am most of the times... I tried to talk with my elders about this,but... They are folk from other generation... Their advice? Just not be that ! Ok, how ? How am I suppose to go about it ? I love my parents, but sometimes they piss me off with their ''encouragement'' they always tell me that I have potential... STOP Saying that ! I don't have any potential and if I did had a bit... Fuck knows how am I suppose to use it! Do I want a change ? Well, here comes the trouble... I don't think I want to change, there's something in love and friendships that scares the shit out of me... I don't know, since young age I always thought that I would struggle alone and die alone. Yes, those were the thoughts of an 4 year old kid... Live and die alone, why should someone give a shit about me ? I don't have nothing to offer... In regard of women... Well, there are plenty of gorgeous men,smart men, rich men... I'm nothing of that, never will I be either... I fucking accepted it long time ago, I can't even be mad at this point... for potential guy friends? Why would you hang out with me ? You got a nice car , you got a nice wife a great life, you pull your weight splendidly in business and everything else you set your mind to... I think you should hang out with people your caliber. So yeah , love and friendship... Why am I so terrified of these things? Normal people would love to have, I sure had few of those before fucking everything up... I don't know, is just... Just... Solitude is comfortable. Not having to answer to anyone, not having to worry that your loved one may replace you, not having the pressure to think you might let someone down ( I should burn in hell in agony forever and ever for how many people I let down ). Solitude is just... Easy. Easy to do, easy to understand and sticks with you, sticks with you till' the end, with this approach? No one ever will knock on your door to make friends... And even if they do, I will probably won't answer. There are remarkable people out there who broke away from it... Broke the vicious cycle, but I don't own such a beautiful mind, total opposite. Yes there been rejections over the years... Yes, I had plenty of people saying '' You ain't worth a shit ! '' , but that's not an excuse... You should never allow bad experiences to influence the outcome of your life. But me? I'm just so comfortable with it. Ok, so what the fuck is this exactly ? You would probably asking yourself right now... It is NOT a cry for help. I'm not depressed. I just needed to write down my thoughts and feelings... I am 200% responsable for my loneliness, I deserve it and... And I love it, as fucked up as that is. Change is never easy... But you need to want that change sincerely for that to happen. I say this because maybe there are people stuck in such place as I am but they are most definitely better than me and want to improve their life. I wish you a good luck from all my heart, and If you want that change... You really have to mean it !",2022-07-22 03:21:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608921594,6,/r/lonely/comments/w4zzlq/a_life_of_solitude/,,0,1,A life of solitude

4122,w50hsj,Historical_Stage1505,"best I can do is categorize it as feeling hopeless, jealous, and tricked. 18M, whenever I see a really cute girl online or irl, I get these feelings of wanting to try and reach out, but I think to myself that whoever is with her right now must be very lucky, but if I were to be dating her, I would constantly fear losing her to someone else or disinterest. Maybe these are some insecurities that stem from media and such about relationships, love, etc. 
Feeling tricked referes to things you see in movies and media and games and anime about relationships, in real life, there’s realistically nothing ou can do to make yourself the main character(which I know is a childish desire)

I feel that even if I fix these things about me, I won’t be able to feel content or comfortable in any future relationships. Never even kissed a girl yet, and I have this ambivalent feeling towards relationships. I feel lonely, and the only way out is to either change the way I feel(of which I can’t control) or meet people.

Seeking help, for it to come and go

Everyone around me only sees what i show

Hiding the tears and brushing away my past

Eventually this tightness in my heart will become to vast

Lying to myself that itll be alright

Playing league all night to prevent the mirrors sight

Making no friends to help me on my journey

Eventually the reaper himself will tell me hes sorry

4181,w58xf0,blindhorseman,"
F23 and have severe social anxiety. I'm afraid to speak to people and I don't know how to make friends. I have a very bad relationship w/ my family. My mom openly hates me and my father refuses to speak to me. 
Almost 2 years ago I moved for my masters degree. I don't know anyone, accept for 1 person, but later on that. That was my first in person semester and even so I didn't manage to learn anyone. I don't even a single persons name. Everyone else seems fine, they all have their friends circle at college and can communicate with other students, accept me. I don't know how to start speaking with anyone and no one seems to ever notice me anyways. It's even harder for me because it seems they have great time without me and they would be happier not knowing me.

I have a job. At work I'm the youngest person by far. The only other student at my office ist 28. Because everyone is much older i can't find a topic to speak about. They speak only about spouses, kids, sometimes about weddings and vacations. It also seems to me that they not really interested to speak to a much younger person. I'm looking much younger, so everyone, who doesn't know me assumes I'm an intern from highschool, which I'm not. The other student just fucking hates me. He always says to me and other coworkers how blank, uninteresting i am,like it's my job to entertain me. He tries to bully me every chance he gets. During break i try to eat alone so I don't need to deal with him and other people don't seem to care if I'm not there. It even worse because that student is bad doing his task and so I always need to make my and his tasks. I get everything done on time somehow and usually better than him. He got so used to that that he even blames on me that I didn't do some of his tasks, which he said he would do on his own.

My dating/love life just sucks. I never got asked out or something. I never been on a single date. If I try to do the first step i always get rejected, sometimes even before I managed to do something i got rejected. Guys often tell me the reason why they never would date me. It comes often to not being feminine enough or being just ugly. It's very painful for me to hear, because I usually don't ask. They just come up to me and say how ugly i am and gonna die alone because of it. 
For several years i even avoided my crushes because I knew I never had a chance and that that would just hate me. When the pandemic started i was even glad , because now no one needed to deal with seeing me. 
When I was 22 an guy in his late 20 tried to rape me. Luckily we didn't ended up having sex, but he sexually assaulted me by kissing and inappropriately touching me. Sadly that's how I had my first kiss. It was very gross for me and I couldn't sleep or eat for a few days and puked even a few times.
A half years after this incident i somehow got an online friend it turned out he was attaining the same university and was living near me. After knowing each other for a few months he suggested to be fwb.  I thought that no one ever would be interested in me. I actually had some feelings for him and I thought it was my only chance to get with someone I like. At first it was nice. But later it developed into a very big mess. Im madly in love with him, but he has no feelings for me at all. He started seeing other people and started bragging about it. I could deal with it so I confessed my feelings for him. He said nothing at first. A week later he decided to have a talk with me. He said something upon that it's more than just fwb, but he doesn't want to label it and that anyway Im just someone to have fun until he graduates and moves into a bigger city, where he ""could meet more ppl and have more sex partners"". I was very sad. I understood that it's not a relationship, but I didn't think that I meant so little to him. After that he sometimes would treat me nice and say that he likes me, but it feels very forced, especially if considering that 2 weeks ago he said he doesn't like me and doesn't see a future with me. We are still ""together"". It's convenient for him and I can't really go because I'm so afraid of loneliness. I still wonder how it went so far, considering my anxiety. 

A month ago there were a few events at my college and I decided to go to one of them. I could do it. I went to it and right before entering I saw a couple people having a good time and got scared. I immediately run away and started crying. For some reason it stressed me out a lot, so I cried all night. 

I'm in therapy for few months. I have a reccuring depression for a very long time with suicide attempts. My last attempts where because I'm feeling very lonely and useless as a human being and everyone would be happier if I never existed in the first place. Therapy doesn't help me with anything. But at least I can speak sometimes to someone.

Sorry this one is very long, but in short i don't manage to get to know ppl at school, i don't get along with my coworkers and even get bullied at work. The only person I know and could speak to (accept my therapist) is someone who doesn't care about me and just uses me for sex.",2022-07-22 12:04:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,,40,/r/lonely/comments/w58xf0/im_socially_incapable/,,1,20,I'm socially incapable

I am a 23yo man living in Japan. Tbh, I really don’t have friends to talk with now. I have been lonely. What I do is just working or studying for my work. 

It has been difficult to make friends because I haven’t stayed in one place for long time. I was actually in the US for my bachelor degree. Fortunately, I had very great friends at the time, but once I came back to Japan, I can’t talk with them like I used to do. Moreover, I will leave Japan in a few months due to my work…. So, yeah I would need to reset my relationships even if I had friends here.

4203,w5bcz1,Just_Lonely_Tonight,"Today it finally completely broke. I guess i should start from the beginning though. 

I fell madly in love with a girl 5 years ago. We had an amazing year together but things ended rough. We both had issues we needed to get past before we could be with someone, luckily we ended up able to be friends a few months later.
She’s been my best friend through thick and thin since then. We’ve seen some of the most ugly and the most beautiful parts of each other’s lives so far. Needless to say I’ve been head over heels for her since we met and that still hasn’t changed.
We have both been in relationships since then but somehow we just couldn’t shake our love for each other so they always failed. 
She told me out of the blue she’s in love and how he’s a great guy. She finally shook free from the chains our love had been for her. 
I’m happy for her, I desperately want her to be happy. I just wish I could have been the one to do it though. 
I’ve had heartbreaks before but never this bad. She painted a beautiful world in front of me and now all the color has drained from that world.

4246,w5jv53,farwanderinghopes,"I've had a lot of major life changes in the past 7-8 months (left my partner of 2.5 years, finally completed undergrad after I left for health reasons, got accepted into a good grad program with a full ride, moved back home and am moving out again this weekend, came out as trans to everyone but my folks, started and left a new job, etc.) I really wish there were people around to help celebrate or mourn these things with me, but much of the scant socialization I had last year has suddenly vanished either coincidentally or as a result of all this shit.
The people I used to casually spend time with have stopped talking to me. My best friend became increasingly unavailable until he also stopped speaking to me altogether. I've been living with my family and they want nothing to do with me--to the extent that my mother will literally interrupt me while I'm talking to her to call someone else, and no one gave me any information to visit her in the hospital after her hip surgery. My former coworkers pointedly excluded me from things like office lunches. At this point there are literally two people who give me a second glance--and they're my new roommates who spend all of their time together without me. 
Being alone (and lonely) are pretty normal for me, and I've never really had anything resembling a support system. It would be one thing if I wasn't putting in the effort to keep in touch, or to be supportive and reliable, or to be understanding and patient. But I try really goddamn hard. I check in. I give people space if they ask for it or seem to need it. I find events in town and invite people. I talk to people at bars and grad school events. I volunteer. I offer to get coffee or play games online or do literally anything. But nothing works. Folks don't reciprocate or respond or show up; they cancel and give apologies and then never follow up. I'm truly at a loss here. Even using online spaces like this normally result in me comforting others while receiving nothing. I can't count the number of posts I've made on reddit and in forums--in appropriate spaces--that never received a single response. 
I've tried for years and years to be okay with being lonely. I invest time in my interests and hobbies. I'm deeply passionate about my work. I do the best that I can to manage my depression and OCD, etc. When I do get to spend time with people I try my best to be open and present and mindful of their needs; if I need to set boundaries I do so politely. But the truth is I desperately need and want people in my life. I want someone to check up on me or invite me for drinks. I want to be a part of someone's life and to share my life with them.

I was friends with a guy, he was really similar to me, we met trough another friend, we were friends for almost a year, but sadly we did not stay friends for that long....

we had a friend group, if Im not mistaken, there where 7 of us. a few months ago all of us unfriended one of our friends, because he was acting like a dick, calling himself fat, useless for atention probably.. later they were starting to leave me out, like they went out to the park, then sent me snaps of them having fun and all, while I was left in the dark...

it happened again about a  month ago.. so a few days later i texted him that I felt left out and I was hurting and did not want to be apart of this group, he said "" Yah sure "" that was it. The last message.. now I am left with 3 friends, 2 are twins that were in the group and the other is a girl, she understands me very well, I think I might like her, but that aside, I can not believe it that i lost  mostly all my friends  for such a stupid thing...

4275,w5phgd,Lonely_Times_27,"I am 27, turning 28 in September, and I never had a real girlfriend. I also have not touched a woman in over 7 years. Every day, despite having a very well-paying job and supportive family, it tears me to shreds.

Meanwhile, I am watching all my former friends and most of my peers I have known growing up get married, have kids, or both. I feel like I am the last one standing. I can understand not having a wife at this moment, but never having an actual relationship? Really?

I seek a woman with the same inexperience as me. I am hoping me and a woman can be each other's first loves. I can no longer say me and a woman knew each other when we were young. That ship has sailed. In addition, I don't feel right giving my heart to the first time to a woman who has loved some other guy dearly before me. It doesn't feel mutual. 

I may very well end up alone the rest of my life. I don't know how to deal with this, especially because ever since I was a kid I always wanted and dreamed of a girlfriend, wife, and a family of my own. 

I feel I am having less and less common with my peers as they move into different chapters of their lives, forming marriages and their own families. I feel I cannot even relate anymore.

Hell, there's only one person I talk to with any regularity and she lives in another state and we might get a total of 30 minutes texting a week. It's been about 9 months since I've been around people and had to be social. I'm so incredibly lonely it hurts. I work from home so that just makes it worse.

So earlier this week there was some training that lasted a couple days and I had to go to the office and I could meet my other coworkers there. It felt really nice, but I think I got too excited and maybe was a bit too much and award and a tad too much self disclosure. I don't know how much of this is real and how much of it is just my mind messing with me, but I know I was a bit much. 

Since then I've had this terrible anxiety worrying about how I came off to my coworkers. I'm so worried that I've ruined any chance of even a casual friendship with any of them. I don't feel like I can address it with anyone, and I'm afraid that if I reach out to anyone and try to talk to someone it'll be awkward. 

I'm just sad and anxious and I have to deal with this weekend alone and I'm safe, but my mind is starting to the darker places that I haven't been to in a while. I just wish someone would talk to me so I know I wasn't a complete disaster, but I know that's almost never happens for me. I just hope the anxiety goes away soon.

We’ve been doing marriage counseling and I’ve recently started going to individual counseling as well. I went into it hopeful, thinking that she just needed to work through whatever she needed to work through and I would continue to be here for her, and work with her.

I made the mistake of going through old pictures tonight and saw a few old snapchats I had saved of her saying “you’re so cute, I love you!” And things of that nature and instead of reminiscing on the good times all it did was make the hurt worse.

4354,w5xrxr,INeedDatingAdviceLol,"For context, back in high school, there was this girl I knew from the local skating rink. I would go regularly, and she would be there a lot, so I wound up talking to her a lot, and we got pretty comfortable talking with each other. Some nights, we’d spend the whole night just sitting and talking to each other. It was really nice having that female companionship. 

I was very infatuated with her, I had built up this fantasy in my mind that of course didn’t reflect reality. As much as I wanted it to, it never worked out between us, she only saw me as a friend. Eventually, I stopped going there, and she moved away and got married and had a child, so that was the end of that.

I am 23 now, and have not had that level of intimacy with a girl again. I’ve had no girlfriends, or even close friendships with girls since then. I desire it badly and can’t get it anymore.

Anyways, I hadn’t even given her much thought at all in a while, until I had a dream about her this morning, I get these sometimes. I get to see her again, and I feel even closer to her in those dreams. Of course, I wake up and reality sets back in.

Before getting out of bed, I just cuddled my pillow for a while, pretending like it was her. It felt kind of good, but bittersweet, because there’s that nagging reality that what we had is forever buried in the past. I know this probably sounds so pathetic, I mean, this was a girl I knew when I was in high school after all.

I just haven’t been able to get her off my mind today, I keep thinking about her constantly. I looked at her social media a few times. It’s made me feel incredibly lonely.

I was fucking fine before this morning, I don’t even think about her that often.

I just feel so touch starved. I strongly desire female companionship like that again, it was a beautiful thing. It’s not just sex that I want, as nice as that would be. I just want to have an intimate loving relationship with a woman. I miss their soothing femininity, the way they can comfort you. I want to be able to cuddle, to hug, to caress, to fall asleep with. It’s something I strongly desire, and I sorely miss the kind of dynamic I had with this girl. 

Living life alone is hard. I am capable of it for sure, I’ve been managing all these years, I’m a pretty strong and resilient person, but damn, it sure would be nice to be loved by a girl…",2022-07-23 07:15:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609877876,5,/r/lonely/comments/w5xrxr/been_feeling_lonely_all_day_because_of_a_dream_i/,,0,1,Been feeling lonely all day because of a dream I had this morning.

4366,w5zq6e,Wayclarke," I realise a lot of us struggle in some way. If you're here you probably need a friend and I'm probably no exception either. Life has been tough for me a fair amount of times and because of chronic anhedonia I have some interests but I've never felt passionate enough to connect with people over them. So now I decided, what if that's not what I try to connect with people over? I find making a difference meaningful so maybe I can use my experience with overcoming certain obstacles to help someone else out? And maybe a friendship can grow from that.

I'm a swede living in southern Germany together with my girlfriend (whom I love very much so please be aware that there are no romantic prospects with me). In a month I'll start a Higher Vocational in Geographic Information Technology so that's where I'm headed, as a quick way to introduce myself.

Mental health areas I have experience in dealing with or overcoming:

* Harmful relationships
* The meaninglessness of life
* Anhedonia
* Chronic insomnia
* Struggling with education
* Loneliness
* Body image and eating disorders

Other areas of interest that I can talk about (does not mean I'm knowledgeable but that I would enjoy it):

* Geography
* City planning
* Feminism
* Veganism
* Gaming
* History
* Sociology
* (SFW) Role-playing (in the sense that I used to Role-Play in World of Warcraft years ago but never quite let go of it due to how it formed the social backbone of my younger years and was something I really enjoyed. I've never done TTRPGs but the idea of being a GM appeals to me some.)
* Sustainability
* Hiking and the outdoors

Of course I can talk about other things too but now you have a better idea of who I am. I'd like to talk to any gender, transitioned or nonbinary, 18 or above.

Do note that I can be a bit of a slow replier as I try to focus on completing my current studies (it's really tough for me) and in general I don't spend a lot of time chatting but I'm considered a very consistent person, on the other hand!",2022-07-23 09:17:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603382085,1,/r/lonely/comments/w5zq6e/sweger_28_m_offers_of_friendship_to_any_gender/,,0,0,SWE/GER 28 M - Offers of friendship to any gender

And for the last year I've been filled with insecurities and haven't been happy or able to communicate. 

When we moved to different cities, my girlfriend was quick to make friends and make a good and fun environment for herself. While I, being a loner, was barely managing to survive. Initially, I was actually happy for her and wished that she was able to enjoy her time as a college student. But slowly as she got more and more and adjusted to her life at college, I started feeling like we live in seperate worlds (which is kinda true I guess).

My girlfriend is incredibly trustworthy, loyal and caring. And I do not have any fear of being cheated on. But still I find it too hard to be in this relationship. I just don't feel like I'd ever be able to be a part of the world she has created for herself. Lately everything about her life there is starting to hurt me - the late night outings with her college group, the constant background noise of her roommates when I call, the constant buzzing of her phone when she comes to visit me.

I mean it’s been a whole global pandemic since we’ve spoken haha. I hope you were well during that time. Even though it was years without being friends we’ve been friends more years than we haven’t been. I remember when we were younger we promised each other we would be best friends forever and maybe that’s a promise we can’t keep but I hope we can at least be on good terms. Maybe go to Costa or McDonald’s and catch up and who knows maybe then we’ll be able to be kind of friends again. I know that’s a big hope but I think we could make it work. I still think of you from time to time and wonder how you are doing. I still remember when we were little and used to play jailbreak on roblox with eachother and have sleepovers and go to [after school club we used to go to together]. Maybe things won’t be like that now we’ve grown up and apart. But you know we have one year left of school (unless we go to 6th form lol) then we have the rest of our life with jobs and college or whatever we choose to do. So yeah we might not have time this time next year to build our friendship. And right now it’s the summer holidays so I think it’s the perfect time to catch up. I hope you read this far and consider rebuilding our friendship. If not that’s your choice. But if you do want to feel free to message me anytime and maybe we could go to Costa or McDonald’s like I said.”

“Have a good day”

4394,w62d3r,waytocope,"There's this girl I've been talking to for a while and I really really like her and at the beginning I think she liked me, too. I got hopeful that someone could like me for who I am and no leave. But recently she's barely been talking to me but is active on social media, which is fine but it hurts a little. Recently she made a new friend or just started talking to them more and flirting and stuff, and it's just reinforcing my belief that no only is she distancing herself from me, she's trying to replace me entirely. Without telling me anything. I know we weren't official but we still talked about living with each other and having fun and dating and kissing and stuff. I'm debating whether I want to confront her and see if she really doesn't like me anymore, because a few months ago she fell into a depressive episode and told me all the reasons she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me and that we shouldn't be together in that way, but later said it was just because at the time she felt nothing. But she hasn't said anything to me again because she just hasn't been talking to me much. So I want to ask her if she doesn't like me and if she likes the other person more, but what if it's all in my head and it actually ends up making her not talk to me anymore because me thinking that is weird?

Around the time the pandemic started I distanced myself from all my real life friends because we just couldn't find times to hang out and we've lost contact. After that happened I didn't try to make any friends online or anything because the few times I had done that they stopped talking to me and basically discarded me from their lives. So I was scared to start talking to Her because I was worried she'd get bored of me and leave. And now I think that's happening. And it's reminding me why I'll always be alone and should just accept that and stop trying.",2022-07-23 12:00:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606121627,1,/r/lonely/comments/w62d3r/fighting_with_myself/,,0,0,fighting with myself

4397,w62mlv,IchBinNabha,"I'm a very akward person. Most of the time someone asks me something or talks to me about something I don't know what to say, my mind goes completely blank and the most I can probably say is ""damn"" or ""nice"" or something stupid, I seem really bland or emotionless probably cause I dont know what to say and if it turns out to be even more akward if i say it. 
I also am pretty bad at my mother language, I don't really know why though. Maybe one reason is that my teacher never properly taught us the language and only made us memorize for tests, which is probably why my friends are also bad at it. But since I am bad at my own language I can't talk with other kids or teens in my area that well. I feel I am really stupid for not even knowing my own language properly. 
My friends dont really like me much either, I dont like to hang out with them as often since many of them do some messed up things in my opinion. Yet I still do feel really lonely when they hang out together and I really can't relate with them much. Sometimes they just want to straight up ignore me no matter what. Nowadays I hate even opening insta or discord cause I just feel left out when I see them.

It is fine though, I don't like them much anyways, but I do need to know how to NOT be akward and be able to actually speak things.

4403,w63f3m,BrokenBlossom77,"I (22F) have had a laughably tragic dating life. I know I’m young, but I’ve dated many people and no one ever seems to want to commit to a relationship with me….

When I ask them, they never say that I’m the reason they don’t want to pursue something, it’s always something with *them* or the circumstances. For example:

1. My HS gf cheated on me with multiple ppl and was in love with her straight best friend

2. My first college fling: Talked to this one guy for 2 months, things seemed fine, then one day he cuts me off because he has a new girlfriend….


3. Talked to this slightly older one guy in college on and off for a couple years before giving him a chance. We went on dates, texted, he took my virginity, and things seemed good for a few months…then he ghosted me/my birthday plans and cut me off because he had just gotten into a long distance relationship…this one hurt quite a bit because we were friends for a couple years 

4. Went through a series of short lived flings  after this. This period lasted like…a year

5. Talk to this one guy exclusively for like 9 months. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship with me yet but wanted to date me in the future. His reasoning was relationship anxiety and the fact that he was busy with his new job. He would get super passive aggressive if I brought up talking to other guys. Every time I tried to tell him I don’t think were compatible he’d get upset and change his behavior for like 2 weeks before reverting back. Never asked me to be his girlfriend but we were exclusive, went on dates, bought eachother gifts….yeah. It eventually fizzled out and I moved away.


6. (Present situation) About 3 months later I move to a new city and start talking to another guy. He wanted us to talk exclusively too because “he doesn’t compete”. I’m not used to being told this so early on but I apprehensively went with it. We went on dates, texted constantly, would have sleepovers, he would kiss me at my doorstep and get sad when I fell asleep before him….yesterday we had another date/sleepover and he kissed me and dropped me off. 10 minutes later he texts me that he doesn’t think we should be a thing because he’s going to be busy with school, working out, and work, doesn’t feel romance with me, but was also afraid of “simping” for me (his exact words). This only lasted a month but I’m pretty bummed. I feel blindsided but also embarrassed. I feel like im just not worth pursuing something with.


….I would really like to be in a relationship and experience love but I feel like I’m incapable of being loved. I want to fix myself but I don’t even know what’s wrong because no one will be real with me. On paper I feel like I seem interesting: I think I look fine (scroll through my profile to see what I look like), I have a good job (I do research at a prestigious hospital), I have hobbies that aren’t just media consumption (hiking, cooking, crocheting), and I’ve always been told I have a cute/funny personality by people. I started researching attachment theory and I keep getting anxious or avoidant attachment depending on the test. Trying to get into therapy but the waitlist I’m on is weeks long……idk what to do at this point…",2022-07-23 12:57:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597761271,3,/r/lonely/comments/w63f3m/im_in_a_new_city_just_had_another_failed_dating/,,1,5,"I’m in a new city, just had another failed dating attempt, I feel alone and unlovable…."

4408,w63x9i,Complete-Ad-9287,"As the title of my post would suggest I love my mother since she was the one that raised I and my siblings as a single mother; however sometimes she just gets on my nerves. For instance, recently my mother forced I and my siblings to clean the house because in her worlds, ""you f\*\*king kids can't do your chores"" or ""your so damn lazy"" and my favourite \[aimed at me\] ""no wonder your grades are so bad, you can't even do your chores properly"". First of all yes, sometimes I don't do my chores either out of laziness or the fact that I contribute very little to the mess in the house; counter to what my mother would have anyone know is that I don't make that much of a mess rather she and the rest of my family make 95% whilst I contribute 2.5% \[the rest is mold due to winter and lack of heating in my house and my gutters not being cleared\]. Secondly yes, I don't get the best grades \[I'm a C or B range student so about 60-80 on average\] yet she attended school in the fucking 80s in another country \[she went to NZ for high school in the 80s, while I've been in the Australian school system for nearly 12 years\] and because she and alongside my two eldest siblings were A students she expects me to reach those heights. Yet she doesn't take in account I still have Autism \[personally for me sitting on my rear end for an hour straight is the most conducive for learning; I'm a physical learner\]. She also likes to go at it with me spending time with my friends online; because she thinks that spending all my spare time studying rather then setting some time aside to grow my friendships with people I've known for 4-6 years isn't important, then again her best friends are her siblings so that might explain her mentality. Thirdly I'm apparently lazy...well sometimes I do become complacent when doing things however rather then judge me by my actions she lumps me with my siblings; essentially if they screw up it all of a sudden smothers onto me \[note: I'm Polynesian, Polynesians are more collective/communal so that's where my mother's collective judgement comes from. And the worst thing of all her tirade and forcing me to clean was over mold that grew \[as mentioned before we don't have a heater and our gutter isn't clean so moisture is trapped in our house along with heat, which are conditions for mold to grow\]. Honestly there's much more to talk about but I'm about ready just to cut myself off from my Mum if she continues to act as if my life was some sort of blight in her life.",2022-07-23 13:22:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642478034,3,/r/lonely/comments/w63x9i/i_love_my_mother_but_she_annoys_me_sometimes/,,0,0,I love my mother but she annoys me sometimes

So... As u can tell from the title, I'm a bit of a people pleaser. I like this guy, We're friends. I've explained to him in the past that I've liked him and even told him that because of those feelings; I feel uncomfortable being his friend. Still the convos with him haven't really gotten anywhere, because I end up feeling guilty about the fact that I can't really be his friend because I just don't see him as a friend, since he gets sad about it (which is understandable). So I cave in and decide to remain friends because I don't want to hurt his feelings and because I care about him. I feel motivated to block him because I just want to get over the feelings I have for him and move on and I think that'd be the easiest way for me to do so... But at the same time I'd feel guilty and am not sure if it'd be a mean thing for me to do.

Fortunately, back in high school I managed to make myself a friend who I shared a lot of stuff with, we had the same activities, passions and sense of humor, we had tons of private jokes 'cause we were the only ones that had some niche hobbies which is why we quickly became best friends.

That period of my life was wonderful as I felt I finally found a true friend, unfortunately, the time to go to college finally arrived, and we went to complete different universities. I tried keeping in touch but we eventually got too busy with our own lives and studies.

Yesterday, boredom was more intense than usual, so I decided to send a text without hoping for any response, but they did answer, and we had so much stuff to say, they're back in town for the month and we've decided to go hang out sometime to remember the good old times, a time when everything was simpler and so fun.

4492,w6eoo1,Shphrd_Flln,"Hello, I don't know you, but as you're reading this know that you're the first people I'm ever openly speaking to. With so much on my mind, it's not easy to begin. Therefore, I will try to keep it short and simple - I am lonely and pretty much alone, too (What a cliché I am).

I think I always have been kind of a loner, but since a high school graduation 4 years ago it's gotten so much worse. Back then, I still had my best friend from the same class, at least (still could never be completely honest with her). However, in 2019 I had faced some problems at uni which made me want to avoid society even more than I did up to that point. Because of that (and some other things related to her as a person) I decided to burn the bridges. She had tried to get to me for the one final time in 2020, but I told her I never wanted to talk to her again. Believe me, I had my reasons to do so then. Every time I miss her I suddenly realize I probably did the right thing. With her gone, there went the only single person in my life I've ever been closer to. She was, quite possibly, the only friend I've ever had in my life. The other people, before and after, were just acquaintances, classmates, uni mates, colleagues, but not friends.

I am lonely and alone. But this ""story"" is just one piece of a big jigsaw puzzle that has shaped my loneliness. There's so much more to it. I just can't put it all together because the thoughts in my head keep blocking each other. This ""story"" is just a prelude, it seems.

The reason of my loneliness, I think, mostly lies in the fact that I am soon 24 years old and I have never had a relationship, never experienced love, never kissed, never held hands...

(I am sorry, I can't type at this point anymore... It's all so complex, there's just too much I want to say, but I don't know how to put it all together, where to begin...)

I'm sorry I've wasted your time.",2022-07-23 21:30:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1633202459,15,/r/lonely/comments/w6eoo1/this_post_will_probably_go_unnoticed_just_like_me/,,0,12,This post will probably go unnoticed (just like me)
4493,w6erzm,TAHINAZ,"I’m at the point in my life where it’s necessary for me to be a hermit. I go to work and have family I sometimes see, but I have no other contact with people. 

For the most part, this doesn’t bother me. I was a homeschooled only child out in the country. I went to public high school, but had social anxiety and lived too far into the country to make or visit friends. Same with college. I commuted instead of living on campus. 

I managed to get married, but divorced after 11 years, due to abuse. Now I live alone. 

I’ve never had friends, and I say that without exaggeration. I don’t know how. Honestly, I don’t feel like I should try too hard. 

I’ve always felt driven to write a novel. I’ve been trying since I was a kid, but fear and procrastination has stood in my way. I chip away at it bit by bit, but am frustrated by my lack of progress. I feel like I’m pushing a boulder up a hill. I know at this point in my life, God is isolating me so I can finally focus and get it done. No distractions. No giving myself away to a man or trying to be someone I’m not to attract friends who would only monopolize my time. It won’t always be like this. But for now, I need to be alone. 

Still, I feel sorry for myself sometimes. I daydream about having someone beside me who values me and wants to know who I am. Someone who appreciate my weirdness. Someone to share life’s burden. Someone to make me feel like a woman, or even just a worthwhile human. Someone to make me feel valued. 

I know I can’t rely on another person for those things. People are imperfect, and I’ve gone through a lot of abuse. I know what I really need is the love of God and self. But it’s so hard sometimes. Sometimes I relish the silence…but sometimes, like now, I feel so alone.",2022-07-23 21:34:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610300809,4,/r/lonely/comments/w6erzm/bummed_about_being_a_hermit/,,0,2,Bummed about being a hermit

4498,w6f2zc,Invisibleman021183,"I talked to people and even the ones who are lonely have outlets to vent about their loneliness to help them feel better. You have someone who has empathy and listens to you. I wish I had that but loneliness here is this massive taboo that you can't talk about. Maybe people who have friends can talk about it but I don't have friends or any other outlet. Professionals? Most of them didn't want to hear about it. They would tell me the same things I could be told on Reddit. Go out, say nice things about you, don't talk about yourself in a negative way are some of the things they say. In what is my reality, they don't want to go out of their comfort zone to have empathy for a bad guy like me. I don't mean a bad guy who's cool. I mean a bad guy who has nothing. Those hotlines made it worse because they would get mad if I told them the advice they gave me didn't help me. Maybe you are different but do you have places to vent to about loneliness? I wish I had someone IRL who is caring, listens, and has empathy. It's depressing that no one is out there IRL since I've been talked down to from most of the people I vented to. I think most of them don't believe me. When I say I'm almost 40 and have had no relationships, or sex, they think the worst about me. Probably words like misogynist, or the dreaded I word comes to their minds because I give off the vibe. Even when I say I don't blame women since I wouldn't go near myself, they assume the worst and you can't help someone you don't like. I'm a bad person but I'm not some hateful monster like most people think. I do have hate but towards myself, not other people. Sure, other people have said some pretty bad things to me but that's because I deserved it.",2022-07-23 21:48:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642202607,7,/r/lonely/comments/w6f2zc/im_jealous_of_people_who_have_outlets_to_vent_to/,,0,3,I'm jealous of people who have outlets to vent to about being lonely
4499,w6f7e3,Boarspoons,"Let me explain a bit with some backstory. So a couple weeks ago I went to with my family to the city. We were enjoying ourselves and for the first time I noticed myself not caring. And by not caring I mean like pressuring myself to talk to women I find attractive. Which I would never do, along with seeing someone attractive with a partner. I would always get jealous but this time. I just didn’t care, and I was legitimately enjoying myself as a single bruh. I don’t know if my brain was like “this fool will never talk to girls let me just make him accept he’ll be lonely forever” or if my brain said “there’s more to life then dating”. I did throw myself into dating apps for the last couple of years but I would always come out empty handed or with someone who just screams red flags all the way. Nothing wrong with having some problems and needing a support group or person. But some of the people I met on the dating apps won’t want to get help or want to admit that they are with struggles know what I mean? But now I guess I’m lonely and I like it.",2022-07-23 21:53:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647316552,1,/r/lonely/comments/w6f7e3/idk_if_i_subconsciously_accepted_the_fact_that/,,0,0,Idk if I subconsciously accepted the fact that I’ll be alone forever or just decided to not care.

4509,w6gbnq,Xenerzone,"Well to start off, I recently became pretty depressed about me being alone and pretty lonely this past year. I recently came home from a crappy Erasmus project in the hopes that I would eventually find some opportunities for me for the future and most importantly new friends/acquaintances with whom I can still keep in touch even after this thing would end, but a classroom friend of mine (that I will name Mike) which I kinda hate at this point made this worse made me feel like shit and I couldn't approach anyone the way I wanted and would mock me for my crappy jokes. Anyways to get back on track, during this 3 weeks of social torture for me I found out that a pretty close guy to me (he is a guy that sits next to me at school which I will name Bob) with whom I felt I could share my deep emotions and thoughts about anything and everything and even took advice from so I could maybe ease my social anxiety which has taken much of my self-esteem to even go out to the groceries or something like that well... he isn't that much of a patient person and that quote ""I can't babysit you everytime..."" which makes sense but for me it kinda hurts in a way (I know this sounds selfish as hell believe me I do too but can't help it) and that he ""can't be always and everytime compasionate to me because everyone has its limits"" which I understand, but for me this hurt a lot which shouldn't but it does, not to mention that during that legit hell of a ""mobility"" as the teachers called it he and most of the others who participated would just meet at the biggest room in the hotel and drink all night listening to music at max which bothered me even more since I aint a junky (firstly they weren't that bad but then shit went down to the point teachers caught on to them once but that's it only once and never again and they continued even further and even worse then other days) and so time went on and me and him would switch rooms since the first one had a broken communist style shower and that's when the room we were given was the new place at which the other could gather and drink until they were dead, initially he would respect my decision not to let them in, but because some guys manipulated me into such manner as to let them do their thing (even though I knew it was gonna be bad). So there I was alone in some corner, people talking about stuff I didn't even understand, events and other things, some got drunk as hell and I had to help them either go to the bathroom or send them to their rooms and so on, they didn't even respected their promises to leave when I told them to, some were pissed because I kinda insulted them for insulting me first when telling them to get the hell out. Fast forward a bit in time, during the 10th day the shower in that room broke for some reason and we had to switch rooms again, coincidentally the electrical installation in the room where Mike was and another dude was got busted and the teachers had no choice but to move the 4 of us into the same room (the teachers didn't have a choice since no other rooms were available that time). So the moment Mike said ""The vote of the majority wins"" when he heard we were all moving there destroyed me. For the rest of the project I had to sleep in other rooms so that Mike, Bob and everyone could go and have fun while I didint want to take part in any of that since it was just disgusting for me to see junkies getting high on vodka, whiskey, tequila and beer combined. Since that day I would spend most of the time in the reception since I had the best wifi there and I would just stay there and play games to pass the time, people would come by asking what I was doing but nothing more, so that was my life during that, and the only thing that kept me together were my parents to which I was keen to call almost everytime to not feel awkward since I don't talk too many people there and to fill that void of loneliness, Bob wouldn't even ask ""why are you sad? What is wrong?"", just nothing, he would come by but that's it, since the most important crap to him was his love towards a girl which liked him first but then decided not to and he is still going for her, I even gave him advice to just live his live and love can be achieved anytime not just here and now (he had gfs in the past so he knew well), but as I thought of myself helping him and seeing him tired of helping me got me questioning ""Am I that selfish of a person for wanting compassion all the time? Am I that selfish of a person for wanting validation and getting approval of any decision that I do?"" (Yeah this question might seem weird but since little I used to and still do ask my parents if I should do X or Y, and I know I should grow up already but I cant help it sometimes). And then the usual lonely acts, pretend you are fine, fake every smile every laugh until it's all over. When I got back home I still couldn't get over the things that happened then, I still think of how incompetent I am to keep a conversation afloat, of how boring I am, of how skinny I am, of how I dont have the ambition to change that even I want and can do it. I would have days where I couldn't sleep and just cry about the whole ordeal and about myself, constantly reminding myself that if people don't deserve me then I don't deserve them, and I believe that if something doesn't happen to me or I dont happen to solve this issue even though I am trying, well... I will just quit, I will isolate myself even further, limit every contact with every human being, 4 years of constant bullying in secondary school, one year of hope in high school then another year of realization that high school while people don't bully me they still make me feel like shit from time to time and make it impossible for me to learn social skills. The only thing I got left in this godforsaken world are unimportant unhelpful stuff which are games and some books, and 2 best friends, me and loneliness.

I've always been extremely introverted with poor social skills, and generally I don't have the same hobbies as most other people my age, all of which has led to nothing but mockery and rejection. I've barely ever had any real friends, aside from my online friends and people who I thought were my friends but stopped talking to me over time because I guess I'm just not interesting enough. This is how my entire life has been, and it's only gotten worse over time. It even got to the point last school year where I just decided to start doing online school at home because being in an environment full of thousands of people my age who do nothing but reject me and regard me as basically being nonhuman became too miserable to bare.

At this point all I ever do is sit at home by myself feeling miserable. That's all I can do. I have come to the conclusion that I'm unlovable and that I'm never going to be accepted by society. I have to live with the knowledge that most other people my age have a positive reflection on their social life and I've barely ever had one. They all have large friend groups and hang out all of the time, they all have girlfriends/boyfriends, they've all done impressive things with their lives, and here I am, having had/done none of that, and I've given up all expectations that I ever will. I'm never gonna have accepting friends in real life who will actually stick with me, I'm never gonna get a girlfriend because every girl that's ever met me thought I was a freak, and at this point, I've lost almost all motivation to achieve any of my goals in life, because it feels pointless knowing that any success I achieve is still gonna leave me unloved and rejected by society and everyone.

4598,w6pnop,DomesticExpat,"Surrounded by people on a daily basis at work but I feel the loneliest when I'm around them. Never being invited to the after work girl's night out (which hurts even more being trans), always just being the person they go to for work related things. I practically have no friends that I see regularly. All my close friends are online and far away. My most recent dating experience was terrible, had an amazing time with her on a date but got ghosted yet again. A friend that promised to see me one more time before they headed back to school overseas didn't keep their promise. Time and time again, I feel like the world is moving on without me. Like if I suddenly stopped existing, nobody would bat an eye, everything would keep going. Nobody seems to want anything to do with me. I lose my temper more at work, which probably only pushes people away from me more because they think I'm just some bitch that hates her job and can't get along with people. On my days off, I only have myself to spend them with, while coworkers are living through their best years with people that care about them.

I need someone now more than ever. I'm falling apart and feel like there's never going to be a way out. I just want to matter to someone, be enough for them to want to hang out with me, and enjoy their time with me. I want to matter to someone enough that they want to be with me. I don't want to be alone my whole life but that feels like how things will turn out for me. Being the chick that's always alone. I don't want my loneliness to take my life away. I struggle to find the will to live a lot, the only thing keeping me from ending it is because I'm a coward, and because of that very small possibility that someone is out there for me and that I will one day meet her.

4607,w6r4l4,PozitronCZ,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not native English speaker and I have never written such a long text in English before. I'm sure there may be (and will be) a lot of grammar mistakes.

My story is long. I was always a ""weirdo"". At school, I was always the weird kid who was bullied by others and having no friends. Looking at it retrospectively I made a lot of mistakes. I was avoiding people because I was scared if I talk to somebody it may result in another wave of bullying. And I wasn't really interested either. I was always a nerd who was in computer science and stuff. When at the end of my primary school (in my country for kids 6 – 15 years old - nine grades) when my male classmates were staring to date girls I was doing my computer stuff. I thought why would I lose my time with others. What a stupid of me.

Then I started my secondary school (four grades). I still didn't think about talking to others so much, but I was started to change when I was about 17. The secondary school I was attending was a electronic/computer science school and in your class there were no girls. Literary the whole school had about 1000 students which only about 50 was females. But I still didn't consider this matters important. Soon after I graduated.

When I'm looking on it now I clearly see I completely wasted the era of my life when one is supposed to learn the principles of socializing.

After the secondary school I gave a try at a university but I failed. It was just too difficult. Also during those two years I didn't make any social contacts that are worth mentioning. I was still the weirdo.

And then I got to work. My first full time job was at McDonald's. I considered it being ""temporary"" but at the end I was there at full-time for about 18 months (and I still occasionally work there as part-timer). At the work for me it was first time after YEARS I actually have a chance to talk to a girl (or rather I say woman) of my age. It may sound crazy but at my secondary school there were no girls and the same goes for the university. And for me having no friends at all it really meant I haven't casually talked to a girl for maybe five or six years.

I remember how clueless I was. I was (and I think I still am) an overgrown child with no clue how many things in adult world works. One day the manager sent me to wipe the floor. They tell me they want me to wipe the floor at locker rooms. Both men and women lockers. I remember how I was uncertain and how it feels just not right. I'm a guy, so I really shouldn't enter women lockers. It was very awkward for me but I got to use of it after some time.

And then the weirdest thing in my life happened. One of the female workers here somehow showed interest in me. I still don't understand how it happened and even what actually happened. Well as expected our interaction last for about one month. Then we ""break up"" without even officially saying it. I think the guilty was on both sides. Surely, she quickly realized I'm an incompetent idiot who have absolutely no idea how to treat her. Honestly, I was scared. And it also somehow doesn't feel right to me. It was something I was thinking one day may happen but when it was there I didn't know what to do. I was really scared, I was scared about how I'm supposed to tell somebody I have a girlfriend. How I'm supposed to tell my parents the big news that their weird son who never ever shown any interest in women suddenly got a girlfriend.

Another thing is I think I didn't fall in love with her. I liked her (until I found out she isn't that great as she looks at the beginning) but I don't thing I actually fallen in love with her. But really I do not even know what ""falling in love"" really is since I have probably never experienced that. I'm not even sure if I'm even capable of falling in love anymore.

Not much happened between us. We hold hand for few times and I received my first (and last) kiss in my life. Nothing more.

When we break up she already ended her job (in reality - she was fired) and I never hear about her or saw her ever again.

This was in 2016. Shortly after this episode I also got a new work which I have until today. I work as a electro-mechanist for a railway company. After all the years my life doesn't change. I'm still a loner, with almost no friends (I have few friends, but we are all ""weirdos""). I realized how bad my life is it the spring 2020. Everyone was talking about how they can't go to the pub with friends, and they have to go somewhere else but for me literary nothing changed.

Now I'm almost 31. I feel bad. Lost in life. Lacking motivation to improve myself. Because there in nobody to applause it. And it gets worse. I remember my grandmother telling me being alone doesn't hurt that much when one is young but become painful when one gets old. It is already painful for me. I do not understand myself. I feel badly because I do not have anyone who cares about me (except my parents) but I also can't imagine myself being in relationship with someone. It's a weird idea for me. I have a coworker who is two years older than me who have wife and three kids. I know it's totally normal to have a family in this age but I just can't imagine myself in the role of being ""a father"". I look just absurd to me. I guess I'm still an overgrown child after all. And I will probably always be.

4614,w6rzsp,consistent_clownery,"I tried (keyword: tried) to turn a new leaf freshman year, and thought I’d be more confident and outgoing. I’d push myself more out of my comfort zone. But I spent the entirety of my freshman year of college online, so that went out the window after the first week and meeting new people/making new friends became extremely difficult.

But it seems everybody took the opportunity freshman year to actually connect online- which makes sense, I think covid really helped with that end. Come sophomore year, it’s my first time in person living on campus and I struggled to make any friends, or any connections at all. And now all my old friends from high school I barely talk to anymore.

I can’t tell if it’s because I’m not trying enough (or at all), or if I’m just that fucking awkward. I’ve tried talking and reaching out but it seems like I only ever make people feel uncomfortable. But it also feels like when I’m trying to be sociable/outgoing I feel like such a fake. Maybe people can sense that? Is it so obvious?

I don’t think I was ever that great at socializing to begin with, but I had friends at some point. Idk it just feels kinda shitty when you don’t have anybody to talk to. Everyone is branching out, and finding their groups and people they feel comfortable with and I’m just kinda there. (Funnily enough, one of my old friends used to wear an “anti-social” shirt, was the type to say “ew people” but even they have a new friend group)

I barely talked to or hung out with anybody since I got home for the summer. The one person I’ve seen this break asked me about my college experience and all I could do was admit I’ve done nothing but work and have no friends. It was so fucking embarrassing to admit that. 

The idea of not making any friends for my entire time in college is depressing, but honestly looks like the route I’m heading.

At this point, I don’t feel close to anyone at school, none of my old friends, and most certainly not my family.

Sometimes, I think about cutting myself off from everyone entirely. Tell people to lose my number, delete all my socials, and just disappear. It’s not like it’d matter.

Tdlr: I’m in college, have no friends, and I’m sad about it. 

This was mostly just me ranting when it gets really bad. Most times I just try to distract myself, but I’ve been having a hard time sleeping since my thoughts keep me up.

so im 22f and have no friends. not someone who says they have no friends but has a few, i have 0. some days i dont even know why i have a phone. its empty.

bc of my disability i dont work, but i live with my mom and brother. i dont have a relationship with my brother, and they both work all the time. im at home alone constantly just wandering around. i would go outside but it just feels like it makes me feel worse seeing people especially together and happy. i have pets, but they are more independent animals that dont really want to sit with you and listen to your problems (especially since one is deaf lol).

i am in a relationship but we only see eachother on weekends and im just sitting here waiting to be told its over and im not good enough or something. maybe thats just my brain being mean but idk. i did have to see a mental health team at my house for \*reasons\* but have had 0 follow up. he works weekdays without connection too, so again, those hours, i am alone even through messages. 

i have always been close to my sister. she now got a job and is constantly travelling. shes never close to home, shes always outside so her phone is never connected, it goes days without sending or receiving a message. we always shared a room or if we werent together we were always messaging or playing games, but now shes gone too. im glad shes finally happy but i want to be selfish and have her with me all the time again.

i just feel so loney and lost it makes my heart feel like it aches. i dont know really how to make girl - friends, i had a lot in high school but that was me pretending to be into makeup and stuff i dont like. now i am into gaming, (WoW, cod, horror games etc), manga, nature, walking, and any man seems to want something sexual.  idk, friendships also feel like so much work. i complain im lonely but a lot of days find it so hard to keep up with relationships and get very overwhelmed (mental health problems too lol)",2022-07-24 10:01:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626483282,8,/r/lonely/comments/w6s5nq/lonely_lost_in_life_siblings_moving_away/,,0,6,"lonely, lost in life, siblings moving away"

I caught myself eavesdropping on the people in front of me, listening to their analysis and takes on the film and felt so fucking lonely that I had no one to share my reaction with. 

Every time I go to the movies solo these days I can’t help but reminisce about all the times what it felt like to be there with someone who’d hold my hand throughout…put their arms around me…kisses here and there. I miss the physical affection the most tbh. How the theater room feels so much less cold when you’re wrapped up in the warmth of someone else. I can’t remember what it feels like to have another hand hold your own.

I met someone recently on here that I thought I connected with but of course, he went ghost. It never lasts. Feels like nothing good ever lasts. Now I feel worse and I really wish he never reached out to me to begin with.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

4639,w6wrhh,pompompopcorn,"I 23f feel lonely most of the time even though have a really good life. I have a family, a bf, two cats and a roof over my head I amb grateful for.

But sometimes it just hits right in the middle of my chest. That horrible feeling of being alone in the world and being empty inside. I can't breathe and start to cry uncontrollably feeling far away from everyone. And then, when I feel this way I just think I'm an horrible person because I should be happy and grateful for what I have in my life.

I talked to my therapist about it and she asked me to analyse what happened when I start feeling it, what exactly do I feel and what are my thoughts.
It's just not that easy. Right now, with tears running down my face, I would not be able to express how I feel or why besides of I just feel empty.",2022-07-24 14:23:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,,13,/r/lonely/comments/w6wrhh/i_shouldnt_feel_this_way/,,0,8,I shouldn't feel this way
4640,w6wt4s,Temporary_Suspect592,"And then last night, she told me if I don’t do what she says she won’t celebrate my bday at all and that my very presence annoys her. I guess the way she treated me for the past few days just came snowballing all of a sudden and so I answered back and told her sure that’s fine. She usually celebrates my bday by buying me a cake that I can’t really eat and serve me customary noodle dish. (While my brother, gets to have a full blown party and every time I do all the work. Doing Dishes and basically slaving myself.) and well that’s fine with me cause a one point that’s just the norm within our family.

But then I don’t know why I never feel like she appreciates me or love me. Even though I’ve always done what she wants and do everything for her like for example whenever it’s her bday, I always go all out. Like literally go all out. My dad doesn’t have a romantic bone in his body and my brother is doing charity work to his gf’s family 🙄(basically, he’s their cash cow. My brother is gullible and doesn’t see it) so he can’t even spare one candle for our mom’s bday and yet he still gets the best treatment, while I get his scraps.  At one point, I was mad and confronted her about her having favorites and then she got mad and rebuked me saying that she doesn’t have favorites and she treats us, equally. Like yeah right. And then I got tired of arguing and telling her she’s lying and well I really thought I accepted the fact it’s normal for her to treat me like this and I can never be cared and loved for like my brother. I thought I’m alright and used to it already but then when she told me she won’t celebrate my bday, I just got tired like why am I even trying at this point? Why did I have to feel so sad about what she said. So, I realized maybe I’m still trying to get her  approval and love. And then today is my bday, the day is about to end and not once did I ever receive a bday greeting from my mom. My dad gave me money and ask if I even wanted him to get me cake and then I saw my mom and heard her say, it’s my fault that she had to cancel her plans of eating out, to this fancy place that my brother suggested and well cause he wants to try it. Did they ask me if I wanted to go there? Noooope. So suddenly it felt all cumbersome. 

I’m both sad and angry at myself for having any expectations and well if I can get my mom and dad a full a$$ catering, a whole roasted pig and designer stuff during their bdays, then I can also just celebrate my birthday on my own. So, I ordered whatever stuff I could immediately have and delivered it to my room. 

Which, btw, is extremely stupid I just feel emptier than ever, seeing all these food in front of me now is making me lonely. I guess this experience will just add up to one more reason why to hate birthdays and my existence. Like really, if there’s a God or something, I wouldn’t have minded if I was born as a rock or some cactus out there or sometimes I  wish I’m adopted but I’m not so….😬🫥😂

4659,w6zgwt,UnlikeAvy,"What happens when the attempts to build a foundation around ourselves fail? When we’ve carefully sculpted our structures, built on social interaction, positive habits, painted with hobbies and general distraction from the constant noise, the painful reminder of what is outside these walls? It just doesn’t work for some people. They can’t efficiently absorb the illusion of happiness like a water soluble over-the-counter cure for what ails us. A bleak, hopeless outlook on life remains when quality of life should have improved, given the effort that went in to change the tide, to brace for the storm, to experience what it is to live in spite of the turbulence. Why is there sadness in the face of success? Why is there grief atop one’s achievements? This feeling pulls you six feet under. You fight to climb out of an early grave.

This makes my self esteem go even lower, I don't like going to bars and meetups since im very self conscious about my body (which is total shit) not to mention feeling ashamed of myself to go to the gym and have a trainer help me with this issue. For the past year I tried to talk to people online, be it on games, or even here, but well... to no avail, most chats are short lived and I cant seem to keep conversations afloat even though i try but its never good enough. I don't like talking about this issue to my parents since i feel like they don't fully understand my situation and probably never will and insist that life is full of people and that i will meet someone somehow, yet these kind of words don't really work on me anymore. This is my second year of high school and now I feel betrayed by mostly all my classmates and while during the first year I would talk to most of them and finding common topics to talk about, well nowadays we don't really speak as frequent as we used to and that pains me a lot, yet I cant do anything to change that. Maybe I'm just too selfish in my goal to find compassionate and understanding people, promising myself that even if I don't find anyone during college then I will just quit finding people and isolate myself from others because i learnt the hard way that things which don't work just don't work and that's it.",2022-07-24 16:47:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642195667,3,/r/lonely/comments/w6zyt8/i_am_tired_of_hopelessly_trying_to_socialize/,,0,0,I am tired of hopelessly trying to socialize

4706,w75yhf,myASMRisHOT_,"I’m 15 and for the past two years or so, I’ve been feeling terrible. Before I got into high school I was pretty okay with my social life, but I soon became jealous of the friendships people had formed around me. I began feeling separated from my friend group, finding no joy in their company. I started to hate my friends and the people around me, the smallest flaw caused me to hate them as if they had betrayed me in some way. 

Luckily, this phase was cut short due to the pandemic and I began to appreciate the people around me more. I saw relationships fall apart and friendships break and thrive. I had gotten into a relationship myself, I was under the impression that a high school student should have a girlfriend/boyfriend/SO. So when a girl confessed to me, I accepted despite not feeling much towards her. The relationship started ed out okay, it was corny and very cringe but felt right at the time. We would cuddle and kiss all the time, she’d come over to my house so we could cuddle up and watch movies together. I was happy with this for a while, I felt like I’d unlocked a new part of life, like I’d bought a DLC. It felt great, and I was happy. 

The relationship soon began to fall apart, however. Although it survived through the pandemic, the commitment I had to the relationship began to fade until I was happy when she wasn’t with me. I knew I had to end it, but getting the courage to was difficult. I was very aware of her emotions, and hurting her was something I wasn’t ready to do. 

Our eventual end was to happen in math class, through a note. She said she wanted to go back to being friends, I was overjoyed and immediately agreed. She didn’t speak to me for a while afterwards, she looked at me with a sort of hatred and disgust. 

It’s been around two years since it ended, and I’ve noticed how much of an awful person she is. I’m glad it ended, but it caused some damage. I got a taste of affection, I became addicted and have now grown desperate for someone to love. I’ve done some pretty weird things to relieve myself of the loneliness I feel, turning to boyfriend audios on YouTube. I feel ashamed to watch them, but they help me forget about my sad reality. 

It physically hurts to realise I’m alone sometimes, I get a sharp pain in my chest and feel my body become heavy. It’s gotten pretty bad recently, I see couples around me and it hurts to see them so happy and content with their lives. It makes me wonder if I’ll ever find love. I don’t know if I’m pretty or likeable, I don’t know if people will like my personality or love me for who I truly am. And what makes this whole thing worse, is that I’ve got severe anxiety and possibly autism. 

I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling this at my age. I’m only 15, I’m going to collage in 2 years and I’m here worrying about my love life rather than focusing on things like studying. I don’t know how to get rid of these feelings, I can’t tell anyone about them as no one really knows about any of this. I’m unsure if I’ll be able to stop feeling like this, I think getting into a relationship would solve my problems but it’s a lot easier said than done. 

I said to myself that when I leave high school, I will find myself a partner. But I’m not sure if I can wait that long. I’d love to have a partner, I think I’ve got a lot to offer when it comes to a relationship. But I’m doubtful and awkward so finding someone will be difficult. I kind of wish someone would just appear in my room one day.  

I don’t know how long I can go on like this, the feeling is making me depressed and living is getting harder. With little motivation to keep me going and nothing to come home to after a hard day, living seems pointless and I feel helpless.",2022-07-24 21:06:47,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597048037,6,/r/lonely/comments/w75yhf/im_getting_desperate_and_it_hurts_a_lot/,,0,1,I’m getting desperate and it hurts a lot

Deep down, I feel like I’m not a terrible human; I think I have a good personality, I’m interested in a lot of things, I’ve become semi successful professionally (I got to $40k/yr with nothing more than a HS diploma and I recently started freelance writing about sports, which I love). But it’s like, if I’ve gone 32 years without finding any girl who thinks I’m worth a shit, how could I possibly be a good person? What good are all of my individual accomplishments if I have nobody to share life with?

I feel like a selfish piece of shit every time I go to my friends’ weddings because l look around and it hits me that I’ll never get to have this. I’ll never get to have that happiness. All of my friends are either in serious relationships or married and some are beginning to have children, another thing I want some day. I’m the only single one (they don’t even give me a plus one because they know it’s a waste) and it’s fucking embarrassing. I’m the only one that has nothing going on. 

I don’t see them nearly as much as I used to because they generally do couples stuff and I’d just be an extra wheel, so I feel like I’m losing my friends because I’m an inadequate fucking loser. They’re all taller, more accomplished, better people than I am. I’m the ugly duckling of the group and always have been; girls not liking me has been a running joke since high school and at this point I just use the humor as a coping mechanism because I’d rather laugh than cry. They’ve never tried to set me up on a date before, at least that I’m aware, so they either don’t have faith in me or the girls they’ve tried to set me up with turned me down and they didn’t tell me. Either is an indictment on me.

I haven’t spoken to my mom in three years (our relationship has been toxic since I was in 2nd/3rd grade) and my dad and I were never/are not close. I’ve never had a stable home life, and I’d just fucking kill for the chance to start a family. To show that I could be an amazing father with no fucking help from them. To be the parent they never were.

My grandmother basically raised me, and it kills me that she’s been looking forward to seeing me get married and have kids since the day I was born, and I’ll never be able to give that to her. I failed her. 

I’m sorry if this comes off as tangential rambling, I’m just really struggling and I don’t know what the fuck to do. I look at my 401k and it’s just like, what’s the fucking point of this? Why am I saving money for retirement when I’m just going to be alone with nothing? Why not just take it out and buy a house or something. I love to travel, but I can’t do it alone anymore without getting in my feelings. I went to a baseball game in April and saw all the couples around me having such a good time, and I got sad. I don’t even know what the point of this is but I I just needed to vent and I hate myself for not being good enough.",2022-07-25 01:10:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1557847816,2,/r/lonely/comments/w7bamq/im_going_to_die_alone_and_i_resent_myself_for_it/,,0,3,I’m going to die alone and I resent myself for it.

4761,w7ceeq,WelcomeSweaty,"I’m 16, I was a privileged kid who has had the honor of my dad inheriting money from his moms death and was given a good childhood despite my bad behavior as a kid. I was and still am the “bad kid”. I am disrespectful and constantly angry with my self, I want to just be left alone and wanna rot in my room until the end of the world. 

I witnessed many things growing up including domestic violence,drugs, and abuse. I have saw at the ripe age of 8 how cruel and nasty this world can get.

As early I can remember my family called me names and poked at how nasty and ugly I truly was. At 8, I watched my father shove a knife up to my moms neck. At 10 I was shunned away from my dads side of the family because I look like her and told “I wish you were never born” by my own father. At 12 I was shoved into therapy because I tried to end my life but quickly removed by my mom because ‘I was telling too much’.  At 13 I was dealing drugs with my mom in order to keep a roof over our heads and pawning every I own in hopes it would be enough money for my moms addiction. At 14 I was forced into online school due to covid and told to do school work while babysitting and if I was to speak about it I would be hit. At 15 I was raising a kid.  Ian’s to stay up every night until 2-3am and make sure he slept then get up at 6am to catch my school bus. At 16 I’m exhausted. I get yelled at and my hair pulled by my mom and hope she’ll forget about me later. I’m not allowed to get a job because I’m “irresponsible” I have no family to go to. I will not get to graduate and I honestly want to rot in my bedroom on the floor. I know everyone had had tough times and people have it worse but I have nobody to turn to. If I tell my parents they just try to give me weed and hope to calm me down.

4775,w7e5od,anonymous_5002,"I am a 17 year old girl about to enter my senior year of high school. As of now I have never dated, or at the very least even entered a “talking stage” with a boy. I am 5’4.5 and around 133 pounds, so while I am not model skinny I wouldn’t classify myself as overweight and believe I hold my weight well (other girls have told me that I have an “hourglass” figure). I have longish, curly/ wavy dark hair, dark eyes, olive toned/medium skin, and wear glasses. Although I am very much average in appearance, I oftentimes think that there are so many people that look just like me or are in my league that have gotten a boys attention that I can’t help but think that my appearance is not the issue. 
Onto my personality, I consider myself to be very intelligent, very kind (to the point where some may consider me to be a pushover or a doormat), and can be a bit shy. However, I do warm up to people very quickly and have quite a bubbly and humorous personality once you get to know me. I also hold quite a few leadership positions at school and a good amount of people around school know my name so it’s not like I’m a hermit. 
All my close friends have gotten close with people before. Whether it be just snap chatting daily, dating, or just overall having a “guy best friend”, at one point they have gotten a boys attention, while I have not. The last time a boy confessed he had a crush on me was 7th grade, which I did not reciprocate back because I was too young and did not share the same feelings. However, that was 5 years ago. Since then, I do have conversations with boys, but these are almost completely limited to “in school” conversations, such as while walking together in the halls, sitting by each other in class, or any other situations where small talk would arise. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had crushes, I find boys cute and am not too specific in my type. I just don’t understand what it is about me that prevents a boy from texting me on Snapchat or making more effort to talk to me at school. I am not extremely quiet, and know how to return a conversation and keep it going, but it jsut seems like nothing ever goes from there. 
So many people at my school have been in relationships, and i just can’t think of anything outstanding that would make me unattractive or unlikeable. I know this makes me sound like a loner, but I just need a little advice, because I am at the point where I think I am truly unloveable. 
Please don’t give me any BS about how relationships suck and “I’m lucky” to not have gotten into one. Or how I’ll find the one and to just be patient. I apologize if I sound a bit aggressive or harsh, I just feel so alone and left out because of this, as shallow as it may sound.

Sometimes my life feels so empty, no matter what I do. As a teen I was always worried about not being good enough at my major, and now I'm way ahead of others my age and it still doesn't feel like enough mentally and fiscally. I used to feel ugly and fat and sometimes I still do, but I've lost a lot of weight and built some confidence and I still feel like nothing in my life has changed as a result of that

Tonight I had a realization that was extremely first-world-problem-ey but long story short, I realized I haven't been able to really enjoy a hobby I've prided myself on since I was a kid and that has helped me through a lot in about 10 years because I've never had the money or means to get halfway decent equipment. I always feel left out of things because of this but I didn't realize it'd been ten years already and that just makes me extremely sad and old lol

And I'm so not excited for my birthday. Another year alone in my apartment, no friends or family to visit, no gifts I like (socks if I'm lucky), same as its been for years now. It's been so fucking depressing for years and I'm starting to hate my birthday so much 

I feel like my entire life has just been me waiting for things to get better. I never feel in control of anything, no matter how much money I make or how much I transform my appearance or whatever, nothing ever changes no matter what I do. My life is completely out of my control and has been forever

4780,w7ej6t,HaleOfBayLeaves,"Hi Reddit.

This whole day has been a day lost to depression. I slept most of it. Browsed the internet for some of it. Now it's bedtime and I'm exhausted. Emotionally, mentally, physically. I can't concentrate, because depression. I'm going to do my bedtime routine now, and I'm going to tell you all about it. It'll keep me on track.  Tomorrow I'll wake up feeling better.

* I made herbal tea. It's a blend of different herbs, and has a faint caramel flavor. It's my all-time favorite bedtime tea.
* I'm trimming my house plants of dead leaves, and taking those to the compost.
* I'm petting my cat who, is requesting attention.
* I put my shoes away in the closet. Two pairs needed putting away.
* I'm putting dirty clothes in the hamper. Mostly socks.
* Do you ever think of a better life? I usually imagine mine in the woods with my tribe. That's my happy place.
* I emptied out the trash can.
* I put away my makeup and hair brush / hair dryer.
* These headphones should be on my desk next to my computer stuff, not with my makeup stuff.
* What is all this paperwork doing just strewn around. Filing away paperwork.
* Feed kitty. She really wanted my attention.
* Speaking of kitty she tracked in so much dead vegetation and stickies from outside.
* Sweep sweep sweep, vacuum.
* I brushed my teeth
* It's weird Reddit, I use to really hate myself. I don't anymore. I kinda love myself now. You can love yourself and still be super lonely, and have the occasional suicidal ideation, I found out. You can absolutely still have depression days.
* Wash my face, moisturize.
* Clean my piercings.
* Pee.
* Take my bedtime medication.
* Made the bed.

I'm really lonely. I fantasize about falling asleep in someone else's arms nightly. Maybe a man, maybe a woman. The fantasy's not that specific. Someone who loves me. Who looks at me and can't imagine not wanting to fall asleep next to me for the rest of their lives. I keep going in the hopes of finding that connection. If I don't.. I dunno. Maybe it's ok. Maybe I need to be ok with it, regardless of outcome.

4787,w7fmjw,desert_dweller5,"I love the idea of how convenient ordering from websites is supposed to be. I'm only home to sleep and shower. the rest of the time I'm out driving around for work. which makes having a social life difficult to say the least. I don't trust anyone enough to leave packages outside on my doorstep. especially when everything is so damn expensive with how terrible wages are. I also don't want to shell out $23 a month for a PO box at a UPS store. I don't order stuff online that often that I need to have a dedicated PO box to recieve packages but I also do not want to have to pay to pick up a package at the UPS store. it's $10 a package to pick up at the UPS store which means if you get more than 2 packages a month it makes sense to get a po box. but I don't do it regularly enough that it would make sense. which means I'm stuck with whatever the local stores sell in the store or I have to send it to the store for them to hold onto so I can come pick it up later. It's basically a tax on being single and having no friends that you trust enough to take in your packages for you. it makes me feel so alone. Like nobody gives a fuck about me. that I'm doing everything all on my own and there's nobody to do small favors like that for me. I can totally feel that my needs for love and exceptance are sorely neglected. My sex life is non-existant. and No, I don't count my  own hand as sexual expression.  if you could die of touch starvation I wouldn't have made it past 27. it's comming up on a full decade of being single, basically involuntarily due to lack of finances. being unemplloyed for an extended period of time due to my terrible mental health.  I think my mom's aniversary of her death is weighing on me extra heavily this year. it's not till the end of july but close enough.  I could always go to her with this kind of stuff and she'd help cheer me up. My dad's solution is pull yourself up by your boot straps, give yourself a swift kick in the ass and get moving. which isn't always as helpful as he thinks it is. I'm sure all this whining is not productive but I just wanted to vent to the void to get it out of my head. if anyone read this thanks for listening. you are not alone in your loneliness. I don't know if that helps anyone but it's a fact. to me it makes me feel bad for both of us. but it's also kinda comforting that i'm not a freak. that everyone feels lonely sometimes. that it's ""normal"" to feel lonely. I just think that I'm lonely more of the time even around people. it's about being understood and seen. ppl laughing at my jokes. which rarely ever happens. that makes me so happy when I can make someone laugh.  my humor is not easily understood by most.

Its been a long time i didnt post here.
My life keep going worse and worse, i dont have the motivation to get out of bed, do dishes, and shit like that.
I lost my job because of my behavior to other people, it seems like i cant understand them, and i feel like that since im a child.

To feel less alone, i startesd streaming (no i wont plug my self) and i managed to be motivated into this and grow a small community.

Problem is, and always has been, i keep comparing myself to others, and wonder why i cant be like them, and imma be real, and say that over the top, im even more jealous of woman who just have to expose their body or fake personnality on twitch to explode and win their life of it, when im just trying to share a passion im having for over 10 years.

This world is so fucking unfair, i dont even have the courage and the trust to speak to my own father who is trying to contact me, im so afraid to disappoint him and be the child he dont want me to be.

I miss the time when i still was innoncent, and not worrying about adult life shit.
I fucking hate my mother for fucking my life up just for her own comfort, but her not trying to contact me back is a sign she isnt even bothered of what i become and how she turned my life into an everydays nightmare, not being able to speak properly or interract withy pairs, beimg jealous where i should be admirative, and feeling like the absolute worse possible human being as people were keep telling me when i grew up.

This is crazy how life is, and i hope i will find comfort somewhere and somehow, even if this hope is almost burning its last ressources right now.

4801,w7gvxg,flame22x,"I have been shy and introverted for my entire life, and even making friends are a struggle to me. So it's no surprise that i have always kept my romantic feeling to myself. Multiple crushes and romantic interests flew by, without me saying a word. And after many many years, when i did have the courage to confess, of course i got rejected, or stood up on a date.

As time goes by, my friends keep talking about their past/present relationships, sex and all that stuff, while i just feel lost. So, i invented some stories about some experiences in love that i never actually had. I only told a few, so it didnt seem suspicious, they know that it's not like me to sleep and be with lots of people, i believe i made it look convincing enough though.

I invented those stories so that they could not see me as the pathetic loveless virgin that i have always been. I dont know how they would react if they knew, i dont wanna lose them.

But i hate lying to other people, it makes me feel like shit, i hate myself for it, but for some reason i keep doing it. I feel like i am behind everyone else around me. Even the shy introvertes kids, that are just like i once was, have more experience than me. There is this voice inside my head that keeps telling me that i am gonna end up alone, my biggest fear, while some other quieter voice tells me that it is gonna be okay soon.

But right now, i dont know what i should do. Do i keep going with those fake stories and hating myself for it until (IF) i actually find someone i can love ? Or do i spit it out, and assume the pathetic lying virgin that i am, and risk losing the friends that i worked hard to get ?

4803,w7h1g6,Last_Branch_2203,"First off - if my grammar and things are terrible forgive me I'm in a bit of a rush.

I am a 23F. I haven't had a real relationship ever. I dated a guy off and on from 8th grade to 10th but he didn't mean anything to be other than checking a box off to my mom that I could like someone. He was a cheating prick too so there's that. My last 2 years of high school my parents died and I was left to send myself to college where I did a 180 with my personality since I was no longer sheltered. I was nihilistic, sometimes I still am. My mom's siblings bullied and caused me so much emotional stress I hated them. I got closer to God (not to be preach but it helped me) after 2 intercepted suicide attempts. I was alone. My family betrayed me and they made me feel that I was a constant disappointment to my parents unless I did something they wanted or could brag about. Until about a year ago I stopped bending over backwards for my family who wouldn't do the same for me. I even stopped talking to my favorite cousin (who is like a sister to me). I tried to defend her from her boyfriend who was disrespecting her. It became a big argument about how I make things worst. I have friends I'm close with, bestfriends too. I started back being promiscuous like when after my last parent died. I know it's bad but I do this thing of making the guy feel so amazing and wonderful but when they want a relationship I can't . I also will go to movies or bowling with a guy every once and a while but I can't commit to a relationship. I don't think anyone will stay with me long. So I never open up or invest because I see myself as a comma in a page in that guy's book. I want to change. I want to be married and have a family that won't leave me or make me feel worthless but now I don't know how to open myself to do those things.

I just hate feeling like there were some people I possibly could have been friends with, but I ruined it with me being ""too much"". I absolutely hate that there is so much shame in being lonely. 

So I was thinking earlier today about how much of my life I've been more or less without a friend I could regularly hang out with. I'll start with when I graduated high school because I had friends because I was forced to be around the same people every day so I got comfortable with them. It's been almost 20 years since then, and I think I've only had a regular friend for about 2.5 of those years.

I realized that I would rather live  just 10 more years (maybe even 5) where I always had someone to turn to than live the average 79 years as I am now.

However, seeing “friends” post on social media going on their graduation trips without having received any invitations really made me realize just how alone I am. Even two of my closest friends, people I called my best friends decided to go on a trip by themselves.  The person that would have been the closest thing to a real friend to me was my girl friend. She would have been the best thing that happened to me in several years. I would talk to her about things that I normally couldn’t tell anyone. She provided me comfort when I got rejected from universities, and when I was having a hard time in school. But my parents made me break up with her because I didn’t get into a good university. I wished I had at least one person that I could consult with about this, but I realized I didn’t even have a single one. I desperately wished  that I didn’t break up with my girl friend, as it hurt her. But it would’ve been unfair and hurt her even more to continue a relationship that my parents constantly tried to sabotage.

When I was younger I was a hopeless romantic. I was in love with the idea of love. I envisioned myself having a loving family. Being a good mother and wife. Doing things for my husband. I’m caring by nature. I generally tend to go the extra mile for the people I care for in my life . Now almost 30 most of my peers and friends have gotten married and have moved on in their live. Here I am lonely and full of shame and guilt. I mourn the life that I once dreamed of . Countless of failed talking stages and the idea that I would have to settle in order to get married has eaten away at every ounce of self confidence I have in myself. People say being single is nice and stress free but that is only true when it’s out of choice. This is torture. Every failed talking stage makes me doubt more that it will ever happen. Think my mother has given up hope that it will ever happen for me.

None of these people know each other or are connected. 

**Friend 1**: I found out my online long time friend was a racist. Using N words and talking about people of color in the most belittling way racists do. I had no clue of this until now. I had to cut them off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Friend 2**: known them the longest. best friend online i had. Just decided they wanted to up and leave the internet. nothing is keeping them here. I understood that and bidded them farewell even though i expressed how much ill miss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Friend 3**: IRL friend who decided to just stop talking to me. Blocking me. Their explanation was that they wanted to focus on themself. i'm not sure what that means all i know is that it doesn't include me at all. no specific reasoning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Friend 4**: the one that hurts the most. My IRL Boyfriend. we were taking it slow to see where it would go. i was afraid to catch feelings this deep for this exact reason. because ultimately ive ended up more hurt than him. Hes suffering from something. depression or something i cant fix. he haid he has done this before and that he is sorry he made me think or feel this way. Its a combination of things i believe involves me. something that ive done. he said it was out of my control but yes it was about me and well other things in his life. there was no arguments in what we had. it was ok then it wasnt ok 

**All this happened in one day. Now looking at it. those were the only people i had interactions with. I don't have contacts in my phone. People added on social media i could call or offer out. Theres just nobody now. And i don't even know where to begin to start making friends. im not generally accepted. or i dont feel that way by the vibe people give off. but thats also something about me \[anxiety\] that i can barely control.**

4855,w7qcfe,pinkpanther1997,"I turned 13 a few days ago but I felt like this since earlier this year.

I've started feeling lonely and sad on and off yet not wanting to connect with my friends even if I tried. I feel like I need therapy but I'm not sure of it because during lockdown all my friends started coming out as bi, gender fluid, nonbinary and all that but I was the only one who thought we may have been too young to think of this kind of stuff (10-11). One of my friends even told me they thought they were depressed and I just tried telling them to get professional help because I couldn't deal with it. Recently, said friend told me that I told them they 'couldn't be' or that they were 'one of the happiest people I know'. To be fair, I don't remember saying any of those things but I know I didn't say it like that. I feel my whole mindset is just questioning if I'm too young for these things.

I think lockdown connected me to the internet more and made me less social, I used to be so happy but now I'm just sad usually. I started secondary school and I had no friends until the end of year 7 (except for the ones from lockdown, but they were all in a different class). It took someone wanting to sit next to me instead of some random table on their own in a science practical lesson in the lab to have the friend group I have today. I've gained more confidence since then but I somehow gained more loneliness too.

I have a dream of getting married and have children, all the kids in my year are getting boyfriends and girlfriends and I'm happy for them but just jealous even thought I don't like anyone there. I have a celebrity crush and because I'm so pathetic I made an entire fake life for myself in my head with I'm and being an actress. I started feeling really lonely in around March because it was then it all hit me that none of it was real and I'd have to try doing something else

I also think I might have mild OCD but I'm scared to ask my parents to check because I don't think they'll believe me. My parents are very supportive of me but they have a passive aggressive sort of vibe, and I'd tell them about my dreams of being an actress or model someday and they'd say something like 'it's nice to dream'.

I feel like the goal shouldn't be, less lonely. It should just be to embrace your loneliness. Like accept it. One thing I realize in myself and in people in general is we never allow ourselves to get bored anymore. Boredom isn't a thing.

Feeling bored? Fuck that. Get on Instagram. Watch a movie, do something, take a substance, eat some food, numb that shit out. You don't wanna feel bored when (sarcasm).

But good things come out of boredom. Boredom was the first thing that I felt before I became tuned in to my emotions.

4876,w7udjf,thr33eyed0rangut4ng,"What's up. Hope you're doing well, despite being on this sub. Like you I'm pretty lonely, although I've read some things on here that make me feel like I should consider myself comparatively lucky. I have a few friends, and a lot of people I hang out with (via those aforementioned friends) with whom I'm pretty friendly- they think I'm allright but they don't care all too much (as is their right, I don't blame them).
My friends, too, don't have me very high on their list of priorities, I guess that's my fault. We're all a couple years out of high school and they're all doing stuff with their life. I feel like I'm right where I started, nothing's really changed for me. I've gotten a degree, and am close to getting a master's, but those don't mean anything if you're not connected, out there networking, setting goals, achieving goals, making actual plans. I'm not really doing any of those (don't know how) maybe the panic that's slowly seeping in will force me off my ass eventually. Maybe.
My friends are perfectly justified in letting me drift away, they know I'm doing as bad as I always have and that they really can't help me, it's my fault- and that's not me self-hating, that's just how it is. It all comes down to sociability, I think. Obviously I'm pretty introverted. I don't have trouble making eye contact and having conversations but I have trouble initiating the latter. Don't want to talk to people, knowing full-well I have to to get anything done. I hate having these forced conversations. My friends, and most people I think, have this 'thing' that I (and possibly you, too) just don't have. This sort of enthusiasm for making friends amd talking to new people and all that stuff. I widens your circle and brings you opportunities for social advancement.
It really makes me sad, because I don't feel like I'm not good for anything, I believe I have talents, I just have no idea how to work myself towards a place where I can really benefit from them. I'm gonna do something stupid now and blame society for indoctrinating people into thinking you have to be an always-smiling, spontaneous people-person to be considered normal, and that it's inherently bad, or weird, to be more quiet or whatever. I know it is way more complicated than that but it's easier to shift the blame off of yourself onto some abstract societal ailment. Just have to work harder I guess. But how? Work on what exactly?
Sorry, this is just a vent, out of need. I really didn't think through what other people should get from it. I guess I'll just close with: any thoughts? Anyone recognise their experience or thought-pattern or something? Anyone work their way out of situations like this?

Before you start, yes I am in therapy (the go to response).

Genuinely I don’t think anyone values me at all, my friends I get on with but I don’t think anyone would be there for me if I really needed them. My employer insists on working me like a dog and whenever I’ve told them I’m exhausted, my feelings are disregarded.

My family are all wrapped up in themselves with their own families they’ve created, so I don’t expect them to have time for me.

Aaaaaanyways, the reason I am venting is because I feel like I am a different person on discord when voice-chatting with my online friends. Like a whole different persona. However, the moment I am disconnected from the “internet life” - I become a whole different person, the opposite personality. 

I just want to know if anyone has ever felt this way and if so how did you overcome it? 

P.S: I don’t think it’s a split personality disorder - or maybe it is?

This is my first time trying this, but I'm taking inspiration from Pablo Strong. You probably won't recognize the name. He's a brilliant man. He's a YouTuber who a few years ago, made a series called Streets of London, in which he asked random people on the street about their life &amp; happiness. It is a truly fascinating series, and people were so happy to tell their story, even if it was to a complete stranger. I'd love to do something like that.

And so I completely get the need to tell someone a story about your life, vent, anything. I'm here for that. I'll ask follow up questions. There may be a bit of a timezone difference as I'm in the UK but I won't ghost. I'm as awkward and shy IRL as anyone, so no judgement.

My only requests is that you give detailed answers. No one sentence answers that I can't work much with. Be as detailed with your answers as possible. And I would prefer if you were 18+ simply because I feel uncomfortable messaging minors. (Preferably 21+) Aside from that, come talk about whatever you like.

4922,w82mf3,ComfortableSuspect10,"i was talking to a friend of mine and he was venting to me about a girl he can’t get over and he’s still in love with. honestly i was thinking to myself some shit like, ohh i know how this goes, i’ll just tell him that once you go out and meet more people, you’ll find out she’s not the only one. i was going to say that because that’s how i feel about guys. when i like a guy, i get completely obsessed over him for a year or two and beg for his attention, but at the same time, i’d still look at other guys and catch smaller feelings for them. i traveled to a different state a few months ago while i was “in love” with a guy at my school who didn’t even know me, and on that trip i saw a lot of other cute guys and forgot about him temporarily. because of this, i thought it was like that for everyone, until i remembered the first girl i had a crush on

and how i never had a crush on another girl again after her

i met her when i first started realizing i was bisexual, so maybe that had an impact on it. but i never knew how much i really loved her until she was gone. and it feels so pathetic because it’s clear to me that she only saw me as a friend, but she was basically the whole world to me. she was so nice to me and genuinely cared about me. she was so cool and beautiful too. i would’ve done anything to be with her. but we lost communication and now she’s just a memory. i was about to judge my friend being stuck on a girl until i realized that i could write about my first girl crush so many times and talk about her so many times without getting tired. i was about to judge him until i realized that after i realized i couldn’t have her, my overall drive to date other women lessened. everytime i look for what i find attractive in a girl, or i think about the perfect girl, it resembles her in some ways. that’s why i think loving a girl is different than loving a guy. i can have feelings for many different dudes and be able to get over them with some time, but now i don’t even want a girlfriend anymore because it won’t be her

or maybe it’s because she was also the first person i crushed on that was actually my friend 🤔could be that too. whatever",2022-07-25 22:43:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643521102,0,/r/lonely/comments/w82mf3/loving_a_girl_is_different/,,0,0,loving a girl is different

4948,w85yc0,PrettyFlako32,"ITS SO MUCH PAIN AND HATE  in me because of the things i did or that happened to me that i dont remember. I feel there is a deep pain in my heart and subconscious i have no access to. 
My parents divorced when i was 6 and i have no recollection of seeing them happy together, i barely remember anything till the age of 12,13.
I was always shy and super intelligent but introverted, now you would not believe that i am like that because of my apperiance, i am getting told that im handsome and stuff but i hate anything about me.
Why cant i be like everyone else, live in the moment, meet girls talk about random things, be romantic fall in love and just live and be. 
Why i am getting so angry and jealous when i see happy people in love around me, what happened to me what is wrong? 
I think i must go deep inside to the roots to find my traumatic experiences that i have no access to like my whole childhood, i cant remember anything about it, i harmed my brain and soul so much with 10 years of alcohol and 4,5 years drugs (began with weed, stopped it and began with cocaine,speed,xtc on the weekends combined with alcohol)
After that i needed downers like benzos because i couldnt stand the coming downs, they just were awful.
I close my eyes and there’s just nothing, no images like before no good feelings no hope for the future, no believe in a higher power.
I have nightmares, i cant sleep my brain chemistry is fucked up, cant concentrate, i just CANT..
 I am just an empty shell, i hate myself so much, i cant feel love and every thought is negative. ITS SO MUCH PAIN AND HATE",2022-07-26 01:11:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579462599,2,/r/lonely/comments/w85yc0/its_so_much_pain_3am_thoughts/,,0,0,ITS SO MUCH PAIN (3am thoughts)

4968,w887xr,That-Dentist8239,"The past year, I’ve been going through a split up from a long-term relationship (14 years). I really don’t know what to do. I’ve looked into different sources for trying to meet new people to try to form some kind of social support system for myself, but I’ve been quite unsuccessful.

There’s no telling how many people I’ve talked to over the months on mental health related online chats, posting on here to meet either long distance or local friends, joining local groups on Discord, and trying different social sites, like Bumble BFF and Plenty of Fish (gearing it mainly towards making friends and maybe potential dating if it went there). Nothing has worked. It’s either conversations don’t really go anywhere, or things ultimately hit a dead end, or I get blown off if they haven’t seen my looks prior to talking (that didn’t happen on Bumble BFF or POF, because they knew upfront how I looked), or we didn’t really have anything in common to connect with. Not to mention, just being given a hard time on the Discord servers and on here. I had people badgering me, simply just for trying to make friends and making me feel creepy for it, because they didn’t like the source I was using. I don’t know why you can’t just look anywhere for that kind of thing. There shouldn’t be social rules regarding that. Plus, I had someone trying to dig and start problems with trying to sabotage me with cancel culture related mentality and tactics. At this point, I’m just exhausted dealing with so many different things, and so much disappointment, and not really getting anywhere despite all my efforts.

Honestly, what makes it so hard to try to meet new people is the fact that so many people in America are just too busy all the time, and their lives are centered around work. Then, my physical disability and mental health issues both definitely make it hard for me socially. I just feel hopeless trying to meet people, who I can talk to more long term, and have a close relationship with as far as really being there for each other and talking about anything, and very likely someone, who is also from North Carolina like me.

4975,w88vf3,wiggedcow,"Greetings everyone, 

Awhile ago I made a post about hitting the road, but before I decided to commit to the project, I decided to practice a bit. Long story short, I made my way to Vermont from Kentucky, and I saw a lot. I saw a drunk getting kicked off a bus, I saw fights break out for nothing, and I saw what people in poverty would do to survive. I remember being in the New York subway watching a mentally ill homeless man, so far gone he’s not even speaking just making noises, wandering the subway system without any help. I don’t know if this is a normal for city folk but it really shook me. While in Albany I was threatened, without my knowledge, as I kept asking my aggressor to repeat himself not knowing he was trying to provoke me. I got stranded at a bus stop in that shithole Columbus, Ohio. It was bad, really bad, that’s all I shall say.

While I was in Vermont, I fell in love with my surroundings, I slept at Burlington International Airport and made my way to Shelburne. Really nice communities near that area, but I learned a valuable lesson, Vermont sucks for hitchhikers. I was stranded, facing rejection as every car drove past me, and all I could do is walk. I eventually wandered into a huge garden. It was nice, it calmed my nerves and I took the time to journal my travels, but I had to go. Eventually, I wandered into this restaurant place, and some dude saw me walking on the road and offered me a ride. Fuck yeah I accepted. He opened up about his past to me, so much I don’t really wanna reveal anything, but he was fine with me journaling it. I remember he asked me “The fuck were you thinking?” I said something along the lines of “It gets me out of the house.” 

I’m home now, and I already want to be out in the world again, but I learned a lot:

1. There is always someone in a worse condition than I am currently. Especially after what I saw in New York, it’s really humbling.

2. If someone treats you with respect, cherish it, not everyone will like you.

3. Enjoy the small things. I was scared and more alone than ever, but if I could find comfort in a simple garden in the heights of my anxiety, then maybe I could bring that home with me.

While I’ve been home for awhile, I still have so much to think about, I was always so isolated growing up. But I had fun, and I hope all the people I met on the road are safe.",2022-07-26 03:26:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637394960,14,/r/lonely/comments/w88vf3/what_i_learned_while_traveling/,,0,0,What I learned while traveling

4980,w89peo,Several-Size-5466,"F(30) I just feel so incredibly lonely. In so many ways, not just physically or romantically. I feel like I have no community and am having such an incredibly hard time even connecting with people platonically. I’ve been single for four years and moved to the city I live in about a year ago. In that time I’ve attempted to date two people. The first, broke things off with me because they felt I wasn’t “opening up” to them and they felt like it was just “an uphill battle” with me and they rather “cut their loses” I was incredibly hurt when this happened because I felt like I just needed time to get to know the person better. So I stopped focusing on trying to meet people romantically and poured that energy into career goals. Fast forward six months later, I meet someone I’m interested in and it ‘feels’ like we immediately click only for them to not be interested because they felt I was too open and I was “overwhelming” them with my “feelings” 

Naturally this whole thing has taken me for a tailspin because it’s like, wtf am I Goldilocks? Too hot then too cold. I mean, I know I’ll be “jussst right” for the person meant for me, and that’s not the feedback I’m seeking. It’s just lonely. It makes you question everything you do and everything you say and it’s so energy consuming to the point that I’m scared to deal with people. I’m sooooo in my head, I can’t even be present for the interaction and that’s such a debilitating way to live. 

Sometimes I just wanna laugh and goof around with someone, or have a little cuddle, or a back scratch, or for someone to say “I’m going to the kitchen, do you want anything”, someone to watch a show with, someone to help bring in the groceries.

I don’t have many platonic friends where I live either. I’ve had pretty much the same friends since high school or college. Keep in mind, im 30, so most of my friends have families of their own at this point. My two best friends who are still unmarried, without kids live across the country. I have two friends in the city I live in. One, is married with 2 kids and the other recently entered a serious relationship. 

Whenever I try to connect with people platonically or romantically it just goes up in flames and, lowkey I have ptsd from continuing to rolling the dice. I’m just exhausted of always being by myself. But even worse than the physically being by myself part, I just wish I could meet people I can connect with and the connection be mutual. 

I should add another reason I’m having a hard time connecting with people is I’m limited financially. I make -just- enough to pay my bills, barely enough to survive. I have to very strictly budget. So for my personal enjoyment I do a lot of free/cheap stuff like hiking trails, walking paths, and libraries. Yes, I’ve considered taking some type of class or going to some type of event of my interest but those things generally cost money. 

So I just do my little work, and eat my little single meals, and watch my little Netflix shows, and read my little books, and drink my little mugs of tea, and get in my little bed, all by my little self, wake up and do it all again the next day

4994,w8byjw,Infinite_Stay_9707,"So, a small introduction about myself. I am 18 y/o (M). I have graduated from high school and am appearing in the entrance exams for universities and colleges. Two years ago, i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic (and lockdown), I was pretty social. I used to hang our with friends and was happy-go-lucky kind of a person. I never over thought about anything, just enjoyed life and faced the problems along.

However, now, I feel like I've changed a lot. For the past 6-7 months, I have isolated myself. It all started because I had to study and focus on my academics for tests and entrance exam preparations. So, I stopped chatting over the phone and stuff like that. And now, it feels like I'm better off being alone for the rest of my life. I like it better when my parents go out for work, I like the serenity of the house, I like the freedom - I can study for long hours, there is no-one pestering me to eat and bathe (I know it's weird, but sometimes I do not feel like getting up from work). Recently, my high school final results were declared and I was happy with my own score, I did not even contact my classmates to know their scores. Some of them contacted me, and there's the catch: I felt extremely irritated about that. Although my scores are better than theirs, I feel extremely irritated when someone tries to pry into my 'own snug world'.

I can't remember when it was the last time I had talked with a friend over the phone, and honestly I don't care at all. When someone texts me something, I just reply to that message in the most concise way possible, thus nowadays no-one contacts me anyway. What bothers me the most is that I always tend to imagine what others think about me and that they are always judging me. I start overthinking and can't focus in my study. I just like to spend the time all by myself, studying, watching series in my free time or lying in bed listening to music.

I don't know whether this is weird or not, but honestly, this is peaceful and I really don't want to get involved with other people at all.

I can't tell if it's from a build up of exhaustion or a build up of the effects of countless phone/computer/tv binge sessions. Feels like someone is prying my eyes open while blowing a hair dryer in my face.

The obvious solution is to just put my phone down and get some sleep. But the second I put this thing down, get comfy and try to sleep... I have nothing to distract me from what I don't want to think about.

Why am I so unlovable? Am I gonna be miserable my entire life? Why can't I do anything right? Why am I so worthless? Will anyone ever love me? If they did, would I deserve it? How can I possibly make myself happy when I can't even get out of bed?

That's only a fraction of what starts racing through my head. That is, until I pick my phone back up and mindlessly start consuming content. I can't think bad thoughts if I let the blue light of my phone screen burn away all my brain cells.

I just want someone to hold me. I want to cry out, scream in agony to the world about my pain but here I am instead. Sitting in complete darkness, minus the glow of screen and that one crack in the curtains that exposes the streetlights outside. I don't cry out, the only sounds around me are the whirring of the fan, whispers of the wind and snoring of one of my dogs.

At this point, even if I got what I wanted... Someone willing to lay in bed with me, stroke my hair and tell me it's ok and they love me dearly, I'm not a pointless burden, I doubt I would believe it. Maybe that's why I don't have such a gift, it would be wasted on me.

The worst part, is no one cares. Not my mom, not my family, not my online ""friends"". The few times I've told anyone, I've been told to just accept it and distract myself with hobbies.

5024,w8ikgl,jawong50,"It’s 3am on a Tuesday morning and I am typing down my thoughts as they come up. The reason I had woken up was that I had a nightmare, something about an apocalyptic dystopia like from War of the Worlds, and was generally feeling uncomfortable, not only due to the feeling of the bed but I had several thoughts in my head that troubled me. 

I’m sitting in the dark, thinking about how I was rejected by my crush and how alone I felt on the inside. That was 2 months ago yet I still think about her all of the time, a thought that used to make me happy now left me heartbroken as I clung on to any feelings of happiness I could find. It has become so bad that I have been having obsessive thoughts on a regular basis. I preferred not to cling on to the past because it just made moving forward all the more harder to do but it felt better than feeling lonely as I do now. 

The feeling of being lonely can be described as being unable to emotionally connect to people around you. I was told that to get over my obsession I needed to spend time alone. But for me it only intensified my obsessive thoughts.

What made me feel so lonely was the feeling that society had given up on me. I tried reaching out to people in an attempt to make friends but every time I tried people ended up losing interest in me and just leaving, leaving me on my own and discouraged to try again. I felt like I had to do everything myself, take responsibility for everything, carry the weight of myself and everything that people have given me over the years, feelings of failure, rejection, heartbreak, frustration, hopelessness, anxiety, depression. If I did something right it didn’t really matter but if I did something wrong it was my fault and my fault alone because I had no one else to blame and I carried it for the rest of my life.

Sometimes I just wish, by some miracle, that I would get help, be able to overcome what I am dealing with, and get on with my life. I just really hate feeling lonely. Every second it’s eating away at my sanity. I can’t eat, sleep, breathe, or even think without thinking about the fact that I’m feeling lonely.",2022-07-26 12:31:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1540109619,5,/r/lonely/comments/w8ikgl/alone_in_the_dark/,,0,0,Alone in the dark

It was a long wait so to pass the time, me and my bro were cracking jokes. We always had this really witty comedy between us, literally just coming up with dumb but real funny stuff. Anyway as we're talking and laughing, I crack this one joke and there was this lady behind us, really pretty, didn't know she was listening in on our conversation and my joke absolutely killed her, she just bursted laughing, me and my bro turn and see her, she was kinda embarrassed but it made laugh and even happy to know I made someone laugh that hard.

I live in England in quite a busy small town and I have no family. I have friends that I will occasionally speak to but at the end of the day I feel like everyone has so much going on like travelling, hanging out constantly with people, going on trips with family and even just talking to family but I have none of that and never did. 

At times when my friends tell them about their day or what they have been doing in life - I hate to say this - but I just envy and get mad because I wish I had that, and also when they complain about their day how they are stuck with family and can't do what they want it makes me want to scream because that's what I want the most in life. Just to be surrounded by people, feel loved and wanted. 

I live with my brother and my mum but I do not communicate at all with my brother (he is 17) so I only really have my mum. On top of that my mum is depressed and stays most her days in bed and my brother at work. The only things I really have left to do is play games ( or hang with friends but I don't do that too often)

My mum doesn't have any friends since she is originally from a different country and lost them over the years of depression and stuff with my dad that happened and on top of that we don't have any family here to speak to. I don't speak my mum's language so reaching out to them to communicate isn't really an option.

I don't know what my goal is here but is there any way I can make my life a little less depressing?

I don’t have a family bc my parents are emotionally and physically abusive. My sister abuses substances and has a really short temper and could never wanna listen to anyone that has a different opinion than her. And my extended family are either passed away or toxic af.

I lost the person who I thought would be the love of my life, and I know that this happened quite a long time ago but sometimes it’s still hard to move on esp when I find out only 2 months after the breakup, they already found someone new. It just makes me feel like I’m easily replaceable. I guess I am. It didn’t help that during the early stages of the breakup, their friends were doing their best to gaslight me to justify all their shitty behavior bc “they have a bad life” and trying to get me back together with them.

My friends often tend to prioritize other people, usually their other friends or sometimes their partners; which the partner one is probably more understandable. I would see my friends hanging out with their other friends a lot but never hung out with me or seem to chat me much at all even if I initiated. Hell no one even remembers my birthdays even if they remember everyone else’s birthdays.

Even recently I lost someone who seems to be close to me and told me they were their best friend. And I lost them because, despite being their “best friend”, they ghosted me for their new partner.

And like I’ve been here a couple of times so I’m kinda used to it but I’m even more upset that whenever I vent to people, people don’t seem to sympathize with me. I vented to one of my other friends and all they said was essentially “well to be fair I did this to you too. It’s just normal for this to happen” no sympathy at all.

Idk when they said that it kinda made me feel like I don’t deserve to be someone’s close friend, or someone who is at the same priority than their other friends and I only deserve to be the extra friend if they have no one else to talk to. It’s been kinda eating me up inside. I’m kinda tired of trying so hard to prove I’m worth someone’s time. It makes me want to cut off everyone out of my life but I just can’t bc they’re kinda all I have. And finding new friends is so hard when you’re too burned out to engage in interest groups and finding friends in a socializing site/group such as r/MakeNewFriendsHere or r/NeedAFriend or r/r4r don’t take much interest in anyone who isn’t female. 

I just want to be with people who actually care about me. Not have an unhealthy attachment with me, not the exact opposite just the healthy middle spectrum. 

But it looks like I may not be deserving of that.",2022-07-26 18:28:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597337489,6,/r/lonely/comments/w8r6os/i_feel_so_unloved/,,0,3,I feel so unloved

You used to apologise about it  
How often you wrote to me

I’d wake up to a dozen texts  
And I’d reply to each one in the morning

I’d get excited when my wrist vibrated

I loved being the one you spammed  
I loved being the one you went to

You became part of my routine  
And I became part of yours

I wish we could go back to that routine

This may seem silly to a lot of people. It's just texting, it's just sending stuff.

It  wasn't to me. It meant the world to me. It meant you were thinking  about me for even half a second. And then a lot of halves. And I was  over the moon because of it.

Until  it stopped. First slowly, then suddenly. And you became less  responsive. And I'd see you online, knowing I was just another annoying  notification.

I don't want to feel that small ever again - just hoping that burning my stare into your chat name would make you start typing.

5076,w8ta1z,MonkeywithFeelings,"I am in a bad place right now. Everything has just become a bit too much and I really need to vent. So that is just what this is.
I feel incredibly alone. I generally like living on my own and am an optimistic person normally but the past few months I really miss having someone who I can trust fully, someone to share my day with and cuddle on the couch with, someone to fall asleep next to. Someone to do anything with.

I don't have any real friends, I have a few friendships but I see them only a few times a year, and none of those are people who I would really call in case of an emergency.
I did have 2 people who I was very close with in the past but both of the relationships didn't work in the past. I don't know if it will work now but I am not in a state to say right now. But I can't let those go, I am still with my mind in the past and don't know if I am ever able to really let that go.

I know I am desperate for some attention at the moment and will accept anything that gives me a little form of human contact. I am swiping around a bit on dating apps, never swiping right or talking to anyone because I know I am not ready for a relationship now, and I don't want casual sex. I have done something like that in the past and I know it isn't real, it isn't really love or care for someone but I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to fool myself with the feeling of someone that cares for me.

I've lost my mother quite some time ago and my father isn't the comforting type of person. I really have no one to talk to, to share my feelings with and to comfort me when I'm feeling down. I think it is really my mother that I miss and although I know I won't get her back but I just want someone that will love me unconditionally as well and feel at home again.

I really could go on hours and hours about this but this is it I think. I just really needed to vent.",2022-07-26 19:53:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614059539,7,/r/lonely/comments/w8ta1z/i_truly_feel_no_one_really_cares_for_me_or_truly/,,0,1,I truly feel no one really cares for me or truly loves me

5078,w8tuso,maroonedowl,"I am so so lonely. I have so many interests, like psychiatry, hip-hop, rock, piano, reading, learning etc etc. and I have absolutely no one to share this with. Nobody at all. All my friends have completely different interests and up until few days back it didn't bother me as much because I'd tell myself that friendship and relationships are beyond this. But sometimes I just wanna share or talk and everytime I do that with my friends I feel like they are burdened to respond. And off late I have been feeling like they are growing distant because of how different we are. I don't know if I'll ever overcome this. 

I can't be in a relationship because I am not girlfriend material and not pretty enough. I had a scene with a boy and he listens to the same music and I want him to be my friend so that I have someone who I can bounce ideas off but I don't think he's interested in that. Why would he be? All of my other friends are dating or are in situationships with someone so that occupies most of their time. Don't get me wrong, I do a lot of internships, practice my piano a lot, and keep myself busy. But it's at night when all of this starts sinking in that I have no one and that I probably will never have anyone and it's crippling. 

It's so crippling. I am an extrovert and I need company. Will I ever find company? Do I deserve company? I am so so alone. Should I just kill myself so all of this goes.

5089,w8vzb5,windblowstheotherway,"For the last 4 years, I’ve been creating my own story that reflects my mental state.

So let's start at the beginning, where my story, Chalin (or Kaleen), began.

In the summer of year 1, the prototype Chalin was created, with the main character being Kara.

She was pretty naive, the typical hero vs villain and honestly pretty empty, with her ability being Sound Manipulation. Why? I liked it, cause it was versatile and also because it meant you could scream your heart out without anyone hearing you. This was my crying phase, and honestly it was pretty cringey for me:/

Year two, I trashed prototype Chalin and just started again, with the baseline of Kara. In that time, I managed to make a *lot* of characters for different time periods and different places though like half of the older characters never meet the younger characters and half of the younger characters are stuck in another land. 

Despite being created last year, Kara was starting to get developed in year 2. Kara’s personality was summed up to show a ton of expressions but none of them were real and only wanted to keep the peace by never getting into fights or getting angry.

At the time, I was crying a lot but I could never get openly angry, since any signs of aggression, slamming the door, walking around angrily, or other stuff was not tolerated and you would just get more punishments (although I guess it wasn’t that bad).

Year three, Hanna Asashina (created in year two) was starting to get some character development, but not anything that complicated. Covid ended and school could distract me, and I left Chalin alone, and concluded that the story had ended, with a new character coming out to replace Ark: Ru Toko, a wanderer.

Year 4, I started having violent urges to hit something, someone, or even myself. And Ark got some character development too. He was a villain that was mainly neutral but slightly manipulated by Juke. Anyways, Ark was more of Kara’s real feelings than Kara was herself and he went out to get rid of obstacles.",2022-07-26 21:41:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617991907,3,/r/lonely/comments/w8vzb5/draft_ask_questions_if_youd_like_also_ill_rewrite/,,0,1,draft (ask questions if you'd like also i'll rewrite this when I feel bored)

5098,w8x14n,mydickisbiggerthanur,"Okay so I worked at a PC and phone repair shop for more than 10 years and I really loved my job. It wasn't too hard, not too time consuming, let me a lot of free time to play video games and chat with friends and a lot of clients were extremely nice when I had almost nothing to do in the end. Perfect job for a lazy piece of shit like me. 

Less than a month ago, a childhood friend calls me to ask if I can get the files from a corrupted SD card. I say sure, thinking it's strange he contacted me since my shop is 1 hour from where he lives and there's one closer to him. I think nothing of it, maybe it's some porn or pics of his tiny Weiner and he doesn't want a stranger to see them. Tell my best friend about it and she's getting suspicious. I say it's her paranoia again. 

Next day, the friend arrives with the SD card, looks really nervous. Says something in the lines of ""don't look at it too much, this has to stay between us, I trust you bro"". Tell best friend, she says I should get rid of the card and not even touch it, tell the friend it was too corrupted to get anything. Should have listened to her but I call her a paranoid bitch and go work on it.

It was porn. But ... You can probably guess what the problem was. Let's just say that the oldest person in those pictures seems to be middle school aged. So I freak out, call best friend. She says I need to call the cops so I do it. They come, confiscate the SD card and my working computer. Friend is arrested. I'm a hero. WRONG ! 

Boss gets angry because they took my working computer and now people are talking about what happened and clients are going to leave us. And all my pedo defenders ""friends"" are threatening me because I snitched. 

So now I have no job, no friends except suicidal bitch best friend, my parents don't talk to me anymore and my brother is in Ukraine. My life is miserable and I really don't know if it's still worth trying. I'll be 40 next year, no girlfriend, no bitches in sight ...

He had mange on his lower legs. He sat down in the shade cause it was really hot. I tried to go up to him and give him some water, but he ran away. I started to follow him and call animal control. He kept moving so it was hard to tell them an exact location. I went up to a trucker and asked if he had any food I could give the dog. The trucker gave me some stale bread. It really didn’t make that much of a difference because the dog kept walking away.

5175,w98fu6,Invisibleman021183,"Happy birthday to me. It's my birthday today. Nobody cares. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend, and my family doesn't care about it. 

You know how I was seeing a therapist for my loneliness and extreme depression due to partially loneliness. Being alone is literally driving me insane. The therapist was cold and uncaring. She called my low self-esteem irrational. She started lecturing me on my core beliefs were negative which of course they are and I had to be more positive. I've heard this a million times and my negative beliefs are from years of negative reinforcement. Being called names, being rejection, and being alone for so long has caused me to internalize all the negativity that people have thrown at me. I tried to bring it up that her advice wasn't helpful but she didn't have time for me even ending the session early with an uncaring, I have to go. I called today to ask for an update on transferring therapists and they said, you called last week, there is nothing I can do, then they said, I'm hanging up before hanging up on me. Nobody ever calls me back and not having anyone to vent to is making me worse. I just want someone to talk to who has empathy and at least tries to help. I give up and they obviously don't want to help me. I said from the moment I talked to the person who takes your information and put me on the waiting list, that I think this place hates me. I haven't even had an IRL friend in years and am doing not great. I thought I was being paranoid and why would they hate me? I'm almost 40 and can tell when someone doesn't like me because it's happened so many times. I suck at life, I will always be alone, and even the professionals who are supposed to help me hate me. Someone tell me how I'm too negative and will never find anyone with my attitude. Even better tell me I don't mind being lonely.  I've reached a new low. I'm just lonely and wish someone IRL cared. One person. I said it before but I will have to be alone the rest of my miserable and hopefully short life.",2022-07-27 07:41:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642202607,13,/r/lonely/comments/w98fu6/therapy_hung_up_on_me_haha_also_its_my_birthday/,,0,14,Therapy hung up on me haha also it's my birthday

All I do is sleep and work, the summer went by in the blink of an eye and i couldn’t do the stuff i wanted to because I dont have the courage to do it on my own. The concept of making friends just seems so weird and impossible. All of my relationships ended with me being cheated on or them not caring about me anymore, I havent been touched in over 6 years, I just want to have someone to care about and them care about me and be here, at this point I’m considering selling myself just to feel some kind of attention and affection, even if its just for a night. I physically can’t take this anymore. I’m so tired.
Edit: for everyone saying to just go out and make friends, its not that easy, i have social anxiety, i physically cannot just go out and talk to strangers and hope that they will like me enough to be my friend, and for the others telling me to get out, i do go to the get out to the gym sometimes, but the thought of going up to someone there to try and be their friend makes me feel sick to my stomach seeing as if theres more than 3 people there i usually dont end up going in anyways.

I’ve always been the type that enjoyed having a few very close friendships instead of a multitude of surface-level friendships, but that backfires in situations like the one I just mentioned above. 


I made one friend at a job in early 2019 after not having any irl friends for almost two years straight, and we both hung out a lot that year. Due to logistical issues involving him moving away, we didn’t hangout at all in 2020 or 2021, and then we only hung out one time in February of this year. However, we still had weekly multiple-hour-long phone calls throughout the time we didn’t see each other in person. Back in May of this year, he suddenly ghosted me over a super small disagreement. 


That leads me to now. I have zero irl friends. I was close to my cousin five years ago, but we stopped talking in 2018 due to stupid extended-family drama. Because of that drama, my immediate family also stopped having get togethers with my extended family, so I don’t have a relationship with them either. I’m not exaggerating when I say the only person I speak to outside of my immediate family is my one online friend. I could leave my phone off for a year and not return to a single notification. 


The way my social life has turned out is really starting to fuck with my head at this point. I feel completely alone and out of touch with reality or society. Even when I see people on here or other forums talking about being lonely, it seems that they still at least have some old buddies they could catch up with if they wanted to, family members, old classmates, etc. My one online friend has some social difficulties, but she’s formed 100 times more social connections throughout her life than I have. It feels like I’ve literally gone through life as a ghost.


This post is long and no one will read it, but it’s just frustrating. I’m well aware at this point that 99.9999% of my current situation is my own fault, and I know I didn’t take any initiative to make friends throughout my life. I’ve actually done the complete opposite and turned down quite literally 20+ people from school, work, etc.  who wanted to hangout, play video games together, etc. because I’m a judgmental fuck.

5195,w9etcz,Big-Addition8154,"For context I had a girlfriend for over a year and a half and for the last couple months of being in the relationship I'd really been wanting to get out of it. Everytime I tried to talk about how I felt to her she would turn it against me or get upset over something about it leading to me comforting her instead. I have some online friends but I'm not close to any of them nor would I want to be. I have a brother aswell, but he's a lot younger than me and I couldn't talk to him about anything on a personal level to do with mental health.

During the relationship I'd been through quite a lot and I'd done quite a lot of things I'm not proud of. I tried to kill myself and self harmed quite a lot leaving scars I still have. This was about half way through it. I'm far from perfect and I think I'm mostly the reason it didn't work out because of how controlling I felt.

 I didn't control what she did or what she wore and I believe that everybody should be able to have their own choice on that, but when I can't even say that it's making me really uncomfortable without being screamed at and told I'm an asshole It's painful.

Theres some other things i'd rather not say that had happened in that relationship. but I've shut off every emotion I have and I can't cry anymore. I just feel empty, and I can't talk to anyone because I'm afraid of what they'd think or that they'd think its immature or stupid. 

I don't want to be in a relationship again because I'm afraid of the feelings it'll bring back or the things ill constantly be worrying about or the million ways i'd mess it up. 

I desperately want love but I can't have it. I'd feel so controlling and not say anything about it leading to me just destroying myself over and over. I have no idea what to do and I can't talk to anybody at all. 

This was my first serious relationship i've ever had and it ended about a month ago. I'm still a teenager and I end up falling for any girl I talk to when they seem caring but quickly shut out those feelings because it'd only ever end worst for me if I didn't.

I don't even know if anybodys going to read this or even see this but even if a single person does its enough.

5201,w9fgmv,[deleted],"Honestly, I felt nothing at first. Being a huge introvert myself, I understood that some people needed time alone but the realization that my best friend is ignoring me is daunting because she was the only person I had. She’s on Twitter talking about hockey and I’m here wondering why she hasn’t texted me back in months.

During July 4th (her birthday), we would always watch the fireworks together and joke about whatever. This year, I sat alone at the docks watching fireworks and with each explosion, it felt like my heart was exploding too. I wanted to jump into the ocean so badly.

We’ve been friends for over a decade. I remember when we first met super clearly. She was a timid child who hid behind her mom and barely spoke English. I asked her to play jump rope with me, introduced her to all my friends, and helped her become accustomed to the U.S. (Ngl, I miss the innocence of childhood and how easy it was to make friends with everyone)

Over the years, she was always there for me because I was there for her when she first immigrated. She stopped my 2nd suicide attempt, offered me a place to stay when I wanted to run away, and held me in her arms whenever my mom cursed the shit out of me.

Now I’m left wondering if she regrets saving my life or having ever met me. All the people I’ve given a piece of my heart to always seem to leave and I wonder what’s wrong with me. I’ve asked classmates their impressions of me to find a root cause and their general responses were that I had a scary stare, am pretty, polite, and a workaholic. Besides the scary stare part, I don’t understand why I’m a people repellant?? Maybe I’m too emotional or depressive? I’ve tried smiling way more but as time goes on, I feel fake

Anyway come back to present, I have been on multiple sites for LGBTQ+ people who are ""still in the closet"".
Everytime they told me they are scared, feel pressured, know the parents are homophobic and others always told them to come out, they will feel better, if your family don't accept you then they don't deserve... And of course I understand but I tend to think that having people acknowledging you shouldn't be something that important in your life.
As long as you are able to accept and love yourself then you should be fine
Of course if you want to tell them then just do it but it's also important to know that coming out isn't a step to start being yourself.

Today is my 18th birthday. A big day you would say, but to be honest I can't wait until it's over. I'm just sitting at home with my parents and brother, forcing myself to smile and act like I'm having a great birthday. But I'm not.

The only 'happy-birthday wishes' I got were from my parents, my brother, a text from my sister and a call from my grandparents. Oh, and don't forget the automatic email from my work... :') I haven't heard anything from my 'friends' or other family members. I guess people forget about me easily. And that's fine.

I know I should hold onto my life, since its my most valuable thing I have, but on days like these being alive just feels like a chore. But I'll guess we have to move on to live/'fight' another day.

5209,w9gs6n,RagingVagabond,"Going to keep this as short as possible. Best friend and I got into an argument. They felt insecure over something, something they really had no reason to feel insecure over, and I said, "" gonna use the same advice you given to me when I am in my head. You are in your head, get the fuck over it."" Only to have them start crying, saying I am smug about this and think they are stupid. Granted, they never said the advice I gave word for word, it is just how I process it when they do speak to me during my insecure moments. But the other parts? I value this person so goddman much. We been there for each other for years, helping each other when ever the other needed it, sharing in the highs and lows of our lives and the growth we made. All of it to be tossed aside by them because of one bad comment? I apologized and spilt my heart out to them later that day. Explaining how I thought, felt, and how they were so wrong in thinking I felt/thought that way about them in their insecurity. Only for days to pass and get ""I really dont know what words to say, but we are good."" Then never really talk to me again.  Weeks pass, and yesterday they comment about "" so am I just never going to see you again?"" And I was honest. I brought up the issue of the one sided responses, how it seems they dont care and that I am not worth the effort to put words forth. An attempt too address this problem and fix/ learn from it so our friendship can stay secure and grow. Only to be ignored again all day and night. Presumably because they were with their SO, the source of insecurity that caused this whole event. And now, I feel so empty. Like I really did not matter to them as much as they said. That my friendship is only valuable when its convenient to them. That the moment any effort needs to come forth from the other person (takes two to make a friendship after all) that I am marked as not worth the energy. So today, I just feel empty and cold.

It's okay to cry and feel lonely. Please don't think that all good things have come to an end. You don't have to be strong, you can cry, you can ask for help, you can stay a little longer in bed.

This is so complicated but I’ll try my best to explain. I (f26) and Marshall (m28) have been off-and-on for about 5 years now. After a big argument a couple of years ago, I decided to cut all ties with him. Last year I decided to reach out to him on a friendly basis to see how he was and also online exclusive only (we live in different cities) All was going fine and smoothly until one day I didn’t reply to him on his terms and he absolutely snapped, slandered me on line. In that moment he also said that he was talking to someone else which I wished him well on (he didn’t like that) so I left them alone.

Two months passes and he decides he doesn’t want to be a child and to come back and talk like an adult with me. About three weeks past and one day he starts acting flirty online with me. This is where I’m a sucker and start falling for it. Before anything goes any further I ask if he’s still with his gf which he replies “no, we are still friends though” I said that I hope that’s he’s telling the truth because I don’t want to be the reason someone gets hurt to which he reassures me once again.

So one thing leads to another and we express our sexual desires to one another and I guess have cyber sex which he is the one in total control of. He keeps asking me for pics, I have BDD (which he’s full aware of) so I send what I feel comfortable with and which he keeps saying he loves. It was great.
The next morning he was totally different. I tried to just play it cool and sweet at the same time but he just didn’t want to speak to me at all. I asked what was up and he replied that he was just busy and will be that day - “but if you want you can send me nudes because that would be hot” He also says that he will talk when he can. I told him to have a great day and we will talk when we can. Night time comes and still nothing from him, I send him voices messages that he used to love but nothing so I left it. Leaving it became two days, two days became three days and well you get the picture. It’s now been three weeks. In that time I’ve sent messages asking where he is and if he’s ok. And yes even sent nudes and nothing.  Two days ago I noticed that his Instagram that was on private was public again (he blocked me when we had a fight and followed me back. I never followed him back) I clicked on to see what has happened and low and behold all these photos of him and his gf are on there. The one I’m assuming he’s had all along but told me he didn’t. My heart drops for myself and for her. I scrolled through the pics and one that made me stop is that on those days where I was sat home wondering where he was, he had taken her to a sunflower field, something that he knew that was a dream of mine to experience and one that he said he would take me to. That hurts so bad. Another thing I noticed is that he recently cut her hair and died it, it looks nice but I would say that as it looks similar to what I wanted at the start of the year and one that he showed love for.

I just feel so dumb and confused. I understand that he has a girlfriend and he needs to spend time with her. But it’s the sudden lie about her, and it’s the sudden ghosting of me when I haven’t done anything. It’s also how he’s public now with her on social media that it makes me think he just done that so I could see the pics of them together.

I just feel so used and lost.",2022-07-27 21:11:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619250197,4,/r/lonely/comments/w9q4rx/a_guy_i_thought_cared_for_me_is_breaking_my_heart/,,0,14,A guy I thought cared for me is breaking my heart and I don’t know why

To leave behind the boys I've loved before and let me down, the parents who just can't stop making me their marriage counsellor, the society for whom I will never be enough unless I absolutely surrender myself to their ideas of what a woman should be.

I don’t recognize myself in the mirror and I’m embarrassed to go out. I am so tired of being stuck in this lonely depression hole with no friends- and no husband and family to grow- while others who haven’t done even a tenth of the work I’ve done- have what I have wanted my whole life.

5308,w9vtet,Oronomoro,"Hello everyone, you can call me Oro, 23 years old and in college.  


As of lately I´ve been doing a lot of introspection, thinking and feeling. In what I like to call the hero´s journey (a coming of age lol) Im trying to create a personal philosopy in which to find ease and strenght.

I´ve come to a small conclussion. That there are wounds that most people carry just because we exist as human beings.

**1.-Loneliness (Because of our physical condition of social beings)**

Being lonely makes the hardships of life harder, society tends to prey on the weak, and loneliness can make a vulnerable person feel even more so.

**2.- The Void (Because of our ability to reason and give meaning to our life).**

I´ve percieved and seen that most people carry an existencial void. An emptiness that cannot be filled with mundane distractions. Some people´s answer to this is religion (a valid one). I don´t know what is my answer but I feel it´s giving meaning/direction to my life.

As such I am in the process of finding out what to do with the second wound.

But right now, not just for me, but for everyone in my community that has ever felt alone I want to create a space where you can meet new people and form genuine connections. Work together towards a goal or share your ideas and personal proyects.

Something bigger and more welcoming than a friends group (where one or various can be formed of course) and more chill so it doesn´t feel like a church or a cult.

The first and only idea I´ve had so far is to post an ad in the school´s community board saying something along the lines of “Hellooo, have you felt lonely or want to make new friends? My name is Oro, I´ll be at the school´s library “x” floor from (example) “6 pm to 11 pm”, you can join me, chat or study together”

Please, I´ll be extremely grateful if you could give me feedback as to how improve and make this space possible. If anyone knows of any social proyect similar (as in deals with loneliness and creates community) please share it here so I can look into it. Anything. I would like to point out that this community is aimed towards the people at my school.

There is no social spot to hangout. I’m a skateboarder and there isn’t an ounce of skateboarding here..

I don’t come from parents or family so friends that I make are my family and I have none within 2 hours of me. I don’t talk to anyone regularly no one is ever calling me on  any day because they love me, I know the only people that care about my existence are those that have bills for me.

5339,w9zd6l,Thegraduate1333,"I don't even know where to begin. I have so much on my mind. I've had a really difficult past two weeks that's made all of these feelings surface. For the past year and a half I've just been working endlessly at my dream job, to the point of burn out because I have been trying to outrun these dark feelings that have built up inside me over the years. I don't have much of a social life anyways. Well, long story short, my car mechanically failed yesterday so I had to take off work which is a rarity. I have nobody else to talk with. 

I've had it rough, fighting for life since the day I was born. I was born with a rare blood disease. I wasn't supposed to make it but at the last moment, a stranger who had the same blood type, donated blood for the transfusion that saved my life. I've been on borrowed time since and all I've experienced are tragedies. I'm not saying my life is worse off than anybody else because it's not. All of our own problems are difficult in their own way because we are the only ones who experience them. I never compare my experience with another because we can't feel what someone else feels in those moments. I can only empathize and only begin to imagine what it would be like. 

I've never purposely been a bad person. Sure I've done dumb shit as a kid but as I've grown into an adult, I realize the consequences of my actions. I grew up to a lot of bullying and family trouble at home. Having experienced that my whole life, I have never put someone else down nor have I purposely hurt anybody because I'd never want someone to feel the way I have. Sometimes things happen and we hurt people in different ways like being cold or doing something compulsive, both of which I have done. Sometimes I just don't think things through. Like cheating on a loved one. But the biggest thing is that I always learn from these experiences and take away what not to do in these situations moving forward. I always try to be a better human being than I was yesterday. I've always been the kind of person to give another my jacket, even when it is pouring rain out. I try my best to think of others before myself. My rule of thumb has been to treat others as I'd want to be treated because of how shitty most people have treated me. A reoccurring theme in my life has been me helping others only for them to screw me over in some way, shape or form. That's caused me to be guarded when considering letting someone in my life. 

The shatterpoint that has shaped my entire adult life started in 2013, when I met the love of my life up until this point. From the moment I laid eyes on her, I just knew she was the one. I didn't even know her at the time, I drove past when she was dating a friend (who treated her like absolute shit). I had this incredible feeling like butterflies that flew from my stomach to my head, telling me that I had to get to know her. Well weeks later, I had that chance and we clicked instantly at a party. We hung out the whole night and the rest was history. Never in my life did I share such a strong bond with anyone nor came close to how close we were. For the first time ever, I had this wonderful human being who actually wanted to be around me and talk to me as much as possible.  She cared more about me than anyone else and anyone ever since. I'm not going to gaslight and say I was a perfect boyfriend but I always cared about her and did the best I could. We'd fight and had broken up a couple times but we'd find our way back to each other. This is the first time I felt unconditional love. After a couple years of dating consistently, I had a plan to get married and move away with her. I had so much saved up and we were so close to marriage. She was the only person in my life that truly knew me, better than I did. She cared so much for me and I cared for her. I almost died from an internal infection in 2014 and she was the only one by my side. I got through it partly because she was by my side helping me fight for my life. Towards the end, she began to drift while I continued to get closer. It was like we switched places in the relationship. I changed my bad habits that was the only thing that put us at odds, but it was too late. Then in 2015, my life wouldbe permanently scarred like a dark cloud over my head, drawn with sharpie marker. Towards the end of the year she broke it off for good and I haven't seen her since. I still have feelings for her, 7 years later, and I've waited for her while she started dating again and moved on with her life. I cried so hard. Everything I had worked so hard for had begun to unravel.

In the following years, I began to get heavily into hard drugs. I almost flunked out of college because I had lost sight of everything, it was all pointless to me without her. I tried to move on but how do you move on from something and especially someone, so significant. First I had gotten into the Xanax that I was selling. Things were spiraling quick. The Xanax made me into a zombie, literally. I almost killed myself and a few friends while driving under the influence. That was enough to make me seek help and eventually got off the Xanax. But to get off the Xanax I started using opiates. Eventually I fell into heroin because I built up a tolerance to the pills. I didn't want to feel the pain, I still don't. I didn't want to feel the weightlessness of my broken heart, knowing she wasn't coming back. I still wake in the middle of the night hearing her voice, and feeling her right beside me. It's been 7 years getting deeper into addiction. From 2016 til 2019 I was a mess; I was nodding out, I stopped taking care of myself, got into car accidents, lost friends both friendships and their actual lives. It comes with the territory. During those early days of using, I found myself in very dark and sketchy situations/places. I spent my life savings, and was selling my belongings to support my habit. I had a ton of Bitcoin that'd I sold which would become worth a fortune later on. I was punishing myself every day for letting such an incredible relationship fall apart. 

Eventually I learned how to live with the loss of her by using heroin, how ironic that name has become. At least I feel somewhat better in a fucked up way, enough to work and continue wandering through this life. I can't even imagine what life would look like had I not found this drug. I don't inject it, thankfully I am deathly afraid of needless. I just snort it. I realized I wasn't going to live long with the trajectory I was on. Like a comet that looks like it's going to impale earth but instead it was always doomed to burn and disintegrate in the atmosphere. That woke me up to start taking proper steps to get clean heroin that doesn't contain fentanyl, the adulterant that is killing my fellow users every single day. I knew deep down I wanted to live but didn't know where to begin. So I started to learn how to use less, just enough to feel the warmth inside that it gives (I've always felt cold. Literally and figuratively throughout my life) and just enough to not be sick but less than I was taking to completely check out. I got back on my feet, moved back with my mother and started working various jobs. Things were beginning to level out. 

Fast forward to last year when I started my dream job. Everything up til that point was so bleak, like the afternath of a devastating war. Since getting this new job, I've found purpose again. I started to take care of myself, work on my perspective on life. Become a beacon of positivity starting in my workplace and eventually all aspects of life. I was tired of being miserable day in/day out. I was able to save up for the first time in years, and move out on my own again. Buy my own car. Support myself while not struggling every day to get by. Finally I began to truly live again, in my own broken kind of way. I go out to concerts by myself, doing activities by myself. It was an unbelievable transformation. I stopped hating myself, stopped focusing on the love lost, and began to put faith in myself and live more hopeful. It sucked I couldn't share this with anyone but I was proud of myself for doing it all on my own, for myself for once. The biggest perk of the new job was being able to get to know my two little sisters. One who is in grade school and the other an infant just on the cusp of Kindergarten. During the past year I've been able to get close with them because of my job. They live 3 hours away, which is a trip but still reasonable. Having those two girls in my life had my heart full for the first time in such a very long while. I never had a family like that before. Every time I walked through the door they'd scream my name and give me a big hug. The smiles on their faces would ahine bright through all the darkness behind me. The youngest was hesistant at first but the older showed her that I was someone to be trusted, family. Things were really looking up. Life can be fucking crazy. From a lonely, bleak existence to a family man. I was actually... happy for once? 

Occasionally I'll fall backwards and get into that pattern of thinking. Let's be real, getting out of a 7 year depression isn't going to change in a year. It takes work and a lot of effort. The negativity comes naturally. I have to stop and count my blessings often. But between work and my family, I'd be able to largely ignore the negative thoughts. 

And then it all started to crumble, just like 2015 and the instances before that. These past two weeks have been the ultimate test of my progress. Starting with my father and two baby sister's moving half way across the country. Long story short, my neurotic step mother (the mother of my sisters) forced my father's hand and he had no choice but to keep the family as together as possible, as well as partially out of fear that she would do something crazy and hurt him (which has happened before, I was there for one of her ""episodes""). But I would soon find out that I would not be included in their plan. They told me at the end of May that they were planning on moving across the country. I couldn't believe it. I fought so hard for our little family. Other family members tried to intervene. I even hired a lawyer to talk with my father. But nothing worked. They put the house on the market last month and the house sold within days. The closing was last week. It was weird seeing the house empty. I hated my step mom from the beginning and wanted nothing to do with her and that house. But everything changed once those two girls came to be. And after all that, I had to say my goodbyes. How could I explain to an 8 yr old and 3 yr old what was happening? I have been so worried for my father being isolated from everyone. I have been so worried for my sister's well being. My biggest fear is that I'll be a stranger to them because I won't be able to see them and spend a week or two each month like I had been. All these moments of my two sisters growing up except I was missing from their milestones in life. It all feels so surreal. Saying goodbye to my family was the hardest thing I had to do since saying goodbye to my ex. Seeing my innocent sister, caught in the middle of this ridiculous situation, crying and knowing that she won't see me in person for a long time, smashed my fucking heart back into a million pieces. She's just old enough to understand something wasn't right but still too young to understand her batshit crazy mother has just torn her brother from our family. I hadn't been able to cry since 2016 because I cried so much from 2015-16, except when my best friend (my dog I had for a long time) passed away from cancer. Well, I cried that day with my sister, then my dad came upstairs and cried with us together. These were our last moment together for the foreseeable future. The 3 hour drive home was unlike anything that I had felt in a very long long time. Like leaving the scene of a murder. All was silent that drive, tears streaming down my cheeks. I hadn't cried since then because I've been trying to block it. Scared the negativity will creep in, and even more afraid of going to that place I was on that day. 

This past week has been one thing after another, bad news upon bad news. And it's just grinding those broken heart pieces into dust. Writing this and reliving these moments has made me cry more than I have in years. Every single time I get close to anyone they either leave me, die, or end up hating me. I haven't had a best friend in years. Whenever I message old friends they ignore me, act like the years we knew each other had never existed. How can people be so cold? I don't understand why I don't get have even just one person to be close with. All I've ever wanted was to love and be loved. But all I get to experience is the cascading weight of loneliness, crashing all around me. It follows me wherever I go. My kind but broken heart trapped within 88ft thick walls. I've been doing right by those I encounter, even strangers, for years now. I don't understand why I have to suffer alone. Am I being punished because my medicine is unconventional? Is it because I did stupid shit when I was a teenager? Or is it because I never was supposed to belong in this world, my life having been saved when it was supposed to be damned? Will I ever find love again, have a family of my own? In finishing my story up to this point, I reflect upon Van Gogh's final words, ""la tristesse durera toujours.""",2022-07-28 03:59:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1510721380,3,/r/lonely/comments/w9zd6l/my_story/,,0,0,my story.

5352,wa0tn5,CdrWulffe7,"""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.""
-Confucius

Hello fellow redditors, in this post I'm going to offer a brief plan of action as to how to combat our social isolation which plagues us so thoroughly. Feel free to combine any of these objectives I offer, though I highly recommend striving for all of them.

1. Seek purpose!
My first year of college was rather demanding and it inspired me to seek out my own meaning to life. This ended up redirecting me to the Catholic faith I grew up with. I recognize not all of you are fellow Catholics, however becoming an active member of a religion or spiritual group will help us realize that we are unique individuals made with a purpose by a being far more powerful and wise than we will ever be. Thus we have value that nobody can take away from us.

2. Improve your body!
Discipline is the road to success. It is our only true friend when times are hard. I understand many here are not physically active, so for those in looking for a start I have detailed a simple plan below to get us on our way to success:
Week 1:
1/4 mi run/walk
10 pushups
10 sit ups
Every week add 5 situps/pushups and every month add another 1/4 mile. We may speed up or slow down as necessary, but never quit on ourselves. If you can't do a full pushup, for example, try to do one without your knees and complete the rest with your knees. I highly advise finding a buddy and/or making a group to keep each other accountable. Not only will you stay motivated, but you'll practice talking to others.

3. Set your world in order!
Every day, we are presented with things that enforce our belief that we have little value. This may start as simply as making our beds, as Admiral McRaven suggests in his book. Perhaps we need to stop watching pornography or clean our rooms more. This one is a little more open to your personal situation, but always strive to improve. We don't need to compare ourselves to others, it is better to compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, and be better. After all, we promised our future selves we would do better for their sake.

4. Go on an adventure!
A great place to meet new people may be things such as museums or art exhibits for the urban members among us or the hiking trails or parks for our rural friends. No matter where we are, we must push past our boundaries and see the beauty of this world we inhabit. There is so much for us to see and smell and hear and taste and touch. We must live because why not? Out there is our future; we could meet others and talk to them about the great forest trees or the long painting strokes. There is always an opportunity in front of us; we just have to take it.

5. Never give up!
There will be times where we want to quite and return to our old, safe ways. But we can never relent. I have faith that you can succeed; if you don't believe me, the fact that I spent time and energy typing this up proves that I believe in you. You took the time to read this, showing you're willing to improve. That is the first step: willingness. Trust me, simply make that first step and keep going. You'll thank yourself one day.

Note: I again advise you meet others in the comments and band together to fight your loneliness. They'll be your friends now and they'll help you succeed. If any of you want to talk to me, feel free to reach out. The college I go to is demanding but I'll do my best to help anyone who needs it. Take care, and remember, carry away a small stone.",2022-07-28 05:14:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1411743414,2,/r/lonely/comments/wa0tn5/shortterm_plan_to_combat_loneliness/,,0,0,Short-term Plan to Combat Loneliness

5366,wa2ekv,Fox_NotAFurry,"Hello. I know for 13, calling myself depressed when hormones are all over the place and I’m just starting to “change”, is a bit unbelievable but no, I have depression and I have yet to tell anyone. 

In second and third grade I was bullied into depression by a kid we’ll refer to as “sam”
Sam would tell me nobody loved me, or cared for me, he pushed me around and threatened to lie to my mother about hurting him. I went to therapy and was diagnosed with depression. In fourth grade it stopped, but something much worse happened. My best friend (F9) (we were both 9 at the time) whom I had a crush on had died. This sent me back into depression, while also adding some anxiety and panic attacks in the mix. I had a existential crisis at the age of nine.

Cut to the start of middle school and my depression is gone. My anxiety is still there and my panic attacks are more rare. School was rough. The pandemic was at its worst so I was in school one day and virtual the next. I had a small friend group of 4 (Including me). One of my friends was super toxic and I had to cut him off. He harassed me for 2 more months until school ended.

The summer before 7th grade (last summer) I broke my leg. I had to do virtual for 5 months by myself (with parent help) until I could return to school. All of my friends had abandoned me when I returned. Two old friends invited me into their friend group which I am still currently in. Cut to now I have only hung out with 1 of them this whole summer. I’m more lonely and depressed than ever but I don’t plan on telling anyone. The only reason that is , is because I know I won’t hurt myself and being lonely/depressed isn’t hurting anyone.

I believe when I return to school it will become worse but I know how to deal with it (I think)

I only had one friend text me and even after a while she stopped talking to me, none of my other friends have bothered to check in on me or ask how I’m doing.

I also repeatedly tried to reach out to another friend of mine who I genuinely love like a parent, like I’m not joking I’ve known them sense 2nd grade and I love them for life, they were the person to really be there for me. 

But for some reason they keep ignoring me, never responded to my texts, and what makes me mad is that they’re constantly online on Xbox and it’s like wtf why are you ignoring me, I just gave up and honestly I really don’t wanna say but it kinda makes me a bit mad. We hung out during Spring Break what’s so different now?

I don’t have many family members I could hang out with, and the only one that’s near my age was quarantined in her home for the majority of the summer and I only saw her a couple days ago. It was kinda fun but the entire time she was on her phone, I tired playing a game with her and after every (well we only played 2) level she would be on her phone for like 5 minutes and after only playing for like 15 minutes she just wants to stop. I ended up watching a movie that she wanted me to watch and I stuck through it, I never went on my phone and I never interrupted. 

But when I showed her the movie I wanted her to watch she was constantly on her phone and missing all the jokes. The movie we were watching was heavily reliant on it’s visual and dialogue humor, and she’s just on her fucking phone watching TikTok. She didn’t even want to watch it first even though I watched her movie that was two fucking hours long and mine was like almost half that.

This was by far my worst summer in my life, it really showed me how truly alone I am and how no one gives a shit about me. I only really did a couple of new things and discovered some new shows and movies but other than that I did nothing. I wished at the very least I could’ve hung out with my friend, or talked to them, but no, no one fucking cares.

The worst is how I lost them.

My 1️⃣ first loss in my life was my cat. Nobody can imagine just how close we were. She passed about a year ago. 

Then I used to have a group of very close friends. We were 4 in total. We’d tell each other everything. We loved and cared for each other. I brought them all together and we were best friends. Then some day, couple fights happened. I lost contact with one of them.

Of this group was my very best friend. I seriously loved her. We knew each others for years. She’d make me laugh just through texto. But then I got my 2️⃣ second loss. She told me she don’t actually really like me. That she finds me annoying. That she can’t keep faking it and she has no energy for me anymore. That she can get similar friendship as ours, more easily, with other people.

My 3️⃣ third and most difficult loss was my (ex) boyfriend. Noone makes me as happy as him. We were over 2 years together. It was the most amazing thing I had ever lived. We were each other’s life goal. Like soulmates. Until I learned he cheated on me and lied to me about many things. That day I learned just how mentally ill he really was. I never found anyone as smart, handsome, funny and perfect as him. And he ruined it. I lost what I thought was my best friend, my soulmate, my goal and my life. 

I’ve been lied to so hard. I’ve lost so much. While i know i’ll keep going and keep living, i’ve never been so hurt before. I can’t even process it properly. 

And now that everybody is gone, i’ve never felt so lonely",2022-07-28 07:44:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654262916,2,/r/lonely/comments/wa3h4m/i_lost_a_lot_in_a_short_period_of_time_and_i/,,0,6,"I lost a lot in a short period of time, and I really need to vent"

(Not my main point for this but) I was definitely disappointed but not surprised by redditors when I found out y’all just gave someone a shit time because they’re the opposite sex. Just personally as someone who’s been alone most of their life I have found myself to appreciate peoples openness and be disappointed by ignorant behavior whether as a gag or sincerely ignorant. I’ve spent years of my feeling friendless and it’s because no one taught me anything , I only really spoke to adults at school, and at that point I already knew I wasn’t gonna fit in. I’ve lived life, I’ve been fortunate enough to have tried to love people, to have sincere friends. But I’ve been both romantically kicked aside, and I’m not relevant enough in my friends lives to spend constant time with them, I’ve spent the past 2 years alone away from everyone in a new town, trying to leave a mark on someone. I can say I know why it’s like to feel lonely. And I just think it’s “kinda lame” that y’all did to someone on this subreddit. But I hope the people who spoke didn’t speak for the majority as I’m possibly in denial.

Another struggle I have is that while alone, the worst thing I feel is watched. I’m constantly in fight or flight fearing whatever my mind will create besides a chemical that’s inducing the anxiety. I struggle with shadow people and subliminal messaging, and I fear at times that I may never be able to interact with new people in person. I always compare myself to Frankenstein’s monster and find myself to be unredeemablly  damaged as a person, with no value in the eyes of everyone who isn’T; materialistic, or “black and white” thinking instead of “colorful” thinking, anyone who thinkings having toxicity inside you is healthy or people who think others are less valuable, I find it hard to be lonely when people make it a pursuit of solitude, all around where I live people seem so self centered in a bad way because of what capitalism has done to us.

TW: mention of a friends self harm

Using a throwaway account because of reasons.

Today I watched a memorial video released by the family of Joey Jordison to mark the one year anniversary of his death.

I was a big fan of his and found the video to be touching and a beautiful tribute. Unsurprisingly, it made me a bit teary eyed. But once the video ended, I cried because it dawned on me how lonely I am in comparison.

The video has dozens of photos of Joey surrounded by a huge support base. Parents, siblings, grandparents, cousins, friends, band mates and of course his millions of fans.

But my reaction is based more upon his life before he became rich and famous. I don’t have any of that. The family vacations, shared meals, parties with a group of friends. Everyone cuddling and happy together. I have no one.

My mother was an abusive deadbeat. And my sibling and I went our seperate ways 10 years ago. My family life was dysfunctional and toxic. I don’t have any other extended family members. Social circles were scattered at best, everyone has drifted away. One close friend took his own life. And I’ve been drifting in a fog ever since. 

I’ve always been a loner because connecting with others is such a struggle for me as I battle depression, low self esteem and crippling anxiety.

I guess I’m weirdly envious. I’m so sad that Joey is gone and I really feel awful for his family but man, he had an amazing life surrounded by people who loved and supported him. Who would I have been if I grew up in a similar way? What is it like to be that loved?

But here’s the reality: All I have is a dead end job, frequent panic attacks and an empty home.

No one would care if I died today, let alone make a memorial video. 

I don’t know, I’m just feeling so broken today. Like I’m taking a good long look at my life and it’s just so empty and bleak.",2022-07-28 08:26:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wa46lv/watching_a_famous_persons_highlight_reel_has_me/,,0,1,Watching a famous persons highlight reel has me questioning my whole life

I don't quite know how to describe it but most of the times I feel like I'm invisible to people especially to girls. I don't have many friends... well only one to be precise but everytime we hang out in a group or something I feel like I am alone and don't get noticed by anyone even when I am crowded by people... I don't really know how to put it. I do gotta say that I've always been a quiet guy and I think much about what I'm saying so most of the times I rather not say anything at all. 

It's probably got something to do with my past cuz my life has always been quite shitty. I've dealt with heavy depression and ptsd for a very long time in my teen years and I've just recently began to finally get up again and turn my life around. Lost about 60kg (roughly 130lbs), changed the way I dress, began to exercise and started an education. And I honestly thought that these things would help me get out of my shell and maybe even talk to girls more but I just don't get noticed and even when, I wouldn't know what to say. I'll turn 22 this year and I never had a girlfriend hell I never even kissed a girl.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I need to change even more but I don't know what I should change.

5423,wac7cf,Texasboy1957,"I signed up on an app called Longwalks a few weeks ago.  It's actually a mostly pointless app since it's 90% answering fill in the blank questions and 10% responding to others.  You can have friends, sort of, but the only thing you know about them is how they answered questions.   There are different ""groups"" with special focus where questions are asked from that perspective, like ""senior walkers"" and ""social worker"" walkers, etc. 

Anyway, you kind'a have to see it but the thing is, a few days ago there was sentence for you to complete: ""I have a friend who's the master of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""  I answered, ""nothing, because I don't have any friends.""

A person read that and said, ""I find that hard to believe.""

My first reaction was to tell them to fuck off but instead I just deleted my answer and along with it went their cruel comment.

It was probably not technically true, I am married and my wife is my friend but otherwise I am just a stray without a home.  I am an atheist, free thinker, open-minded guy with an entirely different viewpoint than christians.  I live on the point of the star of the Texas belt buckle of the bible belt.  Nobody in this town has the courage to admit their atheism out loud, much less befriend others who are.

Even my wife is religious, in a subtle, quiet way.  Her relatives are much more outspoken, evangelical and virtually completely sold out to you-know-who way over on the right.  Same for virtually everyone in this town, especially those from here.  I cannot stand their viewpoint and would not be friends with them if they ask.  

So here I sit, alone and lonely.  I am 64.  I'm retired do to prior medical problems.  I might find work but not likely.  My car was repo'd when I was in a coma so I can't go back to  Uber.  There's not even a decent bar to hang out in here.  I am isolated.

I would move if I could, most likely to Houston.  My wife will not move, she's stuck to this place.  I can't afford to go on my own.  SO, here I sit all broken hearted... to borrow a phrase.

I used to be part of a close circle of friends but we all sort of grew apart and now it makes me so sad even seeing people texting regularly because I haven't had that in so long.

Dear you,

I always thought our differences complemented each other. I thought my adventurous side will drag your ass out to try new things, and your conservative side will sit my ass down and give me my reality check. I thought my chattiness will make sure we never run out of things to talk about and your quietness will let me be me and you just listen. I used to be really proud of our relationship; we were so happy (and my dog loves u). I thought our relationship was one where people would be jealous of...
But tonight, I found out that it perhaps wasn’t the case.

You told me that u weren’t sure about our differences anymore as it might cause trouble. I was a little shocked hearing that news. It made me think. You said you wanted some time to think more about us. But I really hope you give us a try because u never know. You said I wanted attention by posting my feelings online, but for me, this is the only place I can express my raw feelings without worrying about burdening others. It sucks that you think about me this way. But I guess it can’t be helped.

Maybe we are just hitting a road block because I am at a really stressful time right now. I hope everything will be better later. As of now, I will be somewhere out there thinking of you, humming the song that reminds me of you, holding onto the unsent letter that was supposed to be for you.

5431,wadi7g,OkAnnual1631,"I'm David, 17 years old from Scotland and I am so lonely all the time and I'm lonely as heck! I don't have any good friends, all I have are people who will play with me but then they'll either hardly even chat to me, or they will judge me for who I am as I can be kinda strange sometimes which I never mean. In school the only person I'm friends with hardly does anything with me and is so much more interested in his real friend so yeah im almost all by myself, I know I do get people to talk to and they can sound like my friends! And yeah some people on here don't have anybody else to talk to other than their parents or even don't have anyone at all... but it's still soooo painful for me because I'm also too anxious and insecure that I can't even near go to someone by theirself and have a conversation as I know what people are like and it would still take forever to make a friend! And online I can't make any friends either as its usually either they ghost me at some point and the friendship fades away... or they aren't a good friend in some way, and a lot of the times it's because they are listening to something while in vc with me or something! OH AND PEOPLE WHO GO ON THEIR PHONES WHEN THEY ARE WITH YOU!!! Dude! I can't freaking stand that, I was playing a game with my cousin today until she went on her phone and watched the Simpsons, horrible moment I had to even leave back home! And also every time I'm out I'm always so upset because I've always wanted a girlfriend or girl best friend for ages now and I always see girls hanging out with other people like they hang out everyday! I've never hanged out with anyone so how do you think I feel? I really wish one day ill meet someone who understood what I was going through who was similar to my personality and interests such as videogames who could just ask me to become good friends, and they wouldn't judge, make fun of me over something, get distracted on their phone, or leave me after a bit of time! The reason why u prefer girls btw is because I've never had any female friends in my lifetime and its so bloody depressing.  I also like 1 to 1 chats and not groups so that answers why it's harder as I'd only hang around with individuals one at a time.  If anyone understands how depressing this is for me is there any website online where I could make a good friend and it would become local and I'd meet them in person? Or something like that on reddit or facebook? I know I should probably put myself out there but I'm already depressed and I can't put myself through more again! Just thought I'd say I'm diagnosed with autism as well.

Basically my trigger is that i found a new job, so i'm leaving a toxic place where i worked without a contract for a very poor wage (4€/h), it was a saltuary job, and at the time  i accepted it for facing my social anxiety.

I'm happy to leave and fuck off my boss with style 'cause she treated me like a shit , but at the same time i'm terrified for my insecurities, i'm scared despite i have a little experience for this job.

My fear it's not to be capable enough. 

The same thought it goes for an art school, that i'm going to start it at septemeber, it reminds me my failures at high school, i was very immature and my dyscalculia didn't help as well, but i have taken my responsibilities about this.

I worked really hard for paying the courses, i have already studied in another school (Graphic Design) and passed the exams months ago, while I was working and studying, i was going also to a free psychotherapy (on a mental health place for youth) for a couple of months, because i can't afford a real therapy, it helped me to manage my stress but nothing more.

But now, i think i can't handle it anymore, i don't know if this anxiety it's a burn out sign, i want only to be strong and trying to make my dreams come true, i spent 10 years fantasize about my dream job and career, trying a lot of paths. I can't accept to fail.

I need to change something about me, i don't know what i have to do to fix this..

I was a guy who used to like stuff which were different from what another guy would like and society would think otherwise
She used to enjoy talking to me everyday like there wasn't a time she never did
But as time went on we grew even more closer we spent each and every day sharing every detail of our lives every little thing
I used to be a really good listener and she used to like that fact about me a lot.
During 2021 due to the pandemic there were several lockdowns placed and we grew closer and closer during this time
I used to be there for her and she used to be there for me and it is a thing which any two close best friends would do but the unfortunate thing happened i started to develop feelings for her but she didn't and it wasn't until mid 2021 that i confessed to her about it but we both seemingly brushed it off and we didn't really talk much about it and we were back to how we were before 
But as I started to see her from a different POV i started to fall harder and harder for her 
I wanted to be there for her , make her smile , wanted to spend my life with her, literally fullfill all her dreams that's how I felt about her
Every day i used to indirectly mention her about how i could be a good partner for her and how i would be perfect for her and she seemingly used to accept the fact several times that maybe i could be the one for her and there were several times when she used to feel like this could actually never happen
And this stuff went on for several months until recently on june 2022 we had a conversation when i mentioned to her about a fact that i would like to meet her and she was even more excited to do that and several days later on we had a video call and i mentioned her about how excited I was to finally meet her after 2 years and seeing her reaction i noticed something was wrong and that she felt really uncomfortable about all this 
And the immediate next hour I get a text from her telling that She wants to break all relations from me and that she would never wanna speak to me again. I immediately realised that i stepped over my line and now this is something i messed up
My mind went blank and numb i didn't know what else to do because she was that person who grew closer to my heart and its something i wouldnt have even imagined
It took me a lot of time to move on from her and i realised maybe it is for the best
Even then i tried to text her thinking that maybe she would have said those because of something she was troubled with but it was something serious she kept ignoring me for months until recently i confronted her and she was all ready to be friends with me with a condition that I be just friends with her and I was fine with that :) and as I thought things would were getting fine we decided that we would meet and we actually did. I was really damn excited because well I finally met her :) and things went really fine on the day i met her but after all the stuff that happened prior i felt like being too mingled would make her feel awkward and uncomfortable so i was just being a normal friend towards her and we had a great day in the end 
And until the next day the disaster falls upon me she tells me that she didn't really enjoy being friends with me and that she wants to stay away from me and stuff 
I started to panic because it's not like i had done anything wrong to her she felt something wrong about me and she wasnt ready to tell me about it and she blocked all communications with me.
It's been 2 weeks since this thing happened and i don't know what to feel about any person anymore and how they can change this bad
I don't know whether it's my fault in this or its her i need help like seriously anyone who could talk to me because i feel like i have been broken off by someone whom i couldn't even imagine would do something to me
This thing has triggered my anxiety and depression so bad i just feel like Life is unfair with people who are always geniune with everything.
Right now i feel like a part of me has been separated off and i have lost interest in almost everything 
There isn't even a time when i don't think that i just wanna go back in time and just stop all of this stuff from happening",2022-07-28 19:44:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629882146,1,/r/lonely/comments/waja8f/i_feel_empty_right_now_i_dont_know_what_to_feel/,,0,0,I feel empty right now i don't know what to feel anymore

They were completely wrong. It’s like as soon as I turned 18 people did not really care about what I had to say about anything. But women around my age get treated with way more respect. I realized that as a young man in my early twenties people don’t actually seem to have empathy or care about anything you say because men are mostly judged off of what they can do and not actually by their personality.

Even in another environment, I am unable to make friends with anyone because of this. I remember being an extroverted and happy kid (before bullies came into my life), but now I am just a very quiet and shy person. The older I get, the harder it gets to fiend friends, not to mention a gf. Most of these bullies lead happy lives now, while I am rotting in my basement. Life is just unfair.

5483,wamegq,Significant-Set-6382,"Genuine question, why do I have this seething emptiness inside me?

Its not even that I'm an emotional person, because I dont cry that often, or when one normally would. I don't really consider myself as a depressed person, nor do I not have anyone there for me. I'm in high school and I am generally cordial with others. I have a family who loves me and I have ""cool"" (jk pals) friends. None of them really have any experience with romance, and the only one who does is constantly in and out of toxic relationships.

I used to move around a lot because military family, so I never settled to until third grade, so I sorta had childhood friends, but i didn't grow up with them, with the whole ""just like family"" vibe

But I have this overarching feeling that I'll never find love. It may just be because of a self confidence/esteem thing, or that I may or may not have semented myself as the funny weird kid in middle school, but I genuinely don't ever think I'll be loved romantically.

And as a teenage boy, it may sound weird to not be intersted in sex. I mean yeah, I have and use the internet, but I don't really desire something like that. I want to be hugged and told that I'm loved by a someone I love.

The book is going to be called ocean; neverending

Here is the draft:

 It’s a seemingly endless ocean. Here they are paddling in their boat, hoping for some sign of land. Hoping for some sign of getting to leave this prison behind. They are not the only one in this ocean, sometimes they will find others. Some on bigger boats with more wiggle space, some with even smaller boats. They take joy in trying to help these people by simply carrying them along, allowing the other to peddle a little less. Sometimes the others manage to find a bit of land to live on, often with others. The others would occasionally tell them that they were fine, that there was no reason to be in the ocean. The others would sometimes promise them rocks and stones; land to live on, but whenever they would ask about the rocks, the others would have seemingly forgotten about it, would become agitated if they would ask further about it. So they just paddle on, hoping for land to arrive, knowing in their heart that it probably never will. That there is no land for them to live on. They will continue; they will never stop; they know that there are others, equally scared about this ocean. There are others that are lost, that need a friend to haul them along. They might never be happy, but they might finally be content in knowing that at least for some of the people they’ve found, there is an end to this endless ocean.

It’s been 3 years since anyone has taken me out to dinner (or gone out with me). My ex rarely liked to go out to dinner because he was so cheap. Didn’t like me having any friends. Divorced now. 

It’s been 4 months since anyone met me for coffee, and that was the first time in 3 years. I was so thrilled to go out for coffee with this person that I wanted to stay and chat to the guy for hours. He did not want to, he cut the coffee date short after an hour. I was boring him, I could tell. I sent a text telling him how much I enjoyed our coffee date. He ghosted. 

I invite people out and the answer is always a “lol idk maybe” and never a definite answer. Or they ghost.

My acquaintances from college ghosted. Haven’t heard from anyone all summer. My texts to them went unanswered. Everybody’s wrapped up with their families and friends at home.

In May I went to an island to go camping (glamping) and hiking. I camped alone. I hiked alone. Nobody would talk to me. Everybody else was coupled up with partners, spouses, friends or on a honeymoon. Nobody was there alone like me. I had dinners alone. I ended up not speaking to a single person for a week. Paying for meals and other things was automated so I didn’t even talk to clerks, waiters, ticket takers, campground staff. 

In early June I stayed with my family. They don’t like me much and all they like to do is watch reality TV. I’m a STEM student, I do research and work in a lab. They don’t have any interest in that and told me not to talk about my work, because they didn’t care and science is stupid. Ok. I just sat on the couch and watched their TV. Then they started wanting me to wait on them and getting abusive with me. I left.

Now, I’m somewhere else many miles away, in a college town taking summer classes waiting for the fall semester to start, living in deserted dorm housing. Nobody in this town talks to me, I’m invisible. The students in my classes are “gunners”  (the annoying pre-meds). I used to be pre-med but switched over to wanting to do the PhD route so they have no interest in me. When somebody in this town does try to talk to me I wierd them out too much so I get ghosted (I have ADHD and aspergers). I had a roommate but she moved out.

5509,warliw,[deleted],"I will call this woman M. Her friend made a post here couple weeks ago saying that I did things like harassing, threatening, and doxxing her.

So long story short, I saw M posting on this and noticed she is also from the same country as me. So I decided to DM her asking to be friends. I never forced her to give my number to me. I shared my number through the DM and she *voluntarily* chose to add me on Whatsapp.

So I texted M for a couple weeks and it's not like I texted her all that much. Maybe like every five days, give or take? I just try to keep the convo short so that I do not overstay my welcome. She just keeps giving me one-worded answers even though she chose to add my number. Then one day, she just blocked my Whatsapp out of the blue even though I did not do anything.

So I went back to her Reddit just to tell her how I felt. I do not remember the exact details of what I wrote, but what I felt was like: ""I did not even force you to be my friend. You have just respectfully decline my friendship invitation if you really did not want to be friends with me.""

Then two months, M unblocked my Whatsapp just to respond to that DM. Saying things like nobody is owed anything. I mean, she could just have the decency to tell me she changed her mind? So we exchanged a few rude messages then I stopped after I realized I wanted nothing to do with this woman anymore. She also shared my number to one of her friends to send me a hateful message. Fucking asshole went and shared my number to somebody else without my consent.

Then here comes the juicy part. Her friend went and made a post on this sub saying I harassed, threatened, and doxxed M. I do not deny I sent her some rude and insulting messages. But like I only sent *four* such kind of messages only? Where is this *repeated* harassment that she speaks of? She act as though I sent her hundred of messages in a single day. Also I did not threatened anybody. I never said I was gonna do anything shitty to her. She made that part up. And she also said I doxxed M. The definition of **doxxing** is *""search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the internet, typically with malicious intent.""* When have I leaked personal information about M such as her phone number, identity card number, or house address on the internet? I think she has no idea what the word ""doxx"" actually means. I have done no such thing. Ironically, M accused me of doxxing her but also gave my number to a stranger without my consent. LMAO at the lack of self-awareness.

I do not deny I sent her a some rude messages. That part I will admit is true. But nothing I did was as bad as she made it out to be. She is just making it sound worse than it is to play the ultimate victim card. I kind of felt like M is probably not even telling the whole truth to her friend. Something she did not even mention to her friend was that before she blocked me, I was still being friendly with her. She just blocked me for fun even though I was not rude with her at that point. She claimed that I intimidated her when really I just ask her ordinary questions at the start of our texting. And also if she felt so intimidated, then why unblock me after TWO fucking months just to say shit to me? TWO fucking months passed already so just let it go, M. I have already forgotten about you those two months.",2022-07-29 01:36:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/warliw/there_is_one_woman_from_southeast_asia_on_this/,,0,1,There is one woman from Southeast Asia on this sub who is so full of shit.

5514,warypx,i-cant-human,"Title says it all. I feel like the people in my life, the few that are left, don't care about me at all. I have a childhood friend with whom i still hang out once in a while, but we go months without texting and I'm always the one that initiates the conversation. We used to be best friends and now I'm just a nobody he meets with from time to time. He has a bunch of new friends and they always go out together, even go on holidays together. That used to be me. 

I lost all the friends i made in high school, we used to hang out all the time and one day their concept of fun changed and i got left behind. Suddenly it wasn't enough to go to somebody's place and hang out, watch movies, play tabletop games. Now they like to go out and drink, party, go to events. I hate all of that so i never went, that slowly made them stop inviting me. I'm not blaming them, what's the point in inviting me if i never go anyway? But it still felt nice to be invited and having somebody think about you.

With my childhood friend though this never happened. I always found the time to do stuff together, talk over discord, go to the movies, he was the only one i was really comfortable with, i could be myself and not feel judged. I always feel judged by everyone i meet, but it never happened with him. One day we simply stopped talking every day, we started hanging out less and less, we drifted apart and now we barely talk at all, and every time we talk it's because i start the conversation, which ends a few texts later anyway. We're not close anymore and we don't have stuff to say to each other anymore. Sometimes i just think about not trying anymore, letting this friendship end, but then i would be completely alone and that scares me.

I'm used to being alone, but it doesn't mean i like it. I find myself more and more trying to meet people online. Doesn't matter if they're on the other side of the world, i just need somebody to talk to, somebody that listens to me whenever i have doubts, anxiety, when i want to go on a rant about my hobbies etc. I met a few people like this but even then, if I'm not the one constantly texting, i feel like they would stop reaching out. Some even started telling me how they would always be there for me, that i had somebody i could open up to, but in the end they just ghosted me. That hurt, we had been talking for just a few days but i guess it didn't take that long for them to get fed up with me. 

I know I'm clingy, i pity myself a lot and i try to be conscious about it and restrain myself, but i just can't stop it completely. I guess that drives people away.

I end up caring a lot for the people i meet, much more than they care about me, and it hurts. I had this friend in high school that I was really close with, we haven't talked in years, he stopped reaching out and I guess i stopped as well, but i just sensed he got fed up with me and i just didn't see the point in trying anymore. I still dream about meeting him regularly, in those dreams we're still friends and everything is ok and I'm so happy to see him again. Then i wake up and i blame myself for losing yet another friend.

I know I'm not entitled to having people in my life and i can't force anybody to stay, but i wish they would. 

If you've read till this point then you made my day, i just needed to vent and to put my thoughts somewhere and this was the only place i could think of.",2022-07-29 01:54:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627393301,2,/r/lonely/comments/warypx/nobody_ever_stays/,,0,5,Nobody ever stays

While I don’t need another person to make me happy, I have this constant void that I can’t seem to fill . I have friends , good friends but none of them ever seem to completely understand me . This is the first time I’ve had friends in years as I was emotionally and physically abused by people / relationships so it was extremely hard to make connections with people genuine ones .  However I put myself out there and made great friends who love me but the only thing is I just feel like they never understand me on the level I’m searching for and there’s always something I’m looking for . It’s the loneliest feeling and I feel like I’m constantly alone when surrounded by these people I call friends. Sometimes they are a-sympathetic of my situation due the inexperience and awkward nature of everything but nonetheless always there for me. Just not always in the most helpful way , or they can never truly have an understanding 

The only way I actually feel a genuine connection with anyone is intimacy. Now this does not mean sex or even a relationship but hugging, kissing , being close . All that makes me feel whole and understood on a different level nobody else can understand. I don’t want to feel this way but it’s the only thing I crave and I just crave to be understood.
Due to this as a female I feel men often understand me better which could be due to past trauma or events but for some reason I can’t help but constantly feel lonely or unhappy without it. 

Now I’m not saying I need anything on a sexual level because it’s not and that’s not even something I want, it’s more that I just crave to be understood and have genuine connections with people. But the only way it ever feels genuine is if it’s a step above “friends”…

Talk to my parents? They have no advice. They’re too busy.

My friend? He has no time bc his wife owns him. He has to get off the phone after 15 minutes to go pick up dinner for his family or whatever

My sister? Just labels me and dismisses me.

My cousin? Thinks I’m a filthy degenerate even though he used to look up to me

My girlfriend? She doesn’t understand and if I show weakness to her I will lose her too bc that’s what people do. They sense a man is emotionally weak and they cast him out,

She has a regular job, movement, people, challenges, problems...I sit here, writing all day, turning in on myself. It builds up, cumulatively, until it reaches a point where I figure I have to do something.

Normally I start going for walks, even if work makes it hard, I make the time as a survival mechanism. But it's hot here in eastern Europe. Not good hot, city hot, asphalt-melting hot. If I can't get out in the morning, which I often can't, there's no opportunity until early evening.

I do the same things every year in August, when the loneliness of being a remote worker grind me down. I join Internations again, and find that no-one is posting much, and the community is flatlining in terms of activity. I imagine things I could do to meet someone new (I mean a friend, preferably a male friend, I am straight male, happy with my partner).

I know that it is great I have a stable relationship of five years, but it is not healthy to get all your human company for one person. I wish I could meet one other person in this city to hang around with who is not a legacy friend at-one-remove from my girlfriend's small social set.

I am 22 years old male from middle east . My dad was killed in 2003 war and my mother remaried and I had a step dad. He treated me like a son . When I was 8 years old my mother become paralyzed.  My step dad which will call dad from this point forward. He worked his ass off because we were poor and so I had to grow my self just like my sisters. In 2014 I was 14 years old moved to Canada.  Great life until my family got hit with financial instability . When I was 16 depression hit me hard I hated to be outside I felt an outcast no friends no nothing yet my family never understood that I was great student but I hated to study when depression hit me. So when I was 17/18  I did not graduate high school and my family judged me cursed me every day for not graduating they started telling me instead I should of dropped out and started working to help family. I truly understand but I was super depressed. I started working at McDonald's for 2 years full time . All my income I gave it to my family to help them out. All I wanted in those 2 years to get home and sleep and die maybe . Video games was my escape . No one believed my depression not even my self but I knew I was not normal and worst part my family kept taking anything I was playing with and tell me to do chores . 1 year later I met my dream girl. I am sorry to offend anyone here with this but I always wanted a Japanese girlfriend who I can learn Japanese culture and as well I take care and cherish her. For once someone started talking to Me and listen to me and so I told her everything from my dreams my weakness and stuff. And that when things got sour . Then we decided to have sex . We were stupid we did not do it right and then she started getting cold to me completely and that was 5 months in then 9 months in she broke up with me. I genuinely was dead inside I could not do anything I was so heartbroken she was my first gf and my dream girl and shit got worst when I learned 5 months in ( I have nomprove but I know ) she was talking to this dude and she tried to pull her self away from me. I desperately asked her back because I never felt loved by anyone or at least talked to anyone before. 1 year and half and I am depressed af. My best friend found a girl he likes and he spend most of his time with her. I am completely alone I am not attractive and that a fact . I try my best to look good but I don't look good. I started going gym and I can't do it I am too depressed . Amd today I broke down . I am crying as I type this I don't know what to do. The thought of killing my self is lurking around my head but I know I am strong enough not to do it but I really need help. No one love me or listen to me. I can't even go to therapy because I don't trust them or have extra money to throw away.

It’s endlessly racing  
A million and one things, all at once

It never stops - it’s so very loud  
It doesn’t let you sleep, or rest, or think

You get laser focused on that one thing  
And then lose interest, just as quickly

The highest highs make you promise  
The lowest lows make you break

You open up, hoping to find empathy  
You close down, knowing you found apathy

Even if I don’t live in your mind  
I want you to know I understand

\-

I know it isn't easy - it's not easy being you, it's not easy for you to be with others. I know it's very hard to just manage.

I know how much it takes to just pretend to have some semblance of order. I know you hate having to take meds. I know you hate the sides.

I know that a lot of people don't believe you, or take it out on you. I know your pain, even when you say nothing hurts.

I know a lot, not all. I know talking about it doesn't always help, too. So I'll never push.

5589,wb37vw,Vast_Ad_363,"I’m 23 male from eastern/central European country. As I’ve had shitty parents I’ve moved away right after graduating high school. I couldn’t get a degree, but I was reading and coding a lot in high school, as I couldn’t really leave home whenever I wanted and in rural area there was nowhere to go anyways other than local pub, where village alcoholics were drinking whole day and church, which was obligatory to attend, because we had to get stamps and show it to priest each month. So I moved to another part of the country when I was 19, got a job as software dev, albeit shitty one, because I had to work 16 hours a day (boss would call me a midnight to make sure I’m still working) for minimum wage. I’ve managed to hold out for a year, but my already bad depression (I have a lot of cuts on legs and arms, some of which I’ve covered with tattoos, I’ve also had many suicide attempts in middle to high school, because of alcohol problem and mental abuse in house). I’ve changed job, still low paying one, but at least 8 hours a day. I was starting to get better and then father returned from abroad, needed somewhere to live, couldn’t get a job, so I had to take many loans to make ends meet, then he left the country again. Okay then, I’ll just find better job to pay out loans. I’ve got better job - boom two digit inflation, a lot higher rent, I now barely can afford to live at this point. All that while having literally no social interactions aside from clerk in grocery store, because I move often to the cities where I work, so with my depression, anxiety and shyness I can’t meet people, so my life is constant spiraling into deeper and deeper depression. At this point I don’t even have will to work, even thought it was never a problem before, because the job was the only thing I wouldn’t neglect, even if I was neglecting everything else in my life. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’d like to get out of my depression, but 3 different SSRIs didn’t help me. I’ve attended therapy sessions, but the therapist sent me to the psychiatrist again, because she told me that the test she made me do shown that I have very deep depression. Well it’s not like now I can afford therapy anyways. On top of that I’m more of a brown skinned person than white person, which matters in this country, because people look at me like I’m some kind of demon, I was even stopped once by border guard in big city, because they couldn’t believe I’m the citizen.",2022-07-29 12:13:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1652459716,6,/r/lonely/comments/wb37vw/life_sucks_no_matter_how_hard_i_try_to_fix_it/,,0,1,Life sucks no matter how hard I try to fix it

i have lots of hobbies and interests, i study in a very well paying field. ive been told im attractive, even hot, recently. i feel like im quite self aware and easy to talk to. im a very talkative person yet have no one to talk to, whether its a friend, a relationship or family. im also someone that craves touch yet the only thing i have to cuddle are my pets.

i actually managed to get into a long distance relationship a couple years ago then got cheated on. but the only reason the girl even wanted to date me was because she was quite mentally ill and just jumped to the first person she saw after breaking up with her ex. i felt incredibly pressured into the relationship in the first place. i know i will probably get into a relationship again or find close friends eventually, but its incredibly disheartening when you have to go through being ghosted 100 times over and over again. in the last 7 years or so there was only one other woman besides my ex that expressed romantic interest into me.

honestly, worst case scenario i just wait a couple years, finish my degree, get a job and then when im more materially desirable i hop on dating apps to find someone to settle down with and proceed to never be satisfied with life. sadly it doesnt help that my standards are rather high

5638,wbd6gs,Jurez1313,"Anyway, what do you do when you realize you'll always be alone? Like, here's my shit: I'm ugly, fat, irritable, financially irresponsible, and I live with my parents. The kicker is, *I lack the ability to change* ANY of these things. Like sure, if I had money I could get liposuction or gastric bypass or whatever. If I had the right amount of motivation/discipline I could stick to an exercise regimen or a diet and lose weight. If I was smart or dedicated enough I could graduate college and find a better job, which would way enough to move out of my parents' place.  

But I don't have any of these things. I can't do any of these things. I lack the innate traits that most humans are born with that allow them to succeed in life.  

And without these traits, without fixing the things that are broken about me (see: everything), I don't even stand a *chance* at being attractive to someone whom I also find attractive. That's the other thing: I need to feel attracted to a romantic partner. But I don't find people that look like me attractive. So my innate standards that, again, I CANNOT CHANGE, are too high for me to find even a single person willing to date me...  

Sure, I'm not all bad. I'm kind, considerate, empathetic, punctual, respectful. I'm a good listener and an above-average lover. But these things don't fucking matter when I can't love myself, when I can't support myself financially, and when there's not a single thing attractive about my appearance.  

Thing is, a relationship is the only thing I've ever wanted. The only goal I've ever worked towards. So for it to turn out to be impossible, what do I do now? I have no goal to replace it, I never have had anything else I've wanted to do. Well, a professional esports player but that's not feasible for a guy in his 30s lmao. So what the fuck does one do when he has no goals? How do I stop myself from just quitting life?  

Sorry if this is all scattered as fuck. My brain is going a million miles a minute and my skin feels hot and I can't focus on anything and I'm on the verge of tears.

Does anyone else feel pulled in 2 different directions? 

On one hand I feel like shutting everyone out, going on my way as a lone wolf, blocking everyone that hurts me from social media, and just do my own thing. I'm afraid if I go this route I'm going to find myself in 30 years being a bitter old man and looking back on my life with regret. 

On the other hand I know what being alone feels like and I don't want to feel that way ever again. But I also know how difficult it is to go out and be social, to find anyone who will accept me into their lives, so this route is filled with the uncertainty of trying to find my people and maybe being successful or maybe finding myself hurt and alone again.

I work nights so my days are a little screwed up but anyways i walked into work last night with the determination to finally express my feelings for this woman i have caught feelings for and i thought she had the same because when i would flirt she would reciprocate so i decided to show my true self at work and show my love.... she rejected me which she had a full right to do. I picked myself up and turned the other cheek she had told me that she was engaged and that the only reason she didnt have a ring on is bc it didnt fit her ring finger ( she wore a ring on her right middle finger) the ring i saw was cheap and looked like one i had seen at walmart 2 weeks earlier  while looking at watches but i just shrugged it off and continued with my day. Around 3 am right after i got off my lunch break i was called into my manager's office and was accused of harassment and that i the advance had ""came from nowhere"" and i apologized to my manager and simply recounted what had happened when i expressed myself. Lucky enough i kept my job but now i get scornful looks from her like i had violated her in some way but i was told not to speak to her again so i have no chance to apologize for the confusion but i over heard her talking about the situation to EVERYONE and i had wished to keep it between us and management but she has told a bunch of people that I am gross and ugly and that she would have never ever done anything with me. When i overheard this i went out to my vehicle and smoked the rest of a joint so i could process these feeling i havent felt before i felt violated in that everyone knew what i had tried to do and i fear she embeleshed the story to make me seem like a creep i decided to take the rest of the day off because after hearing her talk smack behind my back to my friends and co-workers i wanted to say somthing that i might regret and i was also on the verge of tears due to a pannic attack i felt coming. Now that im sitting at home i am slowly starting to slip into depression i feel like the people i work with are always going to look at me with distane and hatred because of what she has been telling people. I keep having intrusive thoughts of suicide i have never had these before and im scared. I hope talking about this helps even a little bit with what is going on in my head now i constantly dont want to be left alone at work and now i dont even want to eat or interact with my family.

5685,wbj711,TheRealest_Deal,"Hi everyone, today was my birthday and I just feel so down cause barely anyone cares. I'm 26 (F) as of today. Birthdays just hurt cause for me this is the day I'm reminded I'm not important to anyone (or at least it feels like that). I mean my sister hung out with me a bit and my father was nice but other than them I don't really have anyone and it really hurts. I've never really experienced anyone celebrating my birthday. Even when I was a young kid, for some reason, people did not like me and I was often excluded and sometimes even bullied. Maybe it was cause I was a shy little girl, not loud or assertive. The few birthday parties I had as a really small kid were never that great and little people used to show up cause being a summer child everyone would be on vacation. After the age of 7 I think I never had a birthday celebration with kids my age again. Now I sit in my room and there's an event in our city I really wanted to go to. I can hear the music playing and people having fun right at this moment and I'm just here, alone. It's just painful. I don't know why I can't seem to get close friends. Over the years I became less shy and had some acquaintances that I liked but it always stays superficial, I don't know why it seems like most people my age don't feel like making more friends and just hang out with childhood/youth friends. I always try to be thoughtful and wish these people good luck with certain things, remember things we talked about etc. etc. but they never do that for me so eventually I just give up and realize they don't want to be friends.

What makes me feel lonely as of late?

I turn 40 this year, and have been making some big mid-life reflections.....mostly this centers around how i started a career 10 years go that got me out of poverty and into self reliance... however, it seems like i traded away some pretty important life things. 

i work alone and am gone  from home for days on end (used to be weeks on end).  The last 10 years have gone by so fast, i am realizing:

-  I mostly likely wont have children and become a dad, meet someone who will want to be a wife/partner... and all of the ups downs and intimacy, and teachable moments that come with it.

-vacationing alone be it whale watching off the coast, camping, or visiting cities of antiquity are great and all, but the entire time, i feel a void is missing as i dont get to to share the moment with anyone else like i feel it should be. 

- i do have a few good friends, and enjoy time spent, but i feel like the biggest 3rd wheel as most of them are all married with lives of their own. 

I've tried dating, making new friends, however its incredibly difficult to make a strong impression for the first day or two meeting someone, then i have to turn around and leave again. So few encounters have lasted beyond acquaintence-ships.... ""out of sight, out mind"" is real.

- in my house i only use 2 rooms, my bedroom and living room. The other 3 bedrooms are just storage.. the old adage ""if these walls could talk"" makes me think ""these walls are deafenly silent"".

- so here i am a slave to the system i've built. I live to work, but there is no purpose to the machine, no goal to work towards at the end of the finish line.. just rinse and repeat.

Sure, you could say ""just do something else"", but comming hot into my 40s it is terrifying to change the one thing that has defined my existence... not to mention in today's economy there is nothing else that pays even close to what i make (think  $40/hr) for my education level and skillsets. 

Sometimes i wish i would find my person place and thing that gives my life true meaning....

3. **then he delete the reddit account and attempt to get as much as he can info from ur traumas to your triggers and he will then use it against you**

**just be smart and dont talk to any account under 1 week old, especially if they have no activity at all on the account. thank you for the kind comments and thank you for reading for the ones who were really kind and sweet, and for the ones who decided to be nasty and accusing me of posting things I never posted, stop being doubtful with people if you have no proof. have a good day everyone. logging off 💜**",2022-07-29 23:50:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654971854,649,/r/lonely/comments/wbjbf7/to_the_guy_i_met_here_i_hate_you/,,2,148,"to the guy I met here, I hate you :("

5711,wbmdbq,No_Helicopter9361,"I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.

More about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.

I believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.

Other things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life

I feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. 

I cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.

 I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.

For the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.

More information that might help answerthis question! 

I am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. 

I have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. 
While I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.
My motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.

I take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.

One thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.

 Another issue I tend to do commonly is I commonly have a hard time paying attention in certain situations which in turn makes it hard for me to pay attention when someone is giving me instructions.

Found out the hard way insurance I failed to enroll in isn't free therapy. I should have enrolled but the options failed to adequately state options for mental health. 

I was under the assumption mental health was free unless stated other wise. It is what it is. I will find therapy this year regardless of what struggle I must go through to obtain it. 

The work is hard, that I won't deny. Some days are so exhaustive I want to commit serious harm to myself. I mantain my sanity in a thread.

5730,wbnpyh,lavendxrtea,"hi! i’m f18 and i just graduated high school. i’ve done musicals and plays and basically everything fine arts for as long as i can remember, and i love doing it.

i did two shows this summer: one final musical with my high school district and one for a community theater. they were awesome to be in!

not sure how to transition into this next topic but here we go. it’s hard when none of the people you consider yourself close to have come to your shows. i totally get that theater isn’t for everyone; everyone has their own lives and timing is tough. i don’t fault them at all for not coming, but i sometimes just can’t help but wish my friends, especially my close ones, and my family would come and outwardly support me, maybe even once. i know it’s so stupid and that i’m not entitled to their time at all. i realize i’m just another person and that everyone has their own shit going on. it just hurts and i wish i didn’t feel this way.

the shows during the school year are easier for people to come to, since teachers sometimes give extra credit and many teens are finding things to do on a friday or weekend night. plus, they’re advertised well around the school. i am sincerely grateful for all my friends who’ve come to my school year shows; it means the world to me.

it’s just been a little harder on me recently. i love performing, but there’s just something about going out to see the audience and realizing you have no one there. of course, you’re not gonna know people at 14 shows. it just kind of sucks when it’s the 10th show and you still are just wandering alone as fellow cast members see people they know and are greeted with cheers and hugs and flowers and whatnot.

with my family, they never know when any of my shows or concerts are. i understand that it’s my job to inform of them, but i see so many of my theater peers’ parents excited for these shows, and it makes me wonder what it’s be like to have parents who are invested in this. it’s stupid, i know. it just kind of hurts. my mom walked in late to this year’s spring play and my dad didn’t come to my last summer district musical. with my most recent community theater show, they didn’t even stay after for when all the cast members come out so i could see them. they just left. i didn’t even know they were here until i called them and found out they had left.

it hurts just a bit more with my friends though. again, i preface this with the fact that i know these are a lot of selfish ramblings and that i totally understand that people have their own lives. i’m just kinda feeling hurt and wanna get this out. again, i’m insanely grateful for all my school friends who’ve seen my school year shows. i know it’s a ton of time to dedicate and it means a lot to me. 

two of my closest friends, one who i’ve known for 17 years and another for 11, have never seen any one of my shows. they don’t go to my school or live in my town, and i know it’s not their fault that timing is hard and that they might not be interested. it just hurt a bit when i’ve made efforts to come to their recitals, even virtually, and other performances and they’ve just never seen me perform in one thing. it especially hurt today when i asked one of those friends if she was free tomorrow and she said she was going to a dance recital for another friend. 

none of my friends came to see my last summer district musical. i had to beg my now ex-boyfriend to come and see it on the last day. i had one friend make it to this summer district musical. a bunch of them told me they couldn’t see this district musical last minute after they did say they were coming. i totally understand that things come up, but one of them went on for a while about how they were excited to see it. i dont fault them at all of course; it just hurt a bit. i had zero friends come to my community theater show that i just did. it ran for two weeks. some people dm’d me when i posted it on my story and i really thought they’d come. also, one show was on my birthday, and none of my friends but 2 texted me happy birthday as well.

my boyfriends been at basically every show i’ve done this year, and i’m really grateful for that. he’s been incredibly sweet and supportive. i just wish that some of the other people i’m close to would outwardly show some support, even if just once. i’m sorry about how long and whiny this is. i’m just kinda hurt and many of my friends and i haven’t spoken in a while, so i’m just trying to grapple with my feelings. thank you for reading and i hope you have a lovely day &lt;3",2022-07-30 03:35:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636319165,2,/r/lonely/comments/wbnpyh/i_do_theater_and_i_wish_some_people_i_know_would/,,0,2,i do theater and i wish some people i know would come to even just one of my shows

5755,wbqxys,CallingCard117,"Honestly, I just feel kinda like garbage. A person I have known and been friends with for 5 or 6 years now has been using me and I finally am going to do something about it. I don't think she means to, but she has for a long time used me to get herself to feel better and then go on and stop talking to me once she does feel better.

That is the simple version of this story, since it has been many years in the making, but it was something that was always in the back of my mind and yesterday someone I trust told me that they think that is what is happening. I was devastated as the memorys of my time with this person became clear and I saw what I was trying to hide from for years.

She is a nice person, but she unintentionally used me for all I'm worth and then ditches me for someone else, often a new boyfriend, because they are more exciting. Honestly, I feel like a fool. I feel like I should have trusted my own institution instead of going on with this repeated cycle of friendship and then no contact unless they need me. This latest time from the break of not talking to me, they wanted to meet up and catch up. Turns out she was breaking up with her boyfriend. Shocker. I should have known there was something. There always is. She often says I say the same thing her therapist says. I think she just uses me as a human form of rehab before going out and doing it all over again. And now she that she has found a new person to date she is becoming more distant. One word replies, not responding for sometimes days, overall just not acting like she cares about anything to do with me.

I finally am doing something about it though. She sent me a text thanking me for doing something for her, and I'm not going to reply. I'm deciding to take the advice of my sister-in-law. I'm going to be the one to cut her off this time. I'm not doing it to be mean, but I'm doing it to hopefully get a message across that I'm tired of being her rehab and her not acting like a true friend. I'm hoping she will either come back to me and have worked on herself for once instead of just throwing herself into another relationship, or that she will learn from this and never do this to another person.

Tldr: I'm taking a break from someone that I used to be amazing friends with, and I feel extremely lonely. I feel like an asshole even though it was a toxic for me to continue the way things were. I have not felt this lonely in a while and I just wanted to write some of this stuff down. If you read any of it, even just this last part, thanks. I don't need a reply from anyone.

I would reach out to the people who I considered my friends and try to make plans and then they’d always have some excuse for why they couldn’t go when I knew they were lying.

I used to think I had friends but it’s kind of sunk in since I graduated highschool that I was never a friend to anyone.

5784,wbuzhw,FfriendlessIntrovert,"About 13 years ago, I visited this city and said to myself, I'll live and work here someday. Fast forward to 5 years ago, that happened. I am finally living and working in this city by myself, sure the first 1 1/2 years were wonderful. I've finally got what I wanted. Then slowly, over the years, I didn't realize that I'm becoming more and more unhappy. 

Looking back, it actually seemed like I got everything I dreamed of. Got my own place, the dream job, the company where I want to work, I'm in a beautiful city, and I really thought this is where I will retire. Now, 5 years later, I can't wait to get out of here. I recently quit my job. I went out today and looked around. It made me feel so sad to the point that I was about to cry in public. All the memories of 13 years ago came back, how excited I was to live my life as an adult, full of possibilities. And I asked myself, what happened? I am now living my dream, why am I still so miserable? 

I guess I didn't take into account that I will live my life alone, that it will be so hard living a life without anybody, not even friends. I'm in a beautiful city, why can't I make friends? I had my dream job, but I also did not take into consideration that the environment and everyone would be toxic. 

Now, I don't have a dream anymore. I actually don't know where should I live next. I don't have a dream job or a dream company anymore. I will start a new job in the next few weeks, it's a remote job so I can live anywhere. I just applied to every company related to my experience and accepted the first one who extended an offer just to get out of my ""dream company"". 

I thought when we finally got what we wanted or when our dreams finally came true, we will be happy?

When I got to the doctors, apparently if I has waited another day I wouldn't have survived. My parents never told me that story, it was the neighbor. 

I did my college applications alone. I had to pay someone to teach me how to drive. I got my liscense when I was 17 and 1/2, not when I was supposed to. Not when my brothers did. 

My parents couldn't name any of my friends, because they never asked.

For so long its not 'You don't understand"" its was always '(my name) doesn't understand' and I'm still in the room. 

Sometimes, treat me like I'm still so dependnent on them, maybe younger than 14. But I taught myself how to cook when I was 14 because they didn't give me money to buy my own food for two weeks. 

I didn't have a single friend growing up, and my brothers had loads of friends and of course never let me hang out with them.

My mom complained every day about setting my doctors appointments, even my annual, because of how tedious it was. So the day I turned 18, I called every one of my physicians and removed my parent's contact number except for emergency contact. My mom still hasn't realized I've done this.

I started paying for prescriptions at 16, because I was too scared to ask my parents to keep paying for them. They never realized it.

I wanna talk about how people treat you when you open up to them. When you tell them what you've been through and your struggle with loneliness. I never dump my background on anyone. I have trust issues and It takes me so long to open up. But according to some people I'm a ""good listener"" yet despite that, whenever i finally open up to someone about my loneliness they push me away or treat me differently. Why is saying ""I'm lonely"" so frowned upon? Nothing changed. I'm still the same person as before, it's just now you know a little bit about more about me.

This happened to me several times. With friends or love interest. I ended up hiding my emotions and burying my past with me whenever i try meeting new people.

Lately i met a really good online friend. We have been talking for months. I felt good and decided to talk about it. Same thing happened. I don't get it. I'm still the same person you talked to over and over..nothing changed.

I feel like I've lived a double life where i pretended to be someone else. I pretended to have a lot of friends, i pretend that i met a lot of people. I pretended to be someone else just so people won't push me away or feel sorry for me.

I don't want you to feel sorry for me, i have no expectations from you aside from just being my friend, i want you to know who i really am. Just like how you told me of your struggle with ur love life or job and i listened. I want to tell you about my struggle too, so i could be myself and comfortable. I think i deserve it.

No more hiding, I'm not ashamed of who i am anymore. I'm lonely and that's okay. I might be lonely my whole life and that's okay too. But I'm no longer letting people appreciate me less for my loneliness.

4. I also quit smoking cigarettes two weeksago after smoking almost 17  years.
5. I almost dont have any contact with my family.
6. I don't have any true friends or coworkers willing to hang out with me.

Those are just points which put me in the situation I am and how I feel right now.

Recently I don't feel much. And don't get me wrong. I see how much I did in my life, how much good things I did and how much I can offer. I started skipping on the rope 2 months ago, I came back to playing my guitar, I found a therapist with whom we are working over myself, for 1,5 year i am learning new language and recently I signed up for classes to get it faster and better.

So I know I had a worse and better time in my life. I just feel tired of being alone. Except for my therapist I don't have anyone close to me and even with him it is strange, becasue i know he would not help me if I would stop paying him. It is not becasue he wants, it is becasue i want and need it. I am just missing some basic and deeper interactions. I am feeling tired of people which are saying one thing and doing something completely different. I feel cheated and used. It is harder and harder for me to push myself to do all of this things I like. I would like to share things i have and things I care about. It is hard for me to start doing new things alone or even go outside. I am spending my days at home and again I am feeling tired of this, but when I am outside I don't feel like i am in place I should be by myself.


I am afraid of getting back to smoking weed, I am afraid of getting outside and meet new people. I don't even know how. Thanks to all of you whos are going to read all of this. I can explain more in the comments",2022-07-30 14:09:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/wbydi7/32yo_m_here_recently_i_feel_like_i_dont_have_the/,,0,2,32yo M here.

When I was younger my grandma was always there for me, he was my friend through thick and thin. That's why I named this bot by her name.

All you need to do is to send her a message here ([http://t.me/BabaJanjaBot](http://t.me/BabaJanjaBot)), like say hello or such and she will respond with something like:

&gt;Hello my dear John. Welcome, I'm Baba Janja. I will try to find a friend for you. Now, let's connect you... Here are some tips for you.  
Send:  
stop - if you want to stop finding friends and receiving messages  
start - if you want to start finding friends and receiving messages  
next - if you want to pass current friend and find new one.  
help - if you want to see these keywords again.  
&gt;  
&gt;The way it works is that I am randomly connecting you with someone and you continue chatting through me.

This is completely free, I made it because I want to help. If you are inactive for 24 hours then you will be released and available for new friends. Also if there are no available friends right now, Baba Janja will keep finding until someone new becomes available.",2022-07-30 15:51:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645566145,3,/r/lonely/comments/wc0j76/i_created_a_telegram_bot_for_finding_friends_and/,,0,0,I created a Telegram Bot for finding friends and feel less lonely

5827,wc1zxe,troglobyte_coder,"**overview**

Salutations everyone, I am he with the name of Michael, preferable nickname is Mike, has a pet rabbit, aged 24, blue eyes, stands up to 5’11, personality traits of an Ambivert, zodiac sign Aries, single likes girls, started the game of life from Colorado, then moved to California for collage discount then after having enough of the dangers of that environment finally moved out to Oklahoma to work on getting a life in a nice place with unpredictable weather.

As a self-taught student of computer programming I still turned out to be a passionate, team oriented, software developer who aspires to work on large-scale projects, learning new tech and applying new skills whenever I can. Currently finishing my UCSD classes for my C/C++ Programming certification and will continue work on my Python Programming certification. Previous to my current work position I used to be an Amazon warehouse associate at PSP1 packing, sorting, teaching associates and be the fastest water spider in the hole building, currently I’m working at the Braum’s ice cream and dairy which is a lot of fun.

If you’re someone that expects instant responses 24/7 then probably not compatible with your list since there will be times when I’m really busy with life in general like working at Braum’s for example but rest to sure I’ll get around to responding when I have time to do so, do not mistake it for ghosting understand that life is unpredictable. Those probably a little faster if it’s a conversation, it bugs me not to finish a conversation. If you jump in my DM and think your gonna be posting (NSFW) content or trying to sell NEFW, forcefully promoting some stupid tool at me, spamming me and or selling crypto then yeah got another thing coming so keep that to yourself or else. 😁

If you’re into video calls then that’s fine, it’s probably a good way to develop a connection that is stronger than texting messages back and forth and for the love of God please don't suggest Discord, I already had enough bad experiences on that platform as it is, Snapchat creeps me out, and god damn it if it involves giving away my number then assume no, so that means no WhatsApp, Telegram or whatever I haven’t mentioned sorry my number is mainly reserved for the event I actually find a girl I like who is around my age and happens to be in the same state.. I’ll do video calls on Instagram since I’ve already established a spot there with many connections I made over the years.

**Hobbies:**

Learning new things is one of my favorite hobbies as I take the opportunity to understand new topics and perspectives so rest to sure that I’ll take interest in learning anything and everything within reason, science, space, astrology, philosophy, future and past events. Photography is another thing I tend to do, favorite photography would have to be landscape photography, I just like how some environments look and happy to have the opportunity to express my thoughts through the images.

I like to listen to a lot of music, some favorite bands would be Dexperia, Infected Mushrooms, Gorillaz, Pixel Tarror, and Otyken. Not only that I listen to music but I play some musical instruments as well some being the Jaws harp, Violin and an Ocarina.

Reading and writing go hand in hand, I’ll read about topics of interest or do some research for an idea I come up with which is a lot of ideas to research for if ya think about it, writing documentation for my projects is the other half of the reading writing collaboration though some times when I feel like it I’ll write some really deep thoughts or some poems.

Solving programming problems with C, C++, Python and D just for fun on HackerRank seems like a great way to pass the time and to keep my strategic part of my mind sharpen up for any problems I’ll find in real world applications.

Some of my biggest projects would be the Meson-UI project which is a build GUI for my favorite build tool, Troglobyte stdlib which is a GitHub organization hosting custom libraries for use in applications I’ve written using either C, C++, Python or D, Troglobyte apphub which is a GitHub organization hosting custom applications built with my components for users like you written using either C, C++, Python or D.

**Conclusion**

If I missed something at all then feel free to ask any questions you like, feedback loops is what helps improve the quality and or clarify any descramblers.

5835,wc3yii,SwxtchHitta,"I’m a male, 26 &amp; have been having severe depression issues since highschool accompanied by some serious anxiety &amp; PTSD. 

I used to be one of the “emo” kids that everyone at the local small town highschool made fun of, accused of being gay, a school shooter etc. the typical shit that small town highschools are known for being, that’s how this place was. I was not the good looking kid,  nor was I popular so my entire existence has been on the basis of being unliked by my peers. 

Once I graduated I joined the military (4 1/2 years of service) once I got out, I came back to my hometown &amp; everything had changed. I had changed or had a “glow” up, a major one. All the people who made fun of me, suddenly wanted to be my friend. The girls who wanted nothing to do with me had suddenly been ”in love” with me all those years back. I can’t lie, it made me feel kindve nice. It felt almost like I had this power over them at this point. Yet I can’t even bring myself to be happy, or feel like anyone actually genuinely cares about me because of all this. Why was I not ever good enough until I became attractive? Not even for a relationship but even just for friends. 

I’m more lonely in my life now than I ever was, I do a lot of studying on psychology &amp; how to read people. So I understand when someone isn’t genuine in what they say &amp; that’s how I feel most people are. I feel like I’m a trophy to these people, just another notch in their belt. 

It’s progressively gotten worse as I’ve gotten older, my only family doesn’t feel like my family. I feel like a stranger in their house. My family has always been on the narcissistic side of things, my mom to be specific. She loved me when she could brag on me but if it wasn’t what she wanted that “love” could be taken away.

Idk what the point of this even was or why I’m telling you all this, I guess aside from don’t allow people to get here before you care about them. Treat everyone with love, just because they aren’t your type or part of your “cliche” doesn’t mean they deserve less love.

I qualified as a chef just after I turned 18 and very easily secured a sou chef position I believed aslong as I work hard then ill make it but honestly all I did was loose the few friends I had because I never hung out with them and I never met any women aside from rare  late night 1 night stands and financially didn't really get that far ahead but.

I reached a point where I wanted to actually meet someone and make a life with someone and quite literally went 6 years without touching someone that wasn't an accidental graze at work quite literally not even a hug from a family member for reasons already stated and it's honestly kinda easy to deal with until you think about it then it becomes pritty heavy, but I did meet someone a waitress I worked with she was honestly unattractive a bit over weight goofie and kinda stupid (I know I left school very early and my grammar is shit but on many subjects I turned out way above avarage intelligence wise funny how that happens) she was studying at university to become a vet and god damm I fell in love with this girl and I really shouldn't have, originally she quite literally treated me as a price of meat she knew from work that I'd left school early and she definitely treated me like I was an idiot which I completely let happen but I pursued a relationship and for a year I was the happiest I'd ever been but then it was 3 months befor she finished university and I got the  talk from her and what she wanted all along was a good looking guy to treat her like a queen till she was ready to move on.......it was a few years ago and it shattered me im still shattered I still love her I still think about her everyday and the life I wanted to make with her I've never told anyone about my feelings for her.......

It was my birthday last week I managed to get my first bout of covid on my birthday 2 people wished me a happy birthday my brother and my boss only after I cracked a joke that it took covid for me to get my birthday off which led me to think a great deal about how fucking lonely I've been the past 12 years which has led to this post thanks for reading........",2022-07-30 18:45:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1415973692,13,/r/lonely/comments/wc4dqy/32_m_60_tall_stronghint_of_dad_bod_body_decent/,,1,5,"32 M 6,0 tall, strong/hint of dad bod body decent looking face, good job and absolutely alone"

5842,wc5xv1,NoMyNameIsGREG409,"something us loners hear a lot is to not be sad about loneliness because all we need to do is ""love ourselves"" and love will come naturally

However the thing is that no amount of self love can replace the love of another human and that's just a fact of life. I seriously doubt it's possible to love yourself as much as you love your partner on your wedding day, or your mother, or etc. 

The same people telling you to ""love yourself"" would be miserable wrecks if all of their loved ones didn't exist.

Is self love important? Absolutely, it's extremely important. But don't let other people gaslight you into thinking being sad about being lonely is indicative of low self esteem or low self worth. I've known some absolutely self loathing  people who are surrounded by friends, family, loved ones, etc. Socialization is an intrinsic human need. 

And just because it's okay to be sad doesn't mean you should wallow in your own misery. By all means, do what you need to do to get better. But don't let people delegitimize your own feelings.",2022-07-30 19:57:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1483944969,54,/r/lonely/comments/wc5xv1/its_okay_to_be_sad_about_being_lonely/,,0,13,it's okay to be sad about being lonely

5845,wc69p1,Southernbellebeuty50,"To try to keep things short. I probably will just ramble, but basically I’m lonely like I assume many are here. 

Honestly almost my whole life I just never could make friends or enough. I mean I’ve had friends throughout my life and did some things like sleepovers and played basketball for hours in college with a friend for a year but I never had that brotherhood that lasted years , met a girl, or went out every weekend like I feel most people do.

Like right now I basically don’t feel like I have anyone outside one former co worker who I guess was a friend but occasionally hanged out with him and honestly got very annoyed with him over the years.

I guess I have some acquaintances with people at work and playing ball at the gym, but I don’t even know some of the names of the people I play with or sometimes work with.

It’s a lot to say but I hope many can relate and give me anything they can say.

I think I have an overall positive outlook in life even with the issues socially and other issues I face as well. I continue to stay positive about my goals and future and try to look at the psoriasis each day and week. Just can get to you and trying my best to hopefully break from this.

My issues socially have always gotten to me though there are  stretches where I don’t care at times cause I am dealing with outside shit as well or don’t think about it enough.

I am trying and believe I will take better iniatives than before to make friends, meet people, socialize better, and maybe meet a girl.",2022-07-30 20:12:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wc69p1/my_social_life_for_the_past_24_years_and_staying/,,0,4,My social life for the past 24 years and staying positive/hopeful

5847,wc6fom,Figoverlord,"(25 M) 
I'm sitting here in a motel 6 (semi homeless, long story and not going to go into it here), all my friends are gone in a way. They're busy with life (wife and kids, job and family matters etc) so I go weeks before anyone has time to chat.
And yet I've been an outlier, I never got involved romantically nor ever dealt with family since they disowned me a long time ago. So those problems never bothered me.
I'm in a sort of limbo, neither going forward nor ever moving backwards, clinging on to the past and living in it 24/7.
I spend my time biding my time with nostalgia and sad music to drown out the deafening silence and yet I can never leave this self created limbo since it's oddly comforting in many ways.

I'm so used to feeling like this I can't feel anymore than a nihilistic apathy with some 3am hope mixed in at times. 

I sit here listening to alicks - on my own and I find myself loathing the feeling I have yet I want more, I deliberately make myself sad sometimes and yet when I do it feels like I'm an dry emotional husk until I cry.
It's like my tears water the barren wastelands of my heart and mind and it flourishes with life but only for a little while, then everything dies. 
That barren wasteland feels like a blackhole on my chest and the feeling of uselessness and the utter void of my social life is painful yet I'd rather observe society from afar.
It's a double edged sword I'm dealing with and it's hard to really explain but Like one of my favorite shows Bojack horseman, a character says ""I can't be alone and I can't be around people"" that's the only way I can describe it simply.

I'm the guy at a party who maybe a friend of a friends brother invited and who's chilling in the background with his headphones on and taking minimum participation in the party so as to not look weird just loitering in the background. 
It's strange but I take joy in observing others having fun yet when I'm in the background I so desperately want to join in and yet when I am involved I often hate it so much as it's happening yet secretly I'm in heaven for weeks after. 

90% of my time is spent wandering around town listening to alicks or simalar music to induce a almost dissociative state as I wander the streets.

Sorry this was really rambling but I had to get it out there to a bunch of internet strangers.

Tldr: I'm the big sad but I like being the big sad in some cases.",2022-07-30 20:20:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1479522318,4,/r/lonely/comments/wc6fom/feeling_dead_rantvent/,,1,0,feeling dead (rant/vent).

5852,wc6tvc,Rahjan01,"I may be writing this from a drunken stupor right now but I just need to vent...

All my life I have been ""the Outcast"". The one guy everybody knows and most laugh about behind your back.

All the way through school and college I had only some ""buddies"" but no friends. Everybody just was looking out for themselves and nobody really wanted to interact with me. I got people through classes and tried to help where I could but I always had the feeling, that my physical appearance alone (I am rather overweight) was enough for a lot of people to just ... I don't know.- Ignore me? It is really hard for me to put this into words... I was bullied all the way through school... I never did connect with anyone at college... I..... I don't know.. the few friends I made, I made through my hobbies....

I am male, 34 years old. Currently I would say I have 4 real friends, 2 married couples that share hobbies with me (roleplaying, tabletop, video games that kind of stuff) and that I could even rely on if something happened.. so I guess I don't even have a right to post here, because I have those...

These are my only friends. Everybody else is - at best - an acquaintance or work ""buddy"". At worst is it someone I care about but who wouldn't give a flying f... about me.

My famiyl consists of me. Until a few years ago there was me, my mother and my grandpa... we never had much contact with anyone else in our family since my grandmy died because the lot of them are lying assholes who just want your money... when my grandpa died... I don't really know how to say this... he was the only human on this world I 100% knew loved me and I could rely upon always... his last years were a bad trip through multiple illnesses where I took care of about everything that came up because of this until he died.

After that... everything was empty... I tried to live with my mother, because it was my grandpa's last wish that we get along and keep the family dog together (we got the little guy to help with my grandpa's illness among other things) and... it didn't work out... This woman... my own mother.. she.. she stole from me, multiple times... since I was 14.. she does not want to work... she does not want to do anything household related... she... she nearly lost us the dog because of ""forgetting"" to pay the dog tax...

I tried for a year... but in the end.. when here neglect lead to us nearly loosing the dog because she allowed him to bit someone (we alwys knew he was too aggressive after living in the animal shelter for half a year.. I always kept the reigns on him to make sure he does nothing of the sort but she was just... careless.. - as usual - while I was at work) and only told me two days later... I snapped.. and moved out...

I left her the dog.. even though I love the little guy to death... because I know she would have went crazy without him...  the dog is way more attached to her than me because I have to work 8-10 hours per day and she.. is at home and taking care of him.. so I left him because it was the best for him and her...

I still see her every week once.. but honestly think that's only because I want to see my dog... our relationship got a little better after she was hospitalized for smoking related illness, after she actually quit smoking (which was the reason she stole from me the aforementioned multiple times) but still... I do not trust her a little bit.. she stole from me so often.. and so.. callously sometimes... I just.. can't...

My last relationship is 13 years ago.. a woman in a city 5 hours away I met through online gaming.. she.. she was a man once before I met her.. It did not matter to me, I loved her. But she broke up with me 6 months later, never explaining the reason or allowing a discussion about it. Before that, every woman in my life just used the fact, that I try to be helpful and nice (to everyone, not just women) to extort money from me or laugh about me behind my back (happened to me with my ""girlfriend"" when I was 21..  found out later she was just using me to make fun of me behind my back).

I don't know how to amend this situation. Everyday I am going to work. Saturday is roleplay and Sunday I visit my mother... or to say it better I visit my dog which my mother watches over.

I was never outgoing, I don't know how to meet someone, anyone.. all I am feeling is a perpetual feeling of loneliness every damn day.. every day at work is the same dumb shit. Every Saturday is somewhat funny but in the end.. when I go home from one of these married couples I know as friends... I just want to cry.... and sunday I try my hardest just to keep myself occupied...

Sometimes I feel like I am a prisoner of my own mind, which keeps torturing me with thoughts I don't want to have about facts or people who couldn't care less about me and live their own lives... and I don't know how to continue...

I love a woman who will never love me.. and I think I do not really love her.. I love this image in my head I have that she represents... because she is the one woman that is ""friends"" with me that is not married and treats me as a normal human being.::

I know that she will never love me... I told her almost 10 years ago that I love her and her only response was ""Oh no Oh no Oh no"".... 

I still love her... or better to say I love this image.. because  I tend to devolve into a babbling little shit about woman all the time... the last other woman I loved... a co worker in my place of work 5 years ago... I fell in love with her because she at least shared a lot of my interests and treated me like a normal human being... I... I don't know.. she had a boyfriend (as  I found out later when I explained my feelings to her) and she.. I don't know... she ""used me""? because she knew I could not say no to her? I am really in no position to evaluate that... all I know is... I loved her and she did not love me.... but... I don't even know how to meet SOMEONE... or.... if I should... I mean.. there are days I am happy single... and there are days I am very much not... I am overweight (about 40-50 kilos, that is 80-100 pds for you americans..) too much... when I fell in love with my coworker I got the advice from a ""friend"" who worked with me, to train.. so I lost 35 kilos (about 70 pds.) in a month.... I kept that weight for about 3 months... until... it did not work out, my grandpa became very sick and I lost all drive to continue...

Shoud I work out?m How can I meet someone? I don't know... I alwys feel... I don't know.. I the woman I meet does not accept me as fat she does not deserve me as thin? I would train and lose weight but only if someone was concerned about my health... my ex-girfriend from 5 hours away.. she once told me (word for word) ""You are really fat"".... and in that moment... I knew, it was over.. had she said... ""I am concerned about your health""... or anything LIKE this... I would have trained my ass off... but being told ""You are fat"".. it really broke me... so I wasn'ttoo upset when she broke up a few weeks later...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know... I am just so lonely in this world... the woman I still love just told me she had a date (and sex) yesterday and I needed to drink and to vent somewhere today because she will never love me... and.... I don't know.. 

I never really dated.. I donÄt know how this works ""normally""... I am nearly broke... and I... I don't know.. I hate everything... :(

Even when I was little I always dreamed of having a big friend group, I’ve always wanted friends that cared about me. I wanted this as far back as elementary school! I was always a bit introverted so it’s mostly my fault my friendships weren’t ever as deep as I wanted, it still hurts to think about though.

I even have a group of online friends that I love dearly! But lately they’ve been getting busier and busier with their actual lives and I’m stuck here with nobody like a loser. I’m always waiting to see if someones online.

At this point I’m starting to wonder if something is wrong very with ME! I think I’m a caring person but nothing has ever worked out. I want to work the courage up soon to make a doctors appointment just to discuss if anything’s wrong.

5868,wc8d5j,wtvidontcare-,"
I (19f) thought this would be the greatest summer of my teenage years: I finally got a boyfriend and I got selected for a summer job. I feel so fucking stupid now. The boy that I thought that loved me, didn't. He broke up with me in the beginning of june. I think he wants to get back together, but I can't trust him again. I just can't. And the place that I was so excited to work at turned out to be shit. 


On top of this: my best friend is not in town, she is on vacation with her parents, grandparents, and cousins. We've known each other since we were in pre school, and we now go to uni together. Sometimes she goes days without sending a single message. She is too busy getting high with her favorite cousin, who is a really toxic and manipulative person. I text her about the most random shit at the most random times, but i am afraid I am coming off as clingy... I really like her and I don't want to lose her, I can't lose her...


My other four friends are all busy with their other groups of friends. I text them sometimes or send some tiktoks, but they take ages to reply or they don't even do it at all.


My family can be really toxic sometimes. My mom acts like she is so trustworthy, but as soon as I do something wrong she uses what I confided to her against me. My dad is not very present. I mean he is there, but not really. My brother is just a kid, and even tho I love him, I don't want to tell him my whole business.


About three weeks ago, I downloaded tinder again, in hopes of finding a great guy to go on dates with, in hopes of doing things differently this time... I've been on three dates now, with three different guys, and it just feels wrong. I don't feel any chemistry with any of them. I don't know if I have some kind of emotional block, or if I still like my ex, but truth is I am just doing this to fill this stupid void inside of me, to feel more like a teenager.


This is so embarrassing for me. I feel so stupid. People my age are going out almost everyday, going to the beach, to carnivals and festivals, to sleepovers. Meanwhile I am just... here. Existing. Wasting oxygen. I spend my days rewatching the same youtube videos and favorite series, and crocheting. Occasionally I go on tinder to answer the messages, but it almost feels like a chore at this point tbh.


I just fucking hate the summer. Its hot af, too much mosquitos and I always have this overwhelming feeling of loneliness...


(TW: suicide)


I feel like my meds are not working anymore... and sometimes I just think about taking a bunch of them at once... but don't worry, I will not do it, I am a big coward. I kind of wish i could be in some sort of accident. That way nobody would ever know how sad I was and they will never suspect that I was just waiting for that moment to happen...


I know I am really young. I know I am privileged. I know that there are people suffering more than me. But I just want to die. That is the only way I can put it. Nothing ever goes how I want. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I don't think I have ever belonged somewhere. I just wish that I had someone to share everything with. I feel like I don't have anyone to rely on. I wish someone would love me as much as I would love them.",2022-07-30 21:50:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634143348,2,/r/lonely/comments/wc8d5j/i_hate_the_summer/,,0,2,I hate the summer
5869,wc8dna,Lone_thing,"So recently I got this new job. My trainer was cool, chill and we had awesome conversations. She even took me to her house. Nothing inappropriate happened. I genuinely just wanted a friend. So I thought we became friends so I invited her to do something on our day off. She then said she couldnt make it. I started thinking it was a mistake to ask her to hang out. Maybe she thought I was asking her out on a date. But, that wasnt even in my mind. Now she ignores my messages and changed a bit. I couldnt build the courage to admit I didnt have any romantic intentions. I was embarrassed that I accidently asked her out. When in reality I just wanted to go do something. Since I usually do things on my own. Like conventions, movies and going to pick out some manga. I know yall might say I should of made a male friend. But, all my male coworkers will just talked about cars, sports and how many women they slept with and who they would sleep with. Don't get me wrong I like sports and Cars. But, thats literally all they talked about. I was so bored when I went to hang out with them. Fake laughing and nodding at everything they'll say. Point is even making friends can be difficult now.

5875,wc8ml6,cba2name,"I tell myself it will get better. I don't believe it, but I tell myself. The old, fake it till you make it. I made a post on here last year I think. I can't remember, the rona kind of warped my sense of time.. I feel like I've lost 2 years, I'm 32 and I feel like I should be 30. I still live with my parents. I have a job, I have an undergrad and Masters's degree, and I have a Harley. I have a Harly got it recently. My first bike. I got my full license and wow, apart from the first week when I found this needle-thin nail in the rear tire and I had to take it back to the dealer to get it fixed. I've pretty much been on it every day. There's no time for anxiety, there's no time to think about loneliness. There is just the road, watching out for the cars: the wind and the sound of that Stage 1 screaming eagle 114 big v twin. The roar when you rev it just burns away all of the negative feelings. It makes me feel alive and scared and excited. Then I come back and I get off the bike. I chain it up, put the cover over it, and come inside. I'm back to being alone. I want a girl friend, someone to spend time with and you know \*fun times\* with. 

I think It will get better. I'll get on my bike and it will all go away for a short time. Just me, my bike, and the road. 

I'm grateful for what I have, I am...I've done things I've set my mind to. I got my undergrad after having a bad time at university, I got over 6 years of crippling depression to go back to University and get my master's. I got a job in a place I hated so I could pay for it. I achieved my master's degree, I got a job. For the last 5 years, I've wanted a Harley and now I have it. I can do what I set my mind to. I want a girlfriend, I want friends, I want to get fit. I'm going to do this. I will do this. Do or Do not. There is no try. 

I'll check back in in the future with an update. all the best guys. Wish you all well.

5886,wc9tkt,dario_lampa1,"I'm 23 years old and i feel like life is passing me by. The last time i hung out with ""friends"" was 3 weeks ago. I usually go out with them not more than once every month. Every day i feel more lonely and without hope of having a social life. I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 years so things aren't better on that side of my life. 

I don't have a job and i'm not studying for uni. The only two good friends i have are away because of uni and i can't afford to go visit them. The only ""childhood friend"" i had in my small hometown (where i still live) is an asshole who used to beat up his ex girlfriend so every time i see him around i just want to throw up.

Every time i'm in a room with people i don't know i either start panicking or i just shut up and say nothing until i leave. The fact that the world is going to shit right now doesn't really help (climate change, wars and all that beautiful stuff).

I used to go to therapy but that didn't crack it for me even though i really hoped it would. When people ask me how it's going i just say i'm okay and that kind of does it. I'm not capable of sharing what i'm really feeling, not even with my closest friend. And the truth is that i don't feel much. I don't feel interested in anything, i'm always bored and the only thing i feel is this mild feeling of sadness and loneliness. Sometimes i feel like crying but i can't even do that. 

I spend most of my days binge watching something (doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it makes time go by), hoping for something to change even if i know that nothing will. I can't stand motivational messages or that ""resilience""/""positive mindset"" bullshit because it's mostly a 21st century way to say ""just ignore what you're going through and get back to work"".

Nowadays with my very limited line up of people I know, I have to wait days or weeks for their reply. My friend of 6 years is going off to university (a year before me) in a month. She posts all day her hanging out with her friends on her instagram, she calls me her bestfriend but consistenly forgets I exist. Were we even friends in the first place if I didn't leave a strong enough mark for you to think about me at all?

Every summer indoors. I do try go out alone, but my mental illness can't handle it, I need to be with someone to feel comfortable when I'm outside. I've always been poor at making friends with good people, even my first ever best friend used to trauma dump and manipulate me 24/7. I hated her, but now I just miss the company. 

It feels like I've lost my late teens to loneliness. I should be going out, getting drunk, smoking, partying, staying out late, having sleepovers, maybe even have been in a relationship. But I've been the same boring person for the past 2 years, dangerously stuck in my ways with no sign of improvement. I'm only 18 but I don't see much future for myself. 

I don't know what I want precisley. But even just one person who recognises my existence regularly, but doesn't use me or abuse me would be nice.

5915,wcbohb,Pensive_Nights,"it's now day 3 since our last conversation about whether ""us"" should still be a thing. 

My iphone just reminded me of the letter that I had been working on for the past month and a half. It was a love letter... for you. But unfortunately, I never got the chance to give it to you. Life prevented me from doing so. I first got covid, then we got into an argument. 

This letter took a lot of courage for me to write, as the word ""love"" had been difficult for me to say, as I was afraid to fall in love again from all the heartbreaks I had been through. I just read the letter again today (thanks to my siri suggestions) and was surprised by how much our dynamic has changed since our argument. I wrote about how I loved you for caring for me and supporting me through my hard times despite your busy schedule. Your selflessness melted away the guards I had put up the past few years. But now, I cannot say the same. Since our argument, you told me you could no longer could support me as you realized you needed to be selfish. Don't get me wrong, being selfish is okay... just probably not the way you are doing it now. You said you weren't sorry for leaving me during my hardest week because you knew you had the right to be selfish. Hearing this, I was upset. I wanted to burn this unsent love letter, but I hesitated; it hurts me to erase that hopeful girl who wrote this letter — the girl who finally picked up her broken heart pieces and thought she could love again.  

Dear you, I used to want to believe in you and love you. I remember before I left your place after our argument, I was so afraid that that would be my last time of spending time with you; so, out of despair, I created more opportunities for ""us time"". That night, I faked being horny and having pleasure to fuck you to remember how my pussy wraps around your dick (But I did not enjoy a second of it. Who knew I would ever fake such a thing). That night, I asked to eat dinner with you just so I could remember this feeling for the one last time (but who knew you would make me eat away from you, on your bed). That night, I asked to borrow your shirt to remember the softness of your clothes (but who knew, after I took off your shirt, you threw it in the hamper as if I were dirty). Dear you, that night, despite my earnest attempt of recreating scenes that could perhaps reignite your passion, I could still feel the anger in the air. We changed so much babe. Now, I could not help but feel my chest tight, my throat suffocated. I missed who we used to be... we were so happy. I didn’t think I ever wanted my love for you to have a past tense. But it's happening now. I loved you. And I hate it.",2022-07-31 00:29:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1576109138,5,/r/lonely/comments/wcbohb/dear_you/,,0,4,Dear you...

5925,wcd4go,lifeisacloud101,"I’m not saying he isn’t lonely. In fact, he is terribly lonely at times. Because of his fame, he has difficulty trusting people since so many people are out to get him. He will talk to me about his loneliness. I talk to him about my loneliness too. He says he understands, but I don’t think he really understands. He is lonely- but I am all alone. It’s not the same. Like, physically, I am all alone.

He has over a million subscribers on Youtube. Each video gets at least 1 million views. He has thousands of likes and positive comments. He can reply to a comment and get a response at any moment. People are hoping he will talk to them. On Twitter, he also has thousands of followers. He could tweet anything and get a like and a reply. People get so excited to talk to him. He also had a discord server with thousands of people. If he joined a VC- people rushed to talk to him. His viewers are always DMing him in the hopes of a conversation. People talk so positively about him. He probably has the best reputation in his community.

He also has many friends. He has a large group of video editors that he gets to work with. And they all love talking to him. He also has a group of IRL friends that come to his house often to hang out. They go on trips and such together. They are constantly messaging him and talking to him. He lives in England, and I’m in NJ, so I can’t join them. He is also close with his family. I believe he has a good relationship with his parents and brother from what he said.

I am incredibly alone. I come from an abusive household where I am forced to hide in my room all day. I also never made any friends, IRL or online. I feel like it’s too late for me to make IRL friends. I graduated with a master’s degree and never made any friends during my time at school. All of my coworkers ignore me. I try really hard to make friends but get ignored. Any texts I send in the GroupMe to hang out get ignored.

I know what people are probably thinking, what about your best friend? He is amazing but is often busy. And I feel like when I talk too much to him that I’m annoying him. And I don’t want to lose him. He’s all I have left. I can’t lose him. He’s also the greatest friend I ever had. I can’t go back to having no one. I refuse to. I can’t go back to that place EVER. NEVER AGAIN!!!! He did introduce me to people, but no friendships developed. I tried and tried again. I would ask my friend to help me. But I was never good enough for them. They didn’t like me. I tried everything to be liked and start conversations. But people slowly disappeared. None of these people live near me, so it was all on Twitter and Discord. It’s easy to be ignored by online people.

I even feel ignored on social media. Since I’m not made to have friends, I want my existence to be acknowledged. I’ll tweet something and can’t even get a like. I make posts on Reddit and get ignored. I used to post in r/lonely and r/suicidewatch, but no one bothered to upvote. It would just be nice to know that my life impacts others. People are aware of my existence. I am not trying to be loved or needed or wanted anymore. I tried that for years, and it didn’t work. I am not made to have friends. I am not important. But can I least exist? Can one person see and hear me? I don’t even mind my parents abusing me because it at least means I have their attention.

I am so desperate for someone to acknowledge my existence that I am jealous that my friend gets hate comments. I know it’s wrong for people to send hate. But it means that he was worth someone’s time. I used to have abusive friendships, and I miss them. I miss being used, mistreated, and taken advantage of. I feel like my presence is so awful that people aren’t even willing to abuse me. I want to beg people- please abuse me. I don’t know why everyone in the world just ignores me. The world doesn’t want me. I don’t want to marry because I won’t have bridesmaids.

Honestly it has never been easy for me to get over these things. Everything just feels depressing when I’m depressed. I’m constantly tired, I don’t have the motivation to do anything, and every time I do anything it feels like I’m taking every ounce of my energy to do it. Getting through it feels like it’s even more difficult. I never know when I’m going to get through it, I try everything in the hope that something will work, and on top of that I’m doing all of this with it weighing down on my conscience. 

I should think that it would feel satisfying when the pain has gone away and I realize that I had overcome my depression. But it never feels like that. It always feels like I’m right back where I started in the sense that I haven’t done anything meaningful during that time, and even if I did the  pain I felt seemed to overshadow my accomplishments.

Lately the feeling has progressively gotten worse and iv gotten more depressed now that iv been trying to date in the last few years. Also living with family doesnt help that much but moving is not really an option for me. Iv tried getting out and going places to meet people but living in a smaller farm area that's difficult if you don't drink or do drugs. I have pretty bad anxiety and I'm introverted so going out is difficult for me. I'm a huge nerd and love most everything having to do with that so finding people around here that are into that is pretty difficult because they are all at home. Iv found myself wanting to get out more and do more but it's difficult when I have no one to go with or do anything with. I'm always going to the theater alone even though I try inviting people. No one ever invites me to anything.

5997,wcllju,BatCupcakes,"The first social situation I've had in nine months went terribly with me oversharing and almost certainly making some people feel uncomfortable the small bit of confidence I had in my social abilities is pretty much shot. I know I can build it up again if given a good opportunity but I have no idea when that'll happen.

It seems like my life is just a series of events I wish I could rewind and do differently or fast forward far enough to when it stops bothering me so much or I know I'll never see the people I was so awkward around again. 

I hate that everyone my age has a family and or kids. I can't relate very much with them and they always have more important things to do than talk to me which I completely understand. I haven't met anyone in years who has similar tastes in music. I like stupid nerdy shit like history and political stuff beyond what you'd hear on cable news. I like to make spreadsheets and catalogue dumb shit. I'm not adverse to ""popular"" stuff. If someone asked me to go to a movie I wouldn't care what it was as long as I felt like someone wanted to spend time with me. I just feel so damn weird and unlikable lately. 

I used to think that I liked being kinda weird and really nerdy, but fuck that shit. Being smart and caring about shit nobody else cares about has gotten me absolutely nothing. Doing well in school has never gotten me a date and I could have the same job I have now with average grades. It's like even the last few tiny things I didn't absolutely hate about myself have proven to be just as shitty as the rest of me.

6004,wcnkv9,Accomplished_Bad8636,"I have always felt lonely. Even though I have a family and friends. My family has never been the loving kind. Ever since I was a child I have been witnessing horrible fights between my parents (sometimes violent). I have friends, and they are really nice, but everyone of them has a loving family so they can't quite feel what I go through. My best friend has really warm and loving parents and I can't help but feel jealous of her. She's really nice and has always been a big support for me but really idk I just feel so pathetic to be always complaining about my horrid fucked up family. She even has a boyfriend, a successful first relationship. 

I have been working hard, reading up on childhood trauma, meditating, practicing self-compassion but it's so hard when my fundamental support system is so bad. 

Yesterday I received my first ever job offer. There were only five people in the whole program who got selected. All the others who got selected were out celebrating with family. In my home I was witnessing a horrible family fight that ended in me getting slapped by my father. No celebrations. 

The reason I want a boyfriend is because I want a second chance at a family. I'm tired of feeling like it's me against the world, I want someone to be on my team. I'm okay on most days because my friends are really nice, but at times like during college breaks I get so lonely. All my friends are out spending time with their families, but not me. I can't quite ask them to drop their family engagements to hang out with me. But I don't wanna be alone.

I have had two relationships in the past and been dumped both times. I just want a boyfriend so so bad. Someone for whom I will be a priority.

And please don't tell me about loving myself. Like I mentioned above, I have been working on those things but really it'd be so much easier if I had someone who loved me.

Then dudes, even married ones, will drop me the moment they find out I'm not going to sleep with them..

6007,wcodux,Rare-Replacement-175,"Hello! I posted this in r/agoraphobia but thought it would be helpful here as well! Thanks!


Hello! I am a fellow struggler of depression, anxiety, and yes, agoraphobia. I was perusing the community when I saw a post that made me think that a post about tips for college-aged individuals dealing with agoraphobia would be an awesome thing! I myself am a graduate student who deals with these things, so I thought I’d share what has helped me stay in school and work toward finishing my education. In the comments, please feel free to add your own helpful tips!

1. Most important is to seek treatment for your panic attacks, depression, etc if it has come to the point where your daily life and quality of life is being significantly impacted. 

2. Most people don’t know this, but you qualify for ADA accommodations through your university IF you have: A. a diagnosis of a mental health condition, and B. A letter from your treating physician stating you would benefit from accommodations. These accommodations range from extended testing time, extensions on assignment deadlines, and being excused on times where your mental health is rough or being allowed to leave class if a panic attack happens. Don’t worry: your privacy is of upmost importance and they do not disclose this to professors, Nor do you have to. A letter of accommodations will be made that will state your accommodations that a professor is obligated to provide. All you have to do is communicate the need to us it and communicate with your professors about them. And you’ll be set!

3. Search up your university and counseling to see if your university offers counseling (Most do to students free of charge). This is helpful if you are unable to access care through other means.

4. If things are so rough, please consider a semester off or a gap year to work on yourself. Don’t worry about outside pressures or getting behind: LIFE IS A MARATHON. Not a SPRINT. Take time to work on you if needed and have no shame in doing so.


5. College can be tough due to adapting to adult life, managing relationships, and new financial pressures. Try to take time to reflect on what you want out of life and make that your focus. Sometimes we get caught up in the future or past so much. You are only young once so please try to spend your time doing things you enjoy. This will help with socializing and your overall mental health, which should hopefully help you manage the stress of school and get the grades you want.

Lastly, I’ll part by saying this: please realize you matter. I tell myself I don’t matter sometimes, but people do care about people in some form. Sometimes people just aren’t good at expressing. Life is hard, but all we can do is try and get out of life what we want through the means we have. Keep fighting the good fight people.

I’m 19f and have struggled with BPD and major depression for as long as I can remember. But in the last six months or so I feel like I’ve slowly become isolated from everyone else without even meaning to.
Until a month ago I had a full time job. I have a small group of friends who love me. I have a boyfriend and a family. I have a dog. 

Yet every interaction feels forced. No matter how hard I try it doesn’t feel like I’m truly connecting with them. Even when I try to open up and express how I feel it all seems superficial and like no one really gets me. 



A month ago I quit my job to go solo travelling, thinking maybe that would help. Despite having a job I was agoraphobic and struggled to get myself out of the house unless it was for work or to travel to see my boyfriend, who I’m also becoming emotionally estranged to as well. Travelling solo did force me to come out of my shell and yet it didn’t ease the pain at all! I still feel like I’m drowning under water when I see people living their lives and socialising happily. 


Maybe it’s just deep self hatred but I don’t think I fit in. Anywhere. I feel like a monster on display everywhere I go. Nothing brings me joy anymore except for nature and animals because I know they don’t see me as a freak, just another human.

Anyway, back in college i struggled a lot with my mental health due to stuff that happened with my studies (and my dating life ig). I got held back a year and it weighed heavily on me even though I was not much of an academic achiever ever since. college and the first few years of adulting (working) was really hard for me and i had a lot of SH thoughts and it was really hard to control my temper at that time as well. I lashed out a lot towards my family (thank god they have a lot of patience) and I fell out of contact with a lot of my friends back in high school and college. Ever since I started working, that’s everything I did. It got hard for me to go out and hang out with the few remaining friends I had and I closed myself to almost everyone bc it made me comfortable. The isolation comforted me i think. Fast forward to when the pandemic happened, i lost contact to almost all of my friends and i stayed home 24/7 for almost 1 and half year. My friends’ life went on, they enjoyed life despite the pandemic and all. And i gotta say even though my isolation got worse it was better for me i think. My mental health became stable and all that. I was in a very good place and i was very happy with myself and with my career when the WFH set up started bc i thrived on it. As the pandemic progressed, i stayed home, worked at home, didn’t really went out to see the few friends i have since i am deathly scared of getting the virus. Recently, in an unfortunate turn of events I got covid from my parents (lol) it was mild thankfully since we’re all vaccinated (vaccines work!!) and no one talked to me during my quarantine. No friend messaged me well wishes or get well soon message. Nothing. It felt super sad and lonely and after years of saying ‘wow i am finally in a good place and i am happy’ I admitted to myself that I am not happy. And that I feel lonely i don’t have friends bc it’s hard for me to hold down conversations.

hope we all feel ok soon",2022-07-31 16:30:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609824406,12,/r/lonely/comments/wcsqcs/im_finally_admitting_it_to_myself/,,1,10,i’m finally admitting it to myself

It went on to say, it doesn’t matter how conventionally pretty u are, it’s just about men seeing that you’ve made an effort. 

But never in my life has a boy come up to me and asked for my number or anything, and I’ve never heard of this happing to anyone. 

So I don’t want to pin my hopes on this happening if there’s 0 chance.

Your memory is hazy from the meds  
It has to be so frustrating

You tell me things - nice things, ugly things  
Then say you didn’t mean any of them

You send me screenshots of others  
Cropping off the name to keep me jealous

Or maybe it’s all in my head  
Or maybe it’s all in your head

When your promises turn into half truths  
And the half truths into full lies

And you say that nothing in life is serious  
You were the only one I took seriously

\-

I should've known it was impossible. A mirage, nothing real at all. It really fucking hurts to be someone's fun, to be used. But then it's on me, because I chose to not pay attention, not really.

It makes me nervous that you have so many of my secrets, because I don't know what you'll do with them. And it makes me irate that you know I won't do anything with yours - because they are sacred to me.

I should've known. I should've known. I should've known.

Now I know. I know enough. I know you don't care, and never did. And I know there were others before me that went through the same, and I know there have been others since.

6048,wcv5x3,Tower_Sensitive,"When your energy is not returned, you could start asking yourself questions like, am I boring? Am I asking for too much? Am I not worth it? Why is my energy never Reciprocating the same energy you receive from people does not mean you are being petty or playing tit for tat, but it is simply an act of self-preservation. Any relationship is a two-way street and requires effort from both sides to survive. Sometimes, our expectations of others are what lead us to disappointment. We expect too much from people, especially friends, and sometimes they are just not as passionate or caring as we are, or we aren’t at the top of their priority list. As you get older, your responsibilities increase and so do those of your friends. You have to be more understanding when it seems like your friends are not reciprocating the energy you give them. Remember that they also have their own lives and issues they could be dealing with, and that is probably why they are not as fast at responding to your texts or at your beck and call when you need them. Rethink what you expect from people and adjust your expectations. If they really have no malicious reasons for not returning your energy and it’s just that life got in the way, give them space and be an understanding person…up to a point. However, if this friend never reciprocates your energy, and it becomes the norm, you might need to reorganize your friends’ list so they aren’t your go-to person anymore or look for more supportive friends who will be there when you need them. After all, why should you have to accept breadcrumbs when you are worth an entire buffet? If you are the only one who is always prioritizing someone and giving 100% of yourself to them while getting nothing in return, not only are they using you, but you might also lose yourself in the process.

Don’t wait for someone to use up all your energy and make you lose sight of your worth. Instead, start putting yourself first and valuing yourself more.❤️",2022-07-31 18:18:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594540201,1,/r/lonely/comments/wcv5x3/reciprocation/,,0,0,Reciprocation

made no friends yesterday. but i mean i had some people complimenting my rat tail but that’s about it. only conversations from yesterday was with people that had a booth.. still fun and interesting to talk to since there were many talented artists/people. 

overall it was an amazing experience.. but i made no friends sadly. was hoping i would find a wifey there. but hey maybe next year.

if you’ve never been to a comic con.. i think you should give it a try. if i were to ever find a wife/bestfriend.. it would be there.. but sadly life doesn’t work how we want it to.

*actually i lied. one of my homies were there with his family but somehow i managed to not hit send responding to his text.. so yea we never met up but it was still an amazing experience especially by yourself.

best thing about it. i got to talk to another kevin that was from Atlanta. he had two kids and a wife.. but he was there alone.. and i couldn’t just not stop by his booth.. so i bought some of his artwork which was very cool. one was with lilo and stitch house.. second one was the apollo 11 launch.. and the other was a sunset view that he captured at a hotel near disney world. i’m very happy with my purchase.. just wish he had more game of thrones stuff.

I don’t even care if anyone reads this I just want to get it off my chest. 



I have friends, but I don’t see them often. I don’t have to work which is a blessing but also a curse, because I don’t have any responsibility or sense of purpose. but I also couldn’t just go get a job because my depression prevents me from being able to even get up to eat or get water so I could never hold a job. So every day I wake up, sleep, and repeat. I feel like my purpose in life is to wait for the next day, every day. I wake up feeling like maybe there’s something to look forward to, but there never is. I haven’t left my apartment in weeks. I have nothing to do. I feel like my life is so idle, so sedentary. I’m always bored and sad. I’ve thought about offing myself but I’ve lost two people I’ve loved dearly and I see how it affects their loved ones. So I could never do that to the people I love. I’m only 22, I’m just wondering if this will be my life for the rest of my life. It’s scary thinking about how much life I still have left to live because what am I even gonna do?

He used to post on Reddit a lot. He said it was hard to get people to understand him. We loved to laugh at how surreal his situation with herpes was. 

He said that he found it funny that he could tell the truth and be dead serious about how herpes effected him and then stand back and laugh at the irony and absurdity of it.

He was an artist and loved absurdity and had a dark sense of humor. I miss it already.

The last few times were hard because the nerve pain kept him from going hard in the gym and he was losing muscle quickly. He looked hollow.

He always said he worked his whole life to become something and to be attractive and herpes basically ruined all of it.

He was going to move to a secluded place so he wouldn’t have to be seen until they cured herpes. I was looking forward to helping him fix up a house. I’ve never done things like that. He said I could experiment all I wanted and didn’t care if it was perfect.

I (27M) wonders how it is for you to be alone usually on a Friday or Saturday evening when you know people are hanging out and having drinks outside. Maybe it is true or not for all of us, but that is how I feel about these evenings. It usually breaks my heart, because during the week you can focus on work or do sports in the evening after work but for me personally like Friday and Saturday eve are the worst.

I have tried in the past going to the city alone and picking a bar where I could join a talk with strangers and it helps, but sad to say is that it usually only lasts for the night, eventhough we get along well and exchange contact details. Like I said, I can go out to bars on these evenings and talk to strangers, but rarely does it form a friendship out of it. I'm also quite picky in selecting my friends. 

I'm an ambivert, slightly extroverted and a lack of social contact or friendships is really detrimental to my mental health at the moment.

6078,wcyllb,Liebealt,"I want to start by saying that this is kind of a vent, but thought that maybe someone else is in the same situation so maybe we can share our common fear.

I had a very rough and lonely period until two months ago, which lasted around 3 years. I lived in another city, working most of the time and not being able to meet new people, while I lost most of my friends (many moved for various reasons, while others simply disappeared). I went through by isolating myself and ""accepting"" this loneliness, until I snapped out and realized that wasn't what I wanted for myself, came back to my hometown and changed job. In the last two months I was able to stay with my old time friends, my family and even managed to hang out with a girl.

The loneliness was fading away finally, I also had very positive thoughts about my future since I will be even more engaged in many activities from September. In the last two weeks however a bit of things happened: my sister went on holiday, my friends aren't always ""available"" due to work or other reasons, and the girl I was hanging out with started to write me less and less. 

I'm now in a situation where deep inside I know I'm not alone and that things will eventually recover, but seeing all this stuff happening right after I was thinking things were getting better demoralized me, and I realized that I can't stand a single day alone by myself without feeling ""abandoned"" and pretty much hopeless.

6081,wcyskx,WhoaPotatoo,"I met this girl, we will call her Heather (that's not her real name) 😅

See, I met her at work and I found her really attractive, she walks around with such confidence... I work in retail and she was always on the other side of the store, but when she had downtime she would come find me and we would go and take a little break and vape, those moments were honestly so pure and quiet, I could talk to her all day if I wanted to, the first couple of weeks I would totally ignore her, because I would start feeling like I'm ""falling"" for her, to get my mind off things I would walk home, 4 miles and just listen to music to clear my head, while walking I'd stop and pause, and keep telling myself ""You don't fucking love her, you don't even know her, just stop."" And my mind couldn't quite leave the thought of her, and I'd eventually end up at home missing her presence, I'd be thinking ""Why didn't you talk to her more today""... ""Why don't YOU go and talk to her""... I guess my reasoning is I DON'T want to fall for anyone again, me and my ex had a pretty bad ""breakup"" and I really don't want to go into detail.. it's been 4 years, and my ex somewhat snuck back into my life and heart reacts all my Facebook profile pictures, and it almost seems like she wants ME to pursue her... I don't know, my mind is fucked.

Anyways, Heather's brother died the other night, and she came to ME for comfort, I did my best through text message, and she somewhat opened up to me, and told me ""we should hang out or something, I want to get to know you better."" And that one line of her message keeps staying in my head, she's obviously interested in me... right? I don't fucking know... I'm sitting in my room right now trying my best not to think of her but my mind will just not leave her alone, I keep checking my snapchat to see if she's messaged me, and nothing.. I want to message her, but my mind keeps telling me, ""No  she doesn't want to talk to you..."" so in stupidity I'll post something on my snapchat story that's not me, I'm begging for attention from her, I've blocked everyone else out of seeing my snapchat story except her so SHES THE ONLY ONE TO SEE IT... I'll put up attention seeking shit, that's really cringe... like ""sitting here alone wish I had someone to talk to."" And sometimes Heather would reply with concern and I LOVE THAT SHIT, and I hate it.  It makes me feel so worthless... every time my phone vibrates I'm like ""HEATHER MESSAGED ME"" just to open up my phone and see it's a notification that my phones on 15% and that just kills my mood... she hasn't messaged me all day and here I am sitting here thinking of posting some attention seeking shit again.. just so me and her can talk and MAYBE I can lead the conversation to asking her if she wants to hang out, but I'm too much of a lame ass to do it.

I didn't want this to happen, I didn't want to fall for her, but my mind keeps drifting off to her.. oh yeah, and what's killing me is she's putting in her two weeks today at the job I currently work at today, and that means I won't see her anymore and the thought of that makes me want to curl up and cry my eyes out... I know once she leaves what little connection me and her have is going to disappear and she's gonna find someone else. I'm so stupid. I'm overwhelmed, I don't really see her as much anymore because I recently got a promotion and me and her work opposite shifts, I still see her for maybe 15 minutes, and those 15 minutes is what I live for right now, apparently because all mind revolves around now is getting closer to Heather... and I fucking hate it... the other night when she had told me her brother died she ranted to me, and I honestly don't know if she was drunk or what, but she wanted me to hang out with her and catch up, but I made some lame ass excuse and told her I was busy for whatever reason... 

Ugh, I just hate my mindset on relationships, I just want to die, I don't want to tell anyone I know of the shit I'm going through, and it's killing me. My parents have noticed I've been sitting in my room all day, and that's because I'm balling my eyes out randomly at the though of Heather, I don't want to tell them because I did that shit with my ex, and I know they think I'm the biggest dumbass, for staying with my ex through all the obvious cheating and lying my ex put me though... I've been going on 8 mile walks just to clear my head and once I get home it's the same shit, same reasons to cry. I'm such a scummy piece of shit. I'm hoping I eventually get over these attachment issues.

And then I realized those communities I was in are people like me. Others who are alone. Mostly made up of the same people everyday. I started noticing all of the posts were by the same 50-100 people. And all of a sudden I realized what I was doing. And the more I started to put myself in other places, the more I realized I had secluded myself with this group of 50-100 people who were also social recluse like me.

I’ve never been in a serious relationship and get quite shy when I actually like a guy or girl. But in general I will still try and make conversation. I never really minded being single cos I would have a  short fling and the crush would occupy my mind. But now I just spend my day daydreaming about whoever I’m fixated on at that time yet they probably wouldn’t know. The only guys that have actually tried to make a connection and sleep with me that I liked have girlfriends so obvs I’m not gonna go there even when I’m feeling insecure and alone.

I come across as confident but am super obsessed with my body and have huge insecurities. The last guy I almost got in a relationship with dumped me cos basically thought I was too confident and the guy I like now I just found out a girl I know likes, me and him have good talks occasionally but I’m just not going to get in the way and the situation puts me off. I feel hopeless that I’ll never be able to get that deep connection with anyone I like as I can’t ever imagine me being able to not put on this front.

This is my first Reddit post I don’t expect any replies I just needed a place to get my feelings out.",2022-07-31 22:53:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/wd1dk8/ive_always_been_popular_and_had_friends_yet_im/,,0,1,I’ve always been popular and had friends yet I’m more lonely than ever

6116,wd27ii,sketchy_random,"As the title says im just curious on thoughts about if its a dick move to stop talking to people that you feel you can no longer have the same connection or relationship with anymore.
I feel like i should maybe just stop talking to them because they dont actually bother with me, but they do with other people, they kinda only get hold of me when theres no one else or they need some diy done or something, or when they want to rant about their problems but not listen to mine or acknowledge the problems between us. Its gotten to the point where the literal few people i considered friends has now become 1 real friend and a couple of people im not sure i want to be associated with anymore.
They have all the time in the world for people who talk shit about them or pretend friends as i call them, but they cant get hold of the guy thats actually been there for them for years?
They tell me that theyre going to come see me or say we should do a particular thing on the weekend etc, and then i legit just dont hear from them for days or weeks. It makes me feel shit, and i am quite lonely. But i dont think i can be friends with people who are so full of empty words and never any actions to back them up.",2022-07-31 23:31:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1577284461,7,/r/lonely/comments/wd27ii/is_it_a_dick_move_to_stop_talking_to_people/,,0,14,Is it a dick move to stop talking to people

6121,wd2p3h,gradeAmilk," i’ve been trying to hold it in but i will trauma dump here. i’m the last 2 years of my life i’ve been fighting to keep my head up. i’ve been raped at a party, told my friend and she didn’t really care. i’ve been sexually assaulted by a teacher in my senior year being told he was going to be fired but he’s still there and teaching. moved out of my parents house because my mom would treat me like shit all the time and when she went to swing on me it all was over. i get shammed by my aunt and she constantly judging and making comments about how i look. both of my grandparents died. my dad is bleeding internally, and odds are looking bad for him. i don’t have many friends, i have 2 my cousin and our mutual friend. my cousin won’t talk to me even after telling people i was raped and that i was dealing with pregnancy scares, and telling our mutual friend how i molested by my family when i was a kid. our mutual friend won’t really talk to me anymore. and me and my boyfriend are constantly fighting. i’m not saying i’m an angel at all, i’m not a good person either. i probably deserve all of this. all i’m trying to say it’s hard to keep waking up. and that i don’t want to be here anymore",2022-07-31 23:55:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1589662293,4,/r/lonely/comments/wd2p3h/i_want_help/,,0,2,i want help

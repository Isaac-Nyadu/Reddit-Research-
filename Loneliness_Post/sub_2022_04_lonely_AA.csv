4,ttdrmw,moajoca,"My bday is coming up and I will feels so shittyy around this time because I can never celebrate myself. I can only think about the amount of people that have crossed my life and many friends I used to have that now won‚Äôt even care or think about me like I think about them. I moved alot as a kid I never got a stable friend group or anything of that sort, people just move on I guess. I can‚Äôt help but feel less of myself because I don‚Äôt feel worthy of having people pay attention to me, knowing little details about me, or just having someone there to call or text when I don‚Äôt feel good. I know I am a great friend, daughter, cousin, niece, sister, girlfriend so why can‚Äôt I receive the same love I put out there. Why can‚Äôt people express that love towards me. Because of that I feel lonely. Always being there people, making them feel important and heard, but I can‚Äôt get that back. At times I have accepted the bare minimum from people and I guess that is their expectation now. I always say everything is okay but it‚Äôs not. Is it okay if call you later? No I want to to speak with you now. You don‚Äôt want anything for your bday right? Yes, it would be nice but I don‚Äôt need to tell you. I didn‚Äôt invite you because I knew you didn‚Äôt want to go? Why would you assume that! I want people to be considerate of me and be more empathic just like I am with them, specially those around me. I am okay with being by myself, so I think. But this isolation I put myself in will not be good in the long term I suppose.

34,tthuim,mindgoesbrrr,"So, I'm 27 now, never had a partner and I think I'm at a point where I tried everything and went through all the phases you could go through.

I was depressed, reached out for help, went to therapy for 2 years, got medicated, felt better, had a positive view on life, tried online dating, had a few dates which led to nothing, tried to focus on me and my own life, developed substance abuse problems, successfully fighted my substance abuse problems, had a positive view on life again, depression... You get the point. 

The thing is: I can't fill this void that comes from loneliness / the lack of a SO. I went to therapy every week for 2 years, but it made no sense because I know what my goddamn problem is. And neither therapy nor drugs won't fix it. I don't need ""another perspective"" or whatever. I know exactly what would make me the happiest person on earth and it's a partner who loves me and cares about me. It doesn't even have to be ""the one"", I just need someone to show me that I'm loveable. 

After all the shit I tried and all the ""almosts"", I completely lost hope. There is no coping mechanism left that I could try without knowing I'm lying to myself. I have no energy left to keep fighting, getting my hopes up and get them crushed again, like it was the case for the last 7 years. 

Also I can't really give up, because I know that love is the only thing that would make me happy. This situation I'm in ruins my life, makes me an anxious depressed pathetic fuck, and I can't do nothing about it because you can't force love. I just don't get why I can't have it when all people around me can and it makes me fucking mad. At me, at the universe, at my pathetic life. 

Don't really know where I'm going with this, but I think that the conclusion is that coping maybe works for temporary problems, but it doesn't for problems that went on for a decade and you exactly know the solution for.

43,ttiekv,[deleted],"I met her on Ur My Type, and I think she's really cool. Despite being far away in another country which I'm not typically used to, she possesses some intrinsic values that have alignment with me and I very much like that shit. The thing with people on Reddit, you're all either extremely horny trying to get one thing or you have such high expectations that if the person you're talking to doesn't meet them in any capacity, you end up ghosting them or lose immediate interest.

being that I don't entirely possess a type A personality, I still made it my mission to be creative or attempt to have various kinds of conversations with dozens of people on this sub. the main issue? they either don't respond, don't care, I'm too *ugly* for them, they don't possess the comprehension for a good opener, and last but not least, that I'm a fucking catfish. That one gets really old.

I don't know though. I've gone my whole life being really kind to people with no expectations, I never diminished the capacity of others or went with the intentions of being a bad individual even in private. but there's no fucking yields to it. it's like all you *LONELY* people out there have no true concept of being lonely, and the impression you have is by feigning such loneliness and isolation yet when someone who you aren't attracted to or isn't exactly like you, you're like: ""Wahhhh, I'm lonely. BUT NOT YOU"". And then the conversation is done because all of my complaints listed above.

I love genuine people, don't get me wrong. I absolutely adore those that give equal energy to those who initially make the original efforts. If you don't see the message, fine. But if you look and you judge, or you ghost the conversation for what ever asinine reason UNLESS you're uncomfortable, then you're just an asshole. It's really not that hard to be kind, it takes almost zero effort.

Tl;Dr This subreddit is a fucking joke and a lie, and I feel like I'm the only person who ever gave a damn or an effort.

Im (21M) in my last year of college undergrad now and have done pretty well. Ive worked hard doing research and honors. Its paid off well as ive been offered a PhD position at a school out of state. 

Starting college was great as i made tons new friends, was going to parties, living off campus with roomates, and eventually even made a girlfriend. Everything was great and my life was pretty balanced. 

However after a combination of covid, fractioning of my friend group, and my GF breaking up with me (ironicly because of my likelihood of moving out of state for grad school while she was still doing her undergrad) i have very few good friends left. I know in all likelyhood ill lose them too the moment i move out of state for grad school. Ive gone from a time where i was always doing things and hanging out with people to sitting in my room alone every weekend. Im living in campus dorms because i wasnt able to find anyone to rent off campus with. 

Im not sure why im working so hard every week to keep up with school work + research writing when i get to the weekend and feel lonelier then any other point in my life. Ive never been great at making new friends so the idea of having to start over after i move is overwhelming.",2022-04-01 06:53:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599584296,3,/r/lonely/comments/ttkhok/not_sure_why_im_working_so_hard_when_i_have_no/,,0,2,Not sure why im working so hard when I have no one to share it with

83,ttmusy,MrCatalysmo,"(21M) I discovered the internet in my early days of playing on my new xbox 360 with people i met in Call of Duty 2 lobbies on Christmas day, with my irl best friend. Ever since that day, i slowly started to use social media as a substitute for making and interacting with irl friends. It was a simple thing to see, it was easier. Complete anonymity, control over who and how much you wanted to talk to someone and most important of all, limitless choices of people from different walks of life. 



I have been on Discord (and more recently and infrequently Reddit) for over 5 years now. I have met friends, best friends, girlfriends, parents (not mine lol) priests, musicians, doctors, therapists and so on throughout my years on that platform. And out of all those different, unique and wonderful (and sometimes not so wonderful) people I‚Äôve met over a variety of different servers, ranging from writing groups to massive hangouts. It all feels fake. In-organic, something filled with empty promises and a lack of trust. 




Never in my life have i had my heart played with like a chew toy so much over lines of text, or a simple voice call. The sheer lack of honest and genuine people on the internet and social media as a whole is slim, due to the simple fact that it could be anyone, doing anything with anyone in the world while also talking to you. The sheer power of being completely anonymous, mostly unmoderated and without needing any sort of filter to interact with anyone.  Without the need to act like a socially acceptable human being is just‚Ä¶brutal.




Discord has crippled my social-skills for the worse, even worse from being the introverted shy kid in class nobody talked to because i grew up differently than everyone else around me. To turning me into a bitter, social outcast who could only get internally frustrated at myself for the lack of said skills whenever i work up the courage to socialize in public places, events and local conventions and whatnot. 



For the past 3 or so years, I‚Äôve barely left my parents house. Having the occasional job for to then quit over my sheer social anxiety as to how people treat me, their words practically ringing in my ears like tinnitus long after the day has ended due to a slight mishap. I am unmotivated entirely, have no future ambitions, instead to try and quell my mental state with things I enjoy, like video games, watching videos and‚Ä¶well, not much else. At some points in my life, the hobbies i had were vast. I painted miniatures, played golf, worked on cars‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all gone. Instead, it‚Äôs replaced by Discord. It‚Äôs poisoned me, made me crave validation I‚Äôve never had and i keep coming back. Ghosting after breakup after mental breakdown. I  want to start over, I wanted to have never found Discord, or any other social media platform I‚Äôve ever used. My life would‚Äôve turned out better that way.


TLDR: Discord made my life into a vicious cycle.",2022-04-01 09:45:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1513648720,7,/r/lonely/comments/ttmusy/the_internet_is_the_worst_place_to_make_friends/,,0,8,The internet is the worst place to make friends.

I‚Äôve made the money of kings and I‚Äôve been as poor as a serf. I‚Äôve dined on the finest things and I‚Äôve scrounged change together for a shitty slice of gas station pizza. Had times where I did not know if the next meal was ever going to come. 

I‚Äôve been an active addict and I‚Äôve lived large periods of my life substance free. I find myself years past that last affliction and thought to be free and done of the trauma and abuse of my life. 

Yet here I sit stuck at war again in my own mind with my personality. Both of my parents are special in their own right. My mother is unbreakable in my anger with faith in my life it has always been because of the lashings I‚Äôve seen life give this kind good woman for no reasons. She posses a level of kindness and brightness that even after a life time of shit still shines. 

I would like to think I have all of these same good qualities and more from her. My father is the opposite unkind infact in many was he‚Äôs a monster. But that being said he also has some pretty special abilities and qualities in that evil. 

I know that I‚Äôve gotten his drive, wit, intelligence, but I‚Äôve also inherited some of the lack of emotion and ability to handle and process it. 

I sit here torn trying to be a better person than I have been and it has come at the sacrifice of my spine. I need to speak my mind as I have in the past and when I want somethings take it as who is going to stop me. 

That‚Äôs the secret line my old man found in life. (WHOS GOING TO STOP ME?) 
While he abuses this and prays on people because most people confronted with that type of aggression physical or not tends to freeze up most and by they time they thaw its done you you‚Äôve won. 

But I‚Äôm frightened I‚Äôve seen some of that same evil in me. And as much as I need some of those traits and skills I‚Äôve become afraid that tapping into any of it runs the risk of me becoming the same person. So I‚Äôm udderly stuck in this cycle of being frozen myself and unable to move forward.",2022-04-01 12:27:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645204780,2,/r/lonely/comments/ttpgug/where_do_i_go_from_here/,,0,2,Where do I go from here?

My fianc√© (M28) works away from home in the week a lot, so I only see him on the weekends. I work full time remotely, so spend a lot of time in the house. I know that our lives clash in a way, because at the weekends I want to leave the house, whereas he wants to stay. 

He now has some time off, so I thought we could spend lots of time together and have a proper catch up when he got back. However, he was too hungover from being out with his friends the day before. I can‚Äôt be upset about that so we leave it and go to bed after just watching TV. 

I don‚Äôt have friends, for lots of reasons. I have actually just started treatment for PTSD which is part of the reason why I don‚Äôt have people around me. But I long for it. I wish I could pop out with friends, or have people to talk to about things.

This includes socializing. *Especially* socializing with strangers who aren't being forced to interact with me, because of their job (co-workers, cashiers/waiters) or biology (family members). Because I'm too lazy/unmotivated/whatever to overcome that fear, I'll never meet new people. Because I'll never meet new people, I'll always be lonely. I'm not attractive, confident, funny, or interesting enough to have people approach me, and I'm too afraid of risks to approach other people.  

So, I will always be lonely. For the rest of my life. However long that ends up being. I fucking hate this life. Why did I have to be like this? Why can't I just find it easy to do new things like everyone else seems to be? Maybe I'm wrong, maybe everyone feels like throwing up when they think about talking to someone new, and I'm just a pussy who can't swallow his bile.

216,tu7pdl,WhyAreYouScaredHoney,"I genuinely respect and love my friends. They are all amazing people, and it feels like we've known each other forever, even though it's only been a year. But I don't think things are going to work out for us. We've had crushes on each other in the past, and now, in both of my newly developed two three-way friendships with them (separately), I just feel out of place.

It's been almost a month, and I don't think I can take it much longer. I've known each person in the friendship for much longer than everyone else has, but I'm still not even near as close are they are. I know it sounds jealous, but I really do support their relationships. I just wish I didn't have to be there for all of it. I wish I would have been more open with them with expressing my concerns with the friendship in the first place, and also in general. I love them, but I'll never get their inside jokes or rips at me, no matter how long I'm there. I'm either the joke, ignored or having to laugh along/listen while one talks badly about the other one, but hold my tongue. 

Whenever I try to hang out with someone else, or just by myself, they always come along. If I was included, I wouldn't mind. Honestly, it's okay if I'm not, as long as I'm not insulted. But I've been ditched, poked at and interrupted by them so many times, it's just too much at this point. I have to repeat myself five times to be heard as much as them, and even then, I'm still not *there*. I don't think I ever will be.  It feels like I'll never be as important to them, and my feelings are an afterthought unless I'm very upset at them. I try and play along, but it's hard to when the only thing that's up for conversation are my insecurities. I've always been self-conscious about my body, especially my ears and back, and I've mentioned this to them, but it doesn't really matter. I'm an easy target, but I don't think that makes it any more justified of a thing to do to me, or anyone, really. 

Not to mention some have psychically assaulted me and cursed me out, who seemed like genuinely nice people in the beginning. It shocks me. 

I have a past of abusive relationships, but I didn't expect it from them, you know? We used to be in love, and now they're hitting me, but won't listen to a word I say. They say sorry, but it feels so insincere at this point. 

They've told me I'll never be good enough to achieve my dreams, but can't stop talking about their own. I know it sounds selfish, but I want to be able to have a moment sometimes. People always say I come off as so positive and cheery, so I don't really have an excuse for not being so. 

I hope this doesn't come off as a targeted-message at them, I just needed to get it all off of my chest. It's not in order, though I feel I'm still getting my message across. 

If anyone wants to talk about their experience or just vent to me, feel free to reach out. I'm here.",2022-04-02 02:01:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647047686,7,/r/lonely/comments/tu7pdl/i_believe_im_the_third_wheel_again/,,0,0,I Believe I'm the Third Wheel Again

I've heard it all. Work on yourself. Work on your confidence, social skills, etc. - but if I'm being honest, will doing these things really satisfy this intense desire that I feel deep within my heart on a day to day basis?

230,tu9mmp,randoteacher99,"I‚Äôm 25m and I work at a middle school social studies teacher. I live at home with my mom because I can‚Äôt afford rent on my salary where I live. 

My mom kinda just sits around at home and watches TV while I work for the 4 hours I have between dinner and when I go to bed. I don‚Äôt feel connected to her. When Jen came home from Spring Break, they just binge watched Drag Race and were engrossed in it. I can‚Äôt focus on my work while the TV is blaring, but it‚Äôs unfair to ask them to be silent while I work. So I have to go into my room, away from them so I can be productive.

233,tu9s57,sassykitchen,"A year ago I ended the only friendship that I have ever had. I stopped talking to anyone because I wanted to think about myself a little bit, I had to figure out what I wanted to do in my life, after high school. I realized that my behaviour was that a little selfish and I wanted to apologize to my friends but they didn‚Äôt forgave me. Since I have never had any other friends I just don‚Äôt know how to act around people and how to meet new persons.

I moved out at the end of summer to live alone in my own apartment. And I also started uni but I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect since I‚Äôve never knew what to do in my life like I have no hobbies, No interest in anything I don‚Äôt have any talents or whatever. School never really worked out for me. I spend my entire life doing the minimum of what I am capable of because of my lack of motivation I guess.

During the first semester I only went to school because I had nothing else to do and honestly I really don‚Äôt know why I went to school because I study cinema and I don‚Äôt know why but every time I study some thing for school it‚Äôs just disgust me of the thing. Like I didn‚Äôt watched any movies during the first semester. Now I just stopped going to school at all, I don‚Äôt do anything. I don‚Äôt see anyone and I just hate myself I‚Äôm living with myself and I just can‚Äôt stand it.

Since September I started to hate my skin, every single part of my body is itchy and it causes me insomnia I really don‚Äôt remember the last time I had a complete night. When I tell my family that I spend a lot of sleepless nights they just don‚Äôt believe me, or they tell me that it if I don‚Äôt feel good I should see a doctor. but the thing is that I feel so ashamed of myself that I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me so I just don‚Äôt take care of it and everything that I have in my head is : what‚Äôs the point of seeing a doctor because I don‚Äôt even care about myself.

Actually i think that I‚Äôm scared of growing up because I am 19 and I‚Äôve never lived anything, like I‚Äôve always had the same friends (that I don‚Äôt have anymore). I‚Äôve never dated anyone because of the shame that I have for myself I refuse to get intimate with anyone I guess, but I really don‚Äôt mind it, like it‚Äôs not some thing that triggers me. I‚Äôve never worked because I think that I don‚Äôt have any capacity to do anything useful for anyone. I don‚Äôt want to learn how to drive a car, my dad always talk about when am I going to take care of my driver license but this is really is the last thing that I think about and I can see you then it really annoys him because he wants me to be independent but it just terrifies me.

I really really think that I‚Äôm useless, I‚Äôm not leaving I‚Äôm just existing and don‚Äôt do anything in my life, I really am wasting it and I‚Äôm the only person that I can blame I hate it.

I‚Äôm not to big into fizzy water either.

I‚Äôve been snacking less and when I do snack it‚Äôs healthier items like Peanuts 

At work I‚Äôve been eating these salads I discovered I like for my lunches.

All of my colleagues are basically busy all weekend meeting friends, visiting parties and I just sit there with not even a single text message. And its not like I'm not trying. During school I was really shy and kinda weird I guess since I didn't talk at all and to change that I went to therapy and chose a job where I am forced to talk to people regularly. So fitness coach it is. It literally is my everyday life talking to people now and people still tell me that I'm so quiet all of the time.

But not even once I've been invited to something.
Yesterday someone told me that I never tell anyone anything about me and I almost wanted to reply that I just don't like parties and that's what most others talk about all day long. But I couldn't even finish the first word before he already got distracted again.

There's one girl I am trying to become friends with but she always denies when I want to meet up telling me she's busy or already arranged. And when we plan something she tells me something like her grandma is over and stays longer than expected she doesn't have as much time as planned. So we meet up for like 2 hours a month and it always feels like she's just doing it so she can tell me that we just have met up. Planning something with her is a mess as well...

Trigger Warning: Some events described in this story may be very disturbing

I just turned 61 years of age at the beginning of this month. So, I am dealing with the acceptance of being treated differently because of my age. I have been on Social Security Disability Insurance since 2002. So, I have been dealing with the acceptance of being treated differently because of my disabilities as this treatment has progressively gotten more and more negative as I age. I have been on Medicare since 2003. So, I have been dealing with the acceptance that denial of services based on Medicare quotas is my new reality and access to healthcare has been becoming progressively harder and harder to obtain as the years pass. Combine my age, income level, and disabilities and I have recently been faced with the reality of healthcare DE-prioritization based on Quality of Life Years (QALY) and Disability Life Years (DALY) calculations.

Add to this the recent lab results and diagnoses of Psuedomonas aeruginosa and Fusarium in my lungs--both of which are highly treatment resistant and life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals--Bronchiectasis, crippling side effects of Levoflaxacin, a CT scan finding a 5mm nodule in one of my lungs, and as yet to be confirmed diagnosis of mild or moderate Cystic Fibrosis followed by receiving a formal dismissal from services letter from the Kansas University Physicians Network despite the fact that I have hereditary chronic pancreatitis, my daughter and two of my granddaughters tested positive for the genetic SPINK1 mutation, and my sister and her son tested positive for the genetic CFTR mutation. After the dismissal from medical services, I received dismissive treatment by an Overland Park Regional Hospital Emergency Department doctor, and discharge instructions from Menorah Hospital after the CT scan to follow-up in one year with no bronchoscopy, no biopsy, and the stress heightens.

In an effort to find healthcare, I reached out to several medical professionals from traditional to holistic only to find that my limited income is inadequate to obtain the care I need and there are no medical practitioners who work on a sliding scale based on income except for those who want to push pharmaceuticals. What I'm looking for is a doctor who will sit with me, sift through the page-long list of diagnoses in my chart, toss out all that are no longer appropriate or never were, see what is left and look at them as symptoms of an underlying cause, and fix it. I want to be healed rather than just have symptoms masked; but, no one will listen to me unless I have money to pay them what they believe they are worth. No one wants to help me just because they see my worth as a human being. A human must either have money to pay for the care they need or be compliant in adding to the wealth of Big Pharma.

Part of the problem with accessing medical care is the fact that I live in a semi-rural area with no vehicle. I was turned away by 37 medical transportation agencies for either being over income, having no Medicaid coverage because I'm $200 over income and only qualify for Qualified Medicare Benefits (QMB) with $2600 spend-down I am unable to meet, or I am out of the service area. I am unable to afford ride-share transportation. I found that out when I had to pay $80 for a round trip to my Primary Care doctor's office before being dismissed from care. That was for a walk-in visit to the lab. Ride-share is unreliable for appointments; because there is no possibility to book a firm ride in advance and there are few drivers willing to accept anything other than a Metro area pickup. There is no public transportation available to me unless I can find transportation into the service area. Even taxi companies are unreliable with regards to timing for an appointment, aside from being outrageously out of my price range.

My Medicare Advantage Plan only allows a choice between In Home Health Services when a client is incapacitated through disability including after surgery or medical transportation. I chose the in home services because it was beneficial in the past after I had back surgery and I was always able to access medical transportation through County Mental Health even though they prioritize work and school rides. Unfortunately, that was pre-COVID. Now, staffing is skeletal; so, medical rides are minimal, unpredictable, and the rare times they are available, given with an attitude of inconvenience by schedulers and their supervisors‚Äîyour medical ride is less important than the needs of 'productive persons' who work and go to school.

Couple this with housing issues involving willful negligence by apartment management regarding a plumbing leak under the bathroom floor, ceiling storm damage, mold exposure confirmed by a mold inspection expert, and 10-month exposure to slow carbon monoxide poisoning confirmed by a housing inspector's report, and snakes inside the apartment found three times by my cats including snake eggs found with the third snake, all ignored by management until an Adult Protective Services worker became involved to force management to address the snakes, life becomes a struggle.

When trying to resolve the two issues of healthcare and housing, I am turned away by three law firms, the third one having the decency to send me a formal letter declining services citing ‚Äúa conflict between law and fact‚Äù because QALYs and DALYs legally allow my healthcare to be DE-prioritized and housing codes allow property owners the option to make a ‚Äúearnest effort‚Äù giving them a 90-day clock to fix the problems in which, if earnest effort is again made, the 90-day clock restarts, the detailed documentation of the issues is moot. The only other available option is issuing a 14/30 to the landlord; meaning, they have 14 days to fix everything or consider the document a 30-day notice of termination of lease. Now, this is only effective if I have the money to move and follow through with the ultimatum of a 14/30; which, management knows full well that is impossible for me.

When it became apparent that I needed help with basic housekeeping because of the debilitating effects of the Levofloxacin, I hired an In Home Supportive Services worker through the County. This person ended up stealing my medication and I had to fire her. Rather than trust another stranger, I hired my former husband and friend of 30 years and got him on the County IHSS payroll and paid all of his living expenses because he was unemployed and his Pandemic Unemployment Assistance had run out. Three months in, he informs me that he feels like a ‚ÄúF-ing slave‚Äù. During the argument wherein I reminded him that ‚Äúslaves don't get paid‚Äù, he proceeds to volunteer to me that he had broken his promise of refraining from bringing marijuana across State lines because Kansas has strict laws against cannabis and, because of my seizure activity, I must avoid exposure to cannabis, including secondhand smoke, or suffer exacerbation of my seizure symptoms.

I informed him that possession of marijuana is a direct violation and grounds for immediate termination of the lease. I asked him, ‚ÄúWhy would you put someone you love in a legal bind and put their basic needs for housing in jeopardy like this? If I fail to let management know and they later find out, I would be complicit and be evicted as well.‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúI thought to myself, what she doesn't know won't hurt her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you thought that, why would you tell me? You volunteered this information. I never asked you, I never suspected, I never accused you; because, I believed you. I trusted you. You knew I thought you were the last person of could still trust. Do you even understand that you have committed a Federal Felony by transporting a Federally controlled substance across State lines?‚Äù

During the argument wherein he is refusing to leave, he gets up abruptly, grabs his rifle, goes out the door, and drives away. I called the crisis line because I am freaking out. He has threatened suicide before. So, I have no idea if this is just some sort of display to get me to change my mind about kicking him out or if this is serious. The crisis counselor advises me to call the Sheriff's Department to check on his welfare; which, I did. While I wait for the Sheriff, I leave a desperate voicemail on my sister's phone. The Deputies arrive and talk to my former husband informing him that, technically, I am correct and well within my legal rights to have him leave. They get us to agree to be civil for a week so he can get his affairs in order to leave.

A few minutes after the deputies leave, more deputies are dispatched to my address because my sister called the Sheriff's Department after hearing my voicemail. She is in another State unable to reach me because I was talking with the first group of deputies. She informs them I sound distraught, she has no idea what the situation between me and my former husband is; but, she knows he has weapons. The deputies come back in force‚Äîfive of them. So, now, my neighbors want nothing to do with me because they think I am a crazy person.

The reason I felt my former husband was the last person I could trust is because, three years previously, I had moved out of State to help my daughter and grandchildren with a medical crisis. My daughter has six children, two of whom have chronic childhood pancreatitis. She was in and out of the hospital with one or the other child almost every three weeks for between 3 to 30 days each stay and needed help with the care and supervision of the other children. So, I disposed of all of my belongings and moved out there into my sister's home temporarily until I could save enough money to get into my own housing.

While living at my sister's home, her sister-in-law, a person I had met in my 20s and who became a family member when my sister married the woman's brother, was stabbed to death by her son, who subsequently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. We were informed that the Police and Coroner's Departments offer no crime scene cleanup services. My sister's mother-in-law refused to hire a cleaning company. So, my sister enlisted family members, including me, to help clean up the bloody crime scene.

Shortly thereafter, I moved into my own home and tried to get into mental health services to process this trauma. I was turned away by 25 clinics saying they were at their Medicare quotas. I called the State Ombudsman and Governor's Advocacy offices for help and was told they only help with Medicaid. My daughter knew the trauma I was dealing with and the trouble I was having getting into mental health treatment. She and the rest of my family thought that, despite this, I should still be on my best behavior. After a small disagreement that escalated over email and text, my daughter kicked me out of her life and the lives of my grandchildren. I have had no contact with my grandchildren for almost 3 years now.

During this time, I was providing childcare to my niece. I became physically ill and asked for some time off. She told me, ‚ÄúMaybe we're not a good fit and I should find someone else.‚Äù To which I responded, ‚ÄúThat's your prerogative.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, the kids and I didn't care for you anyway. You were just free.‚Äù

‚ÄúBest of luck with your childcare.‚Äù

After this, my sister and her family went no contact with me. This was followed by no contact initiated by the rest of my family members, each giving different reasons. I moved to another State to stay with my former husband only to have the same difficulties accessing mental health services. I called NAMI and was told to file a complaint with the Federal Comptroller who told me I would receive no information regarding the disposition of the investigation. When I finally did find a therapist who would work with me, she fired herself two weeks in saying my family issues were too triggering for her. It was then, I asked my former husband to take me back to the State where I had moved from thinking I was going back home and things would be better after I got back into mental health treatment there.

As described above, that was far from what happened. I began writing a memoir blog. My daughter threatened me with a defamation lawsuit. When that failed, she publicly accused me of pimping her out to her husband before they got married in some sort of sex trafficking scheme. Mind you, they married, had five children together, had a successful business together wherein he worked under her contractor's license; yet, she says I allowed him to groom her for this. I told her, ‚ÄúYour logic makes no sense. If you thought I was a child sex trafficker, you, as a responsible parent, would never have asked me to move out of State to care for and supervise your children in your absence.‚Äù

My friends and my son who lives here abandoned me shortly after all of these problems began, telling me I am just too negative. Yes. I am dealing with a lot of huge, negative things all at the same time and I refuse to put on a happy face and pretend everything is fine. Unfortunately for me, my friends and family have always seen me as the strong one, whom they could rely on to support them through any difficulties they face. It is very disturbing for them to see me fall apart.

I have been trying to pull myself together and solve all of these problems while I am literally isolated in a semi-rural area without transportation and zero moral support. Even my therapist and I had to part ways because her mother is dying and she is unable to be the support I need.

Well, this morning, after sharing the exciting news with my son that, I found out last night, one of my articles which was published on The Mighty was also published on MSN, I received a text from him informing me that, a repressed memory of me attempting to drown him when he was an infant was brought forward into his consciousness after watching a television show regarding the same subject matter. It is important to note here, that my son, according to what my therapist told me several years ago, has some form of untreated schizophrenia. Even though I am aware of this, his revelation to me comes at a moment in which I have been dealing with family mobbing of me as the scapegoat once again.

The family mobbing had begun again after my nephew's estranged wife called me to tell me he had passed away with COVID exacerbation of his underlying health issues. I told her my health issues and finances would prevent me from flying out for the funeral. I asked if someone could Zoom me in on the service so I could participate. Then next thing I know, I receive an email from my sister lashing out at me for asking for a plane ticket. That's when I knew my nephew's wife had lied to my sister. The smear campaign against me was now underway. Trying to fight back against this cause my entire family to jump onboard. I am now estranged from my entire family.

In my distress, I decide to call a Mental Health Peer Support Warm-line because I feel it unnecessary to call an emergency crisis line and take a spot someone in true crisis may need, yet I still need to talk with someone. While describing half of the above, I stop to take a breath. There is dead air for a full minute. I ask, ‚ÄúDid you fall asleep?‚Äù The peer counselor replied, ‚ÄúI'm still here. I'm listening.‚Äù So, I proceed to pour my heart out telling him the rest. He then interrupts me and says, ‚ÄúMy shift is over. If you still need to talk, you can call back in a few minutes and talk to the counselor taking the next shift. But, I want to let you know, I've listened to you for a half hour longer than I'm allowed on a call.‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I say. And I hung up the phone.

Are you kidding me? This person just sat there. No, ‚ÄúMhm. Really. I'm sorry you're going through this‚Äù. Nothing, not a peep. Was he just sitting there checking his watch? I feel very sorry for anyone who calls and ends up hurting themselves over this kind of dismissive invalidation.

I am literally isolated‚Äîno family, no friends, no transportation, no neighborly kindness, no medical care, bare bones mental healthcare just to keep me from suicide or homicidal thoughts. So, I call a warm-line to receive a scrap of compassion or even a bit of sympathy and all I get is dead air and then attitude from the peer counselor about how I should have been grateful to vent into my phone to someone who was hardly present on the other end.

309,tulzgf,Unlucky_Ad7732,"It hurts. It fucking hurts. I have never been able to connect to anyone in my life on a deep level. Nobody.

I don't have that childhood friend that I can honestly share my feelings with. I never had a friend like that. I had many friends over the course of grade school, but absolutely none I ever connected to on a deep level like that.

I was a dork growing up and all my friends were dorks. A lot of us had autism or ADHD or depression, things like that. We were all socially awkward to an extent. But that resulted in us only connecting superficially, through gaming, pop culture, and internet culture. We never bonded on a level truly deeper than that, and in hindsight it is very depressing.

I felt distant to my high school friends because of this. Why did I feel so distant? Maybe it was because I wasn't as invested in that stuff as them.

In my Junior year I started consuming a bunch of TV, movies, and games because I felt this would develop my personality, which was laughably pathetic but true. I always saw everyone talking about this stuff in school so I thought doing so would better help me connect to people. This was around the time the Quarantine began so I had a lot of time to do this.

I don't think it really did anything for me. I didn't contact my friends for the rest of high school. I haven't talked to them since graduation.

It's honestly the same thing with my online friends. Everyone just cracks silly jokes or gets all negative about drama. Something about them radiates negativity to me. I feel like I can't be myself around them because they get irritated over the littlest of things in people.

I can't connect to anyone in my life on any meaningful level. I've spent the last few years feeling inferior to everyone around me and trying to be the people around me. I've neglected myself and my own personality, but I don't really know who ""myself"" is at this point.

There are things I want to do. I want more intellectual stimulation. I wanna read more, learn history and politics, learn to cook, develop my taste in music, improve my art skills, but that's not who I am now. The real interests I had, I neglected in an attempt to be others by wasting my time consuming media.

My personality is underdeveloped as a result. I'm not the person I want to be, and I feel like an uninteresting person as a result. I know I would probably find myself uninteresting.

I've quit all the timewasters like games and TV and stuff, but now my life feels so empty. I only connected to people through media, which is sad. I want to connect to others on a deeper level but it feels too late.

Why even attempt to make friends when I'm not the person I want to be? When I am someone who I would not even want to be friends with?

322,tup77l,shallowshadowshore,"Or I guess, learn to be alone without being lonely.

I‚Äôm very introverted. I don‚Äôt need a lot of socialization. But after some drama~ in the past year, I‚Äôve lost my main community and friend group, in addition to moving to a new place.

I am not totally alone. I have one long-standing friend, and my husband. I get along great with both of them. But of course, they get busy, they work, they have things to do. I don‚Äôt expect them to drop everything every time I want to chit chat with someone.

I used to make most of my friends at work, but remote work and a recent career change has made that much more challenging. There are very few chances to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù like there were in the past. Any time I talk to coworkers, it‚Äôs strictly business.

I have a variety of interests. I‚Äôm learning to cook, I do programming, I‚Äôve done a lot of travel. We‚Äôve started a vegetable garden and are in the planning stages of getting homesteading animals like rabbits and chickens. I think I‚Äôm pretty approachable. Easy to talk to, good listener. I don‚Äôt think I come off as awkward or desperate (though maybe I do, because if I‚Äôm being honest, I am). I try to do both give and take in conversations - I let other people talk about what they want and steer the conversation, but I contribute too. All this is to say, I‚Äôm not boring, and my social skills are not bad. 

My casual relationships are constant disappointments. I‚Äôve already gotten rid of all social media, but I‚Äôm considering going nuclear and just eliminating everyone from my life. New phone number on a dumb phone sort of thing. Right now, no one starts conservations with me. I think I‚Äôd feel less anxious about no one ever talking to me if it were because they *can‚Äôt* get ahold of me. Then at least it‚Äôs my choice.

I know making friends as an adult is hard. But it‚Äôs so much harder than I ever imagined.

2. I have a very young son.

4. I just started a new job and will still be months away from clearing my debt.
5. I'm probably not entirely ready to face the reality of socializing yet, let alone companionship.

But feeling lonely makes me sad. But with all the longing for someone comes the nightmares that remind me of when I was with my ex and its just a nauseating cycle.

373,tuvin9,Normal_Entertainer47,"I have deep rooted abandonment issues and I need help. 

I grew up under parents that were really controlling. Me and my siblings were their underlings. To this day we never had personal relationships because we're considered underlings. Our opinions and perspectives never mattered to them. Something that destroyed our (fake) relationships as adults. 

My siblings and I kind of took after our parents and aren't particularly close. Our household was strange, it was like strangers living in different sections, who never interacted with each other unless necessary. But I thought it was normal. 

I don't have any external family. I do, but they've never been in my life. When I was younger I moved around a lot and didn't have a real friend or anyone that I grew up with. No real bbq's, parties, family events, they were all kind of forced and a bit strange because I never knew how to interact in them, like I said, we weren't close but because they were family, I know I was supposed to act differently with them. 

I've gone to college and realized that everyone wasn't like us. I met friends at school but they all live in other states now. Every girl I met has pretty much left me. My college gf said that I have no one and it's weird to her but I honestly don't know how to change it. It's the one thing that I've always wished i can change. 

When she left me it was hard to take, she was the first person I've ever let in. And she left me and didn't even look back or have a care in the world. I was back to my emptiness and loneliness. I would've did anything just to have one person for me. I actually got a job in her state and moved but it wasn't the same and I ended up quitting the job because I was still lonely and ofc she didn't care that I was close by. 

I tried to rekindle the relationships w/ my family but they all kind of disrespected me when I did. All things that attributed to me really feeling deep abandonment and emotional pain. I'm honestly in my late 20's and I'm like an old person in an old folks home if i get to talk to someone. Just so grateful and long winded, when I'm probably naturally an introvert lol 

Anyway, recently I was talking to someone who left me in the dust again because she wasn't ready for a relationship. I find that I go for people that are emotionally unavailable(i think she was hiding a drug issue), probably because I'm used to it with my mother/family. Anyway, needless to say I disrespected myself so much trying to get her to change her mind. Anything would honestly be better than me going back to my solitary confinement. But again, she left me in the dust and didn't look back. Probably because she actually has a life w/ people and family that she can go back to, where I don't. 

Can anyone relate to me? What can I do? I know I shouldn't have abandonment issues and that there's probably better ways to go about things but how do I stop myself from wanting companionship when I feel so desperate for it. I feel it in my soul. Just hurts how easily ppl able to not know about me.",2022-04-02 22:49:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636651668,5,/r/lonely/comments/tuvin9/abandonment_help_how_do_i_get_over_this/,,0,2,"Abandonment!

387,tux55h,SpookyStarfruit,"So, as the above stated, I was told of R/Lonely and have been coming back to this subreffit for the past few weeks every now and then. I‚Äôm quite the rambler and highly compulsive on organizing out my messy thoughts (esp in lists!!!) so the best format to do this would be to list out reasons I‚Äôve been feeling lonely.

For context: I‚Äôm a 22F, American learning Dutch, and a generally quiet ambivert. For the past 2 years ‚Äî **due to not having IRL friends nor a strong support network in my hometown** and a family who struggles to communicate with me (er, we don‚Äôt exactly see ‚Äúeye to eye‚Äù) ‚Äî I‚Äôve been trying to make international friends on an app called ‚ÄúBottled.‚Äù I met some nice people here and there who pandered in + out of my life, but rarely anyone I connected to. I suppose it showed me that outside of my hometown, I would still felt like an alien essentially. An outsider to the world, longing for some form of substantial, meaningful connection.

In the end, I hope there‚Äôs someone out there who can somewhat relate. A good friend I‚Äôd hope to find through difficult times &amp; heavy thoughts, and who better but one who understands?

But hey ‚Äî let‚Äôs skip to the chase! (I tend to overtype, oh boy)

##No. 1: Unlike many of my peers, I didn‚Äôt grow up with a happy, supportive, stable family.

There were many times when my family was unable to support me (not going into too many details). But it had affected me strongly, to the point where for years seeing families with loving mothers, dependable fathers, doting grandparents, and helpful aunts and uncles or people with older siblings who could guide them along really bothered me. Especially a loving mother. I‚Äôm the oldest of my 2 siblings and grew up taking the brunt of my mother‚Äôs anger.

Although things are long over, there‚Äôs a part of me that feels heavily alienated watching loving families from the point of view as an outsider who will never know the feeling.

##No. 2: Cultural crisis, wishing I had a sense of belonging others did.

Let me note that I never quite liked anyone priding themselves in their heritage/genealogy or nationality (ie, where they were born). My bad experiences with my family, who immigrated from a different country with a tough, heavy filial cultural expectations marked me as jaded on this matter for the most part; frankly, I‚Äôm skeptical of taking the environment you were given and its norms as a truth.

But being online a lot and seeing how many people from different countries just click so well in their cultures, have a place they feel they belong (reaffirmed by those around them), or no major conflicts to come to terms to because of the circumstances of their birth gives me a tinge of envy. Even those from my parents‚Äô home country, who I began to envy, when I previously wanted nothing with my heritage, as it gave me such bad memories.

The area of the US I grew in is open-minded and accepting but I don‚Äôt know... I always still felt conflicted. And with a lot of hatred directed at this particular nationality online, I feel oftentimes distressed and guilty even if it‚Äôs not logical to take responsibility for things you can‚Äôt help ‚Äî like your country‚Äôs governments‚Äô actions or your country‚Äôs history. That people aren‚Äôt their countries but rather individuals. But many times, I feel lonely because of a feeling that I wish I was born another way, that I belonged somewhere, that I didn‚Äôt have so many jaded personal conflicts.

##No.3: My real life friends either abandoned me or pandered out of my life.

I was never the ‚Äúfun‚Äù friend ‚Äî someone they messaged first (usually, I initiated), someone they wanted to invite out, be around, spend time with. I even found out very recently that a girl I believed to be my best friend for years actually considered someone else her best friend. And I have a stream of memories of our mutual friends/others from high school who many times let me down last minute, never initiated, mostly led me to pull the weight in the friendship.

Real-life friendships are something so important and common to many people, but I only ended up lonely where I am. Which added to the hurt not having a loving family to come home to added.

##No. 4: I was sheltered most of my life.

I never stepped out of the house with adult supervision before turning 18. My family sheltered me quite a bit, and when hit with adulthood, I was unable to handle the panic of things I was never taught ‚Äî for instance, paperwork. I didn‚Äôt have those normal casual hang outs everyone seemed to have so easily throughout my teen years. And my childhood wasn‚Äôt spent playing at friends house or celebrating important days with them.

##No. 5: I didn‚Äôt get to take the ‚Äúconventional path‚Äù everyone else did.

Which leads me to this.

Because of being so sheltered, I wasn‚Äôt able to pursue university after graduating high school. Two months ago, I turned 22 and realized that the summer of this year is when most of the peers I graduated with will be getting their bachelor‚Äôs degree after having the time of their lives getting all their exciting college experiences. Probably going off to do amazing things in interesting fields, and getting to travel with the friends they‚Äôve made or go new places, have adventures I can only dream of.

Meanwhile, I feel like I‚Äôm wobbling behind, slowly getting left farther and farther back.

I see their photos, hear of their fun experiences in college, and all I can do is start to feel lonelier and lonelier because I wasn‚Äôt able to make it that far and am still struggle to overcome my numerous issues back at home...

##No. 6: I‚Äôm terrible at picking up social cues and have massive social anxiety in person.

Which honestly just makes it hard for me to approach or understand people in many cases.

##And lastly, No. 7: I can‚Äôt relate to most pf the conversations, mindsets, or viewpoints people have.

Sometimes I feel like people judge themselves, others, and the world at a surface level. Sometimes I feel the things they care for are superficial (looks, achievements, being strong in the face of adversity &amp; valuing strength to the point of Social Darwinism). And it really bothers me and makes it hard for me to understand.

People end up making poor assumptions or conclusions of another‚Äôs situation.

Now when trying to talk to people, I just feel lonely because if I mentioned my point of view or situation, it gets dismissed pretty quickly. But I almost can‚Äôt stand the lack of empathy, the unwillingness to see some others‚Äô situations aren‚Äôt always going to be ideal. Actually, sometimes their dismissiveness starts to get to me because I can start to feel hurt and lonely because I don‚Äôt even know who to talk to about the situation anymore without being dismissed like many previous friends and family members have.

##Bonus, No. 8: I can only connect to cats!

Title says it all! even started volunteering with them because their presence gives me comfort people can not. I suppose that‚Äôs an odd trait of mine.

**Alright ‚Äî if you read this far and can relate, please say something.** I want to know I‚Äôm not the only one out there struggling in my mind, struggling to find a place in the world, who won‚Äôt come back to a happy home, or friends who care.

I don‚Äôt exactly know what I hope for, but I thought it was worth a go to be able to talk to others who may have the same experiences.",2022-04-03 00:08:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641706528,1,/r/lonely/comments/tux55h/a_friend_told_me_about_this_thread_how_some_of/,,0,2,A friend told me about this thread &amp; how some of you reminded him of me; it made me wonder if someone out there possibly feels the same?

395,tuy3cl,DrewParrish,"Guess this is a little bit of a vent, I don't know. 

Things have gotten better for everyone, including me, yet I can't shake the feeling of sadness or emptiness. 

Today, first time in a long time, I found myself inside a fast food joint. Normally I'd just order online and get pickup, but my coworker sprang the idea of food out of no where and offered to pay for something. Anyway, we went it and immediately I became anxious. I thought I was doing better with talking to people but I became tongue tied at the counter. It was a pretty girl and I must have looked like a crazy person as I kept sneaking a peak at her face and then darting my eyes as she looked at me. I have a hard time being loud so it was kinda embarrassing to have to repeat myself multiple times, basically yelling by the end. I am sure I blushed the entire time. 

The coworker got and paid for our food, I thanked him and we sat at the nearby park as we ate. I wanted to forget the experience but he never let go of it and brought it up multiple times, as if talking through it would help my nervousness.  By the end of it he states ""well obviously this is why you're alone."" I agreed and we sat in silence while he dropped me back at work. And when I drove myself back home, I didn't even want to listen to music. 

I think that pretty much ended our work place companionship.  I'm just so alone. 

If anyone wants to talk or whatever. Hmu. Or just hit me and end me haha.",2022-04-03 01:55:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1528252847,2,/r/lonely/comments/tuy3cl/m21_new_year_same_problems/,,0,0,"m/21 new year, same problems"

411,tuzvgi,Correct-Account-5567,"Hey guys, 

This is my first time writing here, but I think that I really need it. I'm american, but have been living in europe for most of my life, and just moved back to the USA last July. It has been a very difficult transition for me, and I have already gone through 2 different schools. I had absolutely no friends for the first 6 months here, and that really took a tole on me. At this point I moved from the private school where I was at, to a public one, an since then I have met a couple people I get along with alright. 

Since I moved to the US, I have kept in close contact with most of my friends in europe, calling them on a daily basis and playing videogames with them as much as possible. Though this definitely helped at first, the sense of online disconnection I had with them, as well as the start of the new school year when they started to talk about the new people they had met, made me start feeling kind of lonely. Over this same time period, I got back in contact with this girl I had been talking to and playing games with as well online. We started spending a lot of time together over call and became pretty decent friends. Its been about 9 months of this, and I've already known her for a little over a year. Anyway we decided that we liked each other, and decided to give online dating a shot. So far, it has been incredibly taxing on me. We are both extremely busy people, and since we started ""dating"" we have actually been talking less and less as the school year has progressed. I do my beset to rationalize this but sometimes I get really pissed and wish I would just end the whole thing. Of course I know that isn't what I really want, and she is one of the few people with whom I feel some real connection with. Its just this distance between us that feels like its keeping me from solidifying our relationship ig. 

Honestly idk exactly what I'm feeling, but I definitely feel pretty depressed/generally sad rn. Having an online relationship, as well as slowing starting to drift away from my old friends has definitely had a negative impact on me, and the people I have met in the US just don't feel real to me. I spend time with them, and I genuinely like some of them, but they just don't feel real. I'm not sure exactly how to explain, but I feel like there is kind of like this cloud between me and everybody else, and I feel incredibly lonely here. I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and real depression before, but I have fully overcome them and don't think I could ever fall back into that state. This feels different, just this long extended loneliness and gloom that just doesn't seem to go away. As definitely more of an introvert this all really hurts because in general it is not often/for extended periods of time that I really look for human interactions or big groups of people, but when I do occasionally feel like having some company there just isn't anyone there. 

Anyway that is my little rant, I really appreciate it if you read the whole thing, and any encouragement or advice that you have to offer is more welcome than you could imagine. Let me know if you have a story similar to mine, and again thx for reading.",2022-04-03 03:30:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1635013376,2,/r/lonely/comments/tuzvgi/having_a_very_rough_time/,,0,1,Having a very rough time

After that I start thinking about how I feel about her, because I wasn‚Äôt so sure anymore.(I had already acknowledged my sexuality a few years ago) Usually I just think of her and her other three friends as annoying, or loud, or rude. Because they are loud. And I realized that I did like her. And over time I realized I had liked her for a while, just not known it.

436,tv2agr,nobodycares239,"I've always felt a pervasive kind of loneliness. Growing up gay and closeted is hard, everyone has heard that kind of story, so im not going to go into it much. 

I was the type of person who decided not to come out to my family because I knew they would disown me, and I'm struggling with the ways that decision has effected me now. 

I met a man online, we became friends, we started dating, and a few months ago I went to meet him in person for a week long trip. It went wonderfully. He's everything I could ever want in a lifelong partner and I've never felt a connection with anyone like this before. 

Now ever since I've been home, I've just felt a horrible numbness. Its hard to describe what I'm feeling exactly, but I think a lot of it is centering on my age. I'm 28, and this is my first real relationship. Before now, I've never kissed anyone. I've never held hands with anyone before, and no one besides my mother and grandparents have ever told me that they loved me. 

Finally feeling like someone loves me has honestly fucked me up. I've always felt lonely and hidden in some ways, but it was never like this. It feels like one week of a normal relationship has completely tainted all of my memories into being lonely and sad.

I think of all the things I used to enjoy by myself and they all seem pathetic now. Going to movies by myself, talking long walks, trying new foods, shopping... it all just feels so hollow. I try to do the things I know I used to love and I don't get real joy out of them anymore. 

Every night I go to sleep and it feels wrong without him. I've never had trouble sleeping before, but now I lay down for hours without falling asleep. I thought it would get easier over time, but it doesn't. It's like it's involuntary- every time I close my eyes I think about how I held him when we would go to sleep together. 

I've never cried much before, but sometimes I do now when I cant sleep because I'm lonely. And I feel like I can't tell him that because it sounds overbearing or obsessive. 

My mom knows about my relationship now, and she absolutely hates it. She cried every time we talked about it, she says she will never accept it as a relationship and won't ever attend a wedding. No one has told my dad or extended family, but it will be far worse when they find out. 

Sometimes the realization hits me that my only choices are to be cut off from my family, or leave the person I love. Even knowing how happy he makes me, it's still so isolating to lose family, and I know they'll never budge on this. 

I'm so bitter about it all... it would have been easier if I had come out when I was younger. Now it feels like it's too late to be doing this. I almost wonder if I never should have dated and just tried to find contentment in being alone because the loneliness I feel now is like a pit in my chest that won't go away. It's like it's eating into me a little more every night and I don't think it will ever stop now that I know what's missing in my life.",2022-04-03 05:54:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648960777,3,/r/lonely/comments/tv2agr/i_feel_so_much_lonelier_now_that_i_have_someone/,,0,1,I feel so much lonelier now that I have someone.

Ever since I was very small I have been bullied. Bullied for my looks and other things about me so I never had good self esteem and had lots of traumatic situations happen to me. I'm extremely lonely and feel I have really no friends. Well I do have friends but they don't speak unless I speak to them first which makes me feel kind of shitty. So to cope with my loneliness I pretend I'm a popular person. Whether its an internet celebrity or a celebrity in general. Just a figure that gets lots of attention from others. Its always been my dream to be famous so that lots of people would love me unconditionally because i never really felt love from someone else unless they wanted something from me of course. So I talk to myself often and get stuck in daydreams where i pretend im famous and i also think of stories and stuff to occupy my mind. Does anyone else do this? I feel weird for constantly fantasizing about it. But if I don't talk to myself no one will",2022-04-03 06:02:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638420898,7,/r/lonely/comments/tv2f4p/just_venting/,,0,20,Just venting

How does everyone just be content with themselves? I'm so lonely i can't take it anymore.

People keep saying ""life does get busy"", yeah it does and it's depressing for me.

I sent a message yesterday in a group asking for a little help(regarding my college work) and no one answered till now. They all hate me. Why does everyone has to hate me? What did i do wrong? I'm far better than anyone i see then with. I'm being treated so rude i want to die but i can't die currently. I'm waiting for the night to come, but it don't last.

465,tv50rm,themightybigj_,"My last relationship ended in September 2019 and I haven‚Äôt fully recovered since. Over the past few years I have learnt many new things about myself. The most important one to me is that I am autistic and an introvert. I don‚Äôt like going out, I don‚Äôt like socialising, I get anxiety when I‚Äôm around a lot of people and I struggle with making new friends. I was in and out of friend groups at high school but I didn‚Äôt really have one group that I could call my friends. The only people I can call real friends I have known since primary / elementary school and they know about how I function. My last relationship ended because my girlfriend had a really good friendship with a guy and they would hang out on a regular basis. I made a big deal out of it and she got mad at me and broke up with me. Since she was a reasonable and nice person, whenever I tried to talk to her again after a month or so she would and we would start talking as mates. Something would happen and we would stop talking.

When I did training clubs, like gym exercises and sorts I just got judged and called ugly, skinny and hairy and I wasn't able to keep up as much as anyone and just left. Was offered training by my dad, but he's a fucking asshole so I said no.

Now my roommate has begun bringing girls over and its college all over again with me locking myself in my room, terrified to get water from my fridge in-case a girl I don't know sees me and judges me, yet at the same time hoping to some higher power that she'll burst through my door and we cuddle and finally someone holds me until I die. I only went on that date because that girl asked me out and I've been too chicken shit to even try and talk to anyone or get help or even try and get better, so now I'm here waking up every morning feeling absolute nothing inside, clutching a pillow like its the last thing I own, praying someone somewhere will just fall into my lap and make everything better.

I think loneliness is the cause of other things that cause health problems. Many people who are lonely tend to resort to things like drugs and alcohol and other things to fill the void. They also stop exercising and doing the things they love. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the substance abuse and lack of physical activity that‚Äôs causing these health issues. If your lonely right now start taking care of yourself, see if you can get into therapy, start exercising daily, take yourself out even if no one is with you, enjoy your own company and be proud of yourself.

529,tvdrc5,orphantwin,"I have this philosophy, that is circled around the fact, that nothing and no one, cant be one sided extreme. We have both eyes, both hands, both legs, both ears, i can go on. I think all of us needs some kind of duality or contrast.

But why i am saying this? I am 26yo and my whole life, i am pretty much alone. You know all the clich√© elements, like; not much of friends, outsider towards your family, no girlfriend at all. I was really depressed few years back, but i got my shit together - of course, few people were somehow helping me, and every person had some kind of influence without any doubt; but most of the time, i was facing my own self, doubts and bad moods, you know all that crap. Now i am much better person, more healthier, maybe even.. wiser? I discovered and learned so much about myself, life and about other people. It felt like i don't have any kind of ceiling. That i can always move everywhere and explore.

But then i realized, that it feels so one sided. That i miss this one element; sharing it. With someone. With anyone. I feel like i reached so far beyond my own horizons, but still - stuck in this lonely space. I have really small circle of friends, but they live so far away and i can see them only through weekends, if they even have time. And 98% of our conversations are their issues, problems and etc. I love helping people. I am always providing great solutions, hints and feedback. BUT! i wish that at least at once, i can have also someone that is like from the opposite direction. Someone, that can push me for once. Someone, that can fill the void. Someone like me, but more wiser, more fresh and someone, that is more experienced, so i can learn. Someone that can at least once, help me.

I always liked action movies; recently, i am watching romantic movies, cause i feel like i am filling the void with these movies. That i am trying to make some kind of compromise with something, i don't even have. I am exercising a lot, jogging often, i don't drink alcohol, etc. I am always trying to be so diplomatic and learn more. But without someone, that i can share my excitement with i feel like i reached to my ceiling again.

The sun has been dimmed out for a week and one day

Tinted shades and catchy tunes sadly come to tomorrow

A mirror image for calamity as time will decay.

And in the darkest hour that I have come to know

With distorted eyes, still I see you

I promised a dream long ago

But I am fickle, as my word is in all it‚Äôs entirety, disturbingly untrue.

‚ÄúSo toward the infinite, and through the unknown!‚Äù

I‚Äôll soar with you forever and always in my mind

And my thoughts may be poisoned, and I may be alone

I thought I would be ok because I went to a club for the first time as well a month ago and that was great. But that wasn't the case. I mean the music was good but I have terrible social anxiety so I was just anxious as fuck the whole time, and I only made it worse because I was high. I was just standing there, emotionless and wanting to be anywhere else. I looked around at others singing along, dancing, jumping up and down and going crazy in the moshpit, and all I could think about was how empty I felt inside. Surrounded by a sea of people and just feeling absolutely lonely. I was paranoid that people were watching me as well. And at one point I swear I started to hear whispers. I think weed causes psychosis in me, that's why I never do it in public. But since this was a concert I thought it'd be different. I just feel so bad because I felt like a buzz kill. This is why I don't like stepping out the house, why I don't like being around others. I'm tired of disappointing people, tired of not being enough. I'm tired of feeling this eternal sadness at the center of every single thing I do. Idk, I don't even listen to the red pears, I just went cause I was invited.

572,tvjdsd,AverageDirect8942,"This is my first, and probably last, post on here. But I‚Äôve seen a lot of positive responses and I‚Äôm hoping for any kind of advice.

For some background info: 

I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year and have never been happier. Even tho my last two relationships ended in me getting cheated on, I truly loved and trusted this girl. She was and is still the only person who truly understands me and who I feel safe with. From the start of the relationship we both knew that at some point I would be travelling to another country to learn the language and maybe even find something I‚Äôd like to do in the future. My problem is, that I am still young but haven‚Äôt found what to do in my life yet. My girlfriend was the exact opposite to that. She always knew what she wanted to do and prepared for it a long time ago. She would be moving to another city for it though. So me not knowing yet, what I will be doing made her nervous because she didn‚Äôt know if we would be able to continue the relationship if I were to go some other place to study/work. So we tried finding something for me together, which helped a bit, but still I didn‚Äôt really have anything. She would always tell me, that I should just apply to whatever I feel like to be able to choose at all and not just have nothing. The pressure coming from my family to find something to study/ work didn‚Äôt help either. 
So I eventually had to go to the other country and we weren‚Äôt able to see each other in person, as she had already started working.

About 2 weeks ago my girlfriend and I started to take a break from the relationship. Even though she knew, that a break for me was normally out of question. I still agreed because she said, it would be the only option to save our relationship. In this time we didn‚Äôt speak only if it was necessary (missing the other person)
Today she told me she didn‚Äôt have any feelings anymore, but she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. 
It broke me. 
I have never felt anything close to the love for her before. Even now, when I should be forgetting her and cross her out of my life, I still love her. And I hate myself for it. 
I told her that I need time for myself at the moment. In 2 weeks I would be able to see her as I am visiting home for a few days.
I just want to get back with her.

Please help me.

(Sorry, english isn‚Äôt my mother language)

Edit:

Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äòs over
It was horrible and painful. The wishful thinking backfired hard but luckily my siblings are trying to help me out.

588,tvll8q,Invisibleman021183,"I walk out to get my coffee but this time it's a latte. What, I was feeling adventurous. I walk into the place and not a single seat is empty with lots of people sitting there. Most people were with friends or sig. others and the people alone were on computers. I looked around noticing how people looked, heard them talking, and realized, I don't belong. Maybe this is why I'm alone. Maybe this is why I am always lonely. I walk out and this group of girls who looked 18-20 walked past me and the one girl who I looked at looked back at me so I thought here it comes again. Just do it, call me names. She had a glare and maybe it was nothing but I've programmed myself to assume the worst. She said nothing and I quickly resumed looking at the ground since anything else would be creepy. I don't think I can function in society anymore. Ever since that thing a few nights ago with that girl insulting me, even though I should be able to brush it off, I can't. It just stays in my head, the word disgusting, then I assume everyone who looks at me is thinking that. I really do think I'm beyond any chance of being helped and am truly a lost cause. I know someone will say but nobody is a lost cause. You just have to think more positive. The rot in my brain due to the years of being forced to be alone combined with the insults that I've gotten have caused me to become hopeless. I truly have given up. I look around and these people are a different species than me. It's like they are humans and I'm a neanderthal who doesn't belong in this modern world.

589,tvln4z,Lost-Object-9701,"It feels like at this point, my best chance to make something of myself and to get a new girlfriend is to make something that would accrue a following. When my creativity grinds to a halt, it's very demoralizing, and I tend to get brain fog. I'm also paranoid that people will plagiarize me. It's probably stupid that I want someone to see me as a creative genius, and despite my low self esteem, I sense that this comes from some sort of narcisism.. But it's not the only reason- I really do feel like my last chance as a human is to make something great. I am multi-talented with next to nothing finished to show for it, nor things that I'm comfortable showing.

I haven't really dated anyone that enjoyed, well... this kind of thing. Wordbuilding, designing characters, coming up with stuff, and just hearing about it. My last girlfriend was jealous of the female characters that I would come up with and spend so much time thinking about. I feel like the springs of imagination in me combined with bad anxiety causes me to come of as (or in practice be) neglectful to who I date. It wouldn't be my only negative aspect when it comes to me being in a relationship.

Lately, I've been making progress with my story, but the feeling of suffocation in my chest is causing me to seek real human attention over creative stimulation. It's quite the predicament.

596,tvmd3u,verylikelydepressed,"Even though I have people in my life that love me, I still feel so alone. I've tried to force myself to be around people, I've tried to throw myself into relationships, I've tried multiple forms of therapy, I've even tried to just be content with my own misery. Nothing works. I could be in a room full of people and still feel like I've never been more alone in my life. There's no happiness, there's no joy. It's just going through the motions of what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing. That's all I do, pretend. I have to force myself to smile, to laugh where appropriate, to mask my own unhappiness by being a glorified jester. As soon as the mask slips a bit, people leave. People don't want to be around me unless I am being entertaining. I wish I could say that's anxiety talking, but it's happened time and time again. 

I ruined the only relationship I've ever had that mattered to me. I hate myself for it. I know that your worth and happiness shouldn't be defined by other people, but it's so hard to tell myself that when this person really was the only thing that's ever made me feel complete. They made me feel like an actual human being, not a disgusting creature. They made me feel actually seen and understood for the first time in my life. But I ruined it. 

The loneliness is killing me. It's gotten to the point where I'm considering putting myself in situations where I'm bound to get hurt by toxic people, just because I need human contact. I was assaulted recently and I'm still stupid enough to consider being around the person who did that to me. I think I'm trying to tell myself that that's how they showed me they want me, which I know is so idiotic. I don't know how to explain it, I'm just so desperate to feel something that I'll take anything, even if it negatively impacts me. 

I just want to be held, I want someone to tell me everything will be ok as they stroke my hair. I want to cry in someone's arms and let out everything inside me.

Growing up it didn‚Äôt bother me as much, it actually made me feel very strong- but now this is really affecting me. I‚Äôm also introverted so of course this doesn‚Äôt help that much.
I feel completely lost, because I see my friends having at least crushes and here I am- feeling nothing and being lonely. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm aromantic since I do crave love and affection, but I do think that I need a strong connection to love somebody. 
What really hurts me is fact that nobody has ever showed romantic interest towards me and because of that my self esteem is extremely low (I‚Äôm trying my best to change but most of the time I feel pathetic).
I know I have plenty of time to meet somebody, but at this point I‚Äôm so used to be alone that I just feel like it will be like this for the rest of my life. This is getting so bad that I can‚Äôt even imagine somebody loving me or at least flirting with me.. it‚Äôs devastating.

619,tvntnz,superIUG,"My exams are in less than a month. Let me sum up for you : I hate university. This is not what I signed up for. I wanted to practice english language, I'm doing literatture, litterature methodology history, general culture, french grammar (I'm a french student so this is totally pointless when you study ENGLISH). 

I failed my first final semester exams and this semester is way harder than the first. I never gonna pass it. But if I don't, I'd have to repeat (because my parents said they wont let me chose another course of study) or get back to my family home far away in the countryside where I have no any friend, and find a job. 

And my boyfriend who I deeply love, he's really strong at school. It's his playground. He has good notes, the principal calls him to his office to congratulate him. He could leave next september for Paris, and I really have difficulties to live with loneliness. I'm hating myself so hard because I'm not as smart as him, it's fueling my s*icide thoughts like it never did in the past. 

Ending it all would be easier right ? 

I can't even sleep, I think about it every single day. I'm not happy. 

Everytime I'm having a good time, there's constantly this voice saying to me ""Remember how hard you're going to fail ?"". I will go to a concert in 2 weeks, I know I will not fully enjoy it because of that. 

My friends are telling me ""I'm sure you can do it"" and its kinda painful because I know they'll be disappointed. 

I don't know what to do. I want to be a musician to make people happy and put smiles on their faces, but my mom doesnt want me to do so, so I picked the study course she wanted me to pick and now it's slowly killing me.

 
I want to disappear. I'm not for this world, I don't have any controle on my life, I don't even have the support of my family to reach my dreams. 

I don't know what I'm gonna be in the future, I will fail and whatever comes next it's gonna be away from my friends and that one guy I want to spend all my time with.",2022-04-03 23:58:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593881096,5,/r/lonely/comments/tvntnz/im_gonna_fail/,,0,3,i'm gonna fail

It's hard to even put my full trust in a human being nowadays because i don't know whether I'll be left disappointed by the person or not. 

I used to think that friendships weren't important but that was back when i still felt ""normal"" and wasn't affected by depression and anxiety.

I‚Äôm a sophomore now and entering my freshman year everything changed. New school, new people, new chances. I made so many mistakes, did so many things wrong, did so many awful things in 8th grade. It‚Äôs almost as if the world knew this is what I needed to stop being me. One of my best friends dropped me and it was my fault. I still have the other one but it‚Äôs not the same. He will always be my best friend and he‚Äôs basically the only reason I haven‚Äôt left this world yet, but even with that I feel so alone, so empty. My freshman year I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I sat in the back quiet. I did that for every class. After a while got a gf somehow and we dated for a bit. Broke up. Dated again entering sophomore year and broke up again. I made a few friends but none of them feel this void I‚Äôve had since 8th grade. I don‚Äôt even consider them friends. The girl I dated means almost nothing to me and I had this weird feeling type thing with this new girl for months and decide to push my social anxiety out for two seconds so I could talk to her. Yea today was the day we stopped talking. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people. I don‚Äôt talk to people but I wish I could. I wish I did. I don‚Äôt know what this emptiness is. I wish it would go away. I wish this loneliness would go away. I wish everything would just stop and things would go right, but I know that won‚Äôt happen. This one thing I wanted for months didn‚Äôt work out and usually I wouldn‚Äôt be upset. I am now. This time it makes me want to just say fuck it and throw my life in the river.

672,tvuiud,ramen_and_ragu,"I hate how it'll tell me I wasnt good enough, or I was being really weird/awkward when I have a ""bad"" interaction with someone. I hate how it'll tell me that I should never talk to anyone because im not worth their time, even though the person im talking to doesnt think that way at all. I hate how I always come up with these crazy scenarios of bad things happening to a person I'm interested in (or want to talk to), when they tell me that they were just talking to another person, or that they have other people they're going to be busy playing games with. I hate how it just wont let my past go, especially with how my relationship with my brother and sister has gotten so much worse over the years, and what it has done to me. I hate how it'll tell me that my brother or parents never loved me, or ever wanted to be around me. I hate how it'll tell me that I will never be useful to anyone, no matter how hard I try. I hate how it'll tell me my problems aren't as worth as much as someone else's, which is probably true for me since I personally think I'm a really bad person due to what I've done to others in the past. I hate that no matter how much I try to impress people, it'll always tell me that I'm an absolute sicko to them and they'll hate me for all of eternity, even if I slightly think I did a good job with talking to them. I hate how it'll tell me I won't be able to find anyone to talk to, since my mentality is that of a 13 y/o. (17m, already almost 1/3rd of the way to being 18.). I hate how it'll make me overthink things 24/7, never letting me catch a break. I hate how it'll always make me feel so lonely and ignored, my ""efforts"" of trying to establish good friendships with people always feeling stale and bland. It always makes me feel like I'm just a plain and basic person, since I'm not into any bands at all or music with lyrics.

I just feel like I won't ever be able to find someone who won't mind how excited and weird I can be. I just want to find a quick escape from feeling so unloved, even if it's by shoving myself in horrible relationships, where the other person probably doesn't even love me. Just pretending they do  is all I would need since it's the only thing that will give me comfort these days. It's even worse how I don't know how to find certain groups of people that fit me, all because I'm too afraid of rejection or being looked at in a strange way.

I just want to be free from this wanting-attention-and-feeling-desperate-24/7 hell I've put myself in. I just want someone who I can be with where I can truly be myself. Not this dumb stuff where I have to ""sorta"" be myself, but really act like how I would if I were talking to a certain person in real life.

At this point it just feels like I won't ever be happy, or satisfied with what I have. I want more, and I hate that I'm such a fucking needy person. Is it because of my past relationships? Maybe it's karma coming to bite me back from how harshly I used to treat them? I don't know. All I know is that I'm a terrible person deep-down, and that I always end up making myself think I won't ever be able to get out of this downward spiral I'm in, just because I feel like I deserve this, and that I should never be genuinely loved or cared for, ever again.

I just wish I could be someone else, a more interesting and fun person to be around. I mean, some people say that I am fun to be around sometimes, but I'm talking about those laid-back people who have a deep voice and sound like they've got everything sorted out for themselves. While I'm there, just in the background laughing and being weird as fuck, not adding anything to the conversation whatsoever. Just being a fucking burden.

I just feel like I never had a chance to begin with. I was doomed from the start, to rot in hell, for what I've done. I can and never will be forgiven for being so unfair and horrible to the people I've been with. I'm sorry.

I'm such a mess. I don't know why anyone would want to be with me anyways at this point. I mean, they probably shouldn't since I'm still pretty young and I've got a long ways to go to sort out my stuff, but holy shit does it feel hopeless as hell.

Sorry if this wasn't the right place to vent, I didn't know where else to go, so I'm just hoping this is fine.

(tl:dr i feel horrible, ill never find the right person, i still let the past get to me, and im a terrible person and i feel like i should burn in hell for it. just a mess.)

quick edit: i forgot to say that i also hate how i never know what to say in certain situations, like when i have to solve a problem that isnt mine or when someone is sad and i need to comfort them.

677,tvv785,Ambitious-but-lazy,"I was SO incredibly grateful for having a good friend for 9 years. I never had a friendship last that long. We had some issues over the years but always worked it out. We had a falling out a couple weeks ago and she dumped me. It‚Äôs not gonna be resolved bc once she‚Äôs done with people she‚Äôs done forever and also I‚Äôve been so hurt that I don‚Äôt know if I would be able to move past this and forgive her even if she did try. 

I have no family living near me. I have almost no friends. I have a couple of unstable and rocky friendships that could end at any moment. I am not working at the moment (unable to) and 99% of the time I‚Äôm just home alone now. When she was around I was always out doing something with her, almost daily. 

Now I feel I don‚Äôt really have anyone who cares about me. My mom died a few years ago and she was the only person I truly felt cared about me. If I suddenly died I am sure that it would take weeks, probably months until anyone even noticed my absence and eventually I would hope someone would have the police check on me. I often think about how if I did die then I would just die all alone and my body would just decompose over months. The only situation I can imagine that someone might check on me is bc my landlord wouldn‚Äôt be getting rent anymore so would likely try to find me for that. I have a lot of health issues, so I could die. Just so you know I‚Äôm not being paranoid. 

In some ways I‚Äôve come to accept that I am all alone in the world. I‚Äôve tried making long term friends so many times and they never work out long term. It takes so much effort and energy and disappointment for me to go through that over and over and still ultimately end up alone.

681,tvvhbi,[deleted],"This is my alt account because well, he found out my main. Anyways, the thing is I'm an active member of [r/applyingtocollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege/). As you can see I'm a HS Senior. I moved high schools, and one of the post on the subreddit asked what person were you shocked to see get into what university. I commented a former classmate of mine who got into Harvard. For context, nobody from that school had ever gotten into Harvard before. None of the alumni did. I knew she was good, but whatever. I was being a bit salty ofc. I congratulated her nonetheless. My friend bombarded my reddit account along with his friends.

The point is, I used to have a really good friend, we will just call him Taco. I knew Taco for 10 years, but we didn't really become friends until middle school, so we were friends for around 5 to 6 years before I left the school. He used to cover up for me when I got into trouble and I did the same. We weren't best friends, but we were really close. On the year that I was gonna leave, we became a bit distant and he would somtimes make fun of me, but I forgave him because of the fun memories we used to have. We didn't leave on such good terms imo.

When I moved away, I was soon banned from the class group chat, and their exclusive discord, both by Taco specifically as it told me who banned me. I was shocked, but I thought maybe because I left the school so whatever (Not true as the other kids who left the school were still part of the group chats.) I talked with Taco a few weeks ago and I just thought it was nice to reconnect.

I applied for colleges. I didn't have really good stats, so I didn't have high expectations. I got rejected a lot and ultimately decided that I will settle for Community College and then transfer as I didn't like any of the schools I got into. Taco was no longer part of my life. I just remembered him as a good friend I used to have.

Now, I'm somewhat active on reddit, but my friends never knew about my reddit account, including Taco. I posted that comment on the post, and boom, I saw that I was swiftly downvoted (ok, it happened before), but I recognized the usernames. It was Taco, and his new friend (we will call him Mango.) Mango transferred to the high school after I left, so I actually never know who Mango is. Taco and Mango harassed me for being salty, and that I was a crybaby for not being good enough.

I couldn't believe it. It's not the Harvard thing that made me mad, but that I used to be such good friends with Taco, and he did this to me. He insulted me. I shouldv'e known when he started making fun of me on our last year. Mango, I didn't even know who this guy was, joined in the fray. I wish I never see Taco again. He doesn't have very good grades as well, but he's a violin virtuoso, so who knows. Now, they know my entire reddit history. I didn't want them to know where I was going for college, But I guess they do now. They're probably gonna tell the girl what I said. And they may tell the entire class, who will tell their parents and tell my parents.

That was the last thing I needed. Now, Taco is dead in my hearts. He used to be so good, so fun. Right before we left, I should've known when he started making fun of me for not watching porn like a normal teenager. (Ok, I did a couple times, but I felt disgusted by it and the last time I did it, was like 7 months ago.) RIP Taco. I'm probably salty, but yeah. Why, Taco? Why? I'm gonna go terminate my main account tomorrow, and use this as my main now. I don't ever wanna see anybody from my last school ever again except one of them who I still talk to often. Now, they all know I'm going to community college and laugh at me for being jealous of the top girl going to Harvard. My life sucks. Just wanted to vent this out.

Edit: Just got harassed either by random redditor or former classmate. The account was young and never commented before, so must be directed towards me specifically.

For some reasons, I can't seem to find any of them irl.

Not even a single alone person who I could even try to befriend. It truly feels like I am the only person in there to have no friends at all, not even an acquaintance. And if you dare talking to literally anybody who's with somebody else at all, you can be pretty sure that you'll get bad looks and mocked behind your back if not insulted, even if you're just asking if something or someone is right there or not.

So this weekend I made sure to stay home to try to spend time with her. All she did all weekend was scream at me and tell me I'm useless she never wants to have sex or anything maybe one time a month if I'm lucky. I have had her verbally abuse me to the point where I feel useless and my kids think I'm a bad guy as well bc she puts them against me l feel so defeated and I beg her to understand how bad she hurts me but I'll she says I'm doing is nagging her... I mean who calls there man ugly and tells them no one wants them and that your ex cheated on u bc u suck as a husband... I literally am trying to keep it together but I have no one to talk to bc I'm a man and u are supposed to be tough.. but it's hard to be tough when the women u love makes u feel like a joke and useless I just wish I could be appreciated and feel worth it for one day.

852,twl7a4,Forsaken-Love7651,I‚Äôm so tired of everything. I‚Äôve cried everyday for the past month. I think part of the reason I‚Äôm depressed is because I‚Äôm so disappointed in myself and the way my life turned out at 24yrs old. I wanted more for myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life to make myself better. Spending 95% of my time alone doesn‚Äôt help. I put on a smile everyday at work when in reality I‚Äôm holding back tears until I get in ny car  cry and leave. I‚Äôve been severely depressed since I was 12. I went to therapy for about 5years and it helped me cope with a lot of pain I went thru in my teen years. I can‚Äôt stand feeling so empty n low and having no one I can comfortably express my feelings to. It eats my up on the daily. I‚Äôm confused lost and sad emotional as fuck. I have issues deep within I never got real healing from. Losing a parent at a young age put a huge void n my heart I feel empty when it comes to not having a father figure. I get a little jealous seeing people with their fathers and get angry seeing people not want their father in there life. The emptiness u feel from not having the other parent is truly indescribable. A lot of anger stems from it that‚Äôs fursure. I need to start praying for direction and believe in my faith. Cause at the moment I have no hope I don‚Äôt even wanna wake up most mornings.,2022-04-05 03:10:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1636752519,7,/r/lonely/comments/twl7a4/lonely_n_lost/,,0,1,Lonely n lost

I guess he unfollowed me way back then because we suddenly got out of touch. I just don't like the feeling that I thought he's someone I can count on even we don't talk anymore but now it's like he wanna cut all ties. It may have been a year or since the pandemic started.

865,twmeh7,Jurez1313,"To be fair, I still have a few people I talk to online from time to time, and two or three I might even consider friends. I know they care about me, even if they can't do anything to help or console me in my darkest times. But online friends just hit vastly different than IRL ones. It's easy to show kindness and compassion to people that you can ignore when it suits you, that you can think of the perfect reply to, that you don't have to deal with if you don't want to. Someone you can idealize in your head. 

But in real life? Meeting someone who can tolerate your bullshit, and still cares about you? Is still there for you, to pick you up when you feel like shit, to help you find happiness in the present moment, and who you would do the same for in a heartbeat? Feels like too much to ask for, an impossibility in a society full of people hell bent on separating themselves from people they don't know at all costs. 

So yes, I desperately want someone to hang out with. A good friend that I can trust, and form a bond with. I might even go so far as to say not only do I want a friend, I want a group of them. And if I had my way, one of them would be my romantic partner. But just one would do, for now. Get me out of this lonely hell where I cry myself to sleep night after night. 

But alas, it is not to be. I am too lazy, too defeated, too unambitious, too much of a degenerate to make the effort to approach strangers on the street. And too ugly, creepy, boring and stupid for anyone to approach me first. So I'm destined to live out my days completely alone, turning to the internet for what little morsels of humanity I can scrounge up, hoping that one of the few acquaintances I've managed to make on reddit will reply to me, crying myself to sleep, and dreaming of holding hands with a woman I will never ever meet - my girlfriend.",2022-04-05 04:17:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,3,/r/lonely/comments/twmeh7/i_just_want_one_friend_is_that_so_much_to_ask_for/,,0,2,"I just want one friend, is that so much to ask for?"

869,twn0xh,Lost-Object-9701,"(24M) I feel like I've lost a family member, and I feel very lost myself. I feel like I'm in limbo. But like, Bosch's version of limbo. My mind is clouded, and my baseline anxiety is doubled or tripled. For 5 years I mainly talked to one person. And vice versa. That was the only way that I could feel comfortable romantically. 

I feel like I'm glued to my screen and expecting the same type of emotional stimulation that I used to be able to get. 

I'm sitting here for a few minutes not being able to formulate what to say. If I think too deep about it, I just see her face. I am the type of person who has always, after a breakup, seeked women with a similar facial feature or another to someone I've loved (though the result wasn't always related to a similar physical trait). It's so stupid, how something so simple and genetic can cause me to feel a certain way so quickly.  Half the people I've dated had canine teeth that poked out. Isn't that absurd? It's ridiculous and it hurts. It's so stupid. I want to laugh at myself. 

I had a panic attack a few days ago after installing Tik Tok to talk to someone when I saw a tik tokker's face that is extremely similar to my ex's. Everything was extremely similar. I briefly questioned what was real. It is haunting me. Scarily similar, it was a very strange set of emotions and confusion. I value personality a lot, but I'm so attached to certain random things. It's embarrassing but I feel like saying the truth.  What are the chances I'd see her doppelganger, so unattainable I can't bear to witness.

The chances of me finding a correct person, that I can be correct for, feels so far away. It feels like the ship has sailed and sunk. I don't have the excuses I used to have. This feeling has been within me constantly. She told me there won't be anyone that I am looking for and it makes complete sense to me.

I‚Äôm a very touchy, very affectionate and needy person. My girlfriend is down for sex whenever and almost never says no, but when it comes to cuddling, just holding each other or kissing, she has been largely absent, except on the whims of her mood. 
I‚Äôve also been very frustrated by how messy she is, like doing laundry and leaving clean clothes in baskets for months on end and cluttering up the room instead of just putting the clothes away.

I‚Äôve talked to her about my frustrations and my needs now time and again for the last 4 years to no avail.

Her grandmother recently passed away and she had to fly back to the Midwest to say her goodbyes and that 2 week break I think was very much needed. It also made me realize just how incredibly alone and empty I feel, and how often my show of affection is not reciprocated. 

Since she‚Äôs been back she‚Äôs noticed a change in me although she‚Äôs having difficulty pinpointing what exactly that change may be and for once in her life she‚Äôs been consistently affectionate but it honestly feels like it‚Äôs too late. Her touch and her show of love is pushing me away and making me feel like I just gotta hide inside myself.

When people think intimacy they think hugs and kisses and one on one time with a person you‚Äôre attracted to and having personal time with them and over time that thought to have someone to share your imperfections with and your time has been just running through my mind like crazy.

Maybe it‚Äôs the thought of wanting a gf or hooking up with someone but it kinda just sounds like a nice time sharing such a private space which is yourself with another person that may want or enjoy your company. The idea that you don‚Äôt feel as alone as you really do and to feel something you feel like you‚Äôve been lacking for so long just seems to me like a experience of a life time.

1. Technology gives us a false sense of connection with others and can isolate us from the real world

2. Technology allows us to be selective about the people we want to talk to, which can lead to loneliness

3. We often use technology to avoid face-to-face communication, which can hinder our social skills

I know I am young but so far it hasn't been great, I've put a lot of effort into dating and haven't found anyone for me.   


I feel like I am missing out on young love, and I know I might find someone in the future... but later there will be more responsibilities, expectations of having children (and I do not want to have kids) and overall tiredness of everyday life.  


I dream about just the regular lovey-dovey stuff. Touch is my love language and I seriously enjoy cuddling, it changes my mood a lot for better. But I haven't cuddled in years. I love cute things and I would like to go for picnics, bike rides, trips, bake cakes together, listen to music while cuddling and kissing, touch each other's hair, talk about everything, make jokes and laugh, stare at the stars... You get it. All of the cliche romantic stuff but what's funny I don't even really watch or read romances. That's just how I always imagined a relationship for me.

I struggle with insecurity about my appearance as well as with low social anxiety. I don't think that there is anything really wrong with me except of my height. I am short which makes me figuratively and literally invisible to most women. A 5'5"" man was short 100 years ago, and today? It's ridiculous how tall people are around me, and self-affirmations, faking confidence can only do so much when you feel like a hobbit surrounded by giants every time you go out.   


I work at home and I don't have many opportunities to be around women, and everytime I go out for walks, I feel anxiety when I am around people. It's manageable and I do everything OK but I am non stop tense in public and I prefer to avoid routes with people if possible.  


I know love isn't a fix, I know many relationships are bad or even turn abusive, but being perpetually single and lonely isn't fun either, and hanging out with male friends, doing hobbies, etc. just doesn't fix that longing for a relationship.

Also, I always seem to fall for women who don't reciprocate my feelings. I feel a spark towards them but they don't feel it towards me.

941,tx1787,cooblat,"Like, for real. I was blindfolded by my activites since 3 years, and a month ago, on a boat trip, where I had an enormous amount of free time, of course it was nearly impossible to talk to my friends irl, but, I'VE GOT NO ONE TO CHAT WITH. 

(20m for context)

I have some friends, but let's be honest, among them, only one would take new from me if I disapeared for at least a month, the others? Hell noooo...

Since my parents got dicorced, I moved 3 times in 5 years, and holy fuck that already made social life hard to me, as a relatively shy and introverted guy. 

My first and only relationship? Lasted 3 months before having to move away suddenly? Great feeling honestly! 

My family? Thinks that I'm emotionless and have absolute no feelings, I cry at every movie and watching a bee miss her flower makes me sad...

I don't know what to do, I got my car recently, but I'm 20 and I already work, unlike every fucking person at my age, it makes it so hard to meet new people...

I was hapoy before, I am very lucky, got everything in life to make me happy, a cool work, enough money, great activities and hobbies, energy, hope... 

BUT I FREAKING CRAVE THE ONLY THING I DON'T HAVE.

Friendships and relationships, honestly I'd give a lot tl have those... 
I feel like my heart is broken although I've almost never truly fell in love. 

And here I amw finding myself listenning to a violon melody at 2 am, dehydrating my whole body just by crying... (THAT SONG IS FIRE THOUGH hmu if you wanna share sad music) 

Like idk, I have great moods, but sometimes, It's hitting hard. And I never really felt that, at the point where I feel stress and heat in my chest when I think about it at night! 

Idk...

Get me out?

My very existence feels wrong. I don't deserve to be loved. I've somehow tricked people into thinking I do and the guilt feels like it's clawing away at my throat. 

But I'm drowning in loneliness. I get up, stay in the same four walls day in and day out, and barely have any interaction with others. I'm so tired, I can't bring myself to try anymore. I'm past the point of being able to care to try again. What's the point? Everything I do still makes me feel this way, I've never been able to shake it off. I'm always going to be this way.

943,tx1j1p,THE01X,"TLDR: Me venting about not making many friends in a foreign school, and I think it's because of  my personality and how I express it.      

Since I got graduated from high school and started studying engineering in a foreign country, I wasn't able anymore to have friendships that last or friends that feel really close and genuine. The only friends I have now are the ones who took the same path as me to study in another school. However, due to the distance between where we live/study, they got new friends, and it's like they created a new life, we don't see each other that much, and I feel like I was left behind.

I've talked to many people and worked with many others in some projects, but as soon as these projects end it feels like they barely know me, and it's rare to get a ""Hello"" from them when they walk by me in the school hallway. I started having self-esteem issues because I think these people I talk to don't find me interesting. Despite not being a talkative person, I always tried to take initiative in being interested in others and asking them questions about themselves to initiate conversations. However, I'm an introvert and that's really tiring, especially when I feel like they are not interested, and recently I don't do it anymore, and I just sit there.

I thought about it so many times now, people don't get interested in knowing me because of the way I express myself, I think I give off the vibe that I am boring and uninteresting due to my expressionless face and weak voice even though I'm a big guy I have a very little presence. I'm jealous of people that just walk in and can say something funny with a big wide smile and huge positive energy and everyone gathers around them. If I was able to do that, maybe people will want to spend more time with me and like me in general, and might get to have meaningful friendships and some social attention. The only way that I made friends before was because we were in a small class and I saw them almost every day. But now it's harder because the people around me change occasionally, and also because it's difficult to make casual talk in a foreign language...

There are many things on my mind that I wanted to say, like not having a significant  other and feeling that I'm not loved enough... I didn't want this venting post to go that long.

Thank you for reading this long post. I just wanted to get some off my chest.

949,tx31iy,TemporaryAdvanced,"21M here. I feel this constant mental stress from seemingly everything in my life every day. From lacking both friends and a romantic relationship.

I have basically no friends. The couple of ""friends"" I have, have been trying to get to play some online game that I don't care about. I thought I might give it a shot anyway just to have something to do with them. We play a bit, I'm not that intrigued but I don't hate it either.

A few days later, I check Discord, 2-3 of them are playing without me. A couple of days later, they mention each other on a server to see if they want to play. Not one of them mentions me. I decided to tell them myself that I'm joining for one game. We play, they get mad at me for playing poorly even though they're the ones who told me to play with them in the first place.

I wonder why I'm playing poorly in this game that I just started playing a few days ago, still don't fully understand, and my account is at a low level, hmmm...

Ever since, I just see 2-4 of them playing on Discord almost every day without me. I stopped playing. Most of them stopped talking to me.

On the relationships side. I knew this girl a couple of year ago from college. Haven't talked to her in a while since we choose different paths in college. She seemed nice. But I never really expected to have anything meaningful with her. Even our friendship was fairly surface level. So, I never told her about my feelings for her.

A few days ago, she called me. Where I live, there's a bit of a national holiday thing happening so I thought she was just calling to say happy holidays or best wishes or whatever.

Last time we had an online chat was over a year ago. Last phone call was even longer ago. Apart from some happy coincidences running into each other in college and chatting for a couple of minutes, we haven't talked much in a while. So, for obvious reasons, seeing her name on a call on my phone came off as a real surprise. One that made me happy for a few seconds until I picked up. And she said that she called me by mistake lmao.

That's all she could say after we haven't been in contact for this long. To alleviate some of awkwardness, I said happy holidays, she said the same, and we hung up. I guess I was naive to think I had a chance when I saw her name on my phone before answering the call after this much time had passed.

Anyway, I'm not sure why I wrote all this. I went to a therapist a while ago, and got somewhat better. Guess it doesn't last forever considering that I feel low enough to need to vent like this. If you had a similar experience or have some advice or anything you want to say, feel free to do so.",2022-04-05 19:34:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594162261,5,/r/lonely/comments/tx31iy/at_21_it_feels_more_hopeless_than_ever/,,0,1,At 21 it feels more hopeless than ever
950,tx34wc,Vagikrappers,"24 M who has never been in a relationship or had many friends what few friends I did have I believe that most of them were one sided friendship. After I left college when I was 18 I stopped talking to people I went to college with unless they spoke to me in the first year of leaving college only got one or two messages I grew accustomed to not talking to people. I got my first job after leaving college doing seasonal work in a factory work for about 8-9 months of the year had the other months off, it was a good job for me who wasn‚Äôt interested in making friends and the staff turnover rate is very high the person your working with one day you might never see again after the next day. I still work in that factory now got to know some of the people who work there all year round but wouldn‚Äôt really call any of them my friends they don‚Äôt know anything about me and I don‚Äôt know anything about them just come to work, work together have a chat mostly about work then go home. About a year ago I changed jobs in the factory came off the shop floor and moved to work in the office all year round. Whilst training for this new job the girl that was doing at that time was training me she was only a year older then me and had a lot of similar interest during my time training with her (2 weeks) I grew quite fond of her looking back I wouldn‚Äôt say I was romantically interested in her but at the time I was thinking about her a lot I believe this was because she was very kind to me even though I only knew her for two weeks she brought some food to work for me due to a celebration/holiday from her home country, praising me for understanding my new job quickly just generally being a nice person to me something I don‚Äôt experience a lot of. Now this girl was leaving work I know that before even meeting her but I grew very fond of her so when she did leave I felt very down and lonely something I haven‚Äôt felt before didn‚Äôt feel like this when I stopped talking to people I had known through out my entire education or when I left college and stopped talking to this girl I was very close with who I hanged around with after college everyday. I felt like this for a couple of weeks lost my appetite lost motivation to do my hobbies I even talked to someone at work about it to try and get some help. I tried messaging this person and it did help a bit but it was a very small conversation and we haven‚Äôt spoke again since then. After a few weeks the feeling subsided and I got my appetite back and back into my hobbies and my normal self of not really wanting to get to know people only talking to them if they talk to me. But my problem is now it‚Äôs happening again met another girl at work this time quite a few years older then me about 8 I think, she does the seasonal work and has just left and now I‚Äôve got the same low feelings, she was also nice to me and someone I actually enjoyed talking to about anything on her last day instead of going home at 5 like I usually do I went to go find her and talk to her until she finished a few hours later. Before leaving work she made sure I had her number and gave me a hug. This was about a week ago now I haven‚Äôt messaged her and I‚Äôve been feeling down like I did with the other girl. My question is in the six years I‚Äôve been at this job why have these two people affected me so badly when they leave in both cases I‚Äôve only spoken to them for a short amount of time but for the hundreds of the other co workers I‚Äôve spoken to day in day out some even having similar interest with me when leave it doesn‚Äôt bother me, why were these two so different?",2022-04-05 19:38:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649018381,4,/r/lonely/comments/tx34wc/why_do_some_people_make_me_care_when_i_dont_care/,,0,0,Why do some people make me care when I don‚Äôt care about most people I know

Has anyone successfully got that skill back after loneliness/isolation? I‚Äôm so worried that the isolation will permanently make me bitter and unhappy for the rest of my life.  When it‚Äôs all said and done, it‚Äôll be six years of solitude.

Thanks and love everyone,

970,tx77m3,[deleted],"Is my order that complicated!? Is the friendship machine broke just like the ice cream machine? (McDonald's you know who you are!) If you have ever felt like this, I would like to invite you to start a friendship with me! For only 24 payments of $0.00, we could be great friends (If that's not a deal then the moon really is made of cheese!)

Features include:

* I'm located in the midwestern part of 'Merica, but thanks to the magic of the internet that's irrelevant! \*such magic\*
* Am willing to talk about anything. Did your pet hippopotamus sit on your favorite pair of shoes turning them to unwearable shoe pancakes? We can talk about that! Time-travelers kidnap your grandmother for the third time this week? We can talk about that too! Or if it's serious (yes believe it or not I have been know to be serious at least once since I escaped my mother's womb) we can talk about that as well. But for real... I'm open to talk about anything you'd like :D
* My favorite vegetable is a red bell pepper. Not sure why I shared that of all things, but if you think about it you probably feel like someone's not an absolute stranger on the internet if you know their favorite vegetable, right?
* Will not ghost. I like spooky things, but I am not spooky myself.

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!

If reading this made you so much as crack a smile, you can try a friendship risk free by sending me a chat. Hurry as this offer won't last for forever (I hope I don't die soon but you never know what the corporate clowns at McDonalds are plotting since I called them out on their ice cream machines!)",2022-04-05 22:40:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/tx77m3/can_i_get_uuuhhhhh_reddit_friendship_sir_this_is/,,0,2,"Can I get uuuhhhhh....

981,txa2ua,Eequal,"Loneliness isn‚Äôt the greatest thing in the world. Guess what else isn‚Äôt? Eggplants. I mean who would want to eat those weird plants let alone drowning them in a pot full of grease? And the skin‚Ä¶ ugh. What makes my mind at peace is finding something I hate, and looking for something else I can hate more so that I can distract my mind from the root issue. Because living in denial is one my key skills as a functioning adult. But I digress. 

Being hornely (horny and lonely) made me appreciate aspects of my life that were so easy for me to ignore. Take for example the creative ways of hiding key evidence after consuming pron. Although there‚Äôs one true method of doing so, the mind is constantly at work to find a new, and a better way to conceal the murder weapon. Nature never ceases to amaze me. Speaking of nature, do you know that my brain sometimes encourages me to seek solitude and stay away from nasty, angry, poo poo people, because they might say something hurtful about me and I‚Äôll hide so fast the continuation of what they wanted to say will be in my‚Ä¶ imagination?

Honestly, everything about me being lonely and horny makes sense. I never seek people out. I mean who would want to go out with someone like me? I‚Äôm not rich, or good at conversations. People feel awkward around me, and stop talking the moment I make my grand appearances. I mean if I‚Äôm denied relationships then why won‚Äôt someone send me, via email, the reasons I got rejected? 

‚ÄúDear Eequal,

You are bad. You are so bad at this. Please be good. Because good is better.

Stop begging for clues. 

Yours,
Nature‚Äù

If I got signs from whoever it is about my performances, I may be in a situation better suited for relationships. Like out of my room? Away from my computer and video games? Yeah, but that‚Äôs an impossibility. Nature doesn‚Äôt give out free evaluations to randos. Maybe it does? Maybe life is just a dream, and we can mold this dream to our likings. If I started to think too hard about something, and focus all my mental gymnastics in that one thing, it‚Äôs ought to manifest in one of those dreams, one night. Or it may give me a sleep paralysis‚Ä¶ Nah, that‚Äôs just me being superstitious.

That‚Äôs all what I wanted to say. Loneliness is horrible. But you know what else is? You guessed it. Egg-fucking-plants.",2022-04-06 01:03:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1422555678,2,/r/lonely/comments/txa2ua/making_fun_out_of_my_loneliness/,,0,3,Making fun out of my loneliness

995,txbwe7,OkPaleontologist8248,"This was a few years ago before Covid.

I took this AP class that my counselor reccomend. 
I had zero ""friends"" but I knew some people. I'm no genius so no one ever wanted to work with me and I would try not to get in my classmates way to greatness. We once had a group project my ""friend"" who was the only person I knew well in the class, and the only person I spoke to stood up and instantly ran from me. I understand why he would do that but it did hurt me a lot. He was at the time, ranked #4 in our graduating class. My teacher was no bs kinda guy so he just tossed me in a group. 

This was basically my life. My ""freinds"" would do stuff together all the time and I would feel extremely left out. They always spoke to me as if I had brain damage. They would always be nice to me almost as if they pitied me. 

They would say stuff that hurt me right in front of me  as if I was not even there or as if I could not hear them. 

One day I was talking to my ""friend"" about class work and then my other ""friend"" asks me if am lonely. It was out of the blue and I did not know what to say. I never gave an answer. I just chuckled and looked down hoping they would leave me alone.  

I know you could say i could have found a better friend group but am not particularly good at that. Another option would be to leave them, but eitherr way I would have to try to work with them as we wbere the only ap students in our grade, so same old ~25 students each class.

1005,txcrux,Icy-Ad666,"Growing up, I have always had different interests from my friend groups. Whether it be music, movies etc its always been hard for me to find someone with common interests. But I never had trouble making friends growing up (probably because of school). 
Maintaining them was never hard either, but now I question why I feel like there's sonething missing.

I feel guilty for feeling like something is missing. But there is this frustration I have when all my friends go to a concert. I never know who to ask to the concerts I want to go too.  There is this frustration I have when I want to go do anything like try a new restaraunt, go to a bar, because I know my friends don't want to.

And i try thinking well its fine I can try their interests (which i do) and which i enjoy at times but i feel like im pretending. And i just feel tired. So more often than not I skip out on their group hang outs with stuff I just cant pretend I like doing. 

I want more friends/ new friends but I also feel guilty/selfish that I can't be happy with what Ive got? And that im never going to find anyone who likes the same things I do (who won't leave). 
Like Ive made new friends in the past couple years who moved away, ones who I thought ah finally someone new experiences common interests. But they moved so i just yeah.

I think itd be idiotic to bring this up to my friends who i feel like im growing apart from.

I dont want to lose them.  But i also dont know how to just make sense of how im feeling. If this is just a phase or are all friendships doomed to be outgrown?

1009,txdcz9,SubtleSerenity,"sorry in advance for my poor grammar, I've never been good at it.

I'm so tired of this constant loneliness. I have this constant feeling in my gut that just gets worse when I remember how alone I am. I live alone, I work alone, I go to bed alone, I wake up alone, etc and I'm just not okay with it anymore. I got my own place about 5 months ago after having lived with my mom and brother until then. I didn't realize how much I valued and  liked having them around until after I moved out. I've been pretty anti social since high school and never had a group of friends and that is still true today. Other than my mom and brother I have no one I can turn to in my local area. No one I can laugh with, no one to talk about hobbies with, no one to turn to when I'm upset or need someone's opinion, etc... And more than anything that is what I want most, an emotional connection with someone, a friend. I do have a gaming group but I have never felt like ‚Äúpart of the group‚Äù if that makes sense, and I know an only online friendship is not healthy for that to be my only social interaction . I also have someone named Chris who I also met while gaming. We've known each other since middle school and I cherish having him in my life. We've only met up a couple of times, but each was some of the best fun I've had. But since he lives on the other side of the country meeting up isn't something we can always do.

I'm trying to get over this rut, but I don't really know where or how to start. Anytime I want to put myself out there I remember just how socially inept I am. I feel like I‚Äôm just this monotone boring person that no one will like and just move away from if I go to any social situations. I'm getting into therapy next month and I'm really hopeful that will help and I'm really looking forward to it. On my days off I keep having the desire to go out and just do something whether that be seeing a movie or going to a museum. Just doing anything to get out of my apartment, but I never do. I've started going on walks around my neighborhood to just get out and move.

Cause you have so much in common...

Maybe not so much.

Maybe It's me who's biased

Towards one particular trait or two.

In all your 4th dimensional glory,

You're imperceivable to me

As I'm just mere stardust come alive.

I want to come into your orbit

But I'm afraid I'm going to get slingshotted.

I don't speak your language

I'm alien to your ways

I'm neurotic about me being

An annoyance and an intruder

I'm impatient as a betelnut tree

Fluttering it's leaves in late march winds

As if it's waiting for someone who's late

And tapping it's arm with it's phalanxes,

And contracting it's frontalis muscles.

Yet I try, I want to try.

I want to..

I want you to put me

Out of my misery

We were together for 5 years and have known each other closely for 7 years before she had broke up with me and respectively that was a third of my life. I had to quit our job and our mutual friends because seeing her hurt me so deep that it would be unhealthy to do that to myself. So I moved back to my home town in an apartment by myself I have a couple of close friends that I talk to everyday from high school but they are all men. I can't truly explain it but it feels like my purpose has vanished I kept telling myself that it will get better once I get a new job and start talking to more people.

1043,txh2cu,PachuliKing,"I enjoy a lot of things in life, but I think my Achilles heel is love, and I mean love in general, but mostly in a relationship.

*I love love*

I never had a lot of love in my life. Apart from my group of friends and a girlfriend (now ex) that is the best person that will ever exist, I really never had what can be even considered the minimum of love in a human life, so I know what I'm writting here can be nothing but the frustrations of a loser. Still, I love love. I love everything about it. When I was about to accept that maybe I'm here not to have love, I simply couldn't. That would destroy me.

Seriously, there's nothing that can make me happier than human affection in the form of love. I even love to see it when I'm not receiving it. Watching random couples at the subway, families at Walmart, groups of friends being stupids together... that just fills my soul.

I'm jewish. I trust Hashem's wisdom in everything he does. I used to feel a bit upset to him and disappointed and even reached depression. Now that's over, I don't feel like a useless object because I know the Creator loves me, but then when I'm not looking at him, head up, and I look at the society, head down, I'm practically unexistent. Yet, I love love.

*I basically hate people*

I think I have a lot of awesome things to share with people -isn't an important part of love to share?- but I've never felt like a person ever really cared or realized how awesome they can be. 99% of the times people talk to me nicely just because they just have plans on how to take advantage of something they know I have. They make me feel like the most fucking useless piece of shit ever. That my role in this world is basically to be there for other people like an old coat. Damn, I even dated a girl (we didn't turn to become a couple) for a year and a half that knew I had a lot of problems trusting people and feeling like nothing, and when I needed her the most and told her that the world broke my heart she simply fucking told me: well, that's how everyone is, so don't expect nothing different from me. How am I supposed to trust people when literally almost everyone is that shitty?

So I don't know what else to do. This feels like the ultimate fight between my heart and my brain. My religion says that the brain should rule the heart and so I think and practice, but I can't just tell my heart to stfu. That's just who I am. I've had to change a lot of things of myself just because of shitty peoplem, just because I don't want people like that hurting me again or because they left me traumas, but this? I'm not willing to change something so important to me in order to fit better. And when I fit better I'm talking about basically taking my heart of my body so I can't feel anymore.",2022-04-06 08:02:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1577692199,1,/r/lonely/comments/txh2cu/i_just_love_love_so_much_that_i_cant_stop/,,0,0,"I just love love so much that I can't stop searching it, but then I hate people so much that I don't even know what to do"

I just feel lately that all the blood sweat and tears I put into this place it's for nothing.. i help the girls when busy (barback it's not my job but they need it) I help any coworker in blink of a eye. But in the end I feel they only like me because I help them or just work hard. They probably don't even really know me I'm a quiet person I tend not to waist time with people if I feel it's to risky or not worth the effort. Kinda wish someone would take the time... I don't know kinda lost person at the moment never had love life always working just always feel alone and lost and afraid I'd over work and push someone away if I did find a person..  kinda all over the place but just venting :b (m 27),2022-04-06 10:10:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616131744,1,/r/lonely/comments/txis96/does_my_hardwork_and_kindness_pay_off/,,0,1,Does my hardwork and kindness pay off ?!

The loneliness and lack of security make me think the most shitty thoughts about ending up alone and I get up every day with thoughts of anxiety where my scalp is tensed up. I'm already balding.

I just feel things would get better but they don't seem to be. I was romantically infatuated with someone and I realized how better a man I was when I thought about her.

I said I felt stressed and that they were overreacting and I was sorry for any misunderstanding. Again, not good enough.

I have to eat lunch soon and someone else started to message me about problems they were having so I started to feel overwhelmed. I asked them to stop again and said I'd talk later or I'd babe to mute them because I didn't want to argue. They then said I was being shitty for saying that and kept on still.

i actively participate in our capitalistic system and try my best to distract myself by spending money on cute things lol, i am always trying to be the best and most creative version of myself, i fight my depression and my destructive thoughts every day, just to live one day longer, but nothing fulfills me. i cannot escape my suicidal thoughts anymore, i really don‚Äòt have much hope or joy left.",2022-04-06 17:23:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640086666,315,/r/lonely/comments/txrblh/the_worst_thing_about_loneliness_is_boredom/,,1,47,the worst thing about loneliness is boredom.

1116,txsx1e,grinninglikeadevil13,"when i started college last year, I joined a few weeks late due to which I had a hard time finding ""my people"" since everyone had already made friend groups of their own and also the crowd in general was very different from the one in my school and not like the people I was used to hanging out with, which however, was something I was ready to accept. slowly over 1-2 months I found myself as a part of this already existing group of 4 who had all met each other the first day of college and had grown pretty close by the time I was introduced into the group, so naturally, it took time adjusting, getting closer to them, trying to fit in but i never did mind the fact that the four of them were closer to each other than with me because it was understandable and I was sure i'd get there with them eventually.  

now, almost an year and a half later, I still find myself in the same place despite having done everything I could and being there for them in every fucking way possible. I just feel so remote at times that I get overwhelmed with tears. it's like they find me unlikeable or something but for no apparent reason. I feel like what if i'm just imposing myself onto them and annoying them with my presence and making them uncomfortable. we hangout together all day long, they have come over to my place for sleepovers numerous times, we party together, I've been to their homes which is literally in a different city, been to trips and one would say that we were a pretty close group for that fact, yet here i am feeling alienated, like i'm a part of the group just as a formality. I also found out that they have a separate group chat without me calling themselves the og, this was like the final blow, it hurt for some reason, both the fact that the group chat existed and it's title, like why would they need to talk in a separate group chat if not about me? do i make them that uncomfortable? I am also always left out from important details and discussions and sometimes it's like they just forget bout me even when i'm sitting right there with them. it's like my presence or absence doesn't make a difference.  

friends have always been a huge part of my life. I'm one of those people who get way too attached, way too quickly. but seeing that they don't reciprocate the same attachment towards me makes me question why it's just me, why it's 4 vs 1, why is it so hard for them to consider as much a part of the group as the rest? and all of this just leads me down this overflowing train of thought every once in a while and i end up feeling so choked up on emotions and start to cry alone. they make me feel like shit about myself. all of this has been so bad for my mental health for the past few months and has made my anxiety even worse. it's like i'm walking on eggshells around them, fearing that anything i say or do will make me even more unlikeable in their eyes. and i have never faced such an issue, I have always been very lucky when it comes to friends, it has always been so easy for me.

a friend suggested that the best I can do is to *emotionally distance* myself from them for the sake of my own mental health, but i just don't know how, like i said, I get way too attached.  

*tldr-* despite being together for almost 2 years now, I feel like my friend group (who were all friends before i joined the group) dislikes me or just isn't affected by my presence or absence in the group. I feel alienated and have started doubting myself, it is affecting my mental health",2022-04-06 18:35:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567532840,2,/r/lonely/comments/txsx1e/how_do_i_emotionally_distance_myself_from_my/,,0,2,how do i emotionally distance myself from my friend group that makes me feel like shit

1155,txy947,NullableIsBad,"TW: Suicide, Self Harm.

I've been lonely most of my life, When we moved here I didn't even celebrate my 12th birthday cause I had no one to invite, I know it might seem small to some of you, But it really fucks you up and took me years to realize that. My following birthdays haven't been much better to say the least.

I been struggling with ""bad thoughts"" since I can remember myself, I was never a happy kid, always quite weird and known as the ""disturbed one"" out of the bunch. at around age 15 I thought I found a good group of friends but I slowly learned that they don't care much either.

example: I had a a suicide attempt at age 17, for a YEAR no one asked how I was, no one cared, I lived in my parent's house but they always said ""stop being depressed"" and didn't offer any help (I been on some meds at the time and they didn't help or rather didn't help enough). The only reason we are still in contact is because I reached out to THEM and kind of snugged in and ""got my place back"", They always talk about each other on how some of them are awesome and their talents and how cool they are, I NEVER heard them say anything of the sorts about me and honestly I cant imagine they do when I am not there.

&amp;#x200B;

I said about half a year ago how I was a loser, and NPC, a waste of air, I wish I could say it changed but it didn't.

I am just a loser who needs to die, and preferably soon.",2022-04-06 22:37:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610558188,1,/r/lonely/comments/txy947/its_not_getting_any_better/,,0,0,Its not getting any better

1176,ty10pf,NorthGrand5694,"So I've been talking to a person from uni for a few months now, we get on really well and we have a lot in common. Were are both pretty awkward and kinda have an understanding that all our interactions are going to be that way.

Anyway, she's super nice and I like her a lot, the problem is that I can't get my work for uni done. Every time I try and start work, I go back to the previous conversation we had and rethink everything that was said. It's got to a point where I'm unable to write because my thoughts are so clouded with my own negative judgments of what I said. I've never been a social person, if I'm honest before her I only had 1 friend who I've known since I was 14 (I'm around 20)and that's been the norm for me, I'm not used to talking with anyone else and the stress of having to socialise with someone new is destroying me, I started having anxiety attacks which never happened before I met her. She knows about the attacks but I lied about the cause (for reasons that should be clear).

I don't know what to do because I love talking to her but at the same time it's hurting me. I'm used to a very isolated existence, people didn't care about me and I didn't care about them and that's how things went and she changed that by actually showing an interest in me and mentally I can't deal with that, it goes against everything I learnt growing up and I doubt the sincerity of fact someone else could care about me. I feel like going back to isolation is the only option so that I can focus on getting my qualifications which I wasn't even sure I was in a position to get a few years ago.

There's definitely something wrong with my thought patterns and I understand that, but at the same time, there's no way I'll be able to sort through all of that before it starts to ruin my uni work and I destroy all the hard work I've put into this. The only possible short term solution I can see is to stop talking to them so I don't have anything to think or I overthink the previous stuff to death and become unable to think about it anymore.

1181,ty1mi9,panda_paul_45,"This is a long post and also my first.I don't know if anyone is really going to read this but just know I writing this just so I can talk to someone. 

Just turned 21 and have no friends. I lost contact with them when they went to study at uni and have not talked to them or anyone since. Its been 3 years now and they have enjoyed themselves going out to partying socialising and being independent. I live with my parents but I'm just a burden on them.I go to college come home and stay in my room.Just what I deserve.  I didn't go uni because of the bad grades I got.Im am an embarasment to my family. This obviously what I deserve but I cant stop this feeling of sadness. Which I am angry with myself about because I did this to myself even with all the privilege I have.Me pitying myself became a thing then getting angry at myself to think i can do that even with all the advantages i have in life compared to someone in a worser situation.This thinking put me in a loop of pity and anger at myself to the piont i have just given up. I am just useless and feel lost. I literally don't feel anything anymore. 

I try to give myself reasons for why I have done this to myself like my parents being strict, not allowing me to voice a opinion. Not being able to answer back to my parents if something is wrong.If I wasn't in the wrong for something, I don't really say anything and take the blame. Being scared of my parents. Being so introverted.

These things may sound bad but I didn't think I was able to ask for anything or speak up because I did so bad at school. One example is when I came back from school I would say I had a test results and I got a B. Being me i would be so happy with myself becuase i worked hard.But my father would say why didn't you get A then .He would complain to me I'm always on my phone and not doing anything.This happened so often I gave up trying to study. A poor excuse I know.I know he wants the best for me.

He would say this when he gets back from work or on weekends 
Father: what have you been doing since morning 
Me: studying (This is a default response i had to make becuase i found out anything else i said  he would get angry at)
Father:so you have been studying for 6 hours
Me: no i studied 3hours
Father: what time did you start
Me: 11am 
Father: really are you sure(he would say in a sarcastic tone).What are going to do now
Me: study


This would be the general conversation I would have with my father since I was a child.
This would be so constant I would just say study if he said what I did today.If he would ask how did a test go I would just say OK I wouldn't even bother giving a result.With this I became introverted staying in my room so I wouldn't be criticised asoon as I got home from school. Now it's all I do.


But these are all just excuses I make for myself i had a ton more but I just forgot about it like I do for most things because nothing seems important to me anymore. 

My parents are good people they came to this country wanting better for me and i have just thrown all their hard work back at their face. Since I was 14 I have just given up and I don't think I will get better.
They aren't bad people i dont think my father knows how much his remarks a berating actually effected me even now.They do support me but their is only so much they can do.To be honest im at that piont where they would disown me and i would find some sort of peace in it.

To sum up I'm just lost in life and I want to get better.Iv become lazy and antisocial I struggle to even brush my teeth and get out of bed. I know this is a long post but I really want to talk to someone. Anyone really.

We‚Äôve hung out from time to time, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre pretty good friends. Lately I‚Äôve been feeling like she‚Äôs been treating me as a rebound.

This has happened quite often she sees me as someone who will be by her side no matter what and that‚Äôs true of course but she takes me for granted. She will go days without texting me but she‚Äôll text other people back right away. The way she treats me I can tell.

1228,ty6qmd,SeriousPuppet,"I met a girl recently. I went for a casual meal with some friends from our rec sports team. They said the waitress was into me. They nudged me to ask her out. I told them I'll come back another time and do it as she seemed busy. Long story short I got up the nerves to ask her out and we've been hanging out.

But, had I not been on this rec team, I would not have gone to that restaurant. It wasn't my idea. I just tagged along.

So yeah. If you're not sure what you can do to ""get involved in something"" my advice would be to start with a team sport. soccer, softball, volleyball, anything. Something super casual of course if you're not athletic. Or heck I guess you could try a book club or cooking class or something like that. I'm sure there's lots of stuff out there, I just happen to do sports because I think it's good to move the body and it's fun. But I get it if that seems intimidating.

But do something. Don't just sit at home playing video games and watching youtube videos and then complain that you never meet anyone. You have to go out and do stuff.

When I first started playing casual sports I didn't meet anyone. It took a while. Don't rush it. Just go out and try and keep doing it, week after week, month after month, year after year. You just might end up making some friends or even better, find that special someone. And worse case scenario you'll burn some calories and get some fresh air.

I have hydrosefalus. It has to do with the water that protects the brain. It's constantly changing. But my water didn't disappear they wey it should. So I have a small pump whit a small plastic tube implanted. And when everything works as it should. I'm normal. Sadly it malfunctioned so I ended up having six surgeries in one year 5 years ago. And because of that I now have brain tiredness. And that changes my whole life. I have to meditate every 2 -3 hours, I can only walk 200-300m now after a big setback, I can't be in a large group of people. And if a push too much I risk collapsing. And for the past 5 years, I have had so many setbacks. A half a year ago I was up on 700m two times a day. Now it's only 200-300m two times a day. So it feels like it doesn't matter how much I fight I always end up on step one again. I tried some meds a few months ago that would both give my brain more energy and to prevent big setbacks. Sounds good right? But no. 32 days in my pulse is between 130-94 ( when im in bed ) stopped with them So now I'm back on step one again and in even worse conduction than before.

Reddit seems to be a great place for likeminded people on a topic to quickly connect with a community, but a lot of subreddits that are based around emotions, mentalities and social themes themselves are kinda narrow in scope, when there's a lot of interconnectedness between these themes. I understand the logic of why subreddits have narrow rules, but, at least for me, I feel like my posts about loneliness, anxiety, depression, breakups, and relationships, etc need to all be split into smaller, more catered posts to specific subreddits. I feel like this subreddit is the sort of middle ground between itself, r/anxiety, r/breakups and r/depression. But even then, I still feel like the potential for lonely people to find exactly what *they* need on an individual basis is inefficient and not optimal. Not trying to bash any of the aforementioned subreddits, though, as again, I understand the logic. I just feel a bit of the irony. 

Hm..... keeping this personal to myself, I guess what's best for me to say is that even though my life could be considered to be stuck in 'development hell', it's a waste to someone out there, somewhere, specific but undefined, for me to *not* be listenening to what they'd have to say right now, with whom I'd feel I can personally have a meaningful connection with. 

I think that a prominent aspect of being lonely is not talking to people frequently, but sometimes I see posts where people either don't understand that loneliness isn't treatable or curable in the same way for everyone, or they attempt to demean those that don't connect with them. The truth for many (but not all) people on this sub is that they post here, but the type of person that would best suit their emotional needs, to fill that loneliness, is something predetermined. This is why there are posts by people on here who say that they talk to people, or even have a significant other, but they still feel lonely, let alone lonely enough to post that they're lonely on r/lonely. It can be a need for a specific type of close friend, or it can be an issue of heartbreak, though this sub only partially caters to the latter, like many, rather than fully to the former.

I hope that this post resonates with some of you, and doesn't get taken down over a technicality. Remember that although this is a great resource, it isn't perfect, and sometimes isn't even great. It's situationally useful, and there's luck involved, and chemistry. And I hope that everyone finds what they desire, or what they didnt know that they needed until it comes along, in due time.",2022-04-07 07:31:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642645425,4,/r/lonely/comments/ty7osl/subreddits_subdividing_thoughts_misconceptions/,,0,0,"Subreddits, Subdividing Thoughts &amp; Misconceptions about Loneliness"

I just don't get it. I think I am pretty decent guy. I have a decent job, my own car, my own place, and I've alway tried to help my friends and family out along with those in need.

Am I just not desirable?

I never had a gf, and I've only had 2 girls ever really tell me they like me only to turn around a see other guys. I just don't get it.

I'm starting to think that at this rate I won't have a family of my own. I won't have genetic kids of my own or an attractive woman I like as my partner.

I guess this is just a rant, but I'm just tired of doing all this work and not really having someone significant to share this with. I'm tired of coming home and not having someone to just hug and talk about my day and plan things out with. I'm tired of being turned down constantly by girls I like, and being used by them. I'm tired of being alone, but I have a feeling this will always be the case.

I know I shouldn't complain and that there is always someone out there that has it worse than you, but I'm still human and a guy. I just don't want to continue like this always.

I had to get this all out. If you have read this entire rant, thanks for indulging me. I hope all of you have a great day today, and that whatever problems you have end up resolved.

Take care.

Edit: 04/09/22

Thank you to everyone who replied to me. I have taken all of your advice to heart. I think I will just stop caring about this so much and just focus on what I do have control over. I've been told that guys should pursue women, but I think at this day and age, I will just ignore this concept and just live my life. If a woman wants to be apart of it and I like her, then I'll gladly be open if we click on all fronts but I will just trying so hard to date and just focus on what I want. I honestly think alot of girls today don't know what they want and don't see a good guy in front of them but I digress. I realize I should utilize this time to really live for me and I need to remember that my happiness revolves around me and not something like a relationship. Everyone is different.

1284,tyf20h,LeBasso,"It was only Tinder and Bumble, but yeah. Opened them a little over two years ago, I think. Was going through a really depressing time and was only looking for hookups, which only Tinder provided. Stopped using them when the pandemic hit and only resumed use about six months ago with the intention of maybe going on an actual date, but I rarely got matches, and on most I was ghosted. I read sometime later that apparently these apps boost you when you first open them? I guess that's what happened when I started using Tinder. I've been on exactly zero dates and yeah, I've got a host of mental issues which very seriously affect my social skills and relationships and well, I consider myself ugly, but I didn't think it was that bad.

Recently matched with a girl on Bumble that was honestly way out of my league, but apparently she loved the fact I sing opera and she really like my voice and my looks, for whatever reason... or so I thought, she just unmatched me overnight and I have no idea why. We talked a lot and I shared a lot of music with her, which she honestly seemed to enjoy a lot, and she was surprisingly kinda flirty, which is admittedly really alien to me. She said she was kinda busy currently but really liked the idea of meeting and me singing something to her. My stupid ass even recorded a few pieces because she wanted to listen to me. If you REALLY want a good laugh, check out my recent posts, especially to /r/opera asking for romantic repertoire recommendations for my voice type. It's a shame because everyone was really helpful, but it was all for nothing, lol. I can't even say I at least have a lot of new rep suggestions, because I really don't feel like learning any of it anymore.

I've only had two actual partners my whole life (I'm 35), and the last one ended in 2014; absolutely everyone else I've tried to date has rejected me. Both were friends of mine for quite a bit before even dating me, and one was really a FWB deal; thinking about it now, they probably took pity on me or something. I haven't been on a single date ever since. I'm going through the worst time of my life, and honestly the shit this girl pulled was the last thing I needed, especially because... for the first time in years I was actually happy and excited. I thought I'd met someone who liked me again, and I loved the idea of getting to sing for someone. I don't even have friends anymore. It really hurt. I just said ""fuck everything about this crap"" and deleted my dating profiles. I guess I have to make peace with the fact I'll always be alone.

Edit: I forgot, for extra fun, check my post in /r/AvPD from when I matched, I sound like a fucking loser now.",2022-04-07 15:04:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1294159447,4,/r/lonely/comments/tyf20h/deleted_my_dating_profiles/,,0,5,Deleted my dating profiles

1317,tyk2st,cusipic8,"Hello, I'm posting this because I remember seeing a similar post a while ago and it gave me hope so hopefully it will help someone(and also because I feel the need to share my thoughts tbh)

When I was around 15-16 I fell into a deep depression, isolated myself from everyone for years, in which I also developed severe social anxiety since I wasn't talking to anyone except my parents. I wanted to kill myself, was self harming in all possible ways, refused to even look into mirrors because I hated the way I looked so damn much, the idea of dying was so damn appealing to me but I'm lucky that I'm a damn coward and couldn't do more than cutting, burning and sometimes ripping hair out of my arms, head, etc.

I didn't have anyone willing to help me, no friends since I pushed everyone away, my parents were only yelling at me everyday, my dad was also depressed but it was manifesting in a more aggressive way, professors from school were only calling me lazy for not being able to focus or study, I was bullied by other kids, you get the idea. 

Now, I don't encourage everyone to do this unless you actually love animals and are able to take care of one, but I adopted a kitten that was almost dying(she's a healthy, very playful grown up lady now if you're wondering) and the bond I created with her it's what I think made me want to recover from all of that stuff. She gave me hope and made me feel not so lonely in this horrible world, she was literally hugging my face every time I cried, slept on my pillow every night next to me, I cannot thank the universe enough for making me find this cat in the trash. 

Slowly I was starting to feel a bit better, the suicidal thoughts started going away little by little(they are still here when something particularly bad happens in my life but go away quite fast). I started socializing little by little with people(mostly online tho) and then in real life, especially since I moved in another city and had the opportunity to meet some amazing people and it made me realize not all people are bad and judgy. Managed to meet my now best friend and some other few friends I have now that I can hang out with. 

However, I went through 3-4 abusive relationships, went back and forth again with the suicidal thoughts, went through drug addiction(left it only at weed now), developed abandonment issues but at least now I had like 3-4 people that were checking up on me, dragged me out of the house and helped me get over shit.

I learned to like myself more, learned not to care so much about other people's opinions, learned how to say how I feel(not very good at it but it's something), stopped self harming(tho I now have to live with the fact that I'll never be able to wear short sleeves around people and that I get weird looks during summer), started coping with my anger by playing video games instead or just smoking some weed(I'm not pushing this on anyone, it's not a good coping mechanism and not good to do it every day, but way better than hurting yourself tbh and it's the only thing helping me sleep).

I know I typed A LOT and maybe not everyone is willing to read the whole thing, but I'll conclude here for anyone getting this far(thank you and sorry), I got better eventually, compared to the person I was 10 years ago, I am WAY better. 10 years ago, never thought I would have friends, never thought I'll take a picture and be confident enough to post it on instagram, never thought I'll have people that want to hang out with me, never thought I'll be able to live by myself(even tho my salary is not enough and I still struggle with money every month), never thought I'll be able to be as social as I am now(I was stuttering constantly even at the supermarket when I had to pay) and never thought I'll be able to stop self harming. 

Maybe life will never be what you want it to be right now, but it CAN and WILL be better if you're willing to try and if you can think of any way that can distract you. I'm still depressed, still have anxiety episodes here and there, still can't act right in some situations, but I now have hope and no longer see myself as a worthless piece of shit. Even if you fall back at some point, you can get yourself up again.

Hang in there and just trust yourself, you are worth it and I hope you all will be able to see the good in this world and will be able to at least accept yourself the way you are. Lots of love and if anyone needs to talk, vent, anything, you can text me if you want to.",2022-04-07 18:58:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605841870,8,/r/lonely/comments/tyk2st/im_making_this_post_as_proof_that_things_can/,,0,1,"I'm making this post as proof that things can actually get better, even if not exactly the way you want.(LONG READ, SORRY)"

1320,tykrm1,blaskoczen," 

Hi everyone.

I am a 22-year old, Polish guy, without any friendship, relationship or sexual background. I was born with a condition known as cerebral palsy. My mother did not want me so she wanted to have an abortion, which failed, damaging my brain in the process. On top of that, after the attempt, she kept squeezing herself tightly around the stomach so that no one could see she was pregnant. Those factors made it that I was born dead. The doctors managed to reanimate me but told my family that I won't be able to see, walk or talk. After around I believe 15 surgeries I was able to see but ended up with a lazy eye and glasses. Obviously, after I was born nothing has changed and my parents still didn't want me, so I ended up in an orphanage. Being in such a place doesn't really help to socialize with anyone and I have to say that those have been the worst 10 years I could imagine and wouldn't wish anyone to be forced to live in such a place for a week, let alone for a decade. After that, I got adopted by my own grandparents, although I have no idea why bother to do so after such a long time. Regardless, I thought it would be a much better environment, but it couldn't be further from the truth. My grandmother turned out to be a tyrant and my grandfather a long time alcoholic. I spent another 10 years there. 10 years of being called a failure, abused and getting beaten up constantly. Sure I had food to eat and a place to sleep, but I was treated accordingly to my grades. If I got a good one, there was no screaming and no beating. I'll let you guess what happened after I got a bad one. I got so terrified that prefered spending the night outside to coming back home. Even today when being a student at a university and hear something will be graded my heart is ready to jump out of my chest. Having no one to turn to I spent those playing video games and reading books in my room, without any friends. As a teenager, I've never been to a party or anything close to that. I didn't even know to talk to people and to be honest I still don't think I do but will come back to that aspect later.

Now, for the walking part. It was a little bit more tricky. Spent most of my childhood in a wheelchair or crawling on my knees, because I wasn't able to stand up on my own. The wheelchair itself caused me not to have any friends because I couldn't take part in any activities that 10-year old usually get into, like playing soccer or riding a bike for instance. I started to walk when I was around 15-16 years old.

Managed to get out of the wheelchair with the help of a gym, which took me about 4 years. After achieving the goal of being able to walk I stopped working out. When Corona broke out it got me motivated to start again. Went from 45 to 65 kg since it started 2 years ago. I managed to build a pretty decent looking body, which I am pretty proud of. I've also managed to move out of the abusive family and currently living in the Netherlands. As previously, I thought changing the place will erase my problems, sadly it didn't. Even though I am currently able to walk ( the walking is pretty specific to people with my condition, so it doesn't look normal) and have a decent physique people still treat me like I am a freak. They always have been, but I was hoping it will change after my appearance also changes.

I can't get out to the city without people staring, laughing or mocking me for how I walk. After I started to work out again I've been bombarded with sentences like: ""It won't change anything. You  
are only compensating for your walking and won't be able to find a girlfriend anyway because you are weird."". I've obviously tried to date, but every single one of them ended on the first one. I was getting rejected for 2 things: My height (5.7ft or 172 cm) and how I walk obviously. The last girl I was dating for about 2 months told me that she was only hanging out with me, because she felt sorry, not because she liked me. Some of the potential ""friends"" I've met told me that they don't want to do anything together because of feeling ashamed of being close to me and that I scare other people away.

All of the things I mentioned in this post really discouraged me from attempting any human interaction. Not even mentioning talking to girls. I feel really lonely sometimes, but don't want to go through all the mocking and rejection, because it really hurts. The worst part is that the thing that people judge me on cannot be changed and it's not my fault. It's not like I am overweight and can go to the gym to fix it and be accepted again.

Thank you to anyone who decides to read this and have a good day!

PS. My only friend I had left decided she doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore just a couple of minutes ago :(

1331,tym7gd,Invisibleman021183,"I got the normal gang up of man up and stop complaining but that's fine, I can take it. Here is the thing, when you tell someone they have to do 10,000 things to improve themselves, you are telling them is that they are inferior. This is coming from someone who did put in the hard work and got hurt so many times, eventually I realized, it wasn't going to happen. I spent almost a decade doing everything I could to self-improve and it didn't happen because it's never going to happen for me. I think anyone can only handle so much rejection and insults until your self-esteem can't take the punishment so it tells you to give up. I know I did what I could. It wasn't good enough. I don't tell other people to give up because it's different for everyone. When people give me the same lines I've been told for almost 20 years(college), I roll my eyes. Here is the thing. Since I'm pretty old, I can look back and realize, wait, just being told to improve on 10,000 things was a red flag. It meant who I was as a person was inferior. People are just themselves, put in some work in school, get a job, marry someone, and have kids.

When I was in high school, the normal kids were having their first sig. others without having to do much of anything. They just came into school, and that was good enough. I came into school and got the swarm of ass kickings for years. In college, none of the kids I talked to had to self-improve. They came into college, was able to be themselves, and they found sig. others. Does that mean they didn't take care of themselves? Of course most of them did. I did but it wasn't good enough. Another red flag. As an adult I actually did self-improve doing everything asked of me and more. I went way out of my comfort zone and didn't skip leg day. My friends who were the only friends I had IRL went in and out of relationships just being themselves. Sure, they took care of themselves but they didn't have to do 10,000 things to self-improve because being who they were was good enough. 

Shaming someone and telling them they have to do 10,000 things, especially when they are routine like take a shower or get a haircut is telling them, you are some loser living in the basement of the basement of the basement of your parents. Sometimes you just have to realize, hey, it's not happening for me and you vent on Reddit but IRL keep your head down. I don't need to be told I'm inferior again. I know I am. When I say inferior, I mean overall and not just looks or personality. 

If I offended or upset anyone who just wanted to help me, my apologies but after repeated incidents like the one last week, what used to be that person has a problem has turned into, they said that because they know how much of a loser I am. I can't take it anymore trying to exist. I'm really reaching a breaking point and have been having dark thoughts. I'm so touch starved, literally a hug or especially a cuddle would cause me to have a break down. All I want at this point is someone to sit next to me and tell me I'm not horrible like other people think I am. I'm not entitled to anything but it would be nice to have someone IRL to tell me nice things even though I know I'm horrible. If you want to say stop saying woe is me you loser and go out, then do it. The truth is I'm just a lonely guy who has no friends and has never had a relationship. I've been rejected, insulted, ghosted, flaked on, and stood up. I just wish I had one person who cared about me that could sit next to me and tell me nice things. I know I'm never going to find a sig. other and it's just venting to say I wish I had one. I just wish I wasn't the inferior, weird, guy with autism I am for one day so I could see how life is for normal people. Maybe I will watch that Euphoria show everyone is talking about. I would get depressed seeing all that sex. Go ahead, shame or gaslight me. I can even start you off.

1332,tymell,paranoid_reject,"Growing up, I was a playful and happy kid.  I remember being excited to just to go to school (K-4th grade) and see all of the same friends that I had already seen yesterday I didn‚Äôt have any problems making friends as a kid it was like the easiest thing in the world, I‚Äôm sure everyone feels the same about that thought, but then I moved just when I had started middle school so to me it was a huge change but the real change was the people.  On my first day I was instantly picked on and bothered by 98% of the other kids, and when I told my parents they told me it was just because I was the ‚Äúnew kid‚Äù and it would blow over in a few weeks or so. But it didn‚Äôt.  The real reason I was picked on was because I have mild Tourette‚Äôs, I was never a disruption in class even while having vocal tics (you couldn‚Äôt really hear me unless you were close to me) but I always chose to sit in the empty row of seats in the back of the classrooms.  I also have a few motor tics and those are noticeable but in my old school, the kids just kinda passed it on as normal and never mentioned it.  So with being made fun of a lot at a young age, I kinda stuck with the being alone thing through the rest of middle school and all of high school year. I met my best friend my freshman year and to me it was a complete shocker that someone actually wanted to talk to me.  She never cared about my tics and has reassured me that they will never bother her no matter what and for that I appreciate her.  We‚Äôve gotten along great for 5+ years, she even lives with me so everyday was always an adventure but then she got a girlfriend.  In all honesty I don‚Äôt mind her gf, I actually think she‚Äôs a really nice person and I‚Äôm happy that my best friend has found someone for her but ever since they got together, I never get to see or hang out with my best friend like we used to.  Like I said before I don‚Äôt mind her gf but it bothers me when she is here 24/7 and they do the cuddly, lovey stuff constantly and it‚Äôs like a constant reminder of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna be alone forever‚Äù replaying in my head.  In my opinion I feel as though our 5+ year friendship means nothing to her now that she has a girlfriend and we‚Äôve seen each other through thick and thin so the fact that she acts like I don‚Äôt exist anymore really beats me up emotionally.  Now whenever she talks about future plans she always seems to just completely exclude me and forget I exist which suckssssss but I guess she‚Äôs just growing tired of me.  It may just be my head getting to me but I think I‚Äôm losing my only friend and every time I think of that, it just hurts worse and worse.

My mood seems just to swing from bad to worse and then less bad all of the time, and I am too paranoid to allow for the companionship that I am so desperate for. I can‚Äôt trust; I can only stop short of vulnerability. When I reach a point where I am letting someone new in, I just shut down and am paralyzed with fear. I wish I could control it, but I simply can‚Äôt. I have never had a real relationship for this reason, and my friendships are always increasingly distant for this reason as well. I am petrified of intimacy; I am afraid it will be used against me. I probably deserve as much. 

No one knows who I really am inside because I can‚Äôt allow that; I don‚Äôt want people to be disgusted with me in the way that I so often am. It is easier to placate people and only assert myself in trivial ways, never meaningful. Can I overcome this? I don‚Äôt really think so. I believe maybe I will eventually totally surrender to isolation.

My dad's been dying from a terminal illness for the past 10 years. 
I have lost all close friends. 
My ADD is the worst it has ever been despite medication.
I'm failing college despite the material being easy and being 'smart'. 
My girlfriend broke up with me, and although the relationship became highly toxic and she didn't respect me, the loneliness and isolation of having the one person who 'understood' me is crushing. 
My dad's mental state means I can't talk to him the way I want to. 
Mom is emotionally abusive, sister is emotionally and physically abusive. 
I clearly know what I have to do, but can't due to severe depression. 
I can make friends when I am in social situations, but the depression means I am not in college or doing anything social apart from going out rarely with some old school friends, which is limited to drinking and doing drugs. 
I feel like giving up, but I can't. I feel trapped. People seem to only want to be there when I'm listening to them, when I'm being the empathetic and caring me. 
I don't really know what the point of this post is, I'm just losing my mind.

1351,tyqmff,qtipheadosaurus,"It's a strange feeling to feel miserable and lonely and then at the same time feeling guilty about it.  

My wife and I are not close.  Shes been struggling with depression for most of our 17 yr relationship.  She lost her job 4 years and shes become even worse.  Shes never been a true partner in our relationship and much of the work of home care, finances, social events, kids activities fell to me.  She has no friends and not close with her family.  Her family life consists of my sister and my relatives and the occasional phone call with her mom.  But she made good money and worked hard as the main breadwinner. She enjoys cooking so she at least contributes to meals and is a great cook.  

We stopped being intimate years ago and was awkward for years before that.  We stopped talking about our relationship years ago after every attempt led to an argument, mostly her getting offended or defensive about something I say.  Somehow it always seems to be about how I am criticizing her or putting her down.  Even when I was trying to offer support or encouragement.  I stopped trying to talk to her.  I basically leave her alone.  Our conversations now are about mundane things.. kids, dogs and dinner.  Superficial and emotionless.  We don't sleep together.  In fact we dont do anything together except the occasional fight over kids.  

My kids are teenagers now and being the typical self-absorbed young adults that they are, they dont need dad to hang out with anymore.

Our finances are bad with my income alone so that's a heavy weight that is on me every day.  I wish I can hang out with my friends more but it became more cost prohibitive.  So I save all money to pay the bills.

I have nobody to turn to and resenting my wife.  But I know that my wife is struggling too.  I feel guilty that I cant give her what she needs.  She seems to think that medication will help her.  But whatever she thinks she needs, its surely not me.

1361,tyrt6u,DonTajj,"Over the last 3 years the reality of how lonely and touch starved I am has steadily set in. I never really received physical affection in my life, but trying to pass my classes in school helped distract me from that. Plus, I had a small circle of friends, atleast in middle school I did. 

That faded away in highschool, and I started taking online classes. I started realizing how detached I was from my family, and how much I disliked them. I had a few coping methods for my loneliness, like having my cat around, and, embarrassingly, listening to audios online.

These coping methods aren't really working anymore. Petting my cat doesn't leave me much better, and now everytime I listen to one of those audios, I either tell myself that I'm pathetic for listening to them, that I'm not good enough for it to happen, and things similar to that.

The full scope of it is starting to set in again, and I don't know how to deal with it. Can someone help me?

I moved out as soon as I turned 18. I found a boyfriend 3 years ago. Love him to bits, I learned to love and accept flaws. We're getting keys to our first ever flat in a few hours. But I'm not happy.

1393,tyvtnh,Upset-Passion1457,"A lot of shit has happened this week. I used to live near my university and had an apartment and lived independently pretty well. My apartment lease expired (I wanted to extend, but my parents pressured me to reliqunish it) so I had to move out and go back to my parents' house temporarily, which does not make me happy. It is possible I am moving to my parents' hotel ASAP which is mid-way between home and my university after talking it over with my parents, but with the recent turmoil, I don't even know if that is even possible. My parents try to aggressively influence my thinking by bringing in religion as the solution to my loneliness and isolation but that doesn't work for me, no matter how much I try, because I am not anywhere close to their personality and patience. It's funny really, they don't believe in what I have and forced me to come back while acknowledging what I have, and their only solution is eating at cheap places and using religion as the solution (no hate, just doesn't work).

Furthermore, it turns out the company I really wanted to work for and had a Superday for declined to proceed with my application, so here I am, desperately looking for a job despite getting a positive response after a Superday. I had planned out a life and what I can do living away from my parents with my own income and building a life out with fun activities, pride in working hard and working with purpose, and connecting with people (I desperately want to connect with people!). Now, I have to go through a lot of interviews, which is great YIPPPYYY but it is gruesome. 

But the thing that really sucks is this...a group of colleagues, a few friends, and I assembled together to study for this exam. We all couldn't meet at the same time, but we did have a group chat. The more prominent the chat was going, the more people were added to a total of around 15-16 people from our class(es). The exam happened earlier this week and the grades came out tonight. I passed, and with that enthuaism, I shared it and asked how everyone else did. My friend, or so I believed (after much convincing that he is a friend), basically wrote this ""Go work for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ already \*my name\*"", then ""Imma beat your ass at \*place\* kid"" and ""Analyze that"". Since one of the colleagues who is a good acquaintance laughed about it, I was still feeling lost but decided to laugh with it. Then he wrote ""So \*name\* you get \*grade\* punches"" so I decided to joke by responding ""How many on each side?"" to which he responses ""Kids got jokes."" ""\*divided the grade by 2\* on each side"" and ""Had to pull out calculator"" to which I felt like it comes across a joke, but the way he was serious about his grade, it didnt sound entirely like a joke. I felt disrespected, especially in a group chat of 16 people including myself. I felt bad that they didn't succeed well despite the best I could do to help them by providing notes and what I understood, but like that was not kind and it really fucks me up.

I feel so lonely inside, isolated to the point that I am stalking Snap Maps and seeing all the parties out there, and extreme sadness because of the way things happened tonight.

1397,tyvx1s,vevevevent,"i guess i have plenty of friends, but none of them are super close friends. i don‚Äôt have anybody who i know i could just hang out with any time. so i only end up hanging with people during larger group hangouts which only happen once in a while. and i know that this is all my fault, because i never make any effort to reach out to people. in all fairness, no one ever reaches out to me either but i know at this point it has to be me initiating contact.

i don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs so easy for others to just ask anyone who they feel like hanging out with to do something. i know i have this horrible fear of rejection due to previous situations in my life where my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù secretly disliked me and i was too dumb/desperate to stop making an effort with people who hated being around me.

also due to my previous fake friends, i am constantly paranoid that all my current friends secretly dislike me as well. if a friend acts seemingly distant or quiet around me, i assume the worst and it‚Äôs giving me near-constant anxiety when i‚Äôm around others. as i write this, i‚Äôm 95% convinced my roommates (i‚Äôm 22f, college apartment) all hate me and are avoiding me. i haven‚Äôt even done anything to upset or bother them or had any fights, at least not any time recently. but i still feel this way and haven‚Äôt had a enough conversations with them lately to feel out their vibe towards me.

basically it‚Äôs living hell hole for me and i have no escape as i have no family even remotely nearby, and i don‚Äôt have a car so my options are quite limited for what i can do in my own basically.

1400,tyw0z0,Artemis-TheHunter,"With my 30th birthday around the corner I have been going through a lot of different emotions. Some have them have been deep to the point I‚Äôm crying over things that happened in the past. Some of them have been kinda on the surface because they are still kinda new. With me working overnights and being the only person awake in the building you have a lot of time to think to yourself and just trying to figure out where the emotions are coming from and when did the emotions start. Then I think back to when I was 27 and I was going through what I thought was hell. I was not living a good and productive life. I was drink heavily and just out partying on work nights not paying bills and jus going down a dark and lonely path. Until a close friend saw my pain and asked me if I was ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. How do you even answer that with all you have just bottled up inside and not sure if you should let it out. So I just sat and cried my out. My friend told me ‚Äú I know what you going through and you won‚Äôt be alone in this I‚Äôll help you. He told about a phase in life that many people just think it‚Äôs a trial or tribulation they or going through. It‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs called Saturns Return. To sum it up basically it‚Äôs a phase from 27 to 30 during this time Saturn is in the same place as it was when you was born. What this brings is all the past emotions and feeling and just things you have done over the years to now and it makes you really deal with them if you haven‚Äôt already. Most people only go through this twice in there life time some are lucky to go through it three times. But during this time you really feel the emotions you have and the cut deep. You really feel alone when you have never felt alone before. You really feel sad for things that normally doesn‚Äôt make you that sad but with all this going on you get so caught up in these emotions. When it‚Äôs really time to feel certain emotions with events that take place you sometime ls even for get to show those emotions when it‚Äôs needed. I said all this to say this yes I love my alone time I love spending time doing what I want to do even if that is just to sleep all day long. Yes I am feeling alone for the first in my life. But I‚Äôm ready for wherever my life takes me when I turn 30. 

If this doesn‚Äôt speak to you then it‚Äôs ok but if it does look it up your self and read about it for you. You might take something different from it.",2022-04-08 05:11:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648967068,3,/r/lonely/comments/tyw0z0/random_thoughts_while_alone/,,0,1,Random thoughts while alone.

1411,tyxg0s,pixels01727,"So I'm just going to start with this, I know I am majority at fault here, I've done this one to myself (mostly)
So few years back, I started chatting with this girl, different country, time zones are whack (10 hour difference) things got flirty, we got close, normal stuff
The issue is I just randomly stop talking to people for no reason, doesn't matter who you are, I get distracted by the daily life stuff that until it becomes routine (I reply if I see a message but she made it clear she wouldn't want to intimate chat), odds are I'm going to forget to talk to you for a few days (I also have no sense of time, weeks go by without me noticing) this happens a few times till she's fed up, with me obviously losing track of things and her eventually unfriended me (I tried to add back immediately like an idiot, wasn't my finest moment)
She tried to add me again back in November, I didnt  see the notification due to where it was sent, twitch friend request of all things, I saw it mid last month
She starts by going on how I've been on her mind, and what not, and when I bring up trying to get to know each other, she starts going on about how she's not interested in a relationship at all, or anything sexual with me, that I lost my chance at any of that, but she wants to slut around, and all these guys she's talking to
Im pretty sure I get what's going on, she's trying to frustrate me, get back at me for essentially ghosting her, I get that I should just stop talking to her, intentionally this time, with everything else this is weighing hard on me mentally, but I'm obviously still interested in her, and I'm letting this happen, and feeding into it
Again I get I'm doing this to myself, that if I'd just been better at keeping up ( or just not staying interested in someone like this) this wouldn't be an issue, I brought this up with a friend ( who has a similar issue of just not keeping up with people) they say it's abandonment issues, where if things are fine then it just kinda slips thru my mind, and if there's a risk of them leaving or something similar, it'll be on my mind constantly

1482,tzbll8,SUNBATHING-POTATO,"
 I have never been one to know which way the wind was blowing. Social queues, and expectations have never made sense to me. Constantly I find myself concerned if I am acting in a way that is correct. It will never make sense to me I understand now. I am not what one would consider an average sort of person. I dare believe I also am not what one would define as a weird or peculiar person. No not I for I do not have such a memorable affect as the strange do in our minds. 
 I dare say I am much more like a gnarled tree you see when on a walk. When you see it you recognize it. You notice very clearly it is not a normal tree. You may debate if the tree is ugly or beautiful, you may wonder how it became so gnarled. At the end of the day you will walk away from the tree and will think nothing of it unless you see it again. Should you see it again you may think to yourself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that gnarled tree!‚Äù then again after you lose sight of it. It is gone from your mind again. 
 It is a rare person who looks at a gnarled tree and becomes fascinated enough to sit by it, or take its picture. Just as it is a rare person who can love a person as strange as I yet so normal. A patient person must love me as I am unable to understand the world around me with the clarity others have no issue noticing. 
 It sounds like such a curse to love me. However, I am a selfish and greedy person who welcomes the curse as it benefits me greatly to be loved. Human nature demands we are loved. I may not understand social cues, expectations, or mannerisms. I daresay I understand what it means to be human to a greater intensity than many. I have not forgotten the language of my lungs that demands I sing with the birds in the morning. I know the dance my blood dances as it travels in my veins.  
 I do not understand society. I do understand the world. It is because of this understanding I know without a shadow of a doubt I do not belong in it. I belong in the ground amongst the living world. It will greet me a hello one day I am sure. For now though I do believe I will indulge myself in the curse others bear to love me. At least until they have conquered the curse enough to stop. The ground will keep.

1511,tzecvo,yeetcuzynot,"Note: Redacted some names. \[A\] was my high school crush, \[B\] was an example of a popular kid, \[C\] was one of my ""friends"" in early high school that I thought I had even though he basically forgot about me as soon as we stopped sharing classes, \[D\] was a friend I had since elementary that had almost completely drifted apart by then, and \[E\] was an old middle school crush that was way too popular for me to have a chance with.

TL;DR: I was obsessing over my crush who I would've never had a chance with and lamenting my complete absence of a social group or any friendships, let alone relationships, with girls.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few days, I thought I had a chance with my crush, \[A\], but I am now beginning to realize that thinking that is not just wrong, but silly. Come on, get a grip. She doesn't want you. She doesn't even interact with you that often, she's just in the same group as you. Why would she ever want me? I don't know anything about the rest of her life, as I'm only with her for two classes. Is she popular? Does she have a boyfriend? Does she go out with her friends? Based on her interactions with others that I notice, she seems to be pretty socially successful, which is basically the polar opposite of my depressed and lonely situation. No matter how much I want her, I have to put her out of my mind, because my level of obsession is getting ridiculous, and she has so many other options other than me, the short and quiet kid that can't talk to people and wanders around alone at lunch.

Other guys, like \[B\], have girls always surrounding them and hovering around them like their own personal harem, but I'll never have anything like that. Many of my old friends from middle school, even the ones that seemed like they were in my situation during middle school, have become social butterflies, sharing fun experiences with their friends that they'll look back fondly upon. I'm not popular, I'm not athletic, I'm not cool. I'm just less than them. And I'm not even sad about it, I've just accepted the status quo at this point. But i just want to be able to be friends with a girl. But how can I do that if I can barely maintain my friendships with boys? This isn't working. Nothing in this school is working. Other kids have extracurriculars and friends and clubs and social lives, and I'm barely getting by doing only my schoolwork. My friend \[C\] went to the National Chess Championships last weekend. Imagine the resumes and college applications of some of these kids. Will I have any of that? No. I'm just not good enough. And I'll be rejected from all the colleges I want to go to, I'll have to settle with some community college or working a minimum wage job after I graduate high school, and be a disappointment to my family and my father. Forget about a social life, I'll be the kid that always studies in the dorm. The others--they'll just leave me behind.

Imagine how \[D\] is doing. He probably has great grades and a fantastic social life compared to me. Maybe even a girlfriend, I wouldn't put it past him. He's always been better than me, in everything really. I'm the worst that I know. Well, there's nothing else really to say. I was just destined to fail. It was clear when I first went to school in Pre-K and was terrified of other kids. It was clear in elementary school when I had bad social skills and needed \[D\] to carry me through, as he was always the spotlight and the center of attention. It was clear in middle school when I was a complete outcast, sitting at the edge of the table and just wishing I could be one of the popular ones, obsessing over \[E\] and wanting to be part of all the stuff they were. And it's clearer than ever now, in high school, without friends, without a social circle, without love, without confidence, even without the decent grades that I used to have.

1544,tzi2yl,BiChip246,"Growing up, I did have classmates that I considered my friends. When I still attended school and college, I'd usually always have at least a few people that I would talk to, joke around with, play with and so on and in my eyes, those were my friends. But outside of school, I never hung out with any of them. Now I realize that they weren't really my friends. They were just other people I spent time with because we happened to be in the same class and we had to get through school together. Those were usually the only things I had in common with them. They were not actually ""my people"". And outside of school, I also never had any contact with other people I considered a friend of mine. I didn't really mind, since I'm quite introverted and I was always completely fine with spending all of my time alone. Btw I also don't have siblings or anything, so I was literally always alone aside from my parents.

But now after realizing I never had any true friends, I feel like I missed out on a lot. Which is kinda weird I guess, since I didn't feel that way when I was younger. I don't remember feeling lonely or wanting more than what I had. But now I wish I had at least one friend I was really close with. Someone I could have bonded with, someone with the same interests, someone who knew all of my quirks and with whom I could have been 100% myself without fearing that they would have judged me, someone that was my go-to partner by default whenever there was some kind of project/group task and someone that would always have my back, no matter what. Because that's what a true friend is. Not someone you just spend time with because you kind of have to. And now that I'm in my mid twenties and never having that kind of person in my life, I'm really longing for that kind of relationship now.

But those same people are often lonely and in desperate need of mental help and rehab or some sort of situation where they should probably admit themself into a psych ward to keep themselves safe.

But where do these people who desperately need help find the time to do that because if they do try to seek help they lose everything in their life which makes everything 10 times worse for them which only makes their mental health that much worse.

Even if they find the time to get help they have already lost everything like their car or the place they're renting or all of their belongings by the time they get out because they couldn't pay. What do you think happens to them next? 

It fucking destroys them because they've already lost everything that they've worked so hard and endured so much pain just to achieve only to have a getting taken away because they asked for help.

I'm currently going through this situation where I have bills to pay but I am in such need of rehab or some sort of mental health program but if I take any time off of work I'll lose my car I'll lose all of my belongings so I just have to wake up everyday knowing that I have no one to turn to because money controls my life",2022-04-09 02:05:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1377267396,73,/r/lonely/comments/tzj21j/people_in_need_are_fucking_stuck/,,1,13,People in need are fucking stuck

I became less and less important to her even though she said otherwise. I got less attention, less priority, she wouldn't even talk to me about anything that was going on. Instead, she talked to her guy friends about it. She left the first time because she said her depression was in the way. Even though I told her she could ttm about ANYTHING because I've been through so much, I understand far more than I would like to. We talked about it after I had started to get over her and was talking to the girl I was talking to before her. ""We"" decided to get back together, and she said she was going to make changes and ttm and stuff. Yeah, broken promise. We got back together like three times before I realized I was being used and manipulated and it put sooo much stress on my mind that I was breaking and after a whole thing where she was on ft with the guy who I thought was my friend and she used to like for hours at night but was talking to him about her problems and one of my close friends at the time, who I had to leave bc I found out he does drugs, told me the guy on ft (Jesse) liked Izzy and I confronted him on snap but he laughed and said I couldn't do anything because he was transferring schools the week after and it stressed me out a ton. Izzy lost her temper on me and said ""ARE YOU REALLY MAD AT ME FOR FACETIMING ONE OF MY GUY FRIENDS WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE OKAY WITH ME HAVING GUY FRIENDS?!"" (btw I only said I was okay with it because she said ""\[I\] would just have to get over it because \[she wasn't\] going to change"" idk why I didn't leave then). The worst thing is the girl I was talking to before, she was the perfect and ideal girl for me but I didn't want to date yet because High school relationships never work and because I went back to my ex so many times, she moved on to this other guy at her school and is or already gone to the dance at the school with him. She keeps saying ""It's fine"" or ""It's okay"" when I apologize for leaving her in the dust so many times but I not it isn't okay and that me apologizing will never fix it. She said something that hurt really really bad but I don't think she meant it to hurt because she is SO sweet and kind and doesn't want to hurt or upset anyone and literally won't turn down people that ask her out because she doesn't want to hurt them. She said ""It's fine, I knew you would always go back to her"". And my dog was really sick since she had puppies, she wasn't eating a lot and was extremely skinny and never played anymore, just slept. We couldn't do anything else to help, we tried so hard. We had to give her to the Humane Society because they have the resources to rehabilitate her and I'll never see her again.

I loved that dog more than anything and I was her favorite person, she would sleep with me, check on me every once in a while, follow me everywhere, if I started crying at night she would come and let me hug her.

1571,tzlesp,kelsietiger,I have been so patient with my husband and how he deals with stresses because of the way he was raised. We have had the most stressful point in our life so far recently. Its been hard I wont lie. I slip up a lot too. But I dont take it out on him. He isolates me. He talks mean to me and ignores me. I understand he is stressed and has his own issues and wants space sometimes. But why does he have to be so mean to me everytime? Every time I have talked about it with other males they say its just how they are. I refuse that statement. I dont want this to be how my future daughter gets treated.

1578,tzlt8b,Nihla7,"I just noticed I'm lonely. I usually know I'm lonely but never really feel it. For context, i got depressed right before the pandemic and i was oit of school for a long time. I took online classes for my senior years and now college started, i got hit with a truck load of anxiety and depression...again. So since three years ago I've really not spoken to many people. Then, my kuya ( older brother) got a girlfriend. I'm happy for the guy but now i cant hang out as much. Worst of all, i noticed I'm really lonely. Like, I've got realtionships...relationship, before. None i really got pass to being serious mostly because i was childish and anxious. 

Another, 'worst of all' is that I'm bi. I like girls and then puberty hit and i was like...'i like that dude too'. Its funny that's how i feel but I'm pretty sure i wouldn't be dating guys...just fantasizing...

I'm super sad and i know it but i don't really feel it. I want to date and be with a girl I'm super close with that i can brag and be arrogant to when i learn a new song on the piano or share my thoughts on...nerdy things, current world news, my raging libido or my fears. 

Hahhhhh...

Having anxiety and a social battery that runs out after a day and recharges for a week is not a good combination for trying not to be lonely. My depression makes it worst as i lack the motivation once i start falling again.

 I feel like I have a extra thick layer of skin that traps myself, within myself. Suffocating my personal desires, motivation. 18yr toxic relationship/marriage which I stayed for as long as I can for my child. Now that Im finally out of that so called ""relationship"", I feel even lonelier then before. 
 But I thought my life turned for the best when I came in contact again (Always Been In Contact, off and on since HS) with HS crush. Crush on each other. 
Long story short, I moved 1000 miles to be with her, but daughter had change of heart on the day I arrived.

1631,tztn0l,sakchurielle,"So I was dumped more than a month ago and we're still going NC since the breakup happened. (No cheating or whatsoever. He just fell out of love.) Im back on my socials again because I thought I was getting better. 

I found out in one of his friend's story (they were going live) that he was at her house together with a male friend. I only peeked for not more than five seconds and exited the app the moment I saw his face. He was smiling and seemed having fun.

I used to get secretly jealous when he goes out  at her house even if they are just friends and they have other friends there as well. We live very far from each other thats why we dont hangout often.

I dont know if I feel jealous right now because I still have feelings for him or maybe it was because this was my body's normal reaction since Ive gotten used to it (i have obsessive thoughts that make me feel really anxious, but i think it has slowly faded since the breakup)

I dont really have any desire nor curiousity to continue watching the live video. My heart is full of rage and grudge that I dont even want to look at his face for more than five seconds. I dont even watch our pictures anymore. I cant delete it either because I dont wanna see and be reminded of our memories. Or maybe they are just too sentimental for me since he was like the first person I made so many memories and experienced things with. I dont also have any plans on messaging him. I cringe every time I am reminded of him or our memories. I am not depressed either since I get to do the things Im passionate and I am happy about it. Though sometimes I miss him, but the anger would weigh more.

Is this a sign that I have moved on? What are your thoughts? Please help me. Thank you!

1638,tzurlp,shiripiitz003,"This is literally the first post im making after using this website for a couple of years, just never felt the need to post anything ever. But today I have reached a point where I cant keep these feelings bottled up anymore.

I feel like i have hit rock bottom in my life, I have felt sad and down at other times in my life but now i feel the loneliest i have evr felt .

Starting from the beggining, i guess ill start with how i came to live in country i call home now, Australia. I moved out here when i was turning 15 with my family, it was hard at first, having to adapt to living in a country where the way people live their lives isnt all that different from my own country, Portugal, but different enough to feel alianated. Naturally, English wasnt my original language, but i had learned enough as kid through videogames and movies that when i moved here it wasnt very difficult for me to master the language in a way that would let me speak comfortably with people. However i Stills had difficulties making friends. I have always been the kind of guy who is very shy at first but once you get to become friends with me i get very confortable with the friends i had made. Ive never been the kind of guy who liked having too many friends either, just a hadfult was enough for me, but the more the merrier. I am also a pretty big guy, even when i was younger, right now im about 6'2 and i am also very broad shoulders, also my face is what a lot of people would call a ""resting bitch face"", its just what i look like and cant do much about it either, it also never really annoyed me when people would make fun of me for it except for one time or another. Bit after about a year i had made a couple of friends at school. I thought i would never have to deal with year of loneliness for the rest of my life.

That is until 2022. Since 2019 i have been loaing friendships left and right, and i whilst i felt sad about I always got back up and said, 'oh well guess it just wasnt meant to last"". But it kept happening, I started noticing that all the frineds that i had made were just dissapering without a trace. I would call them and ask them to hang out or to go play some games or something and i would always hear the same answer, "" im busy"". After asking them a couple of times I had gotten the message, it was done. 2020 and 2021 were terible years i said, but 2022 has been even worse and were not even halfway through the year. Ive lost my job that i had worked at for 5 years, where i also had a lot of issues that im not gonna get into cause i dont feel like writing a whole novel. My parents also lost their jobs, and since we are still living in Australia with a working Visa we were running the risk of getting kicked out of the country, thought that situations seems to have calmed down a bit though. Since i lost my job all the friends that I had from work have just distanced away from me and i was barely seeing them, and now its been 1 month since last i heard from them and my best Friend witch i have know for almost 6 years now is giving the ""im busy"" line. 

I dont blame any of my friends for being ""busy"" they have their lives too, i understand that. But I feel like I have been there for them when they need me, i wasnt a saint who saved their lives obviously but listened and tried to help in the best way that i knew, and now im feeling down but i feel like no one cares, ive tried talking to some of them about it but they just didnt care, i guess for them it was over and they had better things to do.

ive tried to accept this but i just cant, when im not working in my new job where i dont know anyone yet, im at home feeling like shit. I realize that there are people out there dealing with a lot more serious stuff than what im feeling right now, but i cant help but feel like i deseve more, im at the kowest i have ever been and no gives a damn, my parents love me of course, but this isnt something that i could just easily talk to them about. 

Over the years, where i feel like i have lost so much, i started feeling and acting like i dont give a damn, making myself look strong and dependable in front of others and i guess thats where thongs started to go wrong, ive tried to change myself many times to seem more presentable to other people so i can seem more aporachable, but its only short lived, i guess after a while the cravks in shell tha i encased myself in start to show and people see for how weak and anatractive i am. So in the end they always leave. Losing my best friend has definitly got to be the point at which i cracked, i felt like i had someone i could trust with my worries and would understand me, i had been there for him multiple times as he was talking about his frustrations and listened, paied attention, but lately it was feeling like when it was my time to talk he just didnt care and  would chane the subject to be about him. Im not the best person alive, i feel jealous at times and hate like any other person, but i am still human, however i cant understand how and why people just end up leaving me, if it werent for my parents i would truly be alone, and for that i am thankful, but i am going to be greedy and say that i want more, in fact i want things to go back to how they used to be, but i guess thats just useful thinking.

I guess thats about it, this is already super long, longer than anything i turned in for a school assignement, and I dont want to bore you guys with the story of someone youre probably never going to meet. No ones probably going to read this long ass essay length sob story, but i needed to vent my frunstrattions somewhere. I am also sorry for the people who read this mess, i just wrote stuff as i was going but yeah thats about it.

Went out for drinks on Tuesday night with the fellow students in my faculty. There aren't that many of us so we are quite a tight group of friends. There's 8 of us and 3 (including me are guys).

I ended up sitting with one of the female students and we got chatting a fair bit, just banter nothing serious. She's in a relationship if that proves anything. Regardless, it made me feel this horrible pit in my stomach like ""god I'm 25 and never even gelled with a guy like this"". She kept up with my awkward and nerdy sense of humour and when the night drew to a close she insisted on getting the bus back to our flat (we live near each other on campus) and we ended up taking a fair bit more on the bus ride back.

This sounds really pathetic but it just made me realise how much I crave companionship, it isn't even romantic, just gelling with someone's personality and sense of humour. She made a few playful jabs at my PhD and kept nudging me which again didn't help like jesus am I this sad?

1664,tzxzbd,FewConfusion778,"!tw: emotional abuse , bdsm(?) , toxicity, mental issues??? !

plz don't comment trying to be moral or anything, i've never emotionally abused anyone without their consent (because i don't enjoy it if it's not consensual). this is just a vent of a unique issue, and yes i am a bad person to most people, i know it and i try to work on some things that i do (though not all)

keep in mind i'm a sadist who seeks out masochists, and i am no angel

no one loves me like i love them, like i used to be really psychotic about breakups with a select few close to my heart (creating accounts after getting blocked, paragraphs, crazy toxic behavior) altho i've chilled a bit since i haven't been letting anyone get close recently, as to not trigger those behaviors (cuz i hate them as much as anyone would, to be completely honest)

i tried to work on myself to get better, and to be less toxic, which kind of worked in one of my past relationships (which ended due to them pretending they enjoyed it, and i hate it when  people lie about this stuff, as i don't really want to hurt them in a way they don't enjoy it), but i realized that limiting myself is not something i want to do, and instead i wanted to explore my toxicity with someone who would be able to reciprocate it in a way where they enjoyed it as much as i did

i've just been feeling incredibly down recently way more than any time in my life, because of my difficult behavior. i thought i found someone, but it ended due to them being way too busy (i think attention is the best gift, and it was just right person wrong times). it's just so hard to find someone who likes my kind of behavior (although it's not like it's impossible, i think i'm just going to try harder). it doesn't help that i probably have an undiagnosed mental illness, cuz i don't think this behavior is normal (i'm definitely a sadist, or maybe a sadomasochist, but many of my behavior is symptoms for a mental illness i researched)

I‚Äôm 20M and I was born in Bronx NY. I moved to FL at the age of 3 because my parents didn‚Äôt want my siblings and I to witness the things they did as kids in the area. I lived in Florida for about 16 years and I only knew the inside of a home. My parents were overprotective and denied me freedom/privacy of any kind. I was always bullied in school (not physically) and mostly silent. I was eventually placed in homeschooling. For the most part, the only hobbies that were pretty much forced upon me were games and tv. I severely lacked social ability so I never really knew what to talk about. Please don‚Äôt misunderstand me. I‚Äôve had friends back in school, but they all left after they discovered social media and people who follow trends. Dec 18 2019, I moved back to the Bronx and I‚Äôve finally gotten a grip on how to explain myself a bit better with people, but the problem is that they never stay because I‚Äôm kinda weird to them since I don‚Äôt use up to date slang like ‚ÄúNo cap‚Äù. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôll ever do as I am my own person and will never hop on a bandwagon to impress or be apart of a crowd. I‚Äôm not saying people who follow trends are bad people, but everyone I meet is so quick at attempting to snatch me out of my comfort zone to make me act like them. It‚Äôs like being yourself these days is illegal or something. I remember there used to be a larger variety of people when I was little, but it almost feels like people are afraid of their former selves because they understand it‚Äôs not likely to be accepted today. I need a starting point and am looking for someone around my age who is as lonely and as hurt as I am. I‚Äôm looking for someone who is healing and willing to be healed. I‚Äôm not a bad person and I love to give. I‚Äôm always ready to help as long as I‚Äôm not being taken advantage of. I‚Äôm very thoughtful when it comes to gifts (just not good at wrapping them) if I know enough about you. I‚Äôm always willing to listen and can be a very consistent friend. I just need someone that I can help so I can feel useful. As of now I feel stuck and have no desire to move forward until I meet someone who has interest in caring.

I've tried to talk to them, asked them go invite me, they always say they will but they never do. I'm tired, i feel lonely, left alone, forgotten, like no one even cares about me being here.

1762,u080eg,Bree_The_Weirdo,"I'm currently 18 years old and my now ex boyfriend of 3 years was suppose to be going to boot camp for the Marines. We talked about getting married after he gets back and everything just changed. I really freaking loved that boy and he loved me too. He cried in my arms scared he was going to lose me, scared I would fall out of love with him while he was gone. But that was never going to be the case. I wasn't controlling or a flat out b****.  Nearly 2 months ago he told me he felt numb, he felt nothing towards me or our relationship, so me not wanting to lose what we had I suggested that we take a break so he can collect his thoughts/feelings. There was no more 'I love yous' no more sweet unexpected kisses or hugs, the love was just gone. Eventually a little while into our break he ended it. I was devastated and my heart felt like it shattered. I talked to him for closure to see why things weren't working out and all he said was good things about me and our relationship, he said he doesn't know why he went numb but he was angry at himself for it because he knew he loved me. He said that after us he was done dating. Not even a week after we broke up he starts dating a girl he would regularly hang out with. I'm happy that he feels something, that he is happy but I hate what he did, I hate her. She knew we were together for 3 years, he talked to her after me and him broke up, then she asked him out a few days afterwards. I don't know what upsets me more the fact that she went and asked him out after he went to her for comfort? Or the fact that he said yes to her? To me it feels like she preyed on his guilt or am I just jealous? I talked to him sense and he's made it clear that he ""loves her"" and that he will  block my number bc I in rage said some unnecessary things about the new girl. He was my only support system for I don't have any friends. He's made it clear not to bother him and if I so much as try to plead to him I'm going to get blocked. I haven't been to school for nearly a week due to my anxiety and a increase of suicidal thoughts. On Friday he texted me to see if I was okay, I told him I don't want to talk to him or see him anymore all he said was okay. I love him, I really freaking do but he hurt me and I'm done trying to prove, trying to plead to him to start over. It hurts more than I can put to words but at the end of the day I feel stupid crying over a boy who obviously didn't feel the same. I'm sorry for the long rant and poorly written blob, it's hard to proofread when your eyes are watery lol

1764,u083je,onamonapiaa,"I kinda had friends for the first part of elementary school. By 4th grade my autism was too obvious and I started getting bullied. I then made a best friend and had a couple acquaintances through 8th grade but everyone went to different high schools so I basically never saw them again.    

I went to a small private high school that was known for having a lot of bullying and cliques. My parents knew this and even though my autism diagnosis said I needed an IEP to help with social skills, they only yelled at me when I begged to leave. I wasn't openly bullied (although the second day freshman year I overhead about half of my grade making fun of me behind my back). But nobody talked ot me. I kind of inserted myself into a group of people my first two years but they didn't like me and in junior year I just kinda stopped talking to them and they never talked to me again. I didn't have any social hobbies. I treid joining clubs but they were all focused on school spirit and stuff and nobody talked to me in them either lol. Sometimes people would pity me and invite me places but then they would never talk to me again after them even when I tried. Taht even happened when the principal asked some kids to sit with me at lunch one d ay.    

My only hope was college.... and by that point, it was too obvious. I was too far behind socially. I joined so many clubs and I didn't know how to talk to people. It just stressed me out. I don't know how to have any conversations. I don't know how to relate to people. And it exhausts me to try. People misunderstand everything I say and then get mad at me.     

There are only two ways for me to get social interaction: online and creepy men. online is fine but it's just not enough, idk. And then when they meet me IRL they're so weirded out they never talk to me again. Men always fall in love with me, idk why, and I used to not let it get past friendship (they'd eventually just cut me off because they said it was too painful to talk to me). Now I just let them do whatever because I want the social interaction more than i care about them touching me all the time. I've started to resent them so much. I know this makes me a bad person to lead them on but eventually they'll get sick of me and trash me like everyone else. Right now it's one guy who is too embarrassed to have me around his other friends and is going to go off to get a normal job while I'm going to crash and burn.            

I'm so far behind in social skills and life in general that I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to handle getting a job. I can't take care of myself in any other way either and I'm going to be stuck living with my parents forever.     

One of my biggest hobbies is learning languages in the hope that I can move somehwere else, start over and finally make friends, but considering I couldn't handle moving out for college, that's never going to happen.

Like at this point, it's so much less stress to not have any social interaction. I'd rather just sit at home alone so I never embarrass myself again. But I crave it so bad. How do I stop craving it and putting myself in these bad situations?",2022-04-10 02:26:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1507404257,5,/r/lonely/comments/u083je/how_do_i_accept_that_ill_always_be_alone/,,0,2,How do I accept that I'll always be alone?

1822,u0djdq,Inevitable_Hope6331,"After the death of a parent in my early 20s  I crashed pretty hard. I have spent the last few years rebuilding my life in the wake of the poor decisions and mistakes that I made afterward. Things are much better now but I am absolutely behind the remaining friends I have and people in my age group as far as social and economic status is concerned.

I dated pretty regularly throughout my teens and into my mid-twenties but that came from a lot of organic social interaction. I don't have that anymore. The remaining friends I regularly converse with either have much more successful careers/social lives than I do or have started families.

When I was younger striking up conversations in class, at bars, or parties was incredibly easy. That isn't really an option anymore; at my age the only option is to date online or find a club to join and the years of isolation have made me quite anti-social in those respects.

In the last 6 months I have spent time with (excluding care of a handicapped parent) two other people. One an ex and the other a friend from high school. I have seen both of them once in that amount of time.

It's without question that I need to keep working on myself to become a person that brings something truly positive to relationships with others. It is a bummer having to go through such a difficult span of personal growth alone.

My biggest fear is that by the time I am worth dating again i'll have become so detached from other people that any connections I make will be superficial at best. The gulf I feel between myself and the people around me when engaging at the grocery store or at work is growing at a rate that makes me very uncomfortable. It seems like I am on the path to becoming the hermit in the woods alone with his dog.

Does anyone else feel this way or have you seen it happen to other people? Advice is welcomed.

So a little bit about me, I'm 25 and a guy who has been in a solid 4-5 year relationship where I pretty much gave my life to, literally, gave her all my attention, love and time to which made me unaware that I was losing everyone around me. It was a long distance relationship but I made it work by travelling constantly to see them.. things seemed perfect in person, I couldn't have asked for a better relationship, we seemed in love... but as soon as things turned back to 'online' she was different. Without going into too much detail, she cheated multiple times, argued with my friends, didn't like me having friends who were girls but I still allowed her to have friends with guys even though the flirting got to me a bit (as I gained trust issues). We ended things eventually, and I know now that I was wrong to be in that relationship after all that but now I feel like it's changed me. I feel alone, which makes me think of the good times I had with her where I didn't have this empty feeling, that I want that again and miss her. I think what my mind is trying to tell me is that it's not the person I miss, but the things we did together and if I got that with someone else then I could feel whole again. I'm quite a stable person (which may be a surprise from this thread) but when it's nights like these where I'm alone with my thoughts I can get a bit down and instead of seeking friends, I just drown myself in my thoughts.

I have pretty bad social anxiety, i really can't handle more than 2 people at the same time, even then, it's hard for me.  I've consulted a psychologist for almost 6 months now and it doesn't feel like that took me somewhere. Rly the only thing I can talk about is how shit I feel, and when socializing I feel like an empty husk.",2022-04-10 23:01:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597414702,4,/r/lonely/comments/u0tf3k/how_do_i_make_loneliness_more_bearable/,,0,2,How do I make loneliness more bearable?

The only friend who somehow found out about my sexuality talked about me with my whole group of friends behind my back. A few of them just blocked me and my best friend here has been ignoring me since 4 days. He ran out of excuses yesterday, so he just said ""I have somewhere to be, sorry.""

I do not want to confront them, but this is taking a huge toll on me. I haven't stepped out of my room since 3 days and just submerged myself into reddit like a fool trying to find that magical solution to suddenly find a new group of bosom buddies.

I am being too dramatic maybe, but never felt this broken before. Also, I am not an American POC so I have no protection against racist attitudes and no audacity to demand inclusion. I am an international leaving US in 2024.

being genuinely kind &amp; a caring person has gotten me nowhere in life which is weird and heartbreaking because i really care about the people i love and consider friends but i guess it doesn‚Äôt matter, nothing is reciprocated back to me. i spend most of my time alone and even when i‚Äôm around friends i still feel very much alone most of the time. 

suicide is not something i would ever consider but sometimes i just wish i never existed. i didn‚Äôt ask to be created so it‚Äôs not fair that i have to be alive when my life sucks so much. if you‚Äôre not good at something, for instance sports or video games, you can just quit and not do it anymore. that‚Äôs how i feel about life. i‚Äôm clearly not good at it, i‚Äôm not playing it right, so it would be nice if i could just cease to exist. if i ever die i know my parents/family would be sad that‚Äôs why it sucks that i have to be alive. 

my life is so lonely, i have nothing to look forward to. yes i have a good job and make good money but all that means nothing if i‚Äôm not happy. i wish i knew how to be happy while being by myself but i don‚Äôt. i need to be surrounded by love in order to feel happy. i wish there was someway i could change that. maybe i‚Äôm just a boring &amp; unadventurous person idk. i didn‚Äôt choose to be this way tho. i didn‚Äôt choose to be shy, short, to not have a beard (which is weird cause all my cousins do), to have acne. i have no control over any of these things. also i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôm never ever ever gonna be in a serious relationship. i‚Äôm way to insecure. how can i expect someone to love me when i don‚Äôt even love myself. i always thought id be married at 26/27 but that will never happen. i‚Äôm gonna be 24 this year and i‚Äôve never been in a serious relationship. at this age it‚Äôs probably too late to learn how to be in a relationship unless i find someone in the same boat as me. i don‚Äôt see that happening.

1968,u0zii2,Poeticpolitics85,"I sat in the car knowing there was no human presence to greet me with a hug or kiss, I walked into a shell of a house that is void of love, I cook only for myself, I eat a slow cooked dinner while watching a movie where only my laughter resonates off the silent walls. It stormed the other night and there was hail but I was alone in a pit of a lonely hell. 

A wind blows against the trees as I lay alone in this house, only the haunting creaks accompany my thoughts of a love I'll probably not again experience. I miss hearing the orchestral heart beat of another human, I miss feeling the warm embrace of passion, this loneliness is as if I'm climbing Everest without any gear and I'm on my last breath. 

There's a muse out there that my poetry calls to but here I am, alone in an empty house. Today I got a Facebook notification, a bunch in fact but not a single message or text

I feel down today, honestly I been down for a long time. I want to have someone that understand me truly, It doesn‚Äôt a friend, a girlfriend, a teacher, a parent, I just want someone that I can talk to when I feel so fkn unhappy, I have friends, parents but no one can except me the way I am. I just need shoulder to cry on, someone to tell me everything is going to be okay, someone to understand me, someone to be honest with without them judging me. I can‚Äôt talk to my parents about things I‚Äôm going though, because instead of helping me they will punish me and make things worse. It‚Äôs fkn hard when going though bad times and only having yourself to talk to. I never had someone ask me what‚Äôs going on with me. I never had someone say to me they be there if I need to talk. I just want someone to be honest with. It‚Äôs fkn hard to keep all this shit to myself.

2078,u1gzym,Here-Now01,"I (29m) have never been in a relationship not once in my life. The reason being primarily due to depression, anxiety(especially social), and OCD since childhood, as well as ptsd/childhood trauma. It took me until I was about 21 to learn how to manage it enough to just be able to get out of the house and do basic things in life.

I know I have good qualities: I‚Äôm generally smart, I‚Äôm genuinely honest, I‚Äôm someone who would absolutely not cheat no matter what and I am very deep when it comes to thoughts and feelings and intellect. Also, other than being 5‚Äô5‚Äù I‚Äôm reasonably attractive looks wise.  I take care of myself and eat healthy. I have a decent job now and earned a certificate for the field I‚Äôm in. I have good work ethic and I‚Äôm willing to consistently put in effort to get what I want and need. 

It‚Äôs incredibly disheartening because If it wasn‚Äôt for these mental issues I have, I honestly think I would actually be a great partner. I want someone who I really love and I would really be willing to put in effort for that person. But with these issues still haunting me, I just don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôve always been willing to see the positive in life, but it‚Äôs getting more difficult each day. I‚Äôll be honest, I feel a bit resentful. I know it‚Äôs not useful to be resentful, but I can‚Äôt help it. I don‚Äôt want to play the victim and I‚Äôm completely willing to take responsibility for my life. But being abused as a child and being born with severe mental illness is just fucking bullshit. I‚Äôm very suicidal at this point. I feel like I‚Äôm being punished even though I‚Äôve tried my best to better myself.

But I just don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible for me. I don‚Äôt know how or where to find anybody. I‚Äôve tried online dating and I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs for me, I get people to chat with me, but it never goes further. I don‚Äôt want to have a negative attitude, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs ever going to happen for me. I just seriously don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

Most recently she ignored me for a week. We were supposed to see a movie a few days before but she canceled with the same excuse of her ‚Äúnot feeling well‚Äù and ‚Äútoo busy with school work‚Äù but she went to an arcade that night after telling me these things. She acts like she cares about me but I don‚Äôt think she does. I told her I had Covid a day later and not once did she check up on me, while if she ever tells me she‚Äôs not feeling well I make sure she‚Äôs doing ok. So she messaged me back after not reply to any of my messages for a week and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been kinda Mia I was partying this weekend a bit‚Äù. That‚Äôs the lame ass excuse she gave me. Of course I knew she went clubbing but she doesn‚Äôt do it during the day, only the late hours at night. Of course I understand people get busy and not responding to me for a day or 2 I don‚Äôt care but she‚Äôs on her phone 24/7, I mean this girl is addicted to her phone.

I am officially terrified of dating and being alone at the same time. Dating and relationships are hard as it is why do you also have to be so rude about everything. I also think I am terrified of rejections by people that I might not wanna ever try to date again.

I am intimidated by women and still would like to be with one. And this is worst part. Women think I play mind games with them but in honesty I am just always kind and warm to them and still get vicious mind games in return.

Is this what dating has turned out to? People don't even wanna date you for you. People wanna date you so that they would be considered something else than they are. I don't understand this. I fucking just wanna die. This is too much for me.",2022-04-11 22:59:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647406285,3,/r/lonely/comments/u1k67o/is_being_alone_a_permanent_thing/,,0,2,Is being alone a permanent thing?

Recently i have these feeling i never felt bevore or really really rare almost everyday since im at home because my physical health is declining because of my job that gets harder and harder and im more stressed about (thats another story) i get this feeling that i reached the end im stuck that there is no posible good outcome for me or atleast that i have a day weeks or more without struggling.

Im now worked over 10 years in the same job and never done something else besides working eat sleep. Never had a Girlfriend in my life, only have one friend that is in the other side of the country so only voice or text massages and yeah idk i cant express the feelings in words but its just the feeling that im so stuck for a so long time and never had what i consider as a good thing happening that im really really close to just give up. I just wanna have a day with a mind not constantly thinking about anyting what is in the future or what not i just want some peace. But i guess that it that is normal and a thing everyone is struggling with, day by day.

I give everyting everyday for so long im always try to be positive when i go out for my work and stuff always im always kind to anyone because its ofc normal but i always think its not enough work i put in and that im the problem im never connection with someone besides some short smalltalk.

I thought fixing my weight (lost over 50Kg and was very obese in my school days until my aduldhood) is gonna fix my problems with socializing and anxiety and  me putting me out there.

I never thought that im here writing this but idk today i just wanted to get this a bit out of my head and write about it that is someting ive never done before.

2116,u1l9wq,Invisibleman021183,"I know, it's stupid and obviously she's just being nice. It's her job to help me feel better. She said the nicest things to me today during an episode where I was having major anxiety. One of the problems is that since I don't have any IRL friends and she's the only person I talk to IRL, her compliments mean way more to me than she thinks they mean. Why do I do this to myself? This is how pathetic I am. I've reached a new low. Actually having a crush on a professional. I always knew any professional who talks to me is only doing it because they are paid to. Something about her is causing my defenses to drop. She has a ton of empathy and that's something I'm not used to. I have met empathetic people online but when someone looks at you in the eyes and says I care about you, then compliments you, it's different. I know having a crush is stupid and I've insulted myself for it. I say, you know she probably has a long term bf that is attractive, and is everything I'm not. This is how bad it is for me. You will say, you are obviously crazy and I will agree. All it's going to do is hurt when it obviously doesn't happen. Maybe this is a way I'm punishing myself. Have a crush on someone I know I have no chance with. It's a good way to cause pain deep inside me. Have you ever done this? Have you had a crush on someone you obviously shouldn't have due to being in a professional relationship like a therapist or even as simple as the cashier who makes you feel better at the store. I have reached a new low that people could only speculate exists. I think this is another example of being lonely causing me to develop feelings because someone is just being nice.

I would go through spells where I had very few friends, was single, and had no support system, and those times were hell... But I should be very happy right now.

I have a partner of almost 3 years, and they are my rock and the most important person in my life.

Ive been in this situation so often recently, having nobody around and resorting to alcohol or drugs just to feel something, yet I have so many people I could talk to or be around... But they never ask to... Yes, I see my partner frequently enough, but everyone else at my school, people who have told me to my face they consider me a very good friend and like being around me, never invite me to hang out. I would ask, but that feels desperate, and I would offer to host but my housemates are slobs and would rat us out for any rule-breaking which is just a pain in the ass to deal with. The few times I've been invited to hang out were so fun and I want to have friends and be sociable, but it feels like even though I'm surrounded by amazing and kind people who say they care, they don't care enough to want to see me when they aren't incidentally seeing me (class, clubs, etc.)

I keep analyzing everything I do to figure it out and adjusting so that the ""next time"" will be better. But even that doesn't work. Especially in group settings where it somehow ends up being them vs me. Why don't they ever listen? Even apologizing doesn't work. Like what? Even the most quiet person somehow gets along while I am trying to be interesting as possible so that people will be with me. I don't want to me lonely. It feels suffocating like every piece of my body is slowly sinking. My suicidal tendencies have been getting worse too. The only thing that kept me going to begin with was those small socializing moments. But even that is slowly disappearing. Why do I keep waking up? Why can't I just die in my sleep? I started having huge urges to bite myself now. Ofc, not enough to leave bloody marks  cuz then people will notice. But enough for it to hurt a lot. Idk anymore. I just don't want to be lonely. I just want to find that one friend group that I can enjoy being around, that I don't need to worry about feeling judged ,that I can speak my mind out and not hide behind a fake persona I created. I just want people to reach out for me for once. I still remember this one time when I was walking around(obviously not feeling great), this person pulled my hand and asked "" are u okay?"" Pretty pathetic to just remember that but that just touched me. I obviously said everything was alright and moved on. I keep realizing the more u start talking about your problems, the more people distance themselves. But at the same time, u can$/ be high achieving either cuz then u are ""flexing"". I just want to be a normal person who can interact with people, not too popular but have their own group. This is  just a quick vent before I get back to work.

2205,u1tfo1,Calchexas,"I've been holding things in because I have no one I want to bother with this outpouring of pathetic sadness about a girl who left me 7 years ago tat I can't over for whatever reason.

I think about her constantly. I want her to come back and when I fantasize about it I can be happy for a moment. Then the image of her with her new guy pops in my head and I get even more depressed.

I've tried talking to her and she blocks me. I wonder why she left. What's so terrible about me? Everyone else leaves, and there are a few people who will talk to me if I initiate. But I'm so alone and I never thought it would have been her.

All the discussions over marriage, and kids. I can understand I wasn't doing what I suppose too. And it's not her responsibility to push me and make me do the correct thing. But I thought if she had really loved me she would have told me what I needed to do to make it work. But I was wrong. I could have done anything with her by my side. And while I keep trying, it's so much more difficult.

I just think of how I messed up the most important and happiest thing I've ever had in my life and just say ""Fuck."" I keep hoping the past years have been nothing more than some crazy hallucination and I'll wake up with her. I know how crazy that sounds, but all I have is fantasies of her.

One day she'll get married and I don't know how I'll handle that. I wonder why she hasn't already. I thought I knew want before, but this is almost unbearable. I wanna have a drink, I wanna do some of that stupid stuff I did in high school. I won't, but I need to find some way of dealing with all this crap. I'm just trying to outrun the depressing thoughts.

What else is there in this world? I love her, and I just want to talk to her. But, I'm nothing. That's all I'll ever be.

2212,u1u5n8,DevinC1200,"What is a fate more terrible;

To die, cold and alone in the abyss, with no one around to even witness your finality

Or to live in that same abyss, just as cold, just as alone, for all eternity, and find no merciful end?

I think I know which I would choose





I watch a lot of videos on YouTube about people dying while exploring caves, especially underwater cave exploring. It's so dangerous and I wonder why they do it. Even experienced divers can just as easily lose their life over something simple and stupid when they are deep under the earth and water. Sometimes people diving together all get killed because of one person's mistake, and the selfish actions they take in their desperation to survive. It makes me think it must be such a terrible way to die. Then I think that it must be a far worse way to live.

 Sometimes I wonder if I'm trapped in a deep dark cave all alone myself. Sometimes it feels that way. In fact, pretty much all the time. I've been a victim of people's selfishness in ways I would have never imagined when I was young and innocent. I think, as a rule, most of us are victims of others' selfishness. I guess some of us just have it worse or better, and some of us can handle it better. I don't know if I have it bad or if I just have a bad way of handling it- either way, I have become so depressed lately that I struggle to find even the smallest motivation to want to live. My only consistent motivations are fear, and a morbid curiosity to see what might happen, if I just take one more day for myself. And they aren't very good motivations to live by. But even that has begun to lose my interest; I find myself staring into the dark abyss, and wondering if I should dive in, and if I should ever even hope to get back out again- I wonder if I would even be able to remember which way is up again, even if I wanted to come back out again. The only thing that I'm really sure of is that I don't want anyone else to drown because of me. I wonder if it's worth the struggle, the risk that others take at my expense to keep me afloat, when I'm not even sure I don't want to just sink to the very bottom, anyway.



So what do you think?

Would you rather live alone?

When I went to school, I never met any girls because girls don't want a guy who's getting ass kickings all the time. I was autistic and weird. An easy target for bullies. I never got the feeling of being wanted by touch. As kids, you are hugged by your parents, or even your siblings. My sibling hated me. If I touched her, I would get an ass kicking. I got ass kickings anyway because she wanted to be an only child and she resented me for being born. I never had someone to hug or as an adult, cuddle with. I thought touch starvation was only from being an adult but the more I think about it, the more I realize, it's been happening since I was a little kid. Touch starvation is rarely talked about and only on forums such as this one. Now it makes sense. I crave touch because I've never had it. My therapist has qualities that are uncommon for most people, and that's why I have such a crush. Have any of you been touch starved since being a kid? You never got the attention other people got.

My several comorbid mental disorders make me act out, and not just a little bit. I disgust myself with the things I do and say. 

But is that really an excuse to never talk to me on your own accord? When my friends say time and time again that they forgive me and still love me despite it all, but never show that, what does that really say? If they just told me I'm a terrible crazy psycho then that's fine. The fear of abandonment would set in and I'd have a blurry few days where I type up angry rants in my notes app but then I'd be able to start to let go. 

I have already made so much progress, I slipped up recently and directed one of my episodes at someone else and I haven't been able to sleep right since. The guilt is overwhelming. I try so hard to express it in a healthy way, to express all the bad stuff in my mind to a brick wall, somewhere it wouldn't hurt anyone, but I still feel as if I always do.

Maybe it isn't my fault, but I think it feels better if it is. If I did something, then it's logical. But, if I just lost novelty or people got fed up with dealing with me, are annoyed at my autism, are annoyed by my humor, are annoyed because I don't do drugs or drink alcohol and see me as boring... Any of those things would be worse. Because then the problem isn't something inside of me, then the problem IS me.

I tried online ways of making friends, but it seems every single person stops replying after a while, or it's people who have no desire to engage in a conversation, only to respond to the things I say. It's exhausting to try so hard and to get nothing in return.",2022-04-12 16:28:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595426047,3,/r/lonely/comments/u233nw/what_is_wrong_with_me/,,0,2,What is wrong with me?

2262,u24x8j,EmotionalSupportBun,"Hi. My friend posted on Reddit in r/KindVoice seeking a kind listener. Her self-esteem was low, and I was not available to chat with her, due to class.

Prior to this, she was in a week long relationship that ended badly. The other party distanced themselves while assuring her they were still interested, then after mentioning their own trauma with being deleted off of friends lists, proceeded to delete her off of theirs. My friend mentioned that she was traumatized by the deletion in her post on r/KindVoice.

A person who responded to her post said they could relate to what happened to her and assured her that her feelings were valid. They added her as a friend, exchanged a handful of messages, and then deleted her. When she confronted them about it, they blamed her for not respecting boundaries.

My friend types a lot, but she reads my messages carefully, even double-backing to make sure my question from a few minutes ago was addressed. I‚Äôve never had to ask her to be quiet, simply because she never crossed my boundaries.

It‚Äôs inevitable though ‚Äî that the other person and I have different boundaries. But my friend is not a mind reader.

The person who reached out to her and said sweet things, only to delete her in the end, did not even hint at boundaries being crossed. They deleted her without a word, after she sent three short messages asking if they were still there. ‚ÄúHello? Are you still there? Did I do something wrong?‚Äù was what she asked.

She called them out about the deletion. They accused her of trying to make them feel guilty about it and replied that she should be grateful they messaged with kind words in the first place.

I'm currently 19 yrs old (still pretty young ig) and I don't have a gf nor do I have any friends that are girls.

I've actually shared this with a friend of mine (not regarding the asmr thing cus its kinda sad) but i know for a fact that he couldn't care less.

So once i stopped being the first one to message them, they never hmu for months, but i guess I'm going off track.

2276,u27vx2,jodie_somewhere18,"Hey, i am just gonna use this sub reddit like my notes app for today and write a diary entry. 

TW: social anxiety, self harm, toxic relationship 

In 2020, i met a girl and i fell head over heals in love with her. At that time, i was already having huge problems with my self worth and i had problems with self harm. But I still hung out with ppl and texted my best friend and all and i genuinely had a normal social life. I trusted my friends. 
The girl - let‚Äôs call her Malou - and i got together just after a few months of talking. We had a really intimate relationship and i loved it. She showered me in love basically, she wrote me letters and gave me presents and texted me all the time and i absolutely felt so great and loved.

It was foolish and childish, but we always fantasized about getting married together and living together in the future. She wrote little stories about us as a married couple and all. I had high hopes. 

But that ended quickly after just two months of dating. Something changed but she didn‚Äôt talk about it. I always asked her to tell me why she was so sad, why she ignored my texts for days, why she was so distant so suddenly. She didn‚Äôt want to touch me during the daytime anymore, just have sex at night (i felt awful, like she was annoyed by me and only wanted to have sex so i would stop asking her questions). This went on for 6 months. Everyday, i asked myself what i did for her to suddenly act like this. I was at the absolute lowest, i cried everyday, i had panic attacks, i didn‚Äôt went outside for days, i was struck by fear every hour of everyday. My best friend seemed to be better friends with my gf and with me. I talked to my best friend abt my thoughts and how i was feeling but she didn‚Äôt care. She shrugged it off. I stopped talking to her - she never texted me until today. There was no goodbye nothing. 
My gf broke up with me last year, may 2021. I was destroyed, i felt betrayed, used and so lonely. My whole life revolved around her and ik that that‚Äôs not her fault, but she never talked to me why she changed so drastically. I asked her whether she still loved me for months on end and i got an angry ‚ÄúStop saying i font love you!‚Äù.

She broke up over text and said ‚Äúi lost fellings‚Äù 
This rlly felt like a joke. 

Fast forward to today - i have 0 friends and absolutely no trust in anyone and no self worth whatsoever. The relationship was toxic and i always blamed myself for everything. I thought i was the reason for her behaviour. 
After the relationship ended, i went to see therapist for the social anxiety. I had a great few months with him, i felt at home and that i could trust him. But one day - he cut me off. He said that this was the last session, i did not know that.   

The insurance prescribed me another 60 more sessions and i was told i had depression episodes and social anxiety. I did not feel ready at all but he said he could not help me anymore and that i was ‚Äútoo far gone‚Äù. I cried that day, a lot. I cannot trust anyone anymore, i cannot talk to anyone, i feel so so so alone. I want to feel like someone loves me, but i am too scared of being thrown away again. I always think it is my fault that people leave. 

Maybe someone has had similar experiences,if so, you‚Äôre not alone. I feel you &lt;3",2022-04-12 19:56:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627586486,4,/r/lonely/comments/u27vx2/trust_issues_and_self_worth/,,1,2,Trust issues and self worth

Ive just recently tried to reach out and socialise and its flew back in my face 

So i work in a factory and usually dont socialise with people much, i had to take a step back to care for my wife so really just go to work in body and not so much in spirit, i go in do my job then go home.

Anyway we have alot of agency workers who come and go, this worker (F35) had been working there for some weeks, i never spoke to her or made any effort to talk to her, our paths didnt really cross and i dont make any effort to speak to people.

However last week she was put on the production line i was on, again i kinda avoided conversation and eventually she kinda made an effort to start conversation, we talked alot, the next day she was put on the same line as me again and we pretty much spoke all day, the next day she was placed somewhere else but made an effort to try and talk to me again and seemed genuinly happy to see me.

sooooooo.............. i care for my wife whos really sick, i told her this and we talked about it alot, i get really lonely most times and she was the first person in a long time that i actually spoke about all the stuff in my life and it lifted my spirits, i could really use a friend and we seemed to get on quite well so i sent her a friend request on facebook

She accepted so i messaged her just generally ""hey"" and if she was working etc just normal convo stuff

went into work today and although i seen her i didnt really speak to her but our paths didnt really cross and like i said i usually dont make any effort

i was messaging someone else and seen that she wasnt available to message anymore, searched for her profile on another account and it was live meaning she blocked me but i cant for the life of me understand why..................

2308,u2bpwk,Just-Eddie-481516234,"Hello, reddit! Late 30s, single American male here.

I've worked with lots of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals throughout my life. It's been unanimous that my loneliness is attributable to the family divorce when I was seven-years-old; birth order (I'm the ignored middle child, between two sisters); my susceptibility to anxiety and depression; and my sensitive temperament.

Then a couple years ago, another doctor put my history into a larger bucket: ""PTSD"" from childhood trauma. I said to her: if anyone in my family could overhear what she said, they would say: ""that's all made up, it's just a lie. He's exaggerating. Everyone else in the family did/does just fine. What's he have to complain about? Get over it!""

I'm not necessarily struggling with family boundaries, finding coping strategies, etc. I get along with my family, even if I don't feel intimately close to any of them. And I've had other valuable ""chosen families"" in my life. 

But, for example, I just got an invite to an upcoming family gathering. I turned it down, because this particular get-together will be too emotionally triggering for me. But I'm too scared to tell them that.

So in that sense, being the ""identified patient"" feels like a permanent burden. It will always be a curse, not a secret gift. The hurt can get *better* but it can't permanently go away, right?

2313,u2dcor,depressedandpositive,"This is my first time using reddit so I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this or if I said anything wrong.
Also I apologize in advance for my bad writing.

First, I want to say that this message I more like a testimony than anything else, I don't expect any particular response, I guess it's really just a way for me to vent.
To give some context, I think I've been feeling like that for a few years now (I'm in my 20s btw), probably even before highschool. I don't really have any friends left, maybe one or two on social media but I don't really believe in online friendship (I really don't trust people on the internet). 
I'll be clear, I know I'm the one with a problem here, not the others. I guess we could call that introspection, but basically I know that I have a hard time trusting people: I will always have this feeling of being a bother, that people don't really want me around, that everything I say might get misunderstood, etc... and when I'm in that mindset, nothing can convince me I'm wrong... Even when I'm the one who know it's wrong. This was the main cause for me loosing most of my friends before finishing highschool.
On top of that, I know I can be a quite needy when it comes to friendship: when I say that I mean that I'm always the one engaging the conversation, caring about the other, etc... and well, people usually don't return the favor (From what I've seen it's pretty common feeling for some people with the same problem). I know that, well, they have their life and that they probably don't have the time to chat with everyone but still I have this feeling of unimportance. Again I'll be clear, I don't crave for dozen of friends or popularity and I hate drawing attention (I hate the idea of posting this here for example), but having the impression that no one actually cares about me is a bit painful and this thought can make me really depressed, I'd still like to have at least one close friend.
Recently, I tried to talk with people in the chat of a small twitch channel I liked (this might sound stupid but this was a first for me, and I precise that I'm not so much of an introvert, I'm just really shy but I like talking casually with people), and at first it was nice, I even began to send in the chat kind messages because... well even a few kind words can make the difference (clearly something underrated today). Again I want to make a precision: I didn't do that to draw any attention, I just want to give people a bit of kindness and positivity, nothing more, nothing less.
But after a while when I tried talking to them again, people just started ignoring me. So being the idiot that I am I tried to find a non-existent reason like ''Did I do something wrong?'' etc... to the point where I even think that my messages were actually the cause of me being ignored which might be the case but is also less than improbable when I think about it. All that to say that yet again, after trying to make some effort, I feel everything I do doesn't matter, that anyway people will never appreciate a person like me etc...
I know that I'm not the only one feeling like this (that's why I'm here) and that my case is not the ''worst''. But I don't really know how to end this, so I'll try to finish in a more positive manner:
Even after all that, I still want to be better and to try to ''fight'' those thoughts that I have and to trust people a bit more, so I won't feel lonely anymore. And I also believe that all of you can also succeed. Remember that you're not alone, there are people who feel the same way as you do and there will always be people who will be there to help and/or support you if you ever need to.
And finally, learn to appreciate yourself, and take good care of you and people around you.

I‚Äôm mostly alone now and I got so used to it and it‚Äôs sad because I don‚Äôt know how to make friends anymore. I had problems with my ex - girlfriend‚Äôs friends, they would talk behind my back. Just a bunch of BS. I just truly miss senior year because I had a lot of friends but obviously it‚Äôs high school you know? College wasn‚Äôt great for me tho 

Before I had outside school friends that were literally my fkin bros. We all hung out a lot ughh the night was young man. We‚Äôd go to the mall every weekend and universal, messing with the ladies haha get their numbers and stuff it was truly the best time of my life. From 2013-2016 were the best years, after that my life went to shit üòî but I blame myself for it I got into drugs and was a dumb idiot doing stupid shit :/ 

Anyone else relate? How to make new friends? I want to be me again. Been running a lot recently, losing weight, got out of my fkin rut. Can‚Äôt wait to get fit again, I‚Äôm also taking Zoloft for my anxiety and depression. Results do come after a month or so of taking it. Used to smoke weed a lot and that made me break relationships, weed definitely made my life shittier and created most of my anxiety üòü but I don‚Äôt smoke anymore. Sometimes I find myself get the craving and I have to be very careful because I start getting addicted. Running really helps to replace that, I run twice a week to feel good.

2325,u2ehjx,tewkooljodie,"Since 13 years old I have not only felt alone, but actually been alone. I remember getting bullied so bad , I acted up so I can change schools to get away from people ( it didn't work). I use to buy video games and they became addictive, and I would only buy single player games cause I never had no one to play with. This went on for years! And when I would would try to get out of my mind and ways. People would immediately put me back in my place and remind me why I'm alone. I never had much guy friends nor girlfriends so it's easy to get attached when your not use to having someone ( a feeling of being valued, or wanted to be around). I use to think getting money would make shot different, it made it worse... I would doing things cause money bought attention, and I wanted that feeling of basic human connection....

Just not long ago I met a chick we had a very short fling, but I got attached cause I didn't have anyone to give me that feeling of appreciation, care,  empathy. And now it hurts 10x more cause I know she moved on but I have yet. I have went out to try and make friends, but people don't seem to want to be friends. Alot of the people i THOUGHT WAS MY friends don't even call or check up on me like I do with them.. it hurts alot. 

Or the time I turned off my phone for 6 months and when I turned it back on all I had was missed bill payments and spam notifications. It made me realize no point in having a phone. 

I'll never forget when this one white lady said to me "" are you really that nice?"" And it had me down like is nice suppose to have an appearance?

I'm in really dark place and it brings back trauma from my childhood cause this is how it was. Alone üòî 

I've gone out many time to network and chat up with people in nyc, but I guess no one gives a fuck unless your someone..

If your reading this I understand... its a hard struggle and battle.. and it kills me cause it's like no one wants to take a chance to get to know me! It's like I'm a high risk individual or something. It's one of the reasons why I always go out my way to be nice to people cause there are people like me who have NO OnE there's no LOVE,EMPATHY, SINCERITY, NO BASIC HUMAN CONNECTION..

Out of those three messages, only one message was a happy birthday wish and it was for my mom. Then I posted on my Snapchat story that it was my birthday and probably got around 4 to 5 more messages. I've been trapped in a hotel room for the past 2 weeks and have had minimal contact with people because I just transferred working locations. Within those two weeks of only received 15 to 20 messages and they were emails. I was hoping that I would meet new people today and hang out for my birthday but I've been stuck in this hotel room all day. The reason why I'm in this hotel room is because I'm trying to find a house and I had scheduled an appointment on my birthday just to get out of this hotel but the plans fell through. I did leave the hotel once today but that was just for me to go outside because it was a nice day. I typically feel like I'm a pretty popular dude, but today I took a major blow to myself esteem. I usually don't post much on this forum. I just use it to boost people's confidence and to show love words needed. But now I'm hoping that people will show love to me.

Hello, Im in college and just recently discovering myself and who I really am, and dealing with my mental health. Sincerely I feel so much better than my suicidal self, but I really do believe that by being peoples friends I take their life force, there is no one I have been friends with that has any need to be my friend anymore, I am just so apologetic as a friend, I don‚Äôt know how any platonic relationship or non-platonic relationship should go. It seems as though I genuinely hurt people by spending time with them, I make them uncomfortable and always end up enjoying myself when im alone better. I have decided to not make any friends at school (I already don‚Äôt have any), because I truly want everyone else to be happy and I know that that can only happen if Im not in the picture. I think it‚Äôs a fair sacrifice for others to be happy. Also, I love being alone, I love talking to myself, it really feels like I could never be as comfortable with someone else as much as I am with myself.

2341,u2gbyd,weepingseed,"the lore: I have several diagnosed disorders. I‚Äôm a pretty mentally unstable, traumatized &amp; unhinged person, but I do my best. I think that my moral compass is pretty strong, my intentions are pretty much pure gold for the most part. I‚Äôve always actively tried to be a better person, but I get sucked into these pits of molasses. it‚Äôs hard to climb out of, but I do it relentlessly. I come out every single time, but each time I come out, I‚Äôm worse off than the previous time.

social aspect: there are people in this very world who claim to be my friend (2), &amp; my significant other insists that these people are not lying. I do not like being deceived. I treat them as I would treat a friend, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be healthy enough mentally to be able to consider them true friends. it makes me feel like a prick, because I‚Äôve picked up one of them from cancer surgeries before, &amp; they have both assured me that they have no ill intentions for me (before the cancer diagnosis). my skepticism is on the back burner until we get an all clear diagnosis, because I can‚Äôt let my friendship incompetence interfere with chemotherapy appts. (there‚Äôs more important shit afoot to worry about than my sniveling feelings).

romance aspect: my significant other is a true blessing. I could not ask for anyone better to share my life with, &amp; they are so patient with me. I love them with all my soul. I would love to marry them &amp; begin referring to them as my spouse as soon as possible, but I know I am not in a fair enough place mentally, so I will be waiting. we are homeowners &amp; have been together for years, but we will not make anything wedding-official until I get better at the behavioral implications of my disorders.

the result: I have contemplated suicide for many years, &amp; began fantasizing about it when I was seven years old. my psychosis is out of control sometimes. without setting aside the proper amount of finances for therapy, I have been managing on psychiatrist appointments to get medicine alone (which I do feel is primarily working to my mental benefit, but without a daily or weekly beneficial connection I‚Äôm only working with puzzle pieces here).

thoughts: I think that part of my problem falls into the more social aspect. I can‚Äôt trust people socially due to friend related trauma, even if two people claim to be my friend. I want to be able to go out &amp; experience life alongside true friends, or even have someone to look forward to talking with on a daily level via internet. I don‚Äôt think I have many things in common with most people, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm particularly fun, but I do make an effort to be engaging &amp; positive at the correct times.

corrective actions to take: I would like to take better care of myself on a physical &amp; mental level, take care of my space more, &amp; pray more. I would like to learn how to trust the people who call me a friend, find a therapy program that works well with tight finances, &amp; maybe gain more open ears.

At this point ur whole general mood change ur developing like this happiness and this pleasuring enjoyment feeling but keep in mind it‚Äôs all coming from the person ur inlove with or attached to or like etc

So this person is making you feel like this every single day the feeling feels extremely good‚Ä¶ and even when there not talking to you for a couple days that ‚Äúhappy‚Äù feeling is still there cuz you know there gonna talk to you sooner or later

Then one day they break up with you or ghost you or lose interest in you and they never talk to you again and now ur back to square one‚Ä¶

I've been having a hard time trying to make friends online, it probably stems from my anxiety of trying to meet new people and not trying not to embarrass myself. Every time I look through the friendship subreddits, I get a feeling of dread and I just give up. I don't want to put myself out either since I don't think I could match what a person is looking for in a friendship and essentially waste their time. I'm a downer, socially inept, text like a werido, and a boring person that doesn't even have much matching interests with most people. I rather not try to bring someone down with me. And yet because of that I've just been alone, scared of even trying to talk to people. Maybe I'm just not in the right place to even be talking to people but trying to better myself as a person alone is tough. I know I have a lot to work on, with self-esteem, social skills and just being generally most interesting and happy, I don't oppose to talking to new people, it's just I feel so inadequate, and I don't want to put in time that I just destroy good relationships in the end.

2359,u2jn4f,homeboi264,"So I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for a few months now which have been helping a lot but I‚Äôve just been feeling unfulfilled recently, like I‚Äôm longing for something that doesn‚Äôt exist. I feel like it might be touch starvation or something of the nature because I‚Äôve been hugging my pillow to kinda fill the void, but the effects are beginning to wear off. 
It‚Äôs been a struggle to fully get over my ex. It‚Äôs been several months so I would‚Äôve expected to move on by now but there‚Äôs something from the relationship that I can‚Äôt seem to detach myself from. It‚Äôs not that I miss her, I just miss the feeling I had around her, like someone actually liked me for me. 
It‚Äôs also the simple gestures I miss most like hand holding and how she would hold my arm and lean up against my side while sitting at a table. This made me indescribably happy because this is the first time a girl has ever been somewhat intimate with me. The reason she even left in the first place was because of my depression and self harm which she didn‚Äôt know how to deal with, or so I‚Äôve been told by a few friends. 
Looking back, I was also kinda clingy and relied on her too heavily for my happiness which I suspect drove her away.
I would also be a coward and rarely reciprocate her physical affection despite how much I wanted to. I just couldn‚Äôt get myself to do it because initiating that contact made me uncomfortable and I would always make things awkward and felt self conscious. This might tie into my fear of vulnerability. I‚Äôm afraid of showing people how I truly feel to avoid being taken advantage of.
I would wake up every morning happy that I had her and I‚Äôm just chasing that feeling again. So in a nutshell, I just want to feel comfortable with showing love to someone. I‚Äôve been on self-improvement and focusing on myself to become more desirable and further improve my mental health.

2378,u2nggp,weishen_v,"I‚Äôm 20F living in a busy town with a wonderful and active community with plenty of ways to make friends and spend time, but all I do is waste away in my room. I‚Äôve always been a bit of an introvert, but recently, it has gotten so bad I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my life away.

It started out small, talking to less and less people until I was only talking to my core group of friends because I‚Äôd lost a few of my extended family members. Then, I experienced the deaths and rapid declines of both my grandmothers in relatively quick succession as well as a sudden break up with my semi long-term boyfriend. I clammed up entirely after it happened, I stopped going out and slowly stopped talking to all my friends. I only consistently talk with my parents and 1 online friend now.  I mostly fill the days now with school and video games, but it‚Äôs not like I get much human contact on either. I take online classes due to COVID and never talk in game chat anymore due to my crippling fear of people. 

Logically, I know this is a trauma response. I know that I‚Äôm shutting out everyone first so they can‚Äôt hurt me or leave me, but I can‚Äôt stop. The idea of being left again terrifies me so much I genuinely think I‚Äôd lose my mind if I went through it again. 
I also know that most of this suffering is self-imposed, that if I reached out and got help I‚Äôd be given it in a heartbeat, but I just can‚Äôt. Every time I try I always convince myself it‚Äôs stupid, or the fear gets so bad I can‚Äôt even think about sending someone a message saying ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù without cold fear staking me in the chest.

In fact, my fear of forming connections with people is the only thing that has kept me from spiraling into full blown drug addiction because I‚Äôm too scared to go to parties or text my dealer. 

So instead I try and fill the hole with games and assignments, I stare at my phone and scroll through an endless stream of content just so I can drown out my own thoughts. I take my meds every morning and night, go to class and walk my dog like a normal person. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

2397,u2tj98,BushSage23,"A year ago I decided to quit looking for relationships because the cycle of excitement, failure, and sadness was just awful for my mental health.  I told myself that I didn't need love and focused on my work and writing making sure to use every ounce of my time so I didn't have the chance to think about what I don't have.  I felt good, I felt fulfilled, I felt stable.  But now I realize how wrong I was.  I have a friend who keeps talking about how unfulfilled he is and how much he desires a relationship and he keeps talking about how happy all of his friends are and it strikes my heart.  

I know I'm 21 and still have so much time but being surrounded by it and feeling pressure from media to believe that love is the only way to feel truly fulfilled just has its way of convincing me of its urgency.

I don't just want to be strong, I want to be happy, I want to make someone happy and remind them that they're precious every single day.

My mom also hates me. She thinks I‚Äôm a bad influence is the main reason for their problems. 

Because of all this, me and my sister grew up adjusting all our life, watched as our aunts argued with my mom and the bitter rivalry between them.

2412,u2x0sy,grewuponmyown,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this recently but since middle school I‚Äôve never had any solid friendships or memories I‚Äôve made. I remember even then being the outcast and not having any friends. I would have occasions where I would have a friend but they would eventually leave me. I never got invited to anything. I would be so jealous of the people who got along easily.

Then high school happened and I was determined to get over that phase and get new friends. This is the first time I got bullied. It was horrible, it opened the door to depression and I was only 14 at the time. I remember crying every fucking week, I hated school, my grades were so low I‚Äôd never seen me fail so much. Multiple therapy visits, my parents saw a side of me they hated and never accepted my mental illness. They constantly downplayed and denied it. After that I remember a new girl joining our class in the 11th grade, we became good friends only for it to end up in the most unexpected situation that led to more bullying: she was lesbian and she had a crush on me, I had no idea and so the entire school assumed my sexuality and bullied me for it. I stopped making friends‚Ä¶ my grades never improved, but somehow I passed my exams with the lowest grade and got into uni.

Fast forward to a year later from that bullshit I‚Äôm now in college, my friends look down on me in so many ways, think I‚Äôm weird or constantly ignore and bully me. Other people in the class who haven‚Äôt even spoken to me also feel like I‚Äôm the same, never involve me in Conversations and have their own cliques , they pretend to be my friends is the best way I can describe it

i feel like i'm living a 'supporting role' in my own life, or spectating it, and not taking or living. i've never felt a connection with anyone my age. i grew up largely sheltered, moved out of town at a young age, and always struggled to make new friends. but i can't blame that on parenting. i just wish i could go back, and teach myself to be a normal human being. 

yet, now i'm 19, and just feel so out of depth. i turn 20 in a week + it's pure dread. i feel like i've had the world in my hands and dropped it. my life has been a perpetual series of 'until then', 'eventually' and so forth. i'm tired of killing time. 

i try to get out, but seeing people, especially those younger than me - stabs a painful jealousy + yearning for the youth i didn't have. i'll never have friends to laugh and say 'remember then?', it's just all been white noise.

The thing is, I often feel alone but in reality I'm not alone, I have family in my home 24/7, but I must say it isn't the best company some times, I have friends to call and chat when they have the time. The thing that I think is the core of my problem is that I lack a person to open up and talk everyday about anything.  I think that's why I want to find a partner so hard.  


I understand this is a me problem, I could open up with everyone, its just that I don't feel comfortable with anyone for some reason. Telling my parents or friends that I feel sad and frustrated... its just feels awkward to me. Its like all my relationships with people are in a thin line between the superficial and the emotional.  


Not so long ago I could open up to a friend about something that was bordering me for a long time. It feel good at the moment, talking to someone, but after a few days I felt weird thinking that I shared all those feelings.  


I think that if I could open up with everyone and truly be me in every social situation I could fix my situation. I just fear that my friends will see me with another face, or that will start to treat me different. Its an irrational fear of mine because it happened before with some ex friends.

I hadn't seen her since COVID hit. The date itself was fine, we had lunch, and then went to the arcade, and of course we had a long conversation, it all went good. But, after I drove her home and I took off to mine (I live in another city), I realized I didn't feel happy, instead I was... sad, deeply sad. I felt like I suddenly had a void inside of me, an empty feeling, that I couldn't fill with anything. When I got home, all I could do was sit in my bed, in silence, and shed some tears. I felt lonelier than ever before, and it was the saddest I have felt in some time now. 

I just wanted to share this because it's certainly not how I expected to feel after such an awaited moment for me, specially with someone who I love very much",2022-04-14 04:19:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604366553,83,/r/lonely/comments/u38x94/sad_after_a_date_23m/,,0,19,Sad after a date [23M]

I can only distract myself from pain temporarily by having a walk or pursuing my hobby or forcing myself to watch something funny and laugh. 

I‚Äôve tried many times to solve some of my problems, but failed. And problems only keep adding up. Absolutely soul-crushing loneliness is just one of the consequences. 

By loneliness I mean complete social isolation, no friends, no support. My family was very abusive so I don‚Äôt communicate with them either, only bare minimum.

I recently picked up this app called waffle. It seems like its a journal exclusive to people in a specific group and be more closer to them as such. Though this app seems reserved for friend groups, I want to test the boundaries of this and make a group of complete strangers instead. Right now we have 11 participants including me at the moment. Perhaps this evolves into lifelong friendships, new opportunities, who knows. The point is I want to test what could happen with this notion of a group of strangers meeting each other and forced to bond over the next month. 

Rules and Guidelines:
‚Ä¢ Everyday there will be a prompt for us to answer and a minimum amount of post that we have to make. Prompts will be generated by participants.
‚Ä¢ This simulation will last for 30 days and will begin on the 14th 11:59PM, PST. 
‚Ä¢ Participants are required to at least post three times throughout the. day. 3 pictures, 3 journal entries, both can be done together.
‚Ä¢ This will be completely blind, after the simulation is over you can then choose to exchange info and send face pics of yourself.
‚Ä¢ Please keep it SFW and no extremely personal photos via address and stuff. Common sense, yah?
‚Ä¢ You will not use your real name and instead choose code names for yourselves.
‚Ä¢ If you do not participate for more then three days you will be dubbed as quitting and be kicked from the group?

If you wish to participate. Please DM me and you will recieve the invite code to join our diary. This is the last day we are registering people.

My husband and my family just get mad at me if I mention this or say that I'm depressed because I did poorly on an exam. 

I have an anxiety disorder, and not sure if it's related but I have a major issue with freezing under pressure and I have test anxiety where I sometimes completely blank during the exam

I just did poorly on a calculus exam and Ive been crying about it because finals are in 5 days. 

I called my husband, he asked how was the exam, I just said I've been crying, I feel like I didn't do well but we don't know yet and there is still chance to make it. He seemed irritated. I apologized (because he has the attitude that I've disrupted him and caused inconvenience for him) and he said to not apologize to him. 0 comfort. Now he will probably come home and scold me and get mad at me and ignore me.

2550,u3kpy0,Winterlevel,"I just want to be real here.

I feel alone sometimes, but as I have aged I figured that what I truly envy when I see others being together is the the moments I see. I don‚Äôt feel like these moments are true reflection of what I envy. These moments are fleeting and not a true sign of who these people truly really are all the time. I build them up to be consistently like that moment I envy. If i get a chance to see these people interact with each other more. Sometimes that envy fades as I see the flaws. 

Their has also been times when my envy has increased. If I see something deeper in their relationships it grows. It made me realize that I don‚Äôt just want to be with someone. I want that person to be someone I like and I do not mean just as a partner, but as friends as well. 

It always saddens me that I can‚Äôt connect with people easily and thus I feel alone. I more saddened by that thought than I am feeling lonely. I want shared real experiences with people I like to be around. I don‚Äôt see a future where that is possible due to my circumstances.

Yes I know sadness and loneliness can be the same thing. But I feel the loneliness isn‚Äôt there all the time, as I experience good moments even though they are fleeting. My thought is ever present though. 

Hopefully that made sense and people can relate to this in someway.

2551,u3kqpr,Significant_Tap2093,"So I‚Äôve been single for a long long time. I‚Äôve never been good with women or people and that‚Äôs mostly my parents fault. I was never taught how to socialize or flirt or how to be attractive. My dad didn‚Äôt think that was as important as going to work. He didn‚Äôt think boys should be concerned with a social life and we should be focused on work. 

I never got to go to the parties of hang with friends on the weekend. I never learned social skills and never built up any self esteem or confidence. My dad was always quick to anger and violence so I‚Äôve always been a nervous wreck. I‚Äôm afraid of everything and everyone. I spend about 30 minutes every morning puking because I‚Äôm so scared to leave my house or that my parents will need me. 

This is where the problem is. No one is attracted to the guy that‚Äôs so terrified of the world that just leaving the house is a major fear to overcome. No one wants the soft emotionally damaged dude. I got more baggage then an airport on thanksgiving and nothing that is mine.

2556,u3m5rl,DarkCaprious,"Hi! I am a 27M, and I am currently struggling with low-self esteem, insecurity, inadequacy, and loneliness. I'm feeling rather stuck in life and am seeking advice on how to get out of my rut.

About a month ago, someone in the group that I'm a part of asked if people wanted to grab dinner. I and one other person expressed interest. However, at the last minute, the other person bailed, and I was still interested in grabbing dinner with the person who was organizing. However, once the other person bailed, the person organizing decided to cancel, without consulting with me to see if I was still interested. When I wrote in the group chat saying that I was still interested in going, but that I would be okay if he decided to cancel and wanted to go another day, he just left me on read. I did message him personally to confirm that the dinner was indeed being cancelled, and he said that he was only cancelling because he was hoping to get more people to join. It didn't feel like a genuine explanation to me because there have been times when he's gotten food with people in the group one-on-one.

It really hurt and sent the message that I was not interesting or good enough to grab dinner with him one-on-one. This is also someone I really look up to, as he is really knowledgeable about a variety of topics and talks passionately about them whenever the group has a social gathering. I feel as though I can grow as a person and learn a lot from him simply by being around him.

The next day, the group was actually hosting a game night. I attended that as well, and the person who organized the dinner the night before also present. I said ""hi"" to him, but I got a similar vibe from him that night that suggested that he didn't want to have anything to do with me, which completely derailed me. Whether that was a legitimate vibe that I picked up from him or simply me projecting onto him is a little hard for me to tell. However, my experience with that derailed me, and I kind of shut down during the night. I was just missing people wave-length wise. I didn't really get some of the jokes people were making, and people didn't think that the jokes I was trying to make were funny. I just felt like an outsider and clammed up (this isn't intentional; I've found that I have a tendency to withdraw or clam up whenever I feel like I don't belong).

Towards the end of the night, one of the game night attendees remarked on how quiet I was. The host said in a harsh whisper that that's not something people remark on publicly. This made me feel worse, as I was fully aware that I was quiet (I was spiraling, feeling insecure, and no longer felt empowered to open my mouth). Now I was thinking that everybody noticed and probably had their own opinions about my silence (that I was boring, uninteresting, etc.). The person who made the remark about me being quiet said that he wanted to have a one-on-one chat about why I was being quiet (I think he was saying this somewhat jokingly, but I was very interested in talking with him about it). However, at the end, I was helping the host throw out the garbage and unfortunately missed him as he was leaving, and was not able to catch him. I wished I could have opened up to him about why I was so quiet that night, as maybe if he knew, he might have been willing to help me or talk to the group to make sure that I was feeling more included.

Needless to say, the experience with the dinner, and then the game night derailed me and left me in a downward spiral. I am finding that I am just more awkward around people and am having more trouble connecting with people than I used to. I'm a lot quieter and have a harder time being myself, silly, or dorky around people, even around my friends. This is hurting my potential platonic relationships with people, as they are probably growing more and more convinced that I'm a dull person as a I continue to be awkward and quiet around them.

Being in this state isn't ideal, as my housing lease is ending, and I'm currently touring apartments and interviewing with roommate groups. I am finding that I am not connecting with others as well or that I am not meeting them on the same wavelength. There are people who I have interviewed with who I truly feel I would get along and vibe with, but for some reason, we missed each other (wavelength-wise) and didn't truly connect. It's like the connection is there but isn't, if you know what I mean (i.e. if I just took one step to the right, everything would connect in place). Needless to say, I ultimately get strung along or ghosted, which isn't exactly doing wonders for my feeling of self-worth.

I feel that my life is spiraling downwards and that I'm free falling from all the pegs that I've been knocked down with each failed social interaction. It can feel that I'm sinking further the more I try to dig myself out of my current situation. Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, what did you do to get your confidence back so that you could act in a more socially acceptable way and attract others? Any input regarding this would be much appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to reading whatever advice you have to offer!

**\*\*Just for context, on a good day, although I am definitely on the shyer side, I am definitely more sociable around groups of people than I currently am. I love being around people, and settings such as parties or other outgoing people bring out that energy and more sociable side of me. My insecurity has gotten to the point where I'm no longer the same around people, even with my friends of 5+ years\*\***",2022-04-14 17:02:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1464572653,6,/r/lonely/comments/u3m5rl/struggling_with_lowself_esteem_feelings_with/,,0,3,"Struggling with Low-Self Esteem, Feelings with Insecurity, Inadequacy, and Loneliness; In Need of Advice"

2563,u3ncvw,Awkinox,"Recently I transferred from a special education school to a public school by my own choice. Before transferring, I had 3 close friends and a few other regular friends, as it was a pretty small school with a lot of variety. After transferring, I still keep contact with my 3 close friends, but I haven't seen them IRL for a while. In the new school, all of my classmates are the same each period, so they have all accumulated with each other. The problem is, I arrived towards the end of the year, and I'm a senior so I won't have another year to be more familiar to them. I wouldn't mind this, but the thing is, I have no IRL friends. Zero, none. All of my friends are online. My classmates are always laughing and hugging each other all the time. I feel so jealous, but not in an aggressive way. I'm jealous in a way that seeing other people have so many friends and walking outside with their friends and talking on the bus with them, going out to eat with them. It makes me want to cry my eyes out. I nearly cried in class seeing how happy everyone was with their friends. I'm friendly and approachable, I consider myself to be a pretty nice person. Heck, I'm a pushover if anything. I know they aren't used to me, but it just hurts to much seeing everyone IRL have friends and me only having friends online. Even my online friends have IRL friends. I've been getting so lonely as of recent, and it just makes me feel so alone and sad.

2588,u3ruai,Flyaway_5,"Several years ago, I met an older woman in a Zumba class at the gym. I saw her frequently there. She had never spoken to me before, nor I her.

One day I was the one who approached her and walked up to her. I just suddenly approached her out of the blue. It was in between songs while the instructor was choosing the next song. I was standing close to her and I said...

""How are you?""

She said, ""Good.""

I said, ""What is your name?""

She told me her name and didn't ask me for my name.

She said, ""Are you leaving? Or why are you..?"" Then she said, ""Have you been coming?""

I said, ""Yes.""

She said, ""I did not come for four days.""

I said, ""I did not see you the other day.""

She said, ""I'm always late.""

Then I didn't say anything else and I walked away.

What did she think of me? Did this whole conversation creep her out? Was she put off by my random approach? Did she feel like I was watching her or keeping tabs on her since it seemed like I noticed her absence when I never even spoken to her before? What did she mean by asking ""Are you leaving?""

Every time im a new colective, it takes me a lot of time to get to know each other and to start making some friends. Recently i started getting invited to some parties, which sounds great, but for some reason there is not even a single thing to talk about with others. So i always ends up somewhere in the corner checking my stats on Strava or something (My only real hobby is cycling so thats why)

 At one of these ""garherings/parties"" i met one of my old schoolmates from elementary school. Back then i really did not care about her, but when i saw her after all those years i felt like i have fallen in love with her (Or atleast i think. Im extremely unexperienced when it comes to relationships. I have never had gf nor felt something like that to someone else before). She is incredible, and in some ways really similar to me. She even asked me to go out with her a couple of times. But thats it. Nothing more. (I feel like she was bored or something). I have never told her what she means for me. I think she got a boyfriend. All of this made me feel even worse.

Why do i enjoy doing things that others hate? Why am i so boring? Why am i so quiet even though i dont want to? Why am i the most average person out there? Will she one day be mine?

I was like a topper as a kid and  in high school, good in sports, a bit better than average looking, middle class, a little shy but still friendly and playing, enjoying with everyone, even talking to girls was simple. But some things/incidents (sort of betrayals) happen throughout high school and also my best friend moved to another city. I was getting distant from everyone little by little. I realize that The people who I thought were my friends they were just with me when they need something and don‚Äôt bother to talk with me when i am not needed, some were even jealous of me. I was too naive as a kid, and all of this suddenly hit me and i got introverted and distant from everyone. 

I didn‚Äôt even had a phone until i was 16, so i had no way to get in touch with my best friend, I cried for the first time and was very sad cause we were like brothers. I never got the chance to talk to him again and never had best friend after that with whom i can share my feelings.

My interest got different from others and at some point i was shut in, and now it became a habit. It‚Äôs not like i hate it or something- it‚Äôs better to be alone than with fakes, i like drawing, reading, sports, peace and nature. But sometimes i feel alone and want someone to share my thoughts and feelings but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to do it cause i had did this in past and people just made fun on my back, I don‚Äôt talk much so people think of me as dumb and naive.

2645,u3zbqy,Fuck_ing_Throwaway,"I'm sad today but that's okay. I've been doing better my friends. I'm working more than I ever have in my life to be better. It's a struggle but I'm earning more money. This year I will see a therapist or psychologist. I will receive the help I've wanted for so long. I'm trying hard to love myself and it's been going better. I genuinely can finally stand to be proud of myself in all that I've done. All the hurt I've fought to be here where I am. 

I still struggle with the drink but I'm getting there. I'm drunk right now. I'm here to yell into the void and wax poetic when I feel pain heavy in my heart and have no where to go.

I've recently finally accepted and have become proud I'm a bisexual woman. I'm planning on coming out to my homophobic mother. I'm ready for the rejection. It's on her not on me if she cannot accept me. I could pretend to be straight and never tell her but I'm done lying to myself. I refuse to lie about myself to anyone anymore. 

I've never felt so loved in my life more than I have in the last couple of months. My partner has been doing a lot for me and I appreciate his efforts. I try to do what I can for him and he always appreciates what I can do. 

I guess it's time to yell about my pain huh? I still hurt. I don't know why. Maybe it's the years of neglect and abuse I've endured as a adolescent. The abandonment that haunts me still. Maybe it's the episodic anxiety attacks that plague me. Maybe it's that I never know peace quiet as well as when I reach the bottom of a bottle and the memory fades. 

I don't have nightmares as often anymore. They're rare. The ones about my abuse in my adolescence. They happen on occasion but I've mostly erased those memories. Tried to anyway. I hardly remembered the face of my step father who was the primary abuser. I can still hear his voice clearly though. I'm forced to endure his company once a year when I see my family in Colorado. He doesn't strike fear in me anymore, just anger and a sort of loathing. 

I don't sob as often alone for no reason. Those are rare, unless I fall into a particularly bad anxiety attack. I get anxiety when I'm left alone to my more negative thoughts for too long or when I feel aimless. I use podcasts at work to keep my wondering thoughts at bay. It works wonders. I try to keep myself busy so I dont feel aimless. Especially since I've been working more.

People yelling at me don't trigger my anxiety anymore, neither does people cleaning without my help. Loud noises also dont trigger me anymore. I don't say sorry for every little thing. I'm not sick anymore. 

I harbor hate for myself still but I also love myself. I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. The work I've put in. This is just a begging. I'm still working to a better me. One I won't loathe casually anymore. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I deeply appreciate it. I hope whoever you are you feel less lonely today. I love each one of you who reads my woes.

I'm such a people pleaser, I change my opinion based on what other people think and change my personality and attitude of what satisfies that person. Whenever I try being myself just remotely a little, people always call me 'weird' and make me feel like shit so I just shut down myself from others. Everyday I cry because I'm so ugly compared to everyone in my school, whenever someone comments about my looks it's always making fun of how ugly I am and even though I laugh it off, I just feel like I want to crawl into a hole and die. I'm too pathetic to stand up for myself, and I always laugh everything off so everyone thinks it's okay. Once I think I made a nice friend, they call me ugly, constantly call me 'weird' and 'different' which actually makes me feel like shit so much. I had a best friend and when I finally felt like we were like soulmates, she gets a boyfriend and new friends and spends more time and looks so much more happier with them than me, and god I get so possessive and jealous. And it's completely my fault- I'm just so terrified of her abandoning me because she's the only one who I felt like she understood ME, and I guess I just became a lot more clingier..which made her avoid me on purpose.

My relationship with my parents are so complicated- sometimes my mom is so nice and loving towards me, but when she gets angry she becomes a whole different person. I always promise myself not to forgive her when she shouts and blames everything on me and make me feel like shit, but I always let everything slide over and over again. My dad always argues about everything with my mom, and there have been times where they made each other cry, I just wish they would divorce but at the same time I don't want my family to grow apart. Me and my twin brother used to be close, now we just don't talk anymore. I have suicidal thoughts a lot of the time which is so stupid because my situation is not honestly that bad compared to the stuff other people go through, and I just can't ever do it. Whenever I'm always at the top of a building, I seriously consider to jump off but I'm too much of a coward to ever do it. I can't imagine the guilt and pain my parents would be in.

She's the most fun person ever and we share a lot in common, i get lost in her eyes when she talks passionately about cars and stuff (we are in an auto-mechanic course). I thought this was nice because after my last experience with love i promised myself to not get into anything serious ever again and all my friends said that was sad and i had to get over that phase, i would randomly just sit there and smile just thinking about her. Being around her made me happier than anything else. This went on for a few days, but something triggered my anxiety and now i cant be around her, i cant talk to her, i cant look at her. When she talks with other guys it breaks my heart, when she has banter with other guys and i cant even talk to her, it kills me. I now realize that i still have baggage and i am not in the condition to be having these feelings for anyone, i dont even know if i will ever be ""normal"" again. She is such a pure soul i would never want to drag her into the mess i am.

2667,u40jf3,Depressed_Immortal,"I grew up in a strict household. Even at the age of 16 I had no social life outside of school. My friends would hang out daily and I would be able to join once every month or two. After high school I wanted out of the house and got accepted into a scholarship abroad. Bear in mind I accepted the scholarship without my parents‚Äô support or approval. 

I made a lot of friendships out there, but none that lasted. I had to transfer out of college to be closer to my parents as their health wasn‚Äôt as good as before. I visit them every couple of weeks now but my old friends no longer care for my presence when I‚Äôm in town anymore. I spend days on end without receiving a message or a call from anybody, even my family. I pity myself and I grow sad every passing day, every passing exam, every long treacherous drive home, every sleepless night. 

I never experienced having someone to talk to daily since I moved out. No one to connect with. No one except for one. Unfortunately it also didn‚Äôt last more than a couple months and it has made me even more aware and self-conscious. This post has been a long time coming. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly falling into depression. The only person that alleviates these feelings is a sibling who is constantly busy, that I barely meet.

2676,u41bbt,Iniminki,"I'm a 19yo girl. I don't have a family, I don't have friends or a boyfriend,I don't go out, I don't get invited to partys, I dont have a social life. I feel dysfunctional.
 I've always had a hard time making friends because of how socially anxious I am, I currently have 2 actual friends, the same Ive had since the first year of high school. It's been 7 years and I haven't made any new friends since. You guessed it, if I can't make friends I can't get a relationship either, I don't have the social capacity to do so I guess.. I know it's not because of my appearance, I think I'm generally considered attractive, and I always try to look my best at any moment because it helps me feel more confident. But while I'm alright in looks I lack in social skills. I feel so incredibly lonely and I know I can only blame myself for it, I wish I was normal, I wish I could be confident when I talk to people, and I wish people would try to get to know me. But they don't, and I don't blame them.  
 I feel like I'm going to waste my youth, while everyone else around me is having fun, going at partys, going out with their friends. Having a relationship. Telling me all those stories about their lives and how cool and interesting it is. I'm sitting in my bed thinking about how pathetic I am because I don't know how to live properly. I know something is wrong with me, I'm currently in the process of getting checked for Asperger's, I have ADHD, severe social anxiety, ptsd, cptsd, hypersensitivity and ocd. And all that mental health trash is what's ruining my life, I just wish I was normal...maybe then I would have a chance. I feel trapped in my own head. I want to be someone else.

What made me write this post. I had planned a night out with my two best friends tomorrow. And I just found out they are at a party with a bunch of friends. And they cancelled our night. One of them started drunk texting me at 2am and telling me how much fun she was having. I couldn't help but be jealous, And now I feel awful.

2679,u41sfg,nullmage,"All I do is sit in my apartment and it's scaring me. I realized it was getting pretty bad when my car and motorcycle battery were both dead from not being used in weeks/months. I recently graduated from college and after a year of job searching I got an offer in a new city in a different state. I was extremely excited at first and I still love my job and bosses but a little bit after moving there, the office went completely work from home again and now I'm realizing I'm basically a nobody. I've been WFH for about 6 months now and I think the isolation is messing with me. My will and drive to do literally anything even work is suffering greatly. And now I've been getting extremely self conscious about how little I leave my place.

Because of world events, and following advice from my parents before they moved back to their home country, I stocked up on everything. So now when when I try to step outside I can't help but think of it as a waste of time/money or pointless, and I have to lie to myself or psych myself up to even leave my front door to just get food from down the street instead of cooking for myself with what I've stocked.

My social life is in shambles. I feel like I completely missed out in college from just studying all the time, having never really partied or made any friends. My only two friends in this state are rarely available to hang out. I love them both but I get the feeling they've both independently pocketed me out of the rest of their social lives, something I feel like has always happened with any of my friends. My other friends out of state when they talk to me I can't help but always feel jealous. Everyone else seems to have lives so when they post online or text I get sad and feel like a creep/weirdo for never having anything going on, and that they're just talking to me out of pity. I feel like normal people live in a completely different world than me and I don't even know what they do in an average day. I tried tinder and dating apps for a while too but I was quickly made aware that it's a completely different experience for someone like me vs my friends so I deleted those before my self esteem dropped even more.

And now I feel like I lost all my motivation to enjoy things. When I try to pursue a hobby or interest I quickly stop trying because I feel like it's a waste. And knowing how much commitment I'd have to put into something before I can even feel remotely proud of my abilities quickly disheartens me.  Even video games feel extremely boring to me these days. It seems like all I do is buy stuff to get bored of it almost immediately. I know I should be going out and trying to go to meetups and bars and the like but as soon as I find something interesting I think myself out of wanting to pursue it.

So yeah, I've turned into a complete shut in and I don't even really know if I can get myself to stop being one anymore. I feel like I've been one my entirely life now and can barely remember anything that happened to me and it's concerning me even more.",2022-04-15 06:31:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1342301885,2,/r/lonely/comments/u41sfg/i_turned_into_a_complete_hermit_and_didnt_even/,,0,5,"I turned into a complete hermit and didn't even realize it, and now I don't even know how to get myself out of it."

Cant connect with others socialize or make friends and every action burns out my energy so quickly. Figured I'd just quit while I'm ahead. Get told my grades are fine and just to finish out the semester but i cant do it. Cant force myself to endure this hell another 4 weeks. I just want to go home. I dont know what to do anymore no one can continue isolated and alone like this and i can't learn to never need others or connect with others I'm fucked absolutely just stuck and theres no way out.

I'm not someone who hasn't had friends, sure, not hoardes but I usually made one or two wherever I went when I was younger. School, extra curriculars, the kids who waited at the same bus stop as me even..

But over time naturally we've moved away, some people changed and I realised that the friendships weren't healthy anymore and like I feel no ill over losing my school and hometown friends because we've all moved away for so long and that's what happens. I just thought I'd have made atleast one new one by now.

My old school classmates the only birthday messages I get and I just dont understand how I've not met one person who I've gotten close enough to wish me a happy birthday since school.

Ive met so many people, I've had so many flatmates and coursemates through uni and so many coworkers even. I've done research  projects where I've worked closely with the same people for years but no matter what I do the friendships always remain superficial.

I'm not even sure if friendship is the word? Acquaintanceship?

I can't call any of them, no-one texts me and when I do initiate its met with confusion as to why, with the presumption it's work related.

I never get invited to any kinds of plans and even the ones I suggest are usually denied unless it's an immediate plan for that lunch hour.

No-one even wants to get a drink after work but they'll be pleasant and joke during the day as if we're friends.

And the second I leave or move or the project ends that's it, as if we hadn't spent the past 3 years working together and having fun, sharing our lunch brakes.

I just want to meet someone who wants to be friends as much as the kids I'd meet at summer camps wanted to when we were kids.
I haven't changed I still want friends - real ones where you go out for coffees or lunches and know each others families and partners.

I'm an only child who was in the care system when I was younger so companionship isn't exactly something I can get an abundance of from family though I do not have a relawoth my parents.

Is it really me? I've spent so long trying to undo the lower self image my teens years left behind but its almost reverting as the realisation sinks in that I haven't met anyone new in the past years that's still in my life now.

I went to a therapist to see whether there may be something underlying affecting my social communication skills or maybe causing me do perceive situations differently and while I'm still working with her she doesn't seem to think my social isolation is to so with my social demeanor 

I just want someone to send me an article because they think I'd find it interesting or just ask if I want to come over for a chat.

2743,u4bny0,WhatsintheBOAAX,"I‚Äôve (27M) been alone for a few years now (no friends or gf, I only see people at work, the grocery store and family birthdays).

At first it was pretty evident that I felt lonely because my mind would come up with an idea to do something with a friend, but this was no longer possible. That ‚Äòhurt‚Äô felt like loneliness. Basically the lack of something I had ‚Äòhurted‚Äô and I thought that was loneliness.

Fast forward 5 years and I don‚Äôt experience that pain no more. This due to several reasons, but here comes the rationale behind this post:

Regularly (approx. 1-2 days a week), I‚Äôll just experience this dread and overall down feeling. I get tired and my head gets heavy and I won‚Äôt get anything done. And nothing really helps. Most often these are days where I don‚Äôt work.

Which makes me wonder if this is due to a lack of social interaction. But.. it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. Like I really don‚Äôt want to see people. I guess at times I want their approval but I really don‚Äôt want to get to know anyone. I don‚Äôt want to do things with them. 

Can anyone relate to this? Can the reason I feel bad at times still be because of loneliness, even though it doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äòfeel‚Äô that way? There‚Äôs nothing else in my life that could explain that dread. Like I‚Äôm content with how I currently live.. but I do want to do something about those days where I just feel like falling rock.",2022-04-15 16:19:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642668715,1,/r/lonely/comments/u4bny0/how_would_you_definedescribe_the_experience_of/,,0,2,How would you define/describe the experience of being lonely?

2745,u4cm66,DemonsDontDream,"I feel like I need to vent this somewhere before I don't know what happens. I've held it all in for so long, I put on a brave face, a smile, act fine. But it still hurts, all of it hurts and I'm tired of pretending nothing gets to me.

My mom thinks I'm someone else and ""loves"" who they perceive me as. And my father has told me twice he loves me even while he continues insulting, ridiculing me and saying the worst kind of things without a second thought or a moment's hesitation.  About my appearance, about my love life and how people will never talk to me.

Yet they ""*love*"" me, they say. I don't believe them, it's a lie. It angers me. How can you say things like that to someone you ""love"" and not expect them to come to resent you? What right do you have to complain about why that person who you mock doesn't want to talk or see your face knowing exactly what follows? What nerve do you have to wave away all the torment, hardship, judgement and cruelty with a hand wave and say ""it's alright because they're family and that's their way of showing it"" I don't need nor want that kind of love, If I could I'd go somewhere far away from all of them with no way to contact me **ever** again. But I can't and it's draining me. I'm sitting alone in my bedroom while my brother who bullied me, physically harmed me and not only never apologized but instead moved on as though nothing happened is happily with his wife and newborn... How... why?... What kind of sick twisted irony is this? It's laughable, it's sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found friends I consider real family and I'm going to hug each of them when next we meet, even still the longing for someone romantically close to feel a sense of belonging and comfort with still eludes me. Dating is difficult, finding people I really have an interest in are rare, but each of them finds or wants someone else so easily. I feel a bit happy for them but It makes me think, maybe my family was right, maybe I will just have to accept being single and alone until the day I finally die. While I'm not happy about that I'm beginning to accept it, I think. I'm not sad I was brushed aside again so easily, but it definitely... doesn't feel good. 

  
""I'll stop trying now."" 

I keep telling myself that and keep trying in spite of that because I don't want to really accept that form of loneliness. But I don't want to bring this up to my friends, it's not something they need to concern themselves with. Each of them are happy, in their own relationships or on their way to them... It's all so tiresome and soul crushing.

2756,u4e7o1,SeriousPuppet,"Here's what I came up with.

In the past, say in the 1910s to the 1980s... the structure of most people's lives involved:

* school
* work
* church
* hobbies
* events (holidays, weddings, birthdays, etc)

There was no social media. There were no video games. And families were bigger.

Now, I'm not religious, but there's no denying that church provides for social interaction. We've become less religious over time, so church as a center of social interaction has declined.

School - at the college level, in the past there was no online learning. So with the increase of that has led to less social interaction (in person at least).

Work - There has been an increase in work-from-home as compared to pre-computer days (ie pre-1980's), hence less social interaction.

Events - these are facilitators of social interaction. Family gathering during Thanksgiving and Christmas, birthdays, weddings, funerals, your kid's or sister's recital/play at school, your sibling's soccer game, the school dance, etc). Have these increased or decreased? I don't know. Certainly during the pandemic they decreased though. An

Hobbies - I'm guessing the main change in hobbies is the introduction of video games and social media which simply did not exist for all of humanity until recently.

Perhaps not any one of these alone will cause loneliness, but if you combine a few of them then it creates a perfect storm for loneliness.

Let's say Johnny is doing school online, and plays video games for fun. How does he get social interaction outside of going out to eat?  Had he grown up in the 60s he would have been forced to be near people - that's just how society worked then. But now you don't have to.

So my advice would be to simply try to do things where you are around people.

Try to work around people, take a class in-person, visit a church/synagogue/temple, join a soccer rec team, volunteer at a homeless shelter, and go to events.

You still might be a bit lonely if you can't find people you connect with. But it will make you less lonely than you are if you are isolated.

I really don't understand what grave mistake I have done to deserve this predicament. I really don't think there is an escape. Why can't we just care about another soul? 

But have you ever thought why we get lonely? 

I dived deep into my mind and I found it to be acceptance, atleast in my case. Everyone does everything in life just to be accepted. Our actions, our thoughts, our desires all have a common origin, common goal, which is acceptance. 

Ever since I was a child, I have done everything just to be accepted, accepted by my parents, accepted by my friends, accepted by my teachers, accepted by the society. Got good grades, was on my best behaviour, was always nice and kind, was always helpful and I thought about others, never hurt another soul for my own selfishness. This has brought me nowhere in life.

We tend to get lonely because we crave companionship which is a form of acceptance. Everyone wants to be accepted by other people and the society itself. Everyone wants attention, especially from the opposite sex. Sex is the purest form of love and love is the highest form of acceptance.

I have tried to reach out to people everywhere, on reddit and IRL as well. How am I supposed to escape from the depths of despair? I fucking hate it. 

How the hell is a person not supposed to look needy or ""desparate"" in this condition?

Maybe I need to accept myself and show a middle finger to this society. At this point I don't even know.",2022-04-15 20:32:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642074546,8,/r/lonely/comments/u4h4ca/why/,,0,3,Why?

2826,u4myf7,Electrify338,"So I have no idea how to explain whats wrong with and this might be a long vent but I really needed to get this out of my chest or I might die because of it.

So there are these 2 girls I met when I was playing league of legends (the irony) with friends and they became a part of the group and we usually play together now which is normal, but then this one day no one was on except one of the girls lets call X and I was like wanna play she accepted and we had a lovely couple of hours then our friends joined later and we had a great couple of games but during one of those games a friend of mine really hates my laugh so she told him that my laugh is beautiful and I was shocked. I've never been given such a compliment by anyone and it kinda messed me up a bit. 

So a couple of days go with the same routine where no one is on but her we play together till everyone shows up and her friend lets call Y is starting to call me a simp for her which we all took as a joke and moved on but slowly I just felt like maybe I like her she has a lovely personality but I dont even know how she looks so I just brushed it off.

By the end of first week we were 5 playing together me, my cousin, a friend of ours , X, and Y. During one of the matches my cousin pisses of Y so much that she rage quits so I dm her for the first time since we played together and try to apologize to her on behalf of my cousin he didnt mean to and yada yada yada. The thing is that apology turned into an 8 hour chat were I got to share some of my adventures I lived in my 20 years of life and it was a lovely chat. By the end of that long chat I felt something I never felt before its like I wanted someone in my life were I could spent ling nights talking to were we share stories I donno whats wrong that feeling has been hunting me since.

The issue is after that she says she hates chatting and I am not that good with talking to girls so I end up accidentally spamming her while trying to open up a convo till one day after a week I just felt like I looked like an idiot and left her be, during this time also X and I havent been playing much due to exams and we said maybe after. Time skip a week after I stopped messaging Y we got back into talking a bit but not like that one time and I started feeling weird like I had butterflies when Im waiting for X to hop on and play together and I cant for the life of me know why. I message Y we have one of those long chats a bit about how im feeling towards X and it kinda helped me look at how stupid I am but didnt resolve the issue in its entirety but helped.

After that chat Y keeps telling me to leave her alone and I do till its night and I feel like I need to talk to someone and she is usually on playing with X and when I ask her if she wants to play she just ignores me or hits me with a no and since X is Y's friend she wont leave her and play with me and I just feel weird where I feel alone even when Im on with my friends it just doesnt feel the same even when playing with my friends is more fun.

Jump to yesterday where we all finally got to play together a large group and we were playing customs and I was with Y and against X and I failed in killing X bcz everyone ganked up on me and Y said he cant kill because you know why and that shit kinda fucked me over hard I donno what is wrong that line made me feel angry. We continued the night as usual played till everyone got off and I felt I had to ask X if she thinks Im simping for her and before that I asked Y if her friend thinks so she said its pretty obvious I kinda spammed her asking what to do I dont wanna look like that to her I dont mean to simp to her just treat it as a stupid crush or something she went to sleep so I went to X and asked her clarified that Im not and she said its ok nothing to worry about and it was over.

Today I tried to apologize about me spamming Y but she told me to stfu and leave her the fuck alone and I just didnt mean to offend or annoy her I was just trying to ask her for advice but I type a lot and fast. I keep tryingto tell her Im sorry and she say just leave me alone or I will block so right now I left her alone and when I saw X was on asked her if she wants to hop on she joins then immediately leaves to join her friend.

I have no idea whats wrong with me I feel like I love chatting with Y but she hates that and I cant seem to find another person and Im crushing X just based on how she talks I need help. Im gonna leave Y for a couple of days before talking to her or should I just leave it forever. Please help.

Without having the same thoughts and curiosity as another person, although you understand what they are saying and you understand how they feel, you will never truly understand that persons mind. This thought caused me to realise that nobody ever will understand truly how I feel because the only way to do so would be to experience it for themselves, but that will never happen. The fact that i am alone forever with thoughts overwhelms and pains me, never being possible to share the main part of me as a person accurately with another. If I had a wish it would be to communicate exacly what my brain wonders. Communication is flawed, these words will simplify and regulate my expression and the lack of shared minds will leave me trapped forever. If I could communicate to another, exacly my thoughts and emotions, allowing them to truly see through my eyes and completely understand everything behind it and even feel it themselves would be the key to life.

In highschool right now and i have at best 2-3 friends. In most classes I sit alone and people actively try to avoid me. Ive been friends with someone in my 7th period, shes legitimately the only reason I havent killed myself yet. everytime i consider hanging myself in my bedroom i think about not being able to see her again. its not romantic or anything, but i really value having someone i can talk to and someone who lets me escape this perpetual loneliness and misery I dwell in. Im scared; ive already lost other friends who just stopped talking to me, im afraid this would happen again. my life is so fucking miserable rn and this person is the only thing holding me from death. i feel so bad man.",2022-04-16 06:35:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623176959,1,/r/lonely/comments/u4rtt0/im_terrified_about_losing_a_friend/,,0,1,Im terrified about losing a friend

I think I decided to watch it because when we were dating, I must have harbored resent towards her judgment. Love-hate, huh?..

Maybe it's helping me desensitize to everything that reminds me of her. No, songs from Heart still hurt. Or, am I just thinking that? Can I differentiate the paths of logic in my mind for longing or a grudge from their associated emotional counterparts? 

I tell myself I feel no hatred towards what happened, but I remember that many days recently, I have told myself that I am filled with hate. Am I? Maybe sometimes, but for what? Why?

This is useful information. I don't need to know everything. I can implement the effects nevertheless into characterization. Hm...

What are you actually reading this for? 

Is my heart finally hardening?.. 

Maybe that sounded a bit too edgy. Maybe my heartache is more from the vacancy than- maybe it depends on the day, but I shut it down when it's not. Ghost. You ghosted me; you are a ghost. You are a ghost in my memories, distorted and faded. Did I know at the very beginning? I blocked that out and told myself ""but this is how I feel right now, so I've got to try!"" It makes sense. If only it stayed that way. The more I'd doubt, the more pain I'd inflict. 

To whom do I owe the meaning of my existence anymore? The answers would be obvious, but I'm selfish, so the answer is no one. No, that's wrong. I just don't know who it is.

2872,u4tsmc,VeryMentallyStable,"I get that I‚Äôm literally making another post here right now, but I guess I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. Feels like beating my head against a wall because I probably need to vent and don‚Äôt have any other outlet, but in doing that, I also wind up making myself feel worse. 

I‚Äôve probably got CPTSD (not officially diagnosed, but my therapist is pretty confident), and it‚Äôs steadily been declining for the past 3 years or so, to the point where I‚Äôm completely fucked. I‚Äôm totally isolated, no friends cause I feel like no one can really know or understand me no matter how hard I try to explain myself, my family is fucked and the only one I still spoke to, my sister, maybe the only person on the planet I actually liked, just died three weeks ago. 3+ years of therapy has only made me feel worse. Medication does nothing at all. Don‚Äôt know what to do.

So because of my isolation, I guess I just make posts to vent or whatever. I dunno what I expect to get outta it, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel better to know other people relate, and there‚Äôs no words that exist that I feel like anyone could say to me that would help either. But I still do it for some fucking reason, and lately I‚Äôve just been deleting my posts after the first few comments roll in because I just realise that either people don‚Äôt understand, or the advice doesn‚Äôt apply because I‚Äôve failed to articulate something properly so I have to try and explain stuff differently (which often gets read as me being defeatist or making excuses) to get people to understand and it just makes me so fucking frustrated and just compounds the isolation so much more, because even after casting the widest net I can, I still feel fundamentally misunderstood and alone.

I just don‚Äôt know what the fuck else to do. As much as I wish I didn‚Äôt, I clearly need some kinda human contact, but I feel like every time I try to find a way to get it, it leaves me feeling so much worse. I feel like the only fucking person on the planet in all ways but physically. I‚Äôm sure the chronic loneliness is heavily contributing to my crippling depression and suicidal thoughts, and overall hopelessness, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any solution for it that doesn‚Äôt make me feel worse than if I didn‚Äôt try at all.

2924,u51ttk,EERMA,"Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring ‚Äì it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn‚Äôt just tiring ‚Äì it is exhausting. Sound familiar? 

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre anti-social!

Not every introvert experiences anxiety, and you don‚Äôt have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so it is common to be an introvert with anxiety.

Here are the key signs you‚Äôre an introvert with anxiety:

¬∑ You‚Äôre more prepared than most others because you‚Äôve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

¬∑ You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

¬∑ You feel you always have to be doing something ‚Äì being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

¬∑ You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

¬∑ You‚Äôre often nervous without showing it ‚Äì many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. 

¬∑ You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

¬∑ You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‚ÄòI need to please everyone‚Äô, ‚ÄòI need everyone to like me to be a worthy person‚Äô.

¬∑ Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you‚Äôre normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

¬∑ You often have trouble sleeping ‚Äì either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early 

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues many therapists help people with.

2933,u53nps,Levi_Pearl,"Hi, just joined this community and this is my first post here. I have always been in denial about my loneliness until now, telling myself that I am fine being alone and that I am just extremely introverted, which I am. However it wasn't until I started college and moved away from my parents house two years ago I realized just how lonely I am. I still travel home every other weekend (which is expensive) just so I can have someone to talk to sometimes. When I come home and talk happily to my parents, I always notice how sore my throat is because I haven't used my voice for so long. 

When I'm in my small student apartment I frequently take the tube down to the city just so I can see people and be among them. I like hearing people talk to each other, what people my age seem interested in and so on, so I at least can keep up a little. Sometimes I sit at a cafe on a busy Saturday just to observe people walk by on the street, just to feel a little involved. I often end up buying tons of unnecessary things because filling my apartments with things I like makes me feel a little less lonely. Sometimes when a cashier or barista is a little extra nice and looks me in the eye and smile I sometimes struggle at holding my tears in because just recieving a little kindness and contact feels so overwhelming. 

People told me that making friends in college was going to be easy, but they forgot to include that most people make friends in college at parties or when drinking, and I do neither of those. I have tried many times to get close to people, but for some reason they get uncomfortable when I tell them I don't drink and go to parties. Now I'm at that age where everyone already seems to have found their friends and grouped up, not wanting to let an outsider in. Or maybe not having the time or patience to get to know another person. I have never went on a date, never had a boyfriend, as I am scared of men. 

Does anyone else here relate to some of these issues?",2022-04-16 18:14:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594146768,6,/r/lonely/comments/u53nps/does_anyone_else_here_go_outside_to_stores/,,0,1,Does anyone else here go outside to stores frequently and end up buying unnecessary things in order for them to replace the hollowness of how lonely you are and just to talk and see people?

Me not realizing why he asked me that, I said ""To eat"", He then said  ""Then eat and get out of here, stop asking questions"".

Then i had a blank stare for 3-4 seconds, I knew if I turned back, it would be more embarrassing, i just smiled through it and just asked some questions about the exam to the other mates(thankfully they spoke) and ate alone on my table.

Time.

This kind isn't that toxic douchebag we think about when we think about narcisists, but is a kind that, since they didn't receive validation of their parents as children, they grew up without a sense of self and without knowing how to relate with the world around them. So, since they don't really know who they are, they tend to be very aware of what others think about them, as well as feel rejected easily and try to be self sufficient. I used to wonder if I could be a narcissist, because I had to spend a lot of time thinking about myself to have this low self esteem, but someone said to me that I couldn't be cause I actually care about others around me.

Bold of you to assume I have friends in the first place, or at least a lot of them. I have maybe one or two good ones, and that's it. The rest don't see me as a friend, or at least treat me like one. Peer would probably be a better word. And even if I did have a lot of friends to go with, they'd all most likely have dates to go with, and I'd be the only loner there.

Last year around end of September I saw a girl at work. We were both working and happened to go to the same office building to drop off some paperwork. So we caught eyes in the waiting room but couldn't speak to each other because she was called to the front to turn in her paperwork first and shortly after that I was called to do mine in a separate area. So we didn't see each other. When I finished my paperwork I left and was walking in the parking lot when her company car was riding in the parking lot about to leave. I saw a guy driving and the girl I saw inside was in the passenger. So I figured they were work partners but maybe they were dating at work, I didn't know. They had the window down so I waved and said excuse me. I was nervous and just blurted out to the guy driving ""is she single?"" it's still kinda cringe to think about how stupid of a question that was. Smh. Maybe I was trying to come off respectful to the driver in case that was his girl/wife but I noticed in the waiting room she had no wedding ring. But still that's not a good way to ask that. So anyways I could tell he kinda felt a certain way, like the vibe I got was he was friend zoned, but he said ""I don't know she's right here, why don't you ask her"" and I smiled and they both laughed. So I looked at her and said ""are you single?"" And she smiled and said ""yes!"" While I asked her name and introduced my self, I passed my phone to her and she put her number in and then they drove off. We exchanged a few text during the day and asked if I could call her later that evening. So she said yes. Later that evening I called to set up a date for the next week and asked what she was doing and, she was like packing, she's moving back across the country back home.....in the morning! She had got a new job and was moving back, she was only my area for college. So I asked like what sense did it make to exchange numbers If she was moving and no plans of coming back to the state I lived in. I can't even remember her response because I was in shock like what the hell kinda situation is that.  I asked if we would ever see each other again or how to make it work and she told me she was not interested in long distance relationships based of a previous one. So I said ok. Well over the next two months maybe every two weeks or I initiated small talk through text, she sent a couple pics when I asked but nothing serious at all. She eventually left me on read one day after i asked how her day went so I just never talked to her again because I changed my mind with double texting after feeling dumb being left on read many times in life. So fast forward I move states to a high tourist area of the country. I've been on a journey just focusing on getting my self settled since moving so no partying, drinking, smoking etc. I'm a loner by many definitions so moving by myself was no big deal, I been through a lot of experiences in life but I have no social circle and no family in the area I moved to. I cut of my only ""friend"" I had who lived in the previous state that I moved from. We spoke on the phone a few times since I moved but that's another story but I can't help it Im just a freaking loner! So anyways about a month being in this new state, I get a new phone and as I'm transferring contacts over I see the girl name and I think of her. Of course being lonely I thought about talking to her. I started to text her but then I thought how desperate, creepy, and how much of a scarcity mindset I have, comes off to her. So I didn't. A few days later, which was Friday afternoon, still lonely of course, I text her. I say ""hey... is this you?"" She replied less than a minute later ""who's this?"" I told her I'm the guy from work that day we met in the other state and not trying to come as creepy but I got a new phone and transferred my contacts over and it would be nice to talk sometime if she didn't mind and that I recently moved to a new state. So an hour goes by and she text back "" haha I'm actually in that state right now"" so my first thought was wow. I text back and say really? That's a crazy coincidence. Then I thought maybe I texted the wrong number and someone was playing a prank by going along with my text. I told her to send a pic to confirm because that's just crazy. She replied the next day, exactly 24 hours after her last text with a actual pic of where she was and it was really her in the area. So I told her ""I would like to see you , when are you leaving?"" She replied "" just did"".... I thought what the hell does that mean, like ""just did"", like left the state, or like in a smart ass way of saying, you just did see me, meaning in this pic I sent u. I just got so frustrated and mad at my lonely life that I haven't even responded. I guess my lonely life led me to thinking it may have been meant to be because I hadn't talk to her since December and the fact she would text me back and even send me a pic.  And just the fact I decided to text her the exact time she was in my area. I thought the universe,  synchronicity, etc and things were lining up but I guess not it really wasn't meant to be.

I used to feel like I always had my shit together. I always knew what I wanted and how to get there. I had great self control and discipline. After turning 18 I made a huge mistake that hurt some feelings and changed my relationship with lots of people. 

I started to question myself as a person since it was unlike me to make mistakes like this. It definitely was a traumatic experience. I‚Äôve been dealing with extreme anxiety since then. It‚Äôs gotten better but I still wake up wanting to scream and also feeling like the world is ending. 

I‚Äôve been arguing with everyone since my mistake. Lately I just feel misunderstood and not heard at all. I feel like I talk too much and I‚Äôm never saying the right things. I feel like this huge burden that no one wants to deal with. I‚Äôve never felt I needed validation from others until now.

It sucks to be talking and feel like nothing ur saying is being received by the other person. I always feel like I say so much and thoroughly express myself. It never feels as though what I‚Äôm saying matters or holds weight in this world. It feels more like no one wants to actually hear me. It hurts of course. It makes me feel really lonely.

Whole thing has me so confused and worn out. Lost my job because of covid and never was able to bounce back, feel like I'm losing myself more and more everyday.

 Feeling traumatized and suicidal. Tried going to the gym but I still feel depressed after and not fulfilled. I'm up all night alone. 

Nothing helps. Video games and movies are boring. YouTube and social media makes me depressed and envious. All I wanna do is eat fast food and cry now.

I have no lisence, barely any female interaction, wasted all my precious best years around losers and now I'm completely isolated day in and day out. I'm no one's first choice unless they want to use me and I can never do right, I make one slip up or speak out and I'm blocked. People take advantage of me and wouldn't care if I was dead. 

My dad was never around and mentally abused me growing up, my parents were always fighting. I'm an only child with no siblings or anyone to turn to. Everyday I wake up and I don't know what to do anymore. Even if someone reached out I don't even know if I could handle it after what I've been going through these last few years (covid made everything worse) these last 8 days have been a nightmare as well. 

I applied for a few low end minimum wage jobs that I'm sure will just make me more suicidal. Everything feels so pointless. Even therapy and getting help.

3056,u5hw5r,Count_Backwerdz,"Hi there! I'm a 32 M from the Midwest. I'm a full-time student and I work as an academic program co-director at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for developing friendships these days. I'm currently at the end of the semester and taking 5 classes ( Just 5 weeks or so before graduation). 

I've lost a number of people in my life after I returned to school because of how busy I am. I certainly understand and encourage everyone to do what makes them healthier and happier even if it means moving on from me. But, I can't deny the fact that I've become increasingly lonely. On top of that, I work in near solitude most of the time. The majority of my friendships seem as though they are unable evolve into anything with much depth. And, I've been too trapped by the weight of everything I've got going on to do much about it. I'm honestly just starved for that human connection.  So, I'm gonna use the little break  while I'm up for some air to hopefully make some friends and for the summer! I'm also open to voice chat as well but there's certainly no expectation. 

 
I'm looking for something, anything  that has a little more to it than the shallow niceties ( but I'm grateful for even these since it's what I've  subsisted lately) I'd like to meet someone that I can not only joke with and have a fun time but maybe share in the heady things with-- talk about and relate on everything from the humdrum of daily life to life's big questions. I'd like to find that one little spark that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. I'd like to find someone that can make a refuge out of our shared company. Someone that will find our conversations to be a secret spot tucked away from the heaviness of solitude. No monsters, just us. 


I enjoy a lot of different interests in reading and discussing. Some of them are psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, biology, ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible. I'm a musician and like to play and write as often as time allows. I also speak an endangered language that has only about 3,000 speakers. It would be great to find some good company.

3062,u5idsd,No-Philosophy9670,"I suffer from anxiety. I try to do things to reduce it 

I go to the gym everyday, I try to go to bed early. I socialise a lot

This week I‚Äôve met an old colleague, yesterday I went out with another old friend and on the day before I met a new girl in the area and we chatted and spent the whole day together

Despite all this socialising why do I still feel so lonely and anxious ? 

I have some tasks to get done which might help. I‚Äôm not super occupied in my job as it‚Äôs a bit slow, and we do work from home. Potentially I need a new busy job . I don‚Äôt love my career, but difficult to be motivated to train for a new one when I‚Äôve got a job with little to do but still get paid well. I also need to maintain a good salary as I want to get a mortgage.

I‚Äôm 28 , female , live with parents and older sister. I do use social media a lot like TikTok , Instagram , Twitter to occupy myself . I listen to music on spotify

I‚Äôve recently started dating apps, and becoming more conscious about how I look. Eg I have fat on my body which I don‚Äôt think will go away and is just a result of aging, I have quite obvious eye bags maybe from lack of sleep due to anxiety. 

I play sports . I play football once a week and socialise with them after. I have one friend I talk to from that group who is probably the closest to a genuine friend I have. 

I don‚Äôt feel I can develop any deeper connections especially living in London. With most friends you will see them maybe once a month. They‚Äôre mostly old colleagues or uni friends.

I guess I‚Äôm less optimistic because I‚Äôm at an age where people will be settling down into marriages and kids

I have never naturally desired a romantic relationship or kids or experienced a romance. I am dating to see if I do eventually feel that way, but struggle to feel attraction / romance and it just feels platonic . I‚Äôve never experienced physical intimacy and am afraid of it. I‚Äôm also scared of meeting abusive men. It‚Äôs difficult to want a relationship when I‚Äôve never experienced one. In terms of physical attraction it‚Äôs very rare, and the men tend to be unsuitable for me (rude, creepy) 

My only goal currently is buy property in London but there‚Äôs no rush. I also don‚Äôt want to live alone in my own flat. I might try to travel but none of my friends are available to travel. I‚Äôm too scared to go alone as I have little experience 

I have had therapy but never found it helpful . It costs so much money so would rather not 

I even organise events to meet new people . People say I socialise so much but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so lonely

I‚Äôm a super open person about my issues. People comment on how open I am.

I guess I still feel like a child while other people my age are looking to settle down, looking for relationships or have kids of their own. I like the idea of having my own family purely because I‚Äôd rarely feel alone.

None of this information is personal enough to know anybody mentioned unless you are one of them.
This is not a personal ad.
I am not suicidal, just in a bad place.

All my life I‚Äôve been a loner (3-5 friends max) and I‚Äôve been fine with that. About a month ago I realized that I‚Äôm terrified of being alone. Every relationship I have is close to fading and I‚Äôm scared.

First up my parents. I already have almost no relationship with my mom other than living in the same house (I‚Äôve tried connecting with her but she makes no effort). My dad and I are really close but because of his hours we see each other maybe 3 hours a day. I‚Äôm also about to move out so that will hurt it.

Next my friends. I pretty much started fresh in September because I cut ties with everyone I knew in late June (bad LSD trip, panicked, plus drama I wasn‚Äôt there for). I started talking to my friend again in September and he introduced me to some new people. 

There‚Äôs 6 of us and we are definitely friends, but without the main friend we don‚Äôt talk much. He‚Äôs moving in with his girlfriend soon so he‚Äôll be less active. Down to 5 (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing at all, I‚Äôm very happy for him, I just still recognize that ONE downside) His girlfriend is also in this group she‚Äôll be less active, down to 4. One of them is shipping out so, for the better part of a year, down to 3. Another member is going to study abroad for a year, down to 2. This guy is kinda cool but we aren‚Äôt close at all (definitely friend of a friend) down to 1. Just ME

Finally, ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a partner. I‚Äôve talked to a few people on dating apps but no one wants what I want. Most only want a hookup, or just to chat, or drugs. Out of the few I‚Äôve talked to, one ghosted me, one was a scam, and one was confused when I said I like her. 

I‚Äôve had a clear image for years of me being happy, with a wife and family. And in that image I‚Äôd still have my friends, at the very least there‚Äôs some overlap. 
Now it feels like any chance of that happening is gone. 

I can‚Äôt find someone who wants this life no matter how hard I try, I barely have a relationship with my parents, and I can feel my friends moving on to better things.

I‚Äôm not ready to be alone. It‚Äôs gotten so bad where if I even see a meme remotely referencing the concept I breakdown. 

I know everything I‚Äôve said about my friends is selfish but it‚Äôs how I feel. There moving in to the next part of their lives while I‚Äôm stuck here, no job, no school, clinging to them as long as I can.

Please don‚Äôt tell me how I ‚Äúneed to grow up‚Äù or I need to ‚Äústop being so selfish‚Äù I  know this already. I hate myself for the situation I‚Äôve put myself in, but I‚Äôm in it and I can‚Äôt get out.

TL;DR I can see every meaningful relationship in my life move on without me and I can‚Äôt catch up.",2022-04-17 09:37:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1571806050,4,/r/lonely/comments/u5jo8i/im_coming_really_close_to_being_alone_and_i_cant/,,0,1,I‚Äôm coming really close to being alone and I can‚Äôt stop it

3081,u5lko0,Hugs_Ahoy,"That felt really good, right? It's been ages since I gave someone a hug that big! Honestly there was a moment in there that I thought for sure we were going to fuse together into some sort of flurry ball of unhinged cuteness haha, that's how good it felt!

Well, since I'm here already... I know we just met, and this might seem crazy, but I would love to get to know you! You know, my train back home only leaves like in a couple hours, and I don't really have anywhere to be or anything to do right now, so what do you say?



Awesome :)

Hey, wanna hear something funny? Well, on my way here, I passed by lots of people who looked that they were just minding their own business, going about their daily lives...And as I passed by each and everyone of them, I thought to myself ""I wonder what that person is REALLY like"". You know, beyond how they look, how the walk, how they talk... Like, inside. What they really think. What they really want. But knowing how most people nowadays have become so desensitized, I think that if I just straight out walked to one of them and asked them that same question, I would either get punched right in the forehead or decimated with a pepper spray haha! So I guess what I'm trying to say is... thank you for not doing either of those things!


There you go! Now that's a smile I would like to put a frame around and hang it at my place so I could look at it every day :)

So I wonder... Is there anything you like doing so much that it just makes you smile just like that? Like, even if it's something seemingly ordinary? Please tell me about it!




You know, I think it's really the smallest things in life that give us some of the happiest moments. Like, see that little bird up there just standing at the top of that tree? When I look at him, I think about how great he must feel being that small, yet being able to have the whole world at his feet... From up there, we must seem like tiny ants to him haha! And really, good for him, I'm totally rooting for him! Just goes to show that if such a little guy can do such an impressive feat, what's our excuse for not being able to follow through with our dreams?

Oh, by the way, what would you say is your lifelong dream?


Wait, that ain't right... Scratch that. Now that we're friends, I feel that I can be honest with you. I don't think ""dreams"" aren't really attainable, because, well, they're just dreams! It's just something that we see and that we want, but can seemingly never get close enough to it to live it. So, I think it would be much better if we just started calling our dreams ""goals"", because I know for one thing goals can be achieved!

So, let me ask it this way... what is your lifelong goal?






I know that sometimes that kind of stuff can truly seem like a dream, out of reach, with life constantly throwing us those obnoxious curveballs... And it's during those times that we usually feel lonely, especially if there's nowhere near us to cheer us up a bit. I know I know, it sucks. I'm no stranger to it. To live in a world so full of people and yet feel completely alone, that's... really painful. Many times more painful than any injury. I hope you don't mind me asking you this... but... what do you feel is going wrong with your life right now?






 
You know... Back there when I was coming this way, I felt like that. Lonely. No wonder, I don't know anyone around here and people on the street just don't seem like they would be very enthusiastic about making small talk with a total stranger. But then I saw you sitting here, and I just had this strange feeling that you were feeling the same way as me. I mean, not exactly due to the same reasons, but just... the way it feels. Though I must admit... I kinda had forgotten about all of that stuff since we started talking, so I'm really happy we met :)


Wow! Look at the time! We were having so much fun that I completely forgot about my train, time has passed so quick! Well, I'm really sorry to run off like this... Tell you what. Here's my profile: it's u/Hugs_Ahoy. Shoot me a message if you want to talk about stuff or just elaborate a bit more on what we just talked about! I know probably my cell connection will be a bit spotty during that long as hell train ride, so maybe I won't get your message right away, but I promise I will do my best to read it and reply as soon as I can! 

So don't be a stranger! See ya :)





OH SNAP WAIT! How could I forget...








We didn't hug goodbye!!! Gotta take one for the ride home!





Ahhh, now that's a lot better! Ok, wish me luck, because I will need to run like hell to catch the train on time!

I have a bad relationship with my family. Abandonment issues and not being understood or believed leaves me in a constant state of loneliness and anxiety. I feel like every time, I have to put effort into relationships, and I throw myself in completely. Which when I think about it now isn‚Äôt at all healthy since it doesn‚Äôt give me room to grow.

I've been by myself since yesterday when my roommate went to go home for Easter. As an introvert, I do relish in my alone time, but it does have its limits. 

I spent most of the time just chilling, but also going around to various online dating apps and sites just so I wouldn't feel a bit less lonely. They feel like an endless void sometimes, yet I keep coming back to them. I look for genuine connections and when I try to start up with conversations with others who also make this claim, I never get responses. Perhaps I'm just too boring? Maybe I'm not presenting myself well enough? I know finding a partner in life isn't always a key to happiness, but the thought of it sounds nice. There are people that I could talk with about this, but I do feel it's just a conversation I've had before and I'd rather not be a burden. 

I know my problems are just miniscule in comparison to others, but I don't think it invalidates my own loneliness, since it's a feeling we all experience.

3106,u5rja2,[deleted],"English is my second lenguage, sorry if theres any mistake. Im 19 y/o and i met this girl in a summer camp, i was 17 y/o and she was 20 y/o. When i was 17 y/o i was diagnosed with depression, I felt that I had a lot of confidence in her and I told her what was happening to me from the first moment, our friendship was good but since 6 months ago i started noticing things i didn't like (at that moment i had only 2 friends). She lives in another city and she did not answer my messages for weeks (Now I'm realizing that this is a sign, but at that time I had practically no friends and she was the only person I had that could be considered a friend), she updated his social networks without answering my messages, i felt her so distant. more than once I offered to go to his city so we could see each other at least before the end of the summer but i had no answer. more than once I asked her what was going on and if she wanted to continue being my friend but her answer was that she was very busy and that she did not have time for social networks (it made her anxious to maintain a cyber relationship with someone). I remember that many times she updates her social networks where she went to a party, got together with other people from her city, whit his new boyfriend, etc. I didn't know what to do at this moment, I wanted to continue maintaining the relationship I had with her because she was my only friend. So, about two months ago I had an episode where I felt very bad and I needed to tell someone what was happening to me and I went to her. I told her that I was feeling very bad emotionally and was having bad thoughts because of my mental illness. I remember his response was: Have you taken your medications this time?. Then the conversation continued for 2 minutes and I received no more answers. It should be noted that I always tried to make the relationship as reciprocal as possible in order to generate some space of trust (I wanted her to feel that if she went through something similar she could tell me the same way). A week ago I thought that I no longer deserved to be ignored and I told her everything I thought, I told her that I thought the relationship was very one-sided, I felt her very distant and finally I told her that I expected some kind of emotional support when I felt bad. I feel like this offended her. she told me: ""you don't know what I felt at that moment, or if I was going through a similar situation"" At that moment it's true that I wasn't thinking about that, but it's because she never told me, I always wrote first, then I began to think that she was right and that maybe it was very selfish to put my problems before hers. Honestly it's sad, I would have liked to be her friend and I told her, I have mixed feelings, she told me in that same message that she appreciated me. sometimes I think that we are just not compatible for a friendship relationship, I find it hard to think of someone lying about their own mental illness thoughts but someone told me that this could be their justification for ""ghosting"" me.",2022-04-17 17:14:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/u5rja2/i_would_like_to_know_your_opinion_about_this/,,0,1,I would like to know your opinion about this

I just couldn't stand the way he was trying to ""revive"" me, while I just fell further and further down. I thought that it will be better for him that way. But what hurt the most was the realization that it really was, in fact, better for him.

I decided to create group for people that are looking for answers, explanations or solutions regarding long term loneliness. Take it as a book club, but without the book. The goal would be understanding our own loneliness better (how we got there, how to get out of it, why have we been struggling with it for a long time) by exchanging experience, knowledge, perspectives on the topic.  People would meet once a week or once every 2 weeks and talk about it constructively. Those that arent comforable speaking are welcome to just listen in or participate in the discussion via text.

Since I have a little bit of practical and academic knowledge on such disscusion/support-ish groups (no cheesy/cringey AA stuff I promise) I would be the one leading/moderating the meetings in the beginning just to keep them balanced in terms of dynamics and include everyone.

3144,u5wh81,EfficientBox759," 

Hi, i will try to be short somewhat and not give all my story, but basically i am in a very bad spot mentally at the moment , thinking back at everything my life was/is and i have no idea how to start fixing it.

I feel like an absolute weirdo, a freak.

So, my entire life except school and stuff i was forced to do i never connected to anyone outside that activity i did, i just went back home and did my own thing, this for 22 years

i had decent relationships with the people that i knew , but i never went out or did anything with them and when i say never basically never. (not as a child either, i was always doing my own thing after school or whatever ) once i did a high school trip and had some fun and that was in a period where i had a girlfriend (met online, 1 year after meeting her we met in person and went well, broke up eventually but that was the only ''real thing'' i had ever going for me with any other human being..) so i suppose i was more outgoing back then. But that's it, i have 0 irl friends and never did bond with anyone, my friends are only in discord and i have ''plenty'' of them since im very loud and out there and seems people like me and i know plenty, but i basically just sit inside all day on my computer and pretend it is all ok, while i actually have nothing else going for me in the real world.

i think it also comes a lot from the fact that i have a problem at my jaw that is not visible unless i eat (malloclusion, i keep my mouth shut in an unnatural position to make my face look normal) , but i also avoided activities that involved it wich can basically be anything therefore i did not do anything . I do think i am attractive if i do not eat so my face looks normal, and i have received overwhelming positive feedback on my pictures, going as far as calling me a gq model, but that did not help at all apparently my disgusting mental health. --- Ah and to elaborate on the girlfriend part, we met only 3 times irl since long distance, she saw me in pictures mostly, irl i made sure to never eat near her. So it went all fine as far as insecurty goes, cannot imagine having had to meet her every day...i probably would have not even tried to get together with her in the first place.

So yeah...no one knows either this , i pretend that i have a life, i think my social skills and the way i speak or behave also are pretty normal if not even above'' average'' whatever that means, so people expect me to be a pretty popular guy or atleast with something going for me... but here i am, alone in my bedroom like almost every other day since i was born. And i have absolutely no idea how to fix this, whenever i think about going out and meeting people, like next year at uni for example, something in my head just tells me: '' what if they ask what you do in your free time ? what if they figure out you have no life, it's not worth it! You will be exposed, don't talk to these people...you will be made fun of.'' So i always avoid everything...its a vicious cycle.

I speak to people casually but never bond or connect, because i am scared the fact that i have no life might come out or they might figure it out , and i keep living like that.... plus the insecurity about my looks from above.

I have no idea what to do anymore, i have been feeling overwhelmingly bad lately,this especially because some pretty girls apparently like me from university, but i am scared shitless to approach them or even dare share anything about myself with them , OR eat near them.

i don't even know what to do to actually meet new people or do other activities, i just always talked to these people and then went on my way when whatever we did in common ended.

Even now i am scared of people that i know online that might read this and figure somehow out it is me, i keep smiling and behaving like i have the best life ever, meanwhile i am miserable half the time, thankfully i am still a very positive person and manage to find the good in my life and that kept me going for all these years... but it's time for a change, i cannot keep going like this.

3161,u5yg8z,[deleted],"Throwaway account since I don't want him to recognise me.

I had only one guy who i considered to be a good friend. He was my best friend who i met online a year ago. Always had trouble making friends in real life since I have been bullied most of the time. All I ever wanted in my life was a friend who atleast cared and try to understand me. After multiple attempts of trying to find someone online, met this guy.

We vibed with each other pretty well. I didn't hesitate to open up about my struggles with him since he was non judgemental. He did tell about all of his struggles. We both met at a time when we weren't doing well in our lives.

While his life seem to have become better. I'm still stuck in the same phase. But I'm happy that he was able to get through all of the shit.

Without a doubt I still consider him to be my best friend but he started moving apart from me. No longer puts any effort in the conversations and it hurts to see all this go apart. My hopes were high with him. But he just finds me uninteresting and uncomfortable to talk about any stuff. 

He made it clear that there is no chance of our friendship getting any better and that it was all a fallacy that things would work out. I feel so heartbroken. Don't know what to do. He doesn't mention any reason as to why our friendship changed but is adamant that this friendship is of no benefit to him.

It's hard for me to accept the fact that he had no interest in me. All I ever wanted was to feel the essence of a true friendship but i guess I'm wrong to believe that people care maintaining a good friendship that isn't all about checking on how it benefits them.

My mind feels disturbed from my current situation. I may have to open up to my parents sometime later about the friendship that once made me happy thinking about it, is all now broken into a million pieces which cannot be fixed.

Don't know whether it's even worth to find a friend anymore. It's exhausting when it doesn't work out inspite of putting all the effort. Idk just feel lost and lonely again and wish someone would be there.",2022-04-17 22:55:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/u5yg8z/friendship_its_all_over/,,0,1,[Friendship] It's All Over

3170,u5zs81,PassiveVoidResident,"I have been coming on and off this subreddit for a good while now and something that I have noticed is there are frequently 2 types of posts being made here;

1. Venting posts - Talking about the horrible things going on in one's life or past.
2. People trying to help by providing 'virtual' hugs and other means of support (like the 'DM me for a chat if you are lonely' posts).

Personally, I deal with a good amount of loneliness in my own life, it sometimes keeps me up at night, or makes me not enjoy things for a few days at a time.

I do not have a problem with those 2 types of posts, and I really appreciate the people trying to help the others. With that said I think that we as a community can do a much better job at helping each other; Some of us here have been experiencing loneliness for very long periods of times, and as someone who has been dealing with it through a majority of my life, it brings me much pain to see others going through the same thing.

Something that I see a lot on here is people usually validating (WITH GOOD INTENTIONS) the negative beliefs and opinions of others, for example posts about people saying how horrible human beings can be, and the replies saying that human beings are sh\*tbags.

I think there is a lot that we as a community can do to not only potentially save lives, and help others, but even share our own experiences to help ease the pains of our fellow human beings. Here are some of my suggestions;

1. When we reply to venting posts, we should do so with the intention of letting the person know that they are not alone by sharing our personal experience with them, suggest coping mechanisms, or give advice on how to overcome their situation.
2. Try to minimize the negative beliefs towards others, since these are most of the time based on subjective experiences.; like saying all psychologists or parents are horrible.
3. Making posts about personal wins and maybe how/why you feel better than usual.

One thing that I am sad to see is the lack of positive posts and the downvoting and silencing of people trying to be helpful. When I was a regular reader on this subreddit during some of my darkest times, it felt like an eco chamber of people saying how horrible life in general is and making me think that perhaps I will be lonely my whole life.",2022-04-18 00:03:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627165154,64,/r/lonely/comments/u5zs81/my_thoughts_on_the_state_of_this_community_and/,,0,25,My thoughts on the state of this community and its users.
3171,u5zxcw,Rudmonton,"I've been alone for all my 21 years. I had a small group of friends in high school but I moved out of town after graduation and had no friends at all for the last 3 years.  I never had a gf, not even a first kiss. I had always watched the world go by like a viewer that couldn't interact. I was always happy and comfortable but I dreamed of the day that things would change.

That day was yesterday. I started a new job two months ago and started talking to a girl there. She started talking to me and giving me more attention then I'd ever had before. A week ago I built up the courage to tell her I liked her and she said she liked me back. Last night we kissed and she fell asleep on my shoulder as we held hands. 

Life is long, as long as we live it something will come it just takes some patience and dreaming. Do whatever small things you can to meet new people as hard as I know it can be. Stay strong friends no matter what situation you are, don't give up whether it takes 15 years, 21 years, 25 or 40. You will have your day.

I've just started my 1st year of uni. It started bad but I made really good friends along the way and recently I've been in the most healthiest and greatest mindsets I have ever been in my life. I have some amazing friends and ones that I'd die for.

But right now, I am in bed, right after Easter at 2 am and not catching an ounce of sleep. And I'm in this subreddit for a long time and I come back here whenever I feel this way. I'm surrounded by people that I know care about me yet I feel so alone. It might be intimacy that I lack but I really doubt it, it might be stress? I'm mostly venting here but I don't really know how to feel. I thought of a question tonight, quite a famous question but one that I couldn't answer, ""If you were to die tomorrow, who is the one person you'd call?"".

Well, there are my parents and my close friends. But I couldn't pick out one specific person that I would really kick myself for not calling. This doesn't mean I don't love the people I know, I do. But I feel like there isn't anyone I can actually go to for these things. There isn't anyone I can communicate with when I'm lonely.

Today I spent my day just chilling, I was calling with a close friend of mine while enjoying some of my hobbies. Today was actually great, I did a lot of things that I love to do. And I did it with family or my friend. But I really don't understand why I still feel like I'm so alone that I'm living for nothing. I really strive towards my goals because of my family and my future. But tonight I've been feeling I'm just on some sort of solo mission.

3195,u623qk,blk_phoenix14,"Just wondering, how do you guys/gals feel when people try to open conversations with you? Do you feel good that someone is paying attention to you? Do you feel anxious and would like to cut it short ASAP?

I'm introverted but I'm trying my best to be a bit more open. One thing I see is that people are more likely to talk with you if you start talking with them, instead of just waiting. That might just be sampling bias, but I know that my behaviour has always contributed to my loneliness and kept me from getting to know a lot of people - so I've been fighting it for a bit.

I deal really badly with 'rejection' (not in a romantic way, just the silence of somebody who's clearly not interested in a conversation) so its been a rocky road.

3200,u635bv,Jealous-Tea4559,"*long post, need to get things out*

I was speaking to a doctor after I had long term covid problems including memory issues (I'm ok now) they wanted me to speak to a psychologist they knew and although nervous I agreed. I internalise alot of my problems and thoughts and sometimes what I say and what I think are two very different things. 

I get the call and the female (may not be relevant, but women are more empathetic) psychologist started talking to me. As it was memory related we talk about the last 10 year's and things that have happened and the more she asked the more she got upset. The tone of her voice at the start of the call was bubbly, but after 10 minutes she was quieter and started to add longer pauses. 

I asked if she was OK and she didn't answer and instead started to ask how I felt. I said truthfully that there are good and bad days, but I learnt long ago to handle pain and rejection. She started to say I must feel negative emotions (I forget what she said exactly) and I said no I felt great and positive after nearly dying to covid.

She began to reassure me and said it was OK to be sad and again I could hear she was sad. I asked her again if she was OK and she said yes and laughed at the irony of a patient asking her if she was OK. That made me laugh, we laughed, and then the call ended with her saying she thought I was amazing.

I'm not someone who receives compliments so I was  smiling ear to ear for hours after, but since then it made me think about how I feel and whether I'm being genuine to myself. I started to think back at different times in my life not just the last 10 years and I'm amazed I'm not worse than I am and i sometimes wonder how I get through each day. 

What we discussed: 2008 was made redundant. Boss lied to me and I lost a big job. In anger I took redundancy and then fell into depression. I had moved back to family home with mum and brother as it was cheaper. Due to a tax mix up at old job I owed tax. The bank was sending letters to old house so I didn't know and the amount owed got larger. 

I'm a big guy so in a way to change my life I decided to get weight loss surgery. Was a band so reversible. Paid ¬£14k and had the surgery then the place I had it done disappeared. I wasn't able to get the band tightened to work and the NHS back then was very anti-fat. ""If you're fat just lose weight"". This didn't help. 

In 2009-2010 I met a girl and it was going well and in 2011 she asked me to move in for her and I did. I found out a month later she had slept with her newly divorced boss a week after I moved in so that was that. I also had just got an interview at her place working for her boss, so hell no to that. 

2012 my step dad died of cancer. I had just started seeing a woman too and at his funeral she kept messaging and calling me to leave to be with her. So buried step dad and broke up with her. 

I also got a job in a call centre and got a friend who had similar interests. He lived near me so we'd hang out after work, go drinking etc. It was a good way to forget women and move on etc.

2013 he was killed by a car that hit the pavement and crashed into him. I wasnt there and I didn't know his family. They didn't tell work when the funeral was so we couldn't attend. 

I had another friend too and we were going to do an IT apprenticeship. We both applied and was to be told if we got it. She got it. I phoned the college as I hadn't heard back and was told I had got it, but they forgot to email me. (Email was to be sent Wednesday I called the following monday). I said it was OK I'll do it, but they had a meeting that Monday with all apprentices and as I wouldn't be there I couldn't do it. They had a meeting with me a few days later to go over some higher level apprenticeships starting soon, but as I didn't meet the requirements the only solution they offered was to reapply for same apprenticeship the following year.

End of 2015 call centre job shut down. The campaign we had was sold to another company. We had the chance to go there to see the centre and the town and the company would take us as we were experienced. Id have to relocate though. Was to be two trips by coach. First trip I stayed behind. We weren't taking calls but we were still open and i was a deputy manager and we still had email work to do. My manager needed me to man the call centre and  I'd go second trip. Second trip didn't happen. Only 3 of us didnt go the 1st time and they didnt want to pay for us. I couldn't afford to travel there so didn't go and took redundancy again. Fortunately I found a better paying job within a few days.

 2016 my uncle died of a heart attack. I didnt like him much, but he died in my house and I found him.

2019 my mum died. Found out she had cancer in November 2018 and died the following February. 

2020 I got covid. Oxygen levels fell to 67% and I had to go into hospita Christmas day. The first night i only remember being told to breathe and to lay on my front, but i couldnt. Then sitting and breathing into a mask looking at a monitor.My lungs were white on x-ray from the scars and I was on oxygen until Jan 1st. I didnt know until I left that when I was told to breath and to when I was sat breathing I had passed out and oxygen went to 40- something % and then went to 67 after they helped me. If it fell to 65% they would have ventilated me and being blunt they didn't think I would make it.

But I did and Jan 3rd I went home. I couldn't talk, think and would be out of breath after a few seconds of moving, but I'm here. My scan in April showed most lung scarring was gone and all that was left was the brain fog/ memory issues. Which brings us to the psychologist. She was happy that I'd be ok and sure enough my memory is back to normal.",2022-04-18 03:01:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617838044,2,/r/lonely/comments/u635bv/psychologist_got_upset_for_me/,,0,1,Psychologist got upset for me

I ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago, stopped cold turkey smoking marijuana (smoking every day for a year but started smoking all day every day a month and a half before I ended up in the hospital) and taking klonapin daily when I was admitted. 

The withdrawals from the both of them suck. Not only that, I just feel so lost and confused in life. I feel like an utter failure due to things that happened over a period of months leading up to when I ended up in the hospital. That‚Äôs why I feel like I do. My confidence is shot, I‚Äôm at a all time low. I‚Äôm only 22 btw.

And a person I opened up to, who I had romantic interest, she, didn‚Äôt say anything to me. We didn‚Äôt have the best experience last time we saw each other, faults on both sides, but I walked out on her basically. 

She was honestly a jerk to me that day. I replay it in my head multiple times, and after everything I had been through, and what I‚Äôm still going through, I am just a shell of myself. I can‚Äôt do much physically activity, I‚Äôm now having to drop my college semester, among the crippling anxiety that I‚Äôm having. It‚Äôs so debilitating, at one point, because of the klonapin, I could have had seizures and I‚Äôm still afraid I can get it. When I go out with friends for too long, I get exhausted, can‚Äôt think straight, anxiety is peaked, and the zaps and twitching come back again. 

I‚Äôm gonna go get help, but, this is a time I really needed somebody by my side. Just to talk to, have a fun time with, but also just to hold them and hug them because I‚Äôm so scared, anxious, lost, and so many emotions. All I wanted was somebody to talk to, but she just stopped communicating with me. And I don‚Äôt know how she feels because she won‚Äôt tell me what‚Äôs on her mind so I just had to stop talking to her.

3225,u66gjo,SaraleeOF,"*Less than human*. This is the only phrase that accurately describes how I feel. There is something wrong with me. I feel an unbridgeable gap between me and other people. Something about me is just off. I don't know if its autism or social anxiety or something else entirely. Whatever it is, I can't think of a time where it hasn't been there.

It's like I'm wearing a person suit but the cracks are starting to show (or have been showing) and it's so obvious to everyone else that I'm not really human. I go through the motions but my performance is uncanny and scares people away. When I talk to them it's as if I'm following a very stilted script. Inevitably, there comes a time where something comes up that is not covered by it and I draw a blank. There's the opportunity for an interesting conversation and eventually a friendship. I want that more than anything, but I have nothing to offer.

Sometimes I can put on an interesting performance. I can exaggerate my idiosyncrasies, play up what little drama there is in my life, or talk about my interests. Sometimes people are receptive, but the cracks show through and any chance at becoming more to them than momentary entertainment is squashed. Alternatively, I can get them to share things about themselves, but as much as people enjoy talking about themselves it doesn't get them to like me. It's not just a lack of social skills. Something in me is empty. When people speak to me, there's nothing in me that speaks back.

Meeting people isn't the hardest part though. I have a few friends. I'm in love with one. They all mean the world to me. Yet all my friendships are one-sided. I initiate everything. For them, I am a second thought‚Äîa periphery name to be invited to the big events but nothing else. They don't come to me for anything. Talking to me is like talking to a very sophisticated machine instead of a person, so there's no reason to confide in me or become close to me. There is nobody for them to be friends with; I am a simulacrum of a person.

Edit: I don't mean to imply that people with autism or social anxiety are less than human. I also probably have both.

3234,u672rn,RetailSlave5408,"significant others, spouses and a large group of friends are things we are force fed from birth to want and are defined as a measure of success or well adjusted-ness but consider these situations. 

Think of all the people in a loveless marriage that was derived by an unplanned pregnancy, where the child 
(Or children are) is reluctantly looked after by two bitter and neglectful parents who come to the realization they‚Äôve taken a path they despise after it‚Äôs too late and too many people are effected as a consequence. Think about how Unequipped some people can be to parenting, then ask yourself if it‚Äôs something we all innately want.

If people look at you as defective for being single or not having any friends, look at marriage statistics and divorce rates and how common it is for adults to be in therapy as a result of their parents. 

What if you have a partner who is a white collar criminal or a degenerate gambler? Or maybe your partner is simply inept and not giving you what you want? Maybe both peoples lives are worse by being in the relationship? No true loner has ever been snuffed by a death cult or lead into a life of crime by being recruited into a gang.

3243,u688r3,heytheerre,"I was with my last girlfriend about 2 and a half years. And now I've been single for just as long. And I'm still not over her. I miss her so much. I texted her too much and she's blocked me. I just can't picture a future without her. I was never good with women in the first place, plus I'm not a guy that stands out looks wise (for better or worse), and she was a prime catch. I'll never do that good again. 
And since we've been apart I've noticed myself drifting away from who I used to be. I don't feel even the familial love I had for my extended family anymore. I've always been a socially anxious guy, kinda awkward. At some point in the last couple years I realized that at family gatherings nobody talks to me, I just sit and listen. So I stopped going to them. I haven't hung out with a friend off of the internet in years. 
I have dating profiles   and I rarely get matches but when I do, I start with a shitty pickup line that I think is funny and 80 percent of the time the girl just unmatches without responding. Since I have this   social anxiety shit     when I do match with a girl and we do actually have conversation, I don't ever meet up with them. I don't even know if I really want to. The beginning of a relationship sucks. I just wanna go back to where I was at before.     Anyways, since I never ask girls if they want to meet up they usually stop responding to my texts after a week or so. Maybe if I got to text someone for long enough I'd get to a point where I'd be comfortable meeting them in person, but I have never been able to take as much time as I need.   Im super lonely and it might all be my fault but fuckin whatever. I don't feel like life is worth living without my ex. I just see her when I close my eyes. Everything i see reminds me of her. Its extremely frustrating and i wish itd just stop

3245,u689l8,_Roryy,"first of all I'm sorry you have to deal with feelings like this. with the people you have given yourself to and the ones who have carelessly left you to down lonely. I'm sorry about your pain what keeps you awake at nights. I feel u, the feeling of being unloved, forgotten and alone. But well you're not, it is just the wrong people will always make you feel that way. after a while, the hurt hurt less, you start to see reasons, you'll understand everything, why they did what they did. Learn that not everyone you meet will stay in your life forever, and this is okay because not everyone is meant for you, they all teach you something. But it is important to learn and to see the necessity to let them go, even if you don't want to. And it will hurt. The kind of hurt that follows you everywhere, the hurt that leaves you thinking if you ever meant anything for them. You can't except them to love you back the same way you love them. And this is the same with love Sadly this is the truth. This applies to both friendships and relationships, as we hate to admit it. You have to learn live without them, without goodmorning and goodnight.
This is life and it is what it is. Shit is gonna happen. It's gonna get complicated. We're gonna get relapse, were gonna be weak, were gonne be strong. were gonna break down and beg some people to stay in our lives. but we cant give up, we have to keep going, even when it is scary. We have to keep picking ourselves back up because every bad things will pass, and we will make it through. we've made it this far, we can make it through whatever comes next!

Someday You will find someone who will stay by your side i promise. In this world there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with someone else. Its important to to combine the two in just the right amount.

my female best friend has a boyfriend now and she was the only person i could really talk to but now she wont reply to my messages for 2 weeks straight.  she says she really cares about me though. we didnt meet up for a long time. no one of us even asked the other one if we want to meet. i want her to be happy with her new bf but i feel so lonely now. i dont have any other friends. ive got people who i can party with but no one who i could talk to about my mental health issues or other personal stuff. its really eating me up inside.

i dont really want to bother anyone of them. will they really show me if they care? they are my two favourite persons in the world and i dont want to lose them. 

i think one of the main problems in this situation is that im extremely jealous. im jealous that my best friend wont reply my messages but can make stories and pictures for instagram. im jealous that they have soo many friends that they always talk to but im left out. im jealous cause they are in relationships and they have jobs they really love. im jealous that they are on trips with their friends while im sitting alone in my room.

I never never been in a relationship, and tbh it didn't really bother me until very recently. It's been 4 months that i've been feeling very lonely, being introvert doesn't really help too. I've tried going into parties and social events, but it didn't really help as i thought it would.
I've beed fading away in my work environment, these past months, I've become really less social, barly talking to my co-workers, also i noticed that i've become less efficient doing what i've been doing for last 5 years. There is this feeling that i had lost my value in my co-worker and manager's perspective, that i can be replaced at any moment, and this 5 years friendship, would mean very little to them.
This feeling combined with never being in a relationship, moves me towards further sadness and depression.
I've never thought that one day, I would become depressed.
There is a co-worker lady that i had/have a crush on from a year ago. But i never felt or received any signal that she might like me too, because of that i never expressed my feelings to her, despite having dreams about her a few times.

You'll get some internet friends who'll dispel your loneliness temporarily but most won't stick for long and some u won't want to stick with. 


If u connect with someone for a relationship.. loneliness will vanish as long as you both are in love. But one argument or difference of opinion will cause cracks in the fragile relationship causing either of you to become lonely again, but this time it will feel untolerable after the dependency you develop on a person. 

Relationship with someone solely attracted for looks may not last long enough. You need to connect on a deeper level.

I would seem I have been lied to this is the conclusion I must come to 

Because how do they say they a  population of 7 billion that grows every day some so identical to me and some so different from me some better and some worst

I still can't find love and this saddens me to my soul but with this realization come the that embrace of  loneliness yet again but form this I get the occasional jolts of inspiration to better my self until I realize I probably will never be able to grasp the concept of betterment and so this saddens me 

So I turn to faith,enlightenment fantasy,luck,hope,zodiac signs,personalities types,poetry, pulling me down even further down the pit of loneliness and this saddens me 

And with this  knowledge of this  cycle is to make any man cry but I do not because I am strong but because I can't. So once more I come to the conclusion that something is wrong with me not we not you or them it's me maybe a sin that refuses to fade or maybe because I was meant to die without love or because I am scared of it or maybe because I chose knowledge over amusement and for this I am branded as awkward,weird,boring ,small minded 
And this saddens me as to why I was made this way.

So what is this you may ask

Just the rumblings of a another madman on reddit 

 Just another bored person looking for attention 

Just another suicide note 

Just another horrible attempt of poetry 

Just another a lonely person doomed to die alone 

Just another drifting article 

Just a waste of time

Just a play on you vulnerability 

Just another horrible artist 

Just someone with too much free time

3307,u6l5z9,60_year_loser,"Wow! This really turned out to be a book of a post. Whenever I post something on Reddit I only get a single comment or two. 

TLDR: I just lost a great friendship because I‚Äôm fucked up.

I am so lonely. I recently turned 60 years old and the only constant thought I‚Äôve had is that I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. It‚Äôs not that I want to kill myself, although that has been also been going through my mind.  The reason isn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt want to die, it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt want anyone I know that I am hurting so bad. I‚Äôve had depression for most of my life. No one understood how sad I‚Äôve been. 

I‚Äôve been a disappointment to everyone. My Mother and Brother love me, but they don‚Äôt seem to respect me at all. I‚Äôve have three college degrees and have been a professor for about 15 years. I‚Äôve traveled around the world at least three times seeing about 60 countries. I‚Äôve lived in the US, India, Dubai, Malaysia, and Taiwan. I‚Äôve even written three books, and a fourth is on the way, about my experience traveling. No one, none of my family or any of my friends, seems interested. I had to force my best friend to look at it, and she spent about 30 seconds flipping through the pages. Nobody has ever asked what it was like to see so much. In fact when I was trying to talk about traveling through Russia to my brother, the subject was abruptly changed on how my brother went down to Arizona. He even gave me advice on how to travel.  He has also given me advice on how to teach a class. He once taught a workshop on photography, so when I told him that I had been teaching for ten years, he got upset that I thought I knew how to run a classroom. 

When I got my first degree, my mother said that she was so proud of me, even if my major was really easy. When I got the next two, no body congratulated me. I haven‚Äôt had a birthday cake in over 31 years and I have received only one birthday present since then. 

My marriage failed back when I was about 29 after my wife found someone else she liked more than me. I understood, we got married young, but I was hurt that I was losing her and my best friend. When she left, all she wanted was her bike and her clothes. She didn‚Äôt want any memories or photos of our 8 years together. That was rough. I couldn‚Äôt believe that she disliked me so much that she wanted to erase me out of her life. 

I haven‚Äôt had a romantic relationship since my divorce that lasted more than a year. There have been years that I didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend at all. I think my record was about 10 years without a companion. There are several reasons that I blame for this. All of them seem like excuses, but since I‚Äôm unloading here, I might as well mention them. The first is that I don‚Äôt know how to be in a relationship. My mother got married when she was 16 and was divorced when she was 24. She had lots of issues from her parents and struggled on her own. Imagine being that young and divorced, with two boys. Well, she didn‚Äôt handle it very well. She used to verbally and physically abuse us over very small things. She told my brother and me that she wished she had never had us. That we were the root of her problems. There was one time that we were on the freeway and while she was screaming at us, she threatened suicide. She stomped on the gas pedal and aimed at the side of an overpass. I was about 4 years old at the time. She told my brother and me that she wanted to ship us to our father except he didn‚Äôt want us. She had many boyfriends, so many that I only remember some of them. We‚Äôre talking like a dozen‚Ä¶ no big deal, she was still young. The problem was that they would live with us for about a few months and then they would move on. I never understood what a family was by so many men living in the same house as me.  One time I mentioned to one of her friends that, ‚ÄúMy mom hits really hard.‚Äù I get it, not the thing that she wanted others to know. When her friend left, she called me upstairs and said, ‚Äúyou want to know how hard I can hit?‚Äù And then hit me in the mouth with a closed fist. I was about 8 years old then. I was kicked out of the house when I was 18. Her method of letting me know that she wanted me out was to start hitting me with a coat hanger as she screamed that she didn‚Äôt raise a wimp. 

I know, if you‚Äôve gotten this far then you realize I‚Äôm just a whiner. Whiners are weak and I hated myself as I was growing up, when I got older I got a tattoo on my hand to remind me to never be a wimp. 

So, why am I writing this to a group of people that don‚Äôt care about me or how my life has gone? The simple answer is my last relationship. Bear with me a bit and it may make more sense. I had a great friend, she is much younger than I am, but we spent a lot of time together. She is married and I made sure that I never crossed any line that could be considered romantic. I wanted to keep her as my friend for as long as I could. I knew that the odds of a long term friend were against a person like me. I also respect marriage and didn‚Äôt want to even tempt her into doing something that she didn‚Äôt want to do. To give you an idea of the type of friends we were, we talked every day, messaged almost every night. She would come over to my house and hang out. Sometimes we drank and talked one time we just watched Buffy. She was convinced I would love it if I watched it. Other times she just needed to vent about her marriage. Because she was spending so much time with me, her husband and sister started to ask her if she was having an affair. We never did, I knew that if we were messing around she would have to lie, and I didn‚Äôt want that. I wanted her to be happy.

Then it happened, after over two years of us being great friends, I caught feelings for her. It changed everything. I acted different and she caught the change. I ended up telling her how I felt and told her that we couldn‚Äôt be friends‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs much more to it than that, but that‚Äôs the gist of it.  After a couple of months she tried to rekindle the friendship and I ended up agreeing so we went and had drinks. We were back to being friends again. Two weeks later I‚Äôm back to thinking about her all the time. About a month afterwards she stopped being around me. She wouldn‚Äôt immediately reply to messages, and basically stopped being my friend. Last week I made a really bad comment and told her that I didn‚Äôt want to be her friend anymore. She told me that I was being territorial. That I was a friend, but not a close friend. This hurt me so bad I can‚Äôt explain it. Earlier, before the first blowup, she told me that I was her best friend, well actually she said her sister was her best overall friend,  and I told her she was mine. 

Conclusion. My whole life I don‚Äôt feel that anyone has really cared about me. I wonder what the point of life is if I am destined to live alone forever. Death would be a blessing. The only thing stopping me is that people would consider me a wimp. So, my plan is to take some risks that maybe I can end this nightmare of a life. I told someone that I wanted to buy a kayak to go on the local river. No less than five people have told me to be careful the river is very dangerous. One guy told me that two people he knew were drowned there. Friday I purchased a kayak.

3308,u6l7vh,MasterpieceNo8282,"Hello everyone. Idk what seemed to be wrong with me but I cannot seem to get any luck when it comes to finding a significant other. I have never been in a relationship which must be extremely rare at this point. Whenever someone asks me, I have to just say that it's been a while out of embarrassment. 

I would say I dress relatively well. I plan on what to wear and wbat goes with what. I like to buy a wide range of clothing items. I also do my best to take care of my appearance such as skin, hair, etc. I woild say im fairly fit as I usually workput 3-4 times a week and keep track of calories. My height is average so i dont think that would be an issue. I am currently unemployed as I am attending med school. Everyon here seems to be either married or already in a relationship + there isnt that many people to begin with.

As for my personality, it would be a bit biased if I said it was good, but I am taking this from how others have acted around me. Everyone seems to be pretty comfortable with me and will tend to share things. I always try my best to treat people with care and respect. I am open-minded and like to see things from different povs. I have had people tell me im really nice and it isnt hard for me to make friends, but nothing more. I also try volunteering on a weekly basis to try and hep those in need. I still feel like an irrelevant side character in everyone else's story. I am fairly quiet, but can open up to people quite quickly once I get to know them. 

Am I just destined to be alone? I have tried to make moves before and it has always ended the same way. Just rejection. Ik it's hard to say without knowing me but any advice is appreciated. Every passing day I am getting more and more convinced that I am just the ugliest creatuee to ever roam this planet because I cannot find another reason no matter how hard I try.",2022-04-18 19:24:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650308444,3,/r/lonely/comments/u6l7vh/26m_forever_alone/,,0,0,26m forever alone?

In some ways I just need to accept the fact that it will never happen not with me. It hurts and I hate it but it must happen. I will just have to accept that my crushes will find someone else and I will be on my own. I will probably not have a life worth living just one that I am surviving. 

I makes sense in a way who wants to date someone that is broken. I have been abused and probably will again. I just feel like everything wrong is my fault and the world would be better off with out me. I am sick of living if all I feel is pain. I don't know what to do. How to make this pain go away.

3313,u6mra9,Individual_Apple_883,"Hi, I (22f) feel kind of weird posting here, and I guess on paper you'd think I'd be generally ""unlonely"" if that's even a term. 

I live with family I get on with well enough, I have a comfortable job which, while I don't aspire to stay there in the long term, has generally nice people working there, but no one I'd say is a friend. I have a partner who I am very close, but has his own life and as much as he's my best friend, it's not his job to fill in for the role of my friends. My family, whilst they love me, don't really understand my interests (nerdy, d&amp;d, love Doctor Who etc) and find it difficult to connect with me, I think.

I had a small group of friends, but for various reasons grew apart from about a year ago, but wasn't massively close to by the end. My last of my close friends, whilst I still hold very dearly, I do not see much after I left the place we worked at mutually. 

I don't feel low as such, I am generally content with most aspects of my life, besides feeling very lonely. I don't feel close to anyone besides a very few people, but then they are busy with their lives, as I can be with mine. I have had meaningful friendships last years before, but recently, I've not had any kind of friendship that's platonic and I feel very hollow and just really f\*cking lonely. I'm quite shy, but not to the point that it stops me from forming relationships with people. 

I guess amidst my rambling I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on making friends as an adult?

3317,u6nczm,Am-I-doing-alright,"After a breakup of a 3 year relationship when I \[28M\] was 21, I started to develop symptoms of depression and major social anxiety. I could never understand ultimately why until 3 years ago. I used to frequent dating apps and would barely get any success. The matches I did get were few and far between and conversations never lasted more than a day at most. After a while, I started noticing a pattern where I would feel lonely, try my hardest on these apps and never get anywhere then it would just downward spiral slowly but not immediately. I started to distance myself from trying to find someone and thought I had beaten it.

So, 2 and a half years ago, I got my first job that has lasted more than a couple of months and have not felt the same way since... until just over a week ago.

Subconsciously, I started getting a crush on one of my co workers and because I had emotionally distanced myself from that feeling, I didn't even realize until another co worker had pointed it out as a suspicion.

I started getting that feeling of anxiety again that just consumed me. He pushed me to ask the question, which I did, eventually. Only to be let down. Which has just resulted in everything I worked to prevent, come rushing back and I no longer know how to deal with it. I just want this feeling of loneliness to go...

3332,u6osj0,BloodyBloodshot,"I'm a 26-year-old male who had a very controlling mother growing up. I didn't have traditional adolescence and am not having a very traditional 20's.

I missed out on friendships and very crucial experiences associated with that age. At this moment, I have never been kissed and have never had a relationship.

In theory, I could still do all these things but in a way, they are now much harder to achieve and it will be very different to the experience that could have been. But in truth, different is not what I want. I just wanted what everyone else got.

I know I can have ""friends"" but it will not be the strong friendship one experiences in their upbringing. The thought of having friends and being in a relationship is not nearly exhilarating now. I think no matter what happens, I'll never be happy with whatever human relationships come my way. I mean it when I say it. I want to be a teenager. I would kill to have friends that are college-aged. Unfortunately, that's not how societal norms function.

That's what I truly want. I think that's why I am so obsessed with people like Olivia Rodrigo; I wish I had a life and friendships like hers. She seems so close with her buddies. Again, I know I can have ""friends"" but I can never have something so close to the friends she has.

When you get to adulthood, human relationships become very different in a not-so-good way. The energy just isn't there.

I have accepted my loneliness at this point. Somedays, I wish I had people but I do remind myself that at my age, having friends will definitely not be the way I want them to be. I can see myself resenting friends that are my age and older in the long run. There's also the fact that I have taken the controlling traits from my mother. So, I am better off alone, and admittedly, there's peace in that knowing someone will never inconvenience your day unless it's work-related.

My childhood best friend got eloped a few weeks ago without telling me and I think this incident's a clear signal that our friendship is officially over. We haven't talked in a while now and I only found out about her marriage via her new husband's Facebook. I'm not even upset about her eloping; I just wish she would have told me.   

My other best friend moved away to another state, got engaged, and is getting married in May. I have a feeling that after she gets married, I'll never hear or see her again. We haven't had a real conversation in months, and even then I can only talk to her for about 20 minutes at a time.

I had a best friend from kindergarten to grade 9. We were inseparable at school. Everyone at school knew that we were the bestest of friends, never left each other‚Äôs side, and always hung out‚Ä¶ at school. At the end of grade 9 I started hanging out with a new group of friends. I had so much in common with them, talked with them every lunch, and worked with them in class because we were all pretty smart. But that was at school. The pandemic hit at the end of grade 12 for me, and immediately we never spoke again for the longest time. 

I‚Äôve always been a good student and a good person. I don‚Äôt mean to toot my own horn but that‚Äôs what everyone tells my mom at the bank she works at when they found out the woman serving them was my mom.

I‚Äôm in university now, haven‚Äôt made many friends due to classes being online, but I have made some. I did make one good friend who did ask me to hangout quite a few times, but she lived 2 doors down from me. She‚Äôs moved back home and has already started talking to me less.

3355,u6thuf,Affectionate-Back579,"Here's the TLDR version straight up: I [23M] already feel hopeless and done with life. I've moved to a new country away from the handful of the people that I knew (and family but they don't play a big role). Life sucked there, and now that I'm here, it is really really tough. I'm not saying I didn't know what I signed up for, but I didn't know it was going to be THIS bad. I've tried making friends but apparently my 'race' has a bad reputation (maybe sketchy in a way that the native residents try not to get involved), so all of my efforts are in vain.

I don't know what I'm working for, what I'm doing, why I'm doing it or... Oh and the 'Hey do it for yourself man you're so young you have a lot of time left' is just bullcrap so please just. Yeah. 

I wanna marry someone and get settled. I haven't even talked to anyone cause of this 'image' that I'll create in front of anyone that - 'oh hey I have a friend/acquaintance/family member, he wants to get married. He's only 23 tf? ü§£'. I can't do it alone anymore. What's wrong with being married and still studying/having a job? Even if I find someone who is still studying, doesn't matter. It's not like we're gonna buy houses and cars and condos the moment we marry. This'll take time but it'll be fun cause we'll be doing it together. 

Here's the fun part - Relationships don't work anymore, marriages don't SEEM to work a lot either. Plus being this lonely for a long time (6 years), I'm going to always be paranoid about stuff that is not even worth worrying about. Neither am I sight for sore eyes lmao so there's that. Easy to be cheated on. 

I've only said this to my childhood friend. Not my best friends cause they think I'm going through a phase (they're really amazing people but still like tf is a phase) so there's that. Yeah so much for 'TLDR'.",2022-04-19 01:45:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642302805,2,/r/lonely/comments/u6thuf/mixed_feelings/,,0,1,Mixed feelings

3357,u6tt0c,throwaway0183701,"Decided I'm gonna try this. Can't talk to my therapist about everything cuz I'm a stupid bitch who gets too easily embarrassed, not to mention time constraints. And I could just do this offline and let no one ever see it. But I am too cruel to myself, and I figure even just the chance that someone might see it and be kinder to me than I am to myself is nice. Plus they may even have good advice, who knows? Not like anyone will read such a stupid, uninteresting vent by an anonymous stranger, but who cares. And it'll give me typing practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, on to bitching. I have a crush again, unfortunately. I haven't had one for a while, because I was so distant from everyone that I didn't even know anyone well enough to fantasize about them, at best I'd be fantasizing a made up character that looked and *maybe* sounded like them. But there's a cute girl in 2 of my classes, and cuz I sit in the back, I see her quite a lot. Don't know to what extent it's mere exposure effect or something, but I think she's pretty cute. Have since I saw her, actually, so maybe MEE isn't a big part... Anyways, she doesn't really know I exist, cuz no one does. I'm just the sad kid who wears black and can barely string sentences together if you force him to talk. Nobody gives a shit. I mean I guess my lab mate kind of almost does, but that's cuz he's older and is in the compassionate dad stage of life, I think.

But yeah. So me and my lab mate were talking in lab. He asked me what classes I'm taking in fall, and I told him. Then the cute girl joined the conversation just to talk to me. She had joined our conversation once before, but to talk to my lab mate. This time, she wanted to ask me how I fit those classes together on the schedule, and offered a suggestion of taking a physics class over the summer like she is to make it easier on me. That was it. And obviously, any sane person would think nothing of this, but it was the highlight of my fucking month. She knew I existed, she thought perhaps that some knowledge I had could make her life better, and she cared enough about me to give me knowledge that she thought could make my life better. Again, no sane person would get excited over such a stupid thing, but here in the stupid bitch journal, I'm not sane. It was thrilling.

And it's been days now. Think that was Thursday that this happened, but I still am thinking about it. Like I said, I haven't had a crush in a while, so I had no scenarios even close to realistic that I could fantasize about while trying to fall asleep. I've been having to settle for pretending various anime waifus love me, because at least I can watch the anime they're in and learn some about their personality. And it's not like I know much at all about this girl, in fact I honestly know nothing. But it was unfortunately enough to jumpstart my imagination, and for the past few nights I've been imagining that she cares about me and loves me despite how fucked up and worthless I am.

It sucks. Because as easy as it makes going to sleep, it makes waking up that much harder, and it makes seeing her harder. I see her about 6 hours a week rn, and it's hell. It's just me fighting against my own fucking creepyass self wanting to stare at her, all the while lamenting that she doesn't like me. And now I get even more self conscious of my hair in lab. I have long hair, and I have to put it in a ponytail for lab, but because one of my fucking sex chromosomes is broken and I'm a male, I have bald spots that make ponytails hard to do. Some days they just literally don't work, and you can see my fucking putrid scalp through my hair. God, I wish I was just born XX , so I wouldn't have to put up with this.

Tangent: Isn't it funny that Greeks thought women were deformed males, but now we know that everything starts off female and it takes one of our chromosomes being stunted and malformed to make us male? I think that's just scrumptious, I would love to see the look on their faces as they learned that if we could go back in time.

Yeah, but anyways, this sucks. I have so much shit going wrong in my life, I have so much shit I need to do but I don't have a single gram of motivation to do any of it, and that mostly because knowing how fucking unloved I am makes me apparently unable to love myself. I didn't ask for this bullshit. I was actually happy as a kid, when I was under 12, I didn't give a shit about what people thought of me. I wasn't interested in finding a mate. All I fucking cared about (if I filter off the religious indoctrination) was having fun. And I was pretty damn good at having fun. But then fucking puberty came, hormonal changes I hated making my body wrong happened, but the worst of it was the fucking biological need for a mate. It feels like that's all that's been in my head for 9 years. I just wish I could go back to when I was aroace and was happy. Everybody says that love's the best thing about life, and they are probably right, but fuck it if you can't have it. If it's the best thing ever, then watching others get it effortlessly while you know you can never even know what it's like is the worst torture ever.

I'm so fucking jealous of everyone. I'm jealous of everyone at school who has friends that I don't have, I'm jealous of couples who have love that I don't have, I'm jealous of girls who have beauty and attractiveness that I don't have, I'm jealous of aroace people who have a level of self dependency I don't have. I just hate this. I never asked for this, I would've said no if I was asked. It's not fair that this stupid fucking brain has to be conscious so that it can feel all this pain.

3371,u6vs1n,leftonvioletstreet,"I mean this post in the sincerest way possible and do not intend to put others down in any way. I harbor no negativity towards others. I wish love, light, and joy on absolutely everyone and that is the truth. But my problem is that I have absolutely zero mental stimulation from any other human being in my life. It is breaking my heart and has been for years. I'm blessed to have loving friends and family members but none of them, except for maybe one or two people I've met in my life, have the ability to connect with me mentally. 

I understand that \^ is pretty vague, so if I may, please allow me to dump all of this out for you, friendly stranger on the internet. 

I (30F) am a phd student studying history (military history, specifically). I've always been a bookworm. Many things fascinate me and I haven't quite figured out how to turn my mind off, or not marvel at the world around me, or not meditate on life's toughest questions, or stop reading, or satisfy my hunger for learning. I love to collect books, and stare at artwork, and listen to old music, and visit ancient places, and read archaic writing, and reach through the annals of time to try and touch parts of our story as human beings that make us what we are. My soul is ten thousand years old. I've filled hundreds upon hundreds of pages with every kind of reflection you could imagine. I stretch and contort and mould and bend my mind into any and every shape possible reading about countless subjects. I want to talk about space and physics and oceanography and meteorology and architecture and poetry and philosophy and medicine and sociology and life after death and e v e r y t h i n g. There is no thought I won't entertain and no discussion I won't have and no idea I won't hear and no friend I won't make and no meaningful conversation I won't enjoy. 

But I have no one to talk to. 

And worse, I get silence when I *try* to talk to anyone about anything substantive. I've been blessed with rich friendships and loving relationships but they're all with surface-level people. Everyone in my life spends their days watching reality tv, scrolling social media, or staring at football games. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with people relaxing and enjoying their time in whichever way they choose. I believe everyone's creator made them perfectly, truly I do. But they simply don't think. Ever. About anything. So maybe the reality is that creator (if there is one) designed *me* wrong. I don't know. The only thing I do know is that I am so alone. 

The kind of alone where you feel it most when you're around a lot of other people. 

There is no way to get these words out without it sounding like I'm putting others down and I wish that weren't the case because I truthfully do not mean it that way. But every guy I've dated has eventually hit me with lines like: ""I just can't compete with your brain, OP, sorry."" There was one guy who worked at the same office I did a few years ago. He was wonderful and gentle and very multidimensional too. We secretly had a small fling for each other but never admitted it. One day he told me something to the effect of ""you're a cute girl but your brain is the loveliest thing I've ever seen."" We were dating other people at the time and he moved away shortly thereafter. I think about him often. The point of this is not to flatter myself. Or him. Or anyone else. The point is to express that I almost wish I weren't this way. 

I feel good about myself. I am educated, have built a good career, have my life in order, treat my loved ones well and with respect. I've checked all the right boxes. I am just so achingly lonely. 

Like I'm in a world packed with 8 billion people and none of them speak the same language I do. 

I wish someone wanted to read with me, and share their writing, and tell me what they learned recently, and ruminate on powerful poetry, and muse about all the things they don't know, and ask all the questions they're certain no one has answered before, and have the courage to be wrong, and be tempted by the opportunity to exercise their mind, and be awestruck by the night sky, and humbled by the ocean, and be softened by art, 

and be each and every single thing that makes humans, human. 

Instead of spending all of their precious and limited breaths sitting in front of a tv screen. I mean fuck, meeting ANYONE who can even talk about the kind of history I study would be an absolute gift from above for me (especially if they *enjoy* it too, I'd faint).   

These are the things that make me lonely. It's been this way my entire life. But reader, if you've made it this far, you ease the sting a little. Thank you from the other side of a screen, in my corner of the world.",2022-04-19 03:43:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650335008,42,/r/lonely/comments/u6vs1n/starved_of_intellectual_and_mental_connection/,,0,35,"Starved of intellectual and mental connection.

3388,u6x589,[deleted],"She and I are close friends in HS. I've liked her since last november. We eat lunch together and we talk during breaks. Same friend group, I'm the only guy there. Eventually, her friends figured out that I like her, and they all encouraged me except one who blocked me. Anyways, she has told me that she doesn't like anybody. Her friends have asked her same questions and told me the same thing. While I know she didn't like anybody, it was alright. Since prom was coming up, and her friends told me that she will probably agree to go with me, and the upcoming hints seemed promising. (I got a gift from her but the only guy who got it from her. She would voluntarily walk with me and approach me and stuff, and she tells me secrets that her other friends don't know.)

Then, just not too long ago, one of them told me that she will most likely agree to go with me because apparently if she doesn't findanybody, her dad will go with her and she doesn't want that. They also told me that I shouldn't worry about any other guys as I was the only relevant suitor. I was hyped up for a bit. I planned to ask her to hangout tomorrow and ask her then. I thought I had a good chance.

However, today after school, one of her friends came rushing to me to tell me the crushing news...Her friend told me that the girl wants to go with someone in her art class to prom. (I do not share a single class with her.) I remember her friend from art class even told me there is nothing to worry about, I guess I was wrong. So she doesn't want to go with me. I guess I was never even relevant. The friend asked the girl if she liked the guy, but she denied it. Doesn't matter. I lost.

So I guess I won't be going to prom. I was only gonna go if I had someone, so I guess I don't have anybody. I even asked the girl if she wanted to hangout tomorrow, but I just canceled it. I'm broken. Was I not the guy who was always there for her? Who gave her gifts and presents just as she did to me? The only guy who even gave her valentines flowers? Why? I guess I will never know why. Gonna binge in Fade To Black as I die internally.

3389,u6xh2a,habibtiautumn,F(20) I moved to California for my senior year of high schools to attend a school for the arts. It was in the spring of my senior year when quarantine first begun and at first we were told we would only be out of school for two weeks. This quickly turned into for the rest of the year. I graduated online and never got the chance to say goodbye to my classmates. During my senior year I started dating a guy 3 years older than me. My family lives on the east coast so during quarantine I pretty much only had him as my source of companionship/ support. Because of this I ended up becoming very isolated with him and accepted abusive behavior from him. Fortunately we broke up in July and I was able to get out the bad situation .I am in a community college currently online. I realize to make friends I should probably enroll in person but to be honest I have a lot of anxiety surrounding that. My social skills have been quite affected by Covid. The area I live in is also Armenian mostly ( I am not) and I fear feeling like I don‚Äôt fit in or being an outcast. I have like one friend or two who I can hangout with once in a blue moon but that‚Äôs about it . I am extreamly lonely.

Of course I get sad when I don't have anyone to talk to and often become desperate for human interaction after a prolong period. Such as now. My life is spiraling out of control in my mind, but everyone is telling me they still care for me. Yet, where are they? Am I pushing them away? I don't know if I am, but it would make sense. After the constant abuse I had to face and let people do to me just so I wouldn't have to be alone. Perhaps I have a guard up to shield me from the bad apples, but I can never tell who is bad at this point so I dodge every good thing-

Hm, instead of questioning everything all the time I should probably just relax, but even then I'll feel like I'll get attacked by something unexpected in life.

3392,u6xn4j,bigbeansguy,"I couldn‚Äôt find the right words to write for the title of this post as I lay in bed about to fall asleep.

This post is long, scroll to the bottom for the tldr.

I am trying to keep anonymity so I apologize for some vagueness. This is my first real post to reddit outside of a meme I posted once.

Im really a regular guy (21). Im told occasionally that I am attractive even. Physically, I am told I am tall and strong. I had a successful career for myself as a collegiate athlete. I once raced and trained alongside some of the fastest people in the world in my sport, some names you would see in the Olympics. I am currently trying to go into an area in the finance industry that is extremely well paid at the cost of long hours. I work a job related to the field currently as I finish my undergrad and soon will begin my masters. I am expected with the way that I am currently working, and through scholarship, to have no debt even after my masters. I live at home still in my hometown and I hope to buy a nice small house in a couple years after Im out.

What is the point of me mentioning this stuff you may ask? It is because I wish to tell you that no physical success can alter the truth that being lonely is something that cannot be cured with something physical. Nor is it something that can be cured simply by being around others, but Im sure some of you have felt that too. I struggle with both childhood trauma, relationship trauma, and most of my time when Im not moving around I spend alone in my room trying to distract myself with digital things that I cant stand, but its either that or sitting in my loneliness. Even when I am doing something there is so little interaction with say my team that I am forgotten more times than remembered. For years I was talked down to and bullied by people that made me feel so inferior for no reason at all other than to boost themselves up. I only ever wanted to be their friend.

Fast forward after 2 relationships 1 which was very unhealthy emotionally as i let myself get stepped on and gaslit, and the other ending due to my lack of ability to really be present. Im not a good guy because I let these feelings of loneliness and anger and confusion manifest into a sexual addiction in which I either please myself by objectifying women or try to find someone to hook up with to make me feel wanted just for the time being. Neither of these things are what I ever wanted to happen and it has fried my ability to hold a strong relationship due to my ability to not make connection with people that really genuinely want me and are not just hooking up with me for their own reasons. Whenever I do try to start something I am rejected constantly and just have to move on as per usual, which doesn‚Äôt even hurt anymore. I try not to say things to make them uncomfortable or put pressure on them and encourage openness. But truly I feel that I am invisible to everyone, and even sometimes my immediate family.

In some time soon I really feel that I will be hitting a dead end in my life, and just be shut out from things that I had always felt capable of. In some time, not even my immediate family will be physically present around me. The people I work with will never question anything about me, the few friends I do have will fade into their own business as they go far away into their own places in life. All that will be left is myself and the weight I put on my mind which has been killing me slowly for years. Its like I could yell with every ounce of my being and still be unheard.

If you read all of this, you are the kind of person I wish we had more of in this world for really taking in what I have had to write. 

Even if you just read the TLDR, I appreciate at least your thought of looking at the subject.

TLDR: physical success cannot change the way you feel internally, nor can it change how some relationships work/don‚Äôt work. Im approaching a dead end that will soon be void of the few people I have in this world.",2022-04-19 05:32:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621712964,2,/r/lonely/comments/u6xn4j/i_am_a_guy_who_from_the_outside_who_looks_like_i/,,0,2,"I am a guy who from the outside who looks like I have a lot going on in a good way for myself, but I am invisible"

To put in in perspective the town only holds about 3-4k people. I'm a introvert and stay in my room alot. Althiugh I do get out and try going outside and whatnot, I do work 40 hour weeks. I have some acquaintances but none who I would consider friends. As to me being 28 almost 29 in June, they being 20-24 age. Well long story short I moved here this past summer. Figured it would be a new start, found a girlfriend whom I fell for, hard. Things started off great, sex was greatest I've ever experienced. I thought I had it all with her, then vday came and destroyed what little of a relationship we built, all over a miscommunication. Since then everything went down hill and we mutually broke up, as to both of our feelings fell apart.

Now, I can't help but think I'm 28 almost 29 and I'm locked in my room day by day depressed. Moved to a new town and the ain't nobody I know within miles of me besides family. I just want connection, to feel wanted, to be desired, loved. Love back. I just can't help to think this is my end. A blackhole I'm in now. Dating isn't easy in a small town.

3403,u6yw24,SiriustheBlackcat,"I don‚Äôt make friends easily. Most of my friends from work have settled down with spouses and kids, and I‚Äôm still single and child free. Hanging out now takes advanced planning and they‚Äôd rather stay home with their families anyway. Even friends who don‚Äôt have kids are wrapped up in their SO and never initiate conversation with me via text, emails, etc. Half the time my emails don‚Äôt get responded to even when I email first. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs moved on from me and I can‚Äôt identify because I don‚Äôt have a family. 

I reached out to old friends, but they‚Äôre indifferent. Same with my family. My siblings are all having kids and don‚Äôt have time for me. Now, I grew up the eldest of five, so I know how much of a handful kids can be, so I get they have responsibilities. I just miss video chats with my sister, or playing quick online games or going out and doing things. She‚Äôs tired a lot from kids so she doesn‚Äôt want to chat much anymore. I live out of state now, but when I lived 45 min from her, I‚Äôd visit every week. I was fine with that. I‚Äôd play with my niece and it was always a good visit. My parents use to live 90 min from me, but I‚Äôd be the one to always go down and visit too. They‚Äôve come up to see me twice in six years. They‚Äôll fly to East Canada from the West Coast to visit my sister and her kids, or go out of state for grandparents, but one state further is apparently a burden. All the times I lived out of state (12 years) only once has a sibling visited. No one else had, even though I fly up all the time. It‚Äôs made me feel very isolated and lonely. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm ready to not spend anymore of my precious vacation time visiting them and just want to go do my own thing. It just makes me feel like a bad daughter and sister. 

As for friends, I know I have to find single people who can relate to me and be in the same life stage, but at my age, it‚Äôs gotten difficult to find them. I just feel exasperated because I could literally have a heart attack and die in my apartment and people likely wouldn‚Äôt know for days when either the neighbors complain of a stench or work actually visits my home looking for me. What am I doing wrong where no one has time to message, text, email, call, or visit me? No one knows how I feel, since I feel bad like I expect everyone to drop everything for me or that the world revolves around me. It doesn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt expect people to drop everything or cater to me. I just wish someone would reach out to me for a change.

3407,u701ud,Colminius,"I guess this has been asked here a million times, but I need some help on this. Basically the title hints it: I centainly believe I will never ever have a relationship again. For the last few years I have come to the conclusion that I will never find a suitable partner for me. To avoid getting too deep into it, I think I can find a woman that can share my beliefs, but not have a compatible personality, or a woman that has a compatible personality but doesn't share my beliefs. That means I will never be able to find someone with whom I'd truly like to share my life.

Also, right now the only woman that shows some affection to me is a friend of mine who is eighteen, and with whom I know for sure I don't want to be. I have many friends, and good ones in fact, but that doesn't keep me from feeling a crushing loneliness that is slowly driving me insane. I think of my future life and the only thing I see is a loner that goes out with friends, and feels genuine joy, but that will go home to literally no one, that will go to sleep every night in absolute darkness, silence and loneliness, that will be greeted by no one coming from work, that will never rest his heart at that special other's arms, a loner whose arms will never confort anyone.

One of my old college buddies regularly posts here from time to time and he's making me worried. I found out on accident as he uses the same username for everything online. He's convinced that no one will ever love him and that he will forever be alone. This made me reconnect with him so we could do things together. The problem is if I get tired working 9-5 and can't play games with him or meet up then he starts posting about suicide and how every friend he has ghosts him. His depression gets worse after every post. What should I do? I feel like confronting him about these private posts would be out of line. At the same time, I don't want to be aware of a potential suicidal person and not do what I can to help him.

3419,u72ik5,Elaurin34," Hi there,

so there is this girl I write with for over 3 years now and she always claims that she likes me but whenever I want to plan something to meet her she always makes some weird excuses. Today she doesn't want me to come over because she didn't clean her room. But she also doesn't want to come over because she's nervous around someone else's parents. I can understand that but after 3 years she hasn't visited me once because of this excuse and I don't buy it anymore especially since she isn't shy at all in almost any other situation. She also denied every single one of my ideas what we could do outwards. Now she just wants to play video games... So we don't meet at all. Last time she told me her grandma is over. Okay I said just tell me when I can pick you up. ""She stays a little longer than expected"". Okay sure no problem. ""I'll hit the gym give me another 2 hours""; ""I have to get up early tomorrow so we can't hang out for too long"". So we went to the movies and after not talking to each other for 2 hours we drove back to her and I wanted to go eat something on the way back. She said she didn't want to and when we were back I brought it up again then she was like ""why haven't you brought that up earlier we totally could have done that but now we're already home"".

Its not like we never do stuff together but its like once every few months and since her best friend blocked both of us it gets even more rare...

While I'm writing this it seems so obvious but of course that's just my perspective and my insecure ass always thinks pessimistic about stuff like this. And she really is someone who is completely planning out her week. But it always feels like she's making time for everyone but me. Even if I am write I don't know how I should talk to her about it because if she does want to meet me afterwards it wouldn't be the same... It would feel forced. And I don't want to lose her since she's the first friend I ever had. What's your opinion about her behaviour...

It's not what i want but it's always an option.  

I guess it's not just the mental health aspects of isolation there is so much more depth to the darkness. They say isolation is worse than smoking and I understand that, sometimes when my head is bad hitting the bottle for a couple of days can quite the mind from those thoughts.

3440,u764x0,willyari,"It's been proving quite hard to reach this post-cynical stage concept I learned a few months ago. Dividing myself into multiple minds back in 2015 seems to be hindering my growth nowadays.

Everything I learned so far doesn't seem to be making a difference and my trust in the process is at an all-time low. I feel capable of watching negative thoughts from a distance but when I'm required to act, I feel extremely burdened. Perhaps I need to find a method for reaching a no-mind state.

This might be some temporary, childish stream of thoughts - however - I cannot help despising the life I've built for myself so far. The dissonance result of such non-synergistic perspectives brings into question, which are the paths of least / most resistance. The lack of synergy appears in the notion that even if I understand how silly a thought may be, it doesn‚Äôt stop the physiological response that tightens the region around the neck + diaphragm, makes it hard to breathe, cold sweat and the likes. My most deep, animal interpretative framework signals danger too easily. The aftermath of these stress responses, grow an uncontrollable drive for escapism behavior towards hyper stimuli such as coffee, gaming, and many other dopaminergic related activities. The overload lefts me unbelievably tired, restless and susceptible to faulty lines of thought that leads to pits of hopelessness since I depend on a messed up social environment.

Maybe I should have given those monastic impulses more credit rather than disregarding them as another disguised, escaping mechanism.

Somewhere along my upbringing I learned to hate arrogant personalities. It pains to see this in myself as I navigate daily life observing people falling further and further into spirals of mindless indulgence - while at the same time - maintaining the facade that everything is under control.

What seems like equilibrium now can very much cascade into chaos given enough time. Society has overdosed on psychological opiates, entered a trance of numbness and all it can do is postpone it‚Äôs coming down from artificial highs + withdrawals. I feel for every sucker out there in a non-arrogant way. Such realization gradually destroys me even though I‚Äôm only being told a very small part of the whole story.

I see how rubbish is to be stuck in these trains of thought but what can I do? People around me don‚Äôt take my non-traditional substance use seriously enough to offer effective help. My brain chemistry + microphysiology adjusted itself to this dreadful point partly because those responsible for the kid let him overcharge on sugar, pain-killers, caffeine, salt.

My capacity for engaging in complex problem-solving sometimes get hi-jacked by the needlessly negative planner side of this identity I construed to enter early-adult life.

I've been in a dynamic battle, reading depressive-avoidant mind material for 6+ years, applying every word of advice on the book. I feel like I consumed so much biographies of every shape and form, on the internet, that I lived far longer than my actual age.

3445,u779v4,Key-Sheepherder-7176,"So, to start off. I'm adopted by my mother's husband at the time. My mother passed when I was 8 and he's been legally my father for my whole life since then. I've been living with him my entire life with my sister who's a good 11 years older then me. She moved out because of how abusive and manipulative my father can be. He offers no support, he belittles you, he insults you, you're never good enough no matter how hard you try, he rarely says I love you, he never will give you any open support on what you want to do with your life or what makes you happy, he's always negative, and doesn't listen to criticism and or takes accountability for his actions ever. 

It's so bad that my sister moved out within 2 days, not even caring about the place she was moving into. The mental and physical abuse I've been experiencing throughout the years like being beaten and isolated from the people I love and care about has put more trauma on me then I ever realized. I take anti depressants and for the longest, I had no idea why everyone around me looked at my ""father"" weird. 

My boyfriend of 8 years told me continously that my father never acted like a father. That he was obviously just a guardian because I never had that bond or relationship with my father like everyone else usually does. I've realized that my relationship with him is near to none as I'm 19 now and I can't talk to him about anything; not even things I'm passionate and happy about. If anything I'm more terrified of my ""father"" more then anything as I tried to talk to him about moving out and all he did was complain about money, how am I going to college, how I'm brainwashed with trying to move in with my boyfriend. He makes me feel like shit, but I guess him sh*tting on my dreams and goals was the last time I gave him a chance at being a ""father."" 

He broke me. I have emotional trauma that I'm going to have to live with my entire life until I can get actual therapy. I thought this man was decent, I was too blind to see that the ""love"" my father had for me. Wasn't love, it was him using me for money. I found out my father received money all of my life for child support and for me going to school which would've been a good 1,000 a month but, I never received anything besides a small $70 after I hit 17 after I started my first job. I've told my father multiple times how I'm depressed and he's never cared, one time he even told me to kill myself; that he'd dump my body into a dumpster when i was 17. That night, I ran away to my boyfriends house for a few weeks. 

My father never approved of my sister's boyfriend even though when he lived with us, he cooked and cleaned and made sure to help as much as he could; even being a father to kids that weren't his. My father still called him ""useless,  a worthless bum"" my sister moved out shortly afterwards. ((I'm sorry for jumping around so much. It's a lot to catch up on. )))  My father would threaten me, threaten my sister, put his hands on my sister who was pregnant at the time (never apologized to her) and has never been there for either of us. Me and my sister wish my mother was still alive, she wouldn't have let these things happen. She knew what kind of monster he was, she tried to leave but, it didn't go well. In the end my mother had to die right beside a man she was trying to run away from for years. 

As of right now. I've disowned my father. He's abusive mentally and physically. He demands me to baby him, to try and suck up to him. I've always done what he wanted but I'm sick and tired of his rules and him treating me like a roommate rather then his DAUGHTER! He's never said he's proud of me! If anything he calls me delusional and brainwashed or stupid. I'm at a point in my life where I've finally woken up to see how toxic he is. As of right now, I'm trying my hardest to get my own place. But, it's hard when he never taught me things I might need so I'm depending on my sister who's 30 now for advice. 

My boyfriend has been staying with me because he got into a fight with a sibling of his he was staying with. So he's with me right now. It's a lot of other things my father has decided to do but, I'd be here all day typing it out. Anyways, I'm not listening to my ""father"" anymore. I have my own job, I'm stable on my own without speaking to him. And legally my name is on the lease so I can do what I want unless he takes me to court which he likely will never do. I'm tired of him being abusive to me and my family for more then 10 years. 

It's time I take back my happiness, my mental well being and stand up for myself for the first time ever in my life. This is a terrifying thought but, I am determined to put an end to his control and abuse even if it's the last thing I do. He won't control me anymore. 


I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice on the situation. He's threatening me due to me not listening to him about my boyfriend being over. My name is on the lease so he can't kick me out , right? I've done a ton of research on it. I just need help please. I need to get away from him. Once I do, I'm never looking back. I feel sad deep down that I could never get him to love me, but sometimes life is hell. And having a supportive and loving boyfriend, sister and friends I know things will be okay.

3448,u78du3,Pancakesapriori,"I've learned to never mention being lonely to friends or family, because all I ever get is a toxic and/or canned responses.

One such response is, ""keep your head up, everyone is worthy of love."" No, no they aren't. Everyone has made it clear that ""everyone is worthy of love"" is false. My point is not some kind of humanitarian one, though. Of course everyone deserves love, but like other humanitarian concepts, it just doesn't turn out that way. Slavery, sexual assault, and genocide are wrong, and no one should have to experience them, but they still happen. Freedom (whatever that means) should be available to all human beings, but it just isn't. It's how the world has shaken out. 

There is also a family of responses that aim to place all of the blame on a lonely person for their being lonely:
""If you had a better attitude...""
""If you dressed better...""
""If you talked to people more often...""
""If you didn't smoke...""
""If you lowered your standards...""
""If you weren't so negative...""

The people who say these things either don't understand, or are making a mistake. First of all, it's likely that people who have a diminished attitude, diminished fashion, diminished social engagement, etc, haven't diminished in these areas and *then* become lonely as a result. Rather, they were lonely all along, tried all these things, found out that even *with* these things that they are not seen as worthy. Then, these things diminish....caused *by* that loneliness-- not vice versa. Then, these toxic people use their mistaken understanding of the time order of these things to place the blame onto the lonely person which results in a vicious cycle of unworthiness and invisibility. They run their mouths to each other about how it's always the fault of the lonely person, which makes more and more people understand it this way, and guess what,  lonely folks are that much more unattractive from the get go. 

Another: when super attractive people who have little trouble with loneliness (comparatively) say, ""everyone is lonely [at some point/ much of the time]. Yeah, I really love it when desirable and lovable people put in a two cents like this. Fuck you, you have no idea. Spoken from a position of being consistently wanted, you do not have the same access to the same experiences. It effectively trivializes the experiences of a lonely person, and it's toxic. Period. This makes me think that sharing anything about loneliness is simply an over share. Why? Because they don't understand, can't understand, simply have this canned response, and now they think *I'm the one* who doesn't understand. So, mentioning it effectively makes it worse. 

Lastly, I recently deleted my dating apps and made the mistake of mentioning it. Granted, I expressed it in a stupid way. I said,  ""I never get anything out of them except disappointment."" So, they immediately mentioned that ""love isn't a transaction, bro."" 

I couldn't help but think, ""wow, do you really think I'm that stupid?"" Of course it isn't a transaction. I'm not mad that I don't ""get fucked or invited to a relationship in every match."" But, dating apps are objectively changing the way people think about intimacy and courting, so you can put in effort and just be ignored (often very suddenly--ghosting practices) even when you've done nothing wrong. For example, the last 3 times I got excited about a conversation with someone, they suddenly just stopped communicating. Now, I'm not one of those weirdos that makes stupid sexual comments right off the bat, and I'm not a douchy ass hole either. These are all conversations in which a decent vibe was present. My only theory is that it's much easier to go for the cuter (or otherwise more attractive) options in these apps without having to engage long enough to learn about a real person. It's way different in the flesh, when a real human being is next to us and engaging with us. It's not that I expect something every time, like a transaction, and the fact that this person concluded that is ridiculously toxic. 

I'm just going to stop sharing. There is no help anywhere, and the shittiest part about it is that people who aren't lonely don't have to care. It gives them a foundation for their apathy.",2022-04-19 15:53:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593905541,20,/r/lonely/comments/u78du3/nothing_but_toxic_responses_to_loneliness/,,0,16,Nothing but toxic responses to loneliness

3455,u79e38,GoobytheNooby,"I've recently been struggling more than usual when it comes to dating and it has made me do some personal reflection on the fact that I've never had a longstanding girlfriend before. As I'm getting older (currently 25), my mind has begun to wonder into dark territory as I watch so many friends and family members get married and even begin to have children. I've begun to look at myself in the mirror and realize that I am looking more beat down and unhealthy, which is only exacerbating my fears. I work alone often, or with several other men (I'm a PhD student studying metal solidification science), so my likelihood of meeting people, let alone romantic partners, is limited on that front. Furthermore, my favorite past times are videogames, anime, and movies, meaning many of the friends I interact with the most live far away from me. I can literally go days without seeing another person in with little change to my daily schedule. If I hadn't made the effort to come into the office rather than work from home every day, this potential could become a reality.

This has left the dating front entirely to dating apps, which I've only had some luck on. Nothing permanent has ever come from it either. I feel so detached from people that I recently realized that despite my single status, I haven't had a crush on anyone near me in around 3 years. Though this doesn't really mean anything, it just accentuates my feelings of disconnect from others and my fears of being alone most of my life.

I know the solution would be to try and begin something new, enter a new club, and/or begin going to the gym, but I've always been an indecisive person who struggles with build habits; not to mention that many of the clubs I'd be interested (primarily videogame ones) in joining are unfortunately predominantly male. I'd love to try and do something like an intermural sport, but I can't do many cardio based sports as I often get violently ill afterwards.

I know this has come off as very ""neck-beard"" like, but that's not how I feel. I really just feel that I've reached a stop-gap when it comes to building connections with people, both socially and romantically, and I'm struggling with how I can get out of this rut. I'm feeling lonely more often than not. The social groups around encompass either people much younger than me or much older, which has made me nervous about joining as I want to meet people my age. Furthermore, I'm very much a creature of habit and changing my routines is often rare and temporary (another reason I haven't been able to keep up a healthy gym routine).

So I guess the point of the self-pitying ramble is that I need advice. How can I get out of this social rut? What can I do to put myself out there? How can I keep it up? What can I do to get rid of this omnipresent feeling of loneliness?

I know no one in my uni and yes, I finished my second year lmao. My life outside uni is super dry, and I'm not really that close to my family either. I'm still in my early 20s, and after I finish this placement year I'm off to my final year (in a studio apartment). And, honestly, after work or uni stuff I have no one to go back to/ talk to. If I wanted to go out, who am I suppose to go out with lmao xD. When I hear about people's experiences in uni and school in general, I'm just unable to relate. Just goes to show how rubbish my experience in school/uni is with one year left (where everyone probably already have their social circles, with their lavish lifestyle). It just puts my down in the dumps. Recently, I kinda started a self-improvement phase I guess and wanted to do sports (‡∏áÔ∏°'-'Ô∏†)‡∏á I'll be starting in next month or so (left details out for personal reasons. Lame I know. lmao) as well reading books that help (self-improvement ish books). These are some things that I am going to incorporate in my life. But, honestly. I feel like I'm trying wayy too hard to find friends, and sometimes I feel like I'm dabbling in these things to try to escape. But, for some people they have a lot of friends and experience in life, and it's not something they really worked hard for or something it was just natural. It's not like a holy grail wish or something you battled out of an IRL squid game to get. I just don't want to spend my time watching Netflix/ some show or playing some game all the time (I usually hate shows with school tag in it now. Not all, but pretty much most.).

I usually have an uplifting spirit and like to meet people, and whenever I do I never really stay connected or hang out with. And it's like damn broo, this is really killing me. I think it's just that everyone has people they already go with, and I'm like ·ïô(\^‚ñø\^-·ïô) I'm over here too feeling left out. No One wants that, and at the same time, I have no one to go with. It just turns into a pit of loneliness, and unwontedness, like bruh. I have free time right now, and I'm just spending it writing this down...

It like everyone my age has already experienced a lot in life and now the work life is going to take over and I'm just thinking. Did I miss out on my social life. Like this is just too trash and sad to think about I just don't know how to go over it. Any Advice??",2022-04-19 18:28:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650384215,5,/r/lonely/comments/u7by8l/yoo/,,0,1,Yoo

3486,u7euvw,Disasterbi-loner,I had a group of friends once. We all hung out together and shared a lot of memories together.

I gave these people all of my love and trust but then I‚Äôm an instant something changed and they all left me. Just like that. They didn‚Äôt care how it affected me. Suddenly I was a piece of trash to them and I had no idea what I did to make them all hate me so much. It‚Äôs been 2 years since that happened and I now I‚Äôm back at square one. I don‚Äôt know how to socialize anymore because I haven‚Äôt had any friends for so long. And when I do manage to talk to somebody all I can see is their potential to hurt me. I don‚Äôt know what it is about me but it seems like all I can do is push people away or attract all of the wrong type of people where the only thing they‚Äôre capable of is hurting me. I‚Äôve only ever had one relationship and it lasted 1 month. And the longest friendship I had was when I was in elementary school. I think I‚Äôm going to always be alone and it‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm forcing myself to be okay with that fact.

Plz there is help out there



But like does it ever feel like any accomplment or anything you do in life just feels worthless and meaningless without someone in your life.

Could be a friend or a girlfriend or boyfriend 

Like I have my family so I‚Äôm a bit better off than other people 

But like I could accomplish anything and everything I would want but none of it feels worth it without someone to love.


I have dreams and such and have fantasy‚Äôs of getting married one day.


One thing I‚Äôve always wanted to do is cuddle with my hypothetical girlfriend while watching a movie and whisper random trivia.


I never got to do that with my ex.


I feel like I‚Äôll never find someone else again 

I‚Äôm too weak emotionally,I‚Äôm ugly


Sometimes life doesn‚Äôt feel real. I feel like I‚Äôm in third person.

It drives me fucking insane like I have moments where I just wanna spontaneously do shit like I wanna scream at the top of my lungs and laugh like a mad man.

I‚Äôm so desperate for love and companionship 

Not just for kisses or cuddles or even sex but just to love and share with someone

Like I‚Äôm not asexual or anything nor am I really ashamed of being a virgin either. (Or honestly really care)

So don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but I‚Äôm not the kind of guy who would stick his dick in anything that moves.

That isn‚Äôt me trying to shame anyone but it‚Äôs the best way for me to describe how I feel  

I‚Äôve always been more interested in love and companionship Vs sex. If I ever get lucky to ever have sex I want it to be with someone that I trust and they trust me, we both love each other and care for eachother.  

Not that I don‚Äôt like attractive people y‚Äôall are beautiful but I‚Äôm more of a personality kinda guy.


I don‚Äôt make enough money to pay anyone to at least pretend either

Even if I did I just wouldn‚Äôt feel right.

It wouldn‚Äôt be real.


I get envious of people I see them and I‚Äôm just like why can‚Äôt I be them power to them but I want that love and companionship to.

I‚Äôd dedicate my life to someone if I had to.

I just feel pathetic and alone and I wish I had something to take my mind off of it all.

I got members of my family who drink, who smoke weed.

I‚Äôm a lil envious cause I kinda wish I had that but I kinda don‚Äôt want to be dependent on it.

I don‚Äôt like the taste of drink,

I never tried weed before nor really has it never been mysterious to me cause it wasn‚Äôt hidden or demonized in my house

Also like I‚Äôm too embarrassed to ask for help.

Like I really do think I need to talk to a professional I‚Äôm just to embarrassed to ask or talk to my parents about it

I know they‚Äôd listen without judgment and help anyway they can but I can‚Äôt get past myself to ask for help.

Sometimes I think my spirit animal is a squonk.

It‚Äôs this creature from Pennsylvania that is always upset and or crying about itself cause it‚Äôs lonely and ugly and just wants to disappear. It seems to be stuck in its head all the time 


Sleep is my only relief but it‚Äôs a curse also cause I always feel tired I apparently always look tired or sad and if I have a dream where I meet new people I wake up feeling just like the rug was pulled from under me

3515,u7j5vt,Max_Mussi,"My only friend is... My camera, i know that this sounds very stupid, but i genuinally feel a conection with it, i use my computer a lot, but is not the same thing. My dad bought this camera in 2013, and since his passing(2020) i decided to learn how to use it, i started from scratch and now i can safelly say i have mastered it, i know every single quirk and option and filter the camera has, judging by the lighting i can say exacly how much the lens needs to open and how fast must be the capture. I felt is we were building a genuine relationship, every time i wondered throught the woods in search of a subject i felt as if i was on a stroll with a loved one, everytime im with it i feel a deep joy, i feel as if im getting closer and closer to reching my dad's skill level(he was a photographer), i feel that every time i see an old photo made by him, i feel closer to him.

However the camera is not aging very well, its showing signs of corrosion and its starting to fail, the sensation is as bad as seing someone on its death bed.

The camera is a black Nikon Coolpix p520.

Same thing as always, very few matches, start talking to a girl, think we have something in common, even though the chat is a bit one sided, but that is a given on dating apps. Start planning to ask her out and then... She stops replying. How fucking delusional I was again for thinking she would decide to give her attention to me when there so many better people in her dms. I am not even ugly but I I have come to understand that my personality is probably a turn off to all women. I already knew this were gonna turn out this way as soon as I downloaded tinder again. But there is always that sliver of hope that a miracle will happen and I will meet someone.

3531,u7k8gg,tetrismaster16,"Hey everyone, this is my first post. Last year I got accepted to university, and this past fall was my first semester. I was originally excited at first to meet new people and experience university life(I have three friends from home that go to uni), but it devolved. I rarely saw my three friends at university except for one, but once he got a girlfriend he stopped hanging out with me. I decided last semester to join three clubs, however it genuinely felt like no matter how social I was, there was nobody I could match a wavelength with, so I stopped going to clubs. However, one of my friends from home that attends the same university as myself, I fell in love with her(I'm 21 M). However, right when I was going to confess after the club our conversation got cut short, and now she has a boyfriend. We're still good friends even after all these years, but she got a boyfriend in December so I can't tell her how I feel. In addition, I had formed a crush on my RA and asked her out beginning of March, and she rejected me as she just wanted to focus on school and stay as friends. I understood, but it just pivoted my depression further. I know everyone says to love myself and work myself, but that's something I'm always doing so I feel that advice is meaningless. The only things keeping me sane at university is homework, sketching, watching anime, and playing video games. I don't have a car so I can't drive anywhere which sucks since campus is legit in the middle of nowhere. In any case, going to the gym and exercising regularly temporarily helps, but it just sucks I've been here for a year not being able to find friends, romance, or any happiness. At this point I've learned to stop ranting to my friends back at home since I know they don't wanna hear it, so all I've been doing is putting on headphones and playing music as my escape when I go out of my apartment. Sorry if I didn't elaborate as much or explain some things in more detail, it just feels horrible.

How dare I not work at age of 21, not paying for the bills?! Wants me to get out and most likely never return. Considering that tbh, thinking about becoming a homeless traveller, would worry less than with having the life I'm having now.

I-- I'm not much of a crying person, simply I can't do it anymore, but that day I felt like garbage and just cried. Besides that, I tried some e-dating too some time ago.

I have a lot of issues depression and I really want to enjoy life like I used to when I was a kid. Or at least, not thinking about ending my life every moon.

after that - i found a new group of friends. these friends were more ""nerdy"" like me, and i really enjoyed being around them. i didn't hate the fact i wasn't popular, because i had this cool group of friends that all shared similar interests. this group lasted through all of hs, and then we graduated, and suddenly no one talked to me. the friend group still hangs out with everyone else, but not me. i never was invited to hang out again. i tried to send texts and in general be friendly, but they went ignored. it crushed me. the only person i still talk to is one girl, whom i love dearly but we rarely talk and we always say we'll meet up and we never do. we talk maybe every 5 months. but its clear we are not as close as we once were.

since then, ive had a few friends that i call close friends, but they don't consider me to be their best friend. i know this because they never reach out to me. its like i only exist once a month and i get sent a meme every once in awhile (which i don't mind, but whenever i try to have a conversation they suddenly stop responding).

college, same thing. found a friend group, met my bf, and now only my bf talks to me. i was never the person to hang out with their bf over their friends (in fact, im the opposite, probably because im so desperate for friends and connections). 

i started working and met some coworkers and grew close with them; then i moved in with them and now they pretend im not even here. i tried to hang out with them but, alas, my advances were shut down. now i stay in my room and try not to bother them. 

switched jobs. met new people. im trying to be their friend. it has been 6 months and i thought i was getting somewhere and was genuinely excited. but i guess im just...not a fun person to be around, because they are very...nice to me but don't try to put any effort in being around me, if that makes sense. they don't invite me to things. its like im putting in effort and not getting any in return.

now im sitting at my computer crying because i have no one to talk to. my boyfriend is asleep and i can't keep relying on him to support me. i feel like this every night.

i just dont understand. i always go above and beyond with my friends. i always cover them when theyre low on cash. i give them rides. i listen to their vents and make sure they are safe. i always answer right away. i give them nice things. and im not saying they owe me anything, im more than happy to be that person (i am a people pleaser and always will be). i just don't understand why i can't keep a friend. i know its me, obviously. there's something im doing wrong. maybe i just come across as tooo desperate but i really do love to be nice to people. i value my friends more than anything. 

i think i should just accept that im not best friend material. ill always know people, and people know they can rely on me, but that's it. nothing more. 

its affecting my mental health so much. getting to a pretty rough point that im sure will come to a head. 

im just so lonely. i have no one to talk to.

3554,u7medh,Adventurous_Lion2068,"It's been a week since I broke up with my boyfriend. It was was best for us in the long run. Especially seeing how things played out in the end. But the pain... I forgot how bad it could hurt. With him, I got to see what it feels like to be loved and wanted by someone. To see what it's like to be truly celebrated for the big, and small accomplishments. To have someone you could turn to with every little thing, every feeling, every rant, every good and bad thing. Who you could just live life with. We were able to do that for the little bit we were together. But then, things came to an end. It felt so abrupt. Without warning. He was taken from me just like that. 

In us parting, he said some pretty hurtful things. While I on the other hand, tried to do everything in the kindest way possible. I made many mistakes. But we all do. We're human. We aren't perfect. But the longing for someone to love me, want me, cherish me like he did. Or like others in the past who turned extremely toxic. I want something. Someone. Who will last. And will give life that meaning I've been searching for for years and years. Is it too much to ask for? I feel like my expectations for someone are too high. But yet ""you shouldn't settle for anything less. You deserve someone who treats you right. And nothing less.""

I dunno. I'm just feeling especially lonely tonight. And didn't have anyone to really rant to. I don't expect anyone to see or care about this post.

3594,u7ptmu,thomasthehipposlayer,"We live in an age of incredible technology. It‚Äôs easier to connect than ever, and yet people are measurably and scientifically lonelier now than we were 30 years ago. Men report only having half as many friends on average now. Even the amount of sex people have has fallen. People feel disconnected. Younger generations struggle with social anxiety and real life interactions far more than their older counterparts.

Unfortunately, technologies that make it easier to connect also make it easier not to. We have endless entertainment at our fingertips. We have a constant stream of infinite stimulation. We can drown our boredom without having to so much as get out of bed. But maybe, just maybe, we needed that boredom. Boredom was nature‚Äôs way of getting us to go out, meet people, make connections, do stuff. Now we often use our easy communication power to cancel on the few plans we do have. Being a recluse is now easier than ever.

And the constant stimulation has left us restless - we‚Äôre overstimulated. It‚Äôs harder to find the energy or drive to do things. Instead we watch other people do exciting things on a screen while we ourselves do nothing. We let others do our living for us.

We talk more than ever on social media, but we don‚Äôt form interpersonal connections. People are much harsher online, and it can harm peoples confidence to be exposed to constant negativity. Our quantity of communication has skyrocketed, but our connections with each other have plummeted.

I don‚Äôt know what the solution is. I love modern technology, and it has a lot of wonderful, good, and useful applications. I just wish we could change it to connect us meaningfully instead of constant surface-level interactions with no deeper connection. The way we use the technology is just human nature, and we can‚Äôt change that, but maybe the technology itself can change in a way that encourages us to connect. I hope so.

Anyway, that‚Äôs just my two cents.",2022-04-20 06:09:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650119695,22,/r/lonely/comments/u7ptmu/technology_that_should_connect_us_is_making_us/,,0,6,Technology that should connect us is making us lonely.

**General/Dudes**

I'm 43, and I game on Xbox fairly regularly so that could surely be a shared activity. Have a good-sized library of games with some range, and was able to score a Series X last month. Other hobbies include cooking, fishing, gardening, getting back into shape (yoga/stretching, walking, weights, etc.), dieting and breaking said diet to try new restaurants...I have a deep love for sushi and tapas in particular. Additional possible points of conversation:

* Mostly politically liberal, though I have *some* conservative leanings around family ideology. Honestly I think the American system is effed in the A, I greatly admire the Nordic countries but don't dare invoke the ""S"" word.
* Parenting - Two kids, 20(f) and 15(s). Daughter lives away from me but regularly visits, son is week on, week off with mom. Being a dad is what I believe I did best with my life and one of the few things I will ""brag"" about myself on.
* NBA - Huge Celtics fan, don't follow the broader sport as closely as I used to but still know a decent amount. Son plays hoops so it's kind of our thing hehe.
* Relationships - Hindsight is always 20/20 but I've learned everything possible from my mistakes and enjoy hearing the opinions/perspectives of others as well. Have also been told I missed my calling (as a counselor) so if you're in a bummer relationship I'd be happy to provide an ear and outside perspective.  


**Ladies**

I don't envy y'all, as much as it sucks to be a lonely guy online (I'm forever running into lame bots/scammers across a multitude of sites; it's like I'm lonely and depressed, not a fuggin' idiot haha) I could easily see the opinion you have it worse. Unsolicited advances (or even worse pics), your own scammers/bots and I'd argue imagery shredding your self-image is far more pervasive and impactful.

I'm not here looking for a date or relationship. I would not be OPPOSED, mind you, doubt many of us on this sub would be. I'd simply NEVER be the one to **initiate** flirting, *let alone* *anything* *else*. We're all just lonely humans seeking some sort of solace and possibly connections. I've always got on very well with women in a friendly sense and often times that's enough.

I have some amazing friends, barely any family but I love them. I'm afraid I'm going to go too deep and end my life. It's been getting worse and worse.  I'm just that orphan child no one ever cared for, then I grew up and never cared about myself until it was too late.  All I want is to feel cared about and included in something. I'm considering joining the army with the youth I have left. Idk what's the best way to make something in my life matter. I don't want to die as a useless, invisible nothing.

3694,u88bq1,PFFlikeyouneedtoknow,"Hey, how ya doing? Better i then yesterday, i hope. Is this a good place to talk about my story? Well it better be, because I'm going to do it anyway! P

I've never been diagnosed with depression before because my parents never cared enough for my mental health to get me checked. I've only ever had therapy once before and it was only when i told the both of them that i hate them.

I only said that to set the scenario. I always denied the idea that i was depressed because who wants to be depressed, right? But i was definitely fucked up in the head. I never got into things like self harm or drugs fortunately, but what i did do was isolate myself to a point where I'd go to school, be annoyed by everything, then go home and sleep. Hygiene was pretty bad i wont lie to ya.

I still remember when it started. My dad was having an affair with multiple women and it really hit me when they would be arguing all day every day. Luckily my dad never hit my mom but he did treat her like shit. And she projected all that negativity on to me whenever she'd take me on car rides to school.

To give you an example of what the ride was like :"" People are snakes. They don't really care about you and take advantage of you because they think that you're gullible and naive. Don't be fooled by foolish people. Everyone who acts like they're your friend has an ulterior motive. People are evil"" trust nobody, etc etc. Basically, every car ride I'd constantly be reminded that nobody truly cares about me.

The pressure of the threat of my parents splitting and those negative subliminal messages really hit me man. I was depressed for 2 years and told nobody about it because i believed the words my mom told me. I pushed away alot of good people man. I'm doing what I can to mend those relationships now and I'm trying to help my current friends who are depressed.

One day i was set on killing myself, but someho god sent a smile my way or some shit and my crush at the time called me. I picked up the phone trying to act slick and confident but i know she could tell i was doing shitty. She really saved my life dude. That's crazy to think about sometimes. She's also going through a rough time now so I'll do my best to be there for her aswell because i really care about her ( she isn't my crush anymore, just a good friend now) 

How i got over it?  I don't even know to be honest with you. My feelings kinda morphed from depression into hate. I hate the way the world is. I hate that people suck. I hate my parents and the way they nade me feel. That hate is probably what drove me to taking action. I'm really petty and competitive, so i like the idea of murdering any motherfucker that stands in my way, and making my enemies suffer or proving them wrong. For like a year ( whole of last year) I've just been working on self improvement. Working out, learning to fight,  meditation. I wanted to feel powerful, and now i do. Nothing can stop me as I am right now. I'm in grade 12 btw:)

So after that year of development, my feelings turned from ""i hate everything"" into ""man I'm really awesome"" I've got so much love for myself it's kinda scary sometimes. I still hate my parents though! Fuck those motherfuckers I'm gonna find a way to sustain myself and cut then off of my life.

But yeah man i feel really good. Everything seems so clear to me now. I don't cry anymore, and not because I'm holding it in or anything, i just feel like all i gotta do when life puts pressure on me is beat the shit out of life. I love me dude. I'll do my best to help my friends feel the same way about themselves, so wish me luck. Nobody deserves to be depressed.

I don't even know if my story made sense üíÄ I'm gonna copy and paste it into different communities because why not. This is really just a brain dump and i want to put it in everyone's face, whether they'll like it or not.

Find yourself man, fuck life. Life's a bitch. Would you really let a bitch get you down though? I know its tough but keep ya head up king/queen. I feel like i can say i love you guys. I don't know why I'm usually very careful with who i say those words to. But we're all trying to get through our shitty feelings, right? I feel like i can kinda bond with all of you over those shitty feelings. So yeah, i love you guys xx",2022-04-20 22:29:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627000853,3,/r/lonely/comments/u88bq1/can_i_talk_about_how_i_overcame_my_depression_here/,,0,2,Can i talk about how i overcame my depression here?

1. I am randomly ghosted for no reason. 
2. We meet up once and then the communication slows down to almost a stop. They suddenly claim they're "" busy"" or "" busy with work "" or something like that when they were somehow just able to text all day just days before even though their schedule hasn't changed any. 
3. They come up with some excuse as to why they don't want to talk anymore. 

This is so frustrating. I recently came across this guy on a dating app and it was gong okay. I wasn't really too into him but I talked to him anyways. We had made "" plans"" to meet up, although I had a fejjf the whole time it wouldn't happen and then last night he succeeds we facetime. We did and it went okay I guess. 

Well today I have heard nothing from him. I texted him once he said he was "" busy working"". I haven't heard anything since. My feelings aren't hurt over him because I didn't really care for him anyways but they are because this ALWAYS happens. I'm almost 30 and I don't want to be this old still doing this shit.

3734,u8d9uc,Miahrod831,"Before I got into the shower I almost started crying looking into the mirror trying to smile, and so to avoid breaking down I decided to just get in the shower and relax. But I ended up breaking down anyways. I was trying to remember times in my life when I'd been happy but I just couldn't for the life of me remember anything, and when I did finally remember something and also remember that soon after Whatever it was that I was happy about was taken away from me. Whether it be my best friend no longer talking to me, my great grandfather dying from cancer after recovering and then my mom being diagnosed in the same week, or my whole prom incident thing. It just seems like when I'm happy it's only temporary and more often than not I end up sadder than I was before. I've always tried to make friends to sort of ease the pain and have someone I can lean on when I'm in need and be the same for someone else if need be, but one way or another everyone just ends up leaving me behind like they never cared about me in the first place, and no matter what I do to keep them around they just don't say. 

I mean it had been 3yrs since I last talked to a group of friends I've met and thought they finally accepted me, only to find out that most of them were still keeping in touch with one another and hanging out while I was struggling to talk to them and get them to talk to me. One of them even has a kid now and I only found out because I forced myself one last time to try and reach out to them. Now we are supposed to meet this Monday but I feel as though it's all just an act to make themselves feel better for not even trying to talk to me since highschool, and I don't even care because it's been so long since I've hung out with anyone who I thought of as a friend or even had a friend at all.

Then all these thoughts just started flooding into my head, while I was trying to remember my life and remember the things that used to make me happy, but I just can't remember anything everything is just a huge blur. Then I realized that the only thing I had left that makes me feel less alone is my family, but then for a split second I went to the one place in my mind that I hadn't even realized I'd been avoiding. My family has always meant so much to me as they are the only constant in my life, the only thing that I know is here when I inevitably get shot down or left behind by the people I meet in my social life. The only problem is that they expect so much from me, everyone expects so much from me. They are always saying how smart I am and how I destined for great things, and I've been so focused on trying to make them happy and live up to their expectations that I've been driving myself crazy. Because it seems that no matter how hard I try I always seem to fail.

That's when I really lost it, what if I'm not able to live up to their expectations, what if I end up disappointing them, what if I let them down and don't become the person I'm supposed to. And then they leave me too. And then I'm truly alone with no one left in the world to love me. I already don't have anyone who I think considers me a friend, no girl out there wants to be with me, and if I'm not able to figure something out and find out what to do with my future it's only a matter of time til my family starts to shun me and become distant as well.

I don't want to be alone, I'm so full of love and I just want someone to be able to share it with. I try my best to be nice and I do what I can to stay positive, but I don't know how to move forward anymore. I know my life isn't that difficult and I know there are people out there going through much worse than what I've been through. All I want is something to be happy about, something I can remember, but right now it just seems like that's not possible and what I'm destined for isn't a life of happiness but something full of loneliness",2022-04-21 02:39:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600828796,1,/r/lonely/comments/u8d9uc/i_just_broke_down_in_the_shower/,,0,3,I just broke down in the shower

I always say I think they look great and if I could treat them to a drink or something. And I've never had anyone run away or freak out but the result is always the same - a polite decline. Maybe I am just ugly haha but at least I am fit and don't smell bad. I know this is a me thing and no one else's fault but just wanted to vent a little bit since I absolutely despise dating apps and refuse to pay for premiums or an upgraded account so I keep trying the more traditional way despite the lack of success lately. One thing I tell myself is although some days I feel like a huge loser, a real loser is someone who won't even try so thats what motivates me to keep trying.

3753,u8f2dk,Mammoth_Procedure_55,"In the summer of 2020 I had a incident with a relative of mine that put me in jail for about a week until the prosecutor decided not to press charges because it was justified self-defense. As soon as I got back to my place I packed up all my things that I could put them in my car and I left because it was no longer safe for me to be there. This post isn't about that situation is just about the last two years since I've been living out of my car.

Man it's just so hard on me knowing that I really don't matter. All of my friends family co-workers etc, I've always said we'll have your back no matter what, only to have my request to do laundry at a friend's house the first week I was homeless not denied but ignored, and the same thing happened with countless other friends and family members. I don't understand why people do that, they extend their love to you verbally or on social media but when the rubber hits the road they don't want to do anything and it's okay you know they're not obligated to do anything for me. And that's one thing I learned the last 2 years is that people will just say things just the same you know. 

Another time a person who I called my best friend / brother laughed at me in a text message because I was using the 7-Eleven app and if I had somebody sign up using my link I could get a free two slices of pizza or something like that. And he responded with laughing emojis, I already send the link and nothing happened. Once again nobody's obligated to do anything for me or to help me. The hardest part was my birthday was last month in March and just like last year nobody called me, nobody remembered and I used to never really you know take too much stock in the birthdays, but man it hurts so bad no one that once you're out of the picture, don't have any money, can't hang out or go to the clubs or any of the stuff we used to do, you're pretty much nothing to them. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this post and I feel like I'm just rambling but man I'm really kind of just feeling this loneliness and it's it's hurting me so bad. Abnormalize the thought of me being worthless, and my wife not meeting anything because what do you do when the people that you think are supposed to love you don't? Their days man where I wish I had never been born, cuz it's not the homelessness it's not living out of my car it's not being able to eat for the last 2 weeks, it's the nothing, that silence no text messages no calls not even somebody coming up to the place where you kind of hang during the day when you're not doing anything to check up on you. 

I swear the only thing that's keeping me going at this point is that my father's still alive and I don't want to put them through having to bury me or any nonsense like that. I'm not perfect nobody is but I wonder sometimes what did I do to deserve this? Not the homelessness but the lack of love from everybody who cared when everything was good 

I don't really know why I'm posting this I usually don't use social media much but I just felt like I just needed just to say something to somebody maybe just to get it off my chest to vent I don't know. But if anybody has any advice how to manage this feeling it would be much appreciated.",2022-04-21 04:18:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644624673,9,/r/lonely/comments/u8f2dk/two_years_homeless_and_im_invisible/,,0,7,two years homeless and I'm invisible

3757,u8fk0a,bikersquid333,"I can't remember clearly but apparently I had a small friend group of three guys in kindergarten and reception as we call it in the UK, so age 4 or 5 maximum. Unfortunately that was the end of my friendship days. Since then, and as far back as I can actually remember, I've had huge difficulty making and keeping friends. I've never felt truly loved or wanted or appreciated by a fellow peer,  if that makes sense? I haven't been able to connect with anyone on a deeper level and what makes it so painful is that I'm literally the opposite person of who you might think to be typing this. I get along very well with everyone I meet but only at a purely acquaintance/small talk level. 

I put it down to my upbringing and always being the odd one out or unique should I say because I'm definitely not odd, and I've been told many times that I'm not 'odd' as well. I grew up ripping through the streets on my bike with my brother and a couple neighbourhood kids. I was climbing trees, exploring, crossing rivers and flying through the monkey bars and slides at my local park, etc üòÅ. I didn't even know what video games were until much later and I'm thankful for it because objectively I had a great childhood playing so many different sports and my parents really did give me everything they could have...

Except maybe the ability to stand up for myself and fight back the bullies and weak sheeple who looked down on me because I had long hair for a time and probably talked about different things to them. Even the parents of my school mates would look at me weird and for me to remember and even acknowledge that as a kid, it must've been very toxic. Later on in high school I was similarly ostracized by certain teachers as well, never mind my peers. It's been an excruciatingly slow, painful and most importantly consistent downward spiral of diminishing self esteem, self confidence, self assurance, contentment, happiness. 

I have always stayed strong and stuck to my guns, never sold out and that's probably why I haven't been able to 'fit in'. Thing is, I see so many genuinely 'odd' or 'unique' people and they seem to find each other and honestly couldn't be happier. Full love to them, I'm envious of their joy and how easy it seems for them to make friends even if just with one another. I'm just completely baffled and disheartened why I just can't seem to make any headway with fellow human beings. I mean shit, even animals like me! I have two cats and they are great and all the dogs and cats and other pets of people I've met over the years have always been good with me (I mention it because I do believe they have a 6th sense) and can tell a good person from bad. 

Oh, and I've never been in a proper relationship so double, triple, quadruple whammy üôÑüòÇ. Everyone says my standards are too high but then I think on it and always come back to the answer 'why shouldn't I have high standards?' (which tbh are not high at all, I just haven't found someone yet who is physically active and intelligent, but humble and down-to-earth at the same time). It's always one or the other unfortunately I won't settle for less since it wouldn't do either of us any favours in the long run. 

And in the end, I always end up alone, completely isolated from everyone. It seems like people want absolutely nothing to do with me unless they are getting something out of me. I've recently dropped out of uni because of this mental anguish and I was abused by my last boss so quit the job and I'm at a real crux in my life right now.

3767,u8gpjn,Weary_Acceptance,"Relatively old quote which it's hard to say the originator, ""You'll worry less about what people think of you, when you realize how seldom they do!"" Olin Miller (presumed)  
Sometimes it seems we let ourselves get bogged down by what other people think, or let their opinions on us shape our outlook on ourselves. While it's never a bad thing to take constructive criticism, we can't let someone's sour mood because of something outside of either of our control hurt us to such a degree. Of course someone badmouthing us will hurt, but we should see if we can take anything from said badmouthing and grow, even if just to spite their faulty opinion of us.  
They'll more than likely forget the following day, week, whatever, but while you might remember that, it won't matter to them. Even if you see them every day, especially if they're commonly in a bad mood! While taking care of yourself, take care of those you love, and if they're not adding something to your life? Even if it's something as simple as a smile and kind words when you're at your lowest, seriously look at if you need them.  
Loving yourself is important, you're the only one you'll have to live with for the rest of your lives.

I have been communicating with only 3 people for the last year and a half and im staying home 95% of the time only taking slight walks as i have a light form of agoraphobia. Im very emotional and really enjoy seeing people in love and , obviously , falling in love. Thats the reason why my main source of entertainment is watching romance-drama ( both movies and anime ). Recently i , pretty much , fell for a fictional character and i realize my feelings are pretty real as it has no actual difference from my previous feelings for a real person. My question is , is it normal for a person like me, who is constantly feeling lonely, to fall in love with a fictional character or it can happen to basically everybody who lacks interest for too long in real people.

That being said, I still wonder what it would be like to find one of those special people that do anything for someone they are committed to. I know I use to be one of them, and I‚Äôm sure this Sub is full of people that are, or use to be that way. You see those characters in movies and shows‚Ä¶they fight so hard for the person they love and in the end they live happily ever after. 

I burned that concept into my soul. No matter the situation, I would fight through anything and do whatever I could to maintain my relationships/friendships. Sadly‚Ä¶those were all fictional stories I was watching. The reality is, those of us that do anything for those we care about usually just end up being used and eventually tossed aside when we aren‚Äôt needed. 

This post isn‚Äôt meant to be a downer though, but just the thoughts going through my mind at the moment. Those of us that have given our all and still ended up being tossed aside, we are still treasures. Just because we were used, and not treated fairly doesn‚Äôt make us ‚Äúless‚Äù or garbage. It just means we put all of our efforts into someone that was  blind as to what a truly caring person is really worth. 

We are still treasures. We may not shine as brightly as we use to, but we are still worthy of being loved and cared for‚Ä¶truly ‚Äútreasured‚Äù for what we have to offer someone else. We may not all find that one person that we would like to treat us that way, but that doesn‚Äôt diminish our worth. We are priceless, and if others don‚Äôt see everything we have to offer, that‚Äôs their problem, not ours. Does it hurt being a treasure in a world full of blind people? Absolutely. But just know, I see you‚Ä¶and you are beautiful. And if I see you, that means others do to‚Ä¶and who knows, hopefully the person you want to see you, will.

I woke up that day and I could not get out of bed. I couldn‚Äôt move my legs or my arms or my hands, just my head. I was later taken to the hospital, and because of the severity of my paralysis I had to be put on a ventilator. Now all of this happened in my sleep, which means there were no signs or nothing ahead of time where I knew this would‚Äôve happened.

Everyday is a struggle for me. Nearly every time I wake up I'm introduced to yelling or nagging. Today I just found out since I live far away from it, I ha to transfer from my current school, one of the main highlights in my life, for a worse one because it's in zone. My mother emotionally and mentally tires me out. Last year I went through immense depression because of it, and self-harm. Last year also, she had a baby, which only made my life worse, because I am sensitive to loud noises and she always screams. And now, in about a month, she's having another one, which makes a bad situation worse. My friends were the only people in my life who made me feel better overall, even though sometimes I felt jealous how they got to hang out with each other and had fun, while I'm basically forced to stay at home all the time. And now I have to leave all of that behind. I went through so much the past few years that I can't even cry anymore even if I wanted. It feels like I have no control over anything that makes me happy. And it gives me a feeling of existential dread sometimes.

I was always a lonely kid, not but choice, but by undesirable circumstances. I want the unconditional attention I've been craving. Someone to say that ""it's okay"" or ""we're in this together"" but unfortunately, this isn't the case, and it's starting to fill me with dread and even pent up sorrow for something that could be. I'm just slogging through everyday at this point with little to no hope (at least for two more years) for my situations to get any better.

This isn't living. I want to actually live. To not be mentally and emotionally out down by my mother, to not jump everytime a loud noise happens, to, be at peace with myself and actually feel calm and not filled with constant worry. To not feel jealous when seeing how other people are actually living. To feel the unconditional support I've been craving my whole life. May it be a girlfriend, or just a good friend. If I had a girlfriend like that, I would do anything for her lol.

But yeah, this is my life now. Right now, I'm just tired. That's all.",2022-04-21 23:45:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646156755,5,/r/lonely/comments/u90vzc/i_live_a_miserable_life_and_im_only_16/,,0,3,I live a miserable life and I'm only 16.

If you cba reading skip the first paragraph :)

I have had so many incidences where i made a plan with friends got all excited and then they cancelled and i guess it happens but when it happens so many times i just lost trust in making plans and losing all friends. I am kind of an introvert but love having people around i feed of their energy when i go skateboarding and there is people around i am kinda happy. i dont have any friends in the country i live in but thats another story

And now the fun part :) i got a girlfriend and i am really trying to push myself to be some what excited for anything we plan. We are planning going to itally and i just feel like i dont care or just like meh and i know i would be excited before this mood swing.

Also its really weird i am the only one in my entire family thats kinda lonely and not excited about anything i havent had a proper friend in my country for 15 years i dont know why i dont fit in but no one gives me a chance after the first initial meet

Any tips ? I dont want to bore or kill the happy mood of my gf.

All i get excited about is skating and gym but its different every 2 months my entire life which is annoying too ... Any help or tips to live in the moment and be more excited at a given time would help.

Today I just found out since I live far away from it, I ha to transfer from my current school, one of the main highlights in my life, for a worse one because it's in zone. My mother emotionally and mentally tires me out. Last year I went through immense depression because of it, and self-harm. Last year also, she had a baby, which only made my life worse, because I am sensitive to loud noises and she always screams. And now, in about a month, she's having another one, which makes a bad situation worse. My friends were the only people in my life who made me feel better overall, even though sometimes I felt jealous how they got to hang out with each other and had fun, while I'm basically forced to stay at home all the time.

It feels like I have no control over anything that makes me happy. And it gives me a feeling of existential dread sometimes.

I was always a lonely kid, not but choice, but by undesirable circumstances. I want the unconditional attention I've been craving.

3897,u91hww,Silly_Garbage_3523,"I was unexpectedly promoted at work today. I got a big raise and a lot of praise from my manager. I was feeling really happy and proud of myself and wanted to share the good news with my 2 friends. I was hoping they would hype me up a bit and congratulate me on my accomplishment, like friends usually do. I sent them a message and one of them left me on read while the other just said ""congrats"" and immediately started talking about something else. It made me feel really bad. It seems like they don't care at all. Are they even happy for me? This happens every time I share something important with them. I get the bare minimum. Had the roles been reversed I would have been really happy for them and would have asked them to tell me all about how the promotion happened, what are they getting promoted to, etc. Why is it that I never get this kind of energy back from them? Am I not worth it?? 
It makes me feel really lonely. Like no one cares about my feelings and my life, not even my ""friends"" who are supposed to care about these things. 

Has anyone ever experienced this with their own friends? I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to cry. I'm so lonely.

EDIT: I decided to be brave and tell my friend (the one who left me on read) that I was hurt and I wish she would've said something. I was really nervous because I never really stand up for myself like that. She ended up apologizing and she congratulated me as well. I'm still a little hurt but I appreciate her apology and won't hold this against her anymore.

she got into a relationship about a month ago and i am really happy for her. but a small part of me is jealous because in my 20 years i have never, ever come close to having a boyfriend.

i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. i tried dating apps, but i feel like i get too attached. it‚Äôs so confusing differentiating between dating for sex &amp; dating for relationships. i did date a guy for a relationship once. he basically said he didn‚Äôt like me, but found me really attractive so wanted to keep having casual sex. he ghosted me shortly after. i sobbed and still don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm fully healed.

so i decided to stop dating for relationships and just sex instead. found a guy, we‚Äôd been trying to make plans but he was always busy, then eventually stopped texting me altogether. i didn‚Äôt think i was attached to him until i once again, cried and cried and am now feeling like there‚Äôs something intrinsically wrong with me. 

and this has happened so many times, with so many different boys. i don‚Äôt even believe they actually find me attractive anymore, because i seriously don‚Äôt understand matching with someone you find attractive, messaging them, and then proceeding to not put in any effort to keep them in your life. i hold on to every boy i find attractive because honestly i‚Äôm picky and it‚Äôs really exhausting having to go start over on dating apps.

I know it‚Äôs more about the connection but you can eventually establish that when you build up the courage to talk to the people already in your life. On the other hand, when I say I have no friends it isn‚Äôt an exaggeration and it also isn‚Äôt due to lack of trying.

Then you've got people who are always seen as worthless by their friends, have never had any close knit friends, just ultimately fail in that department. But will find it easy to have a partner. 

I just do not understand why this is. I have an acquaintance/friend who is the above. I thought he was awesome, understanding, tender-hearted, a big softie, etc. So did his friends. But whenever he tried to meet someone, they'd often flake on him, the conversations would be one-sided, they would just straight up treat him as worthless. 

Then there's me, who fits the second category. But my partner keeps mentioning how much I mean to him, that he has never met a more caring person, etc.

3989,u9de9s,ElTheStrange,"I know things could be worse. Much worse. So the fact I am feeling this way bugs the fuck outta me. My threshold is crap for things like this. 

I see many stories and people able to have friends that last through life. Why cant I even have 1 friend like that? Willing to deal with my crap as I have put up with so many others because I cared for them. However, when it comes to me.. Fuck me. Fuck what I feel. Is it really that wrong?

I have never really had a stable group of friends. Usually because I left for reasons or they disbanded and went separate ways. 

There has been a circle of friends that I had I held kinda close. It was a really good group. However, the person I am cohabiting with to help take care of our child has not made it easy for me. We are exes and with the economy, its been difficult finding separate places. I recently tried getting back into contact with someone I used to talk to and they couldnt handle it. We got into some arguments. I wanted to reach out to my support network and he couldnt handle it. Im sure it cost me a couple friends and im about ready to drop the other two because I feel like a terrible friend and I want to say fuck it on being social because I am tired of the drama.  Tired of the back and forth. I feel so fucking alone and just want to talk to somebody without feeling like the only person I can talk to is someone I dont want to talk to nor trust completely. So, might as well focus on the very basic and important. 

I have no family above me or around my age range but my mother to talk to and we arent that close. And she doesnt want to hear everything. She may listen, but she is very You On Your Own For The Most Part. 

I just want to freaking lie down in the sun and soak it up like a damn lizard right now. Seriously. Im so tired of all the turmoil and shit. I know many of us are and are struggling to hold on for unknown reasons. I just hope, like many, there is a good fucking reason.

4020,u9jq8t,Extra-Wall-3990,"So, there's this person I used to talk to online. Mostly my friendships would end in a month or so, but this one lasted for almost an year. It was fun in the beginning, there's always something to talk about even after tons of differences. It was quite fun honestly. 

But after a month or so, the intensity started to fade and the differences started to kick in. And as a result I drifted away. But, they were, I guess really a lonely and checked up on me time to time. It was bit of a work to answer the same things over and over again, but we did carry on for quite a while. 

When I met them, I was down. But, gradually my situation improved and I would get bored of hearing their stories. I did not respond to their texts for many days. I was just carrying on, quite frankly I was bored of hearing the same old monotonous stories. 

Whenever I stopped answering, they would try to initiate a conversation time after time. And I ""didn't need that"".  But eventually, they stopped trying to talk to me. It's been a long time now, we haven't talked. 

I never thought I would want to talk to them again. All those friends I made a while back, well dynamics keep changing and I am back to being a loner. I would love to have someone to talk to now, and I feel so guilty of ghosting this friend. 

They were a good friend. I'm pretty sure they would've heard me out and encouraged me. Their advice might not have always worked out for me, but they always listened and at least tried to help. I feel I've taken advantage of them, I realized I never listened to them much. I was selfish.

I'm lonely once again and I've tried making more friends here, but none of them would feel like that.

Sound familiar?

Welcome to Imposter Syndrome. You‚Äôre in good company. Nigella Lawson, Michelle Obama, Lady GaGa and Lily Allen have all shared their imposter syndrome experiences publicly. But what is this demon?

It‚Äôs an umbrella term, under which lives one or more limiting beliefs such as those generalised ones above. They may be accompanied by more specific beliefs. These are typically formed rationally in childhood and, as children, may serve us well. For example;

¬∑ I need everyone to approve of me. 

¬∑ To be a valued I must succeed in everything I do.

¬∑ It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am  bad.

¬∑ I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way.

¬∑ Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves.

¬∑ I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain.

¬∑ Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me.

What would your own list look like?

However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well ‚Äì and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of our childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most of these will be innocuous most of the time but some of them will, sometimes, impede our performance as high functioning, inter-dependent, adults. As adults, we benefit from identifying our limiting beliefs, and growing in to more valuable beliefs. 

By way of an example, a common limiting belief sitting under the Imposter Syndrome umbrella is ‚ÄòI must compare myself to others‚Äô which can be re-framed to ‚ÄòI live my own life on my own terms‚Äô or ‚ÄòI have a unique set of character strengths, as do others‚Äô. In turn the re-framed beliefs can underpin valuable affirmations such as ‚ÄòBecause I live my own life, I enjoy the successes of others‚Äô or ‚ÄòI choose to celebrate my successes without reference to other‚Äôs accomplishments‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe fact that I choose to live my life authentically means I only compare myself against my own standards‚Äô. 

A standard element of working with PERMA hypnotherapy is developing a high degree of self-awareness via exploring your characters strengths, values, beliefs and limiting beliefs which paves the way to defining your identity. In turn, this leaves you ideally placed to choose your own best future. 

Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as ‚Äì by its very nature ‚Äì it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‚Äòus‚Äô and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal for when we need to take those big steps forward.",2022-04-22 18:26:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602891040,5,/r/lonely/comments/u9l8rx/and_who_do_you_think_you_are/,,0,0,And who do you think you are?

I have no leadership qualities I guess. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm inherently awful and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person. I just wish I had friends but I know it‚Äôs my own fault that I don‚Äôt. I wish I could fast forward interactions to the part where I am comfortable and can be myself and we like one another.

I started noticing something was off around 8th grade, because everyone had begun to form tight friend groups.

I still don't necessarily belong to any friend group and I don't even have close friends (or family, for that matter), but I feel like I don't deserve to be lonely since I have so many people I get along with just fine.

This might sound kinda ridiculous.. maybe it's more appropriate for r/intp.. but, um... 

It's just been really emotionally weighty to me. I have talent as an artist, a writer (prose and poetry), and I love to try to come up with things. Because of these good qualities:

*---One ex decided to burn her drawings.*

*---Ex after that: decided to burn her drawings. Was unaware the previous ex did the same, to my recollection.*

*---My final ex: completely gave up on drawing because of me, didn't want to hear any poetry that's not directly about her, and got jealous of the characters I was coming up with for my story. I love jealousy and clingy women, but not over fictional characters. I really hope that she is truly happy now. It still hurts after all this time. T-T*

...........

This probably sounds like satire, but I swear on my life it's reality. I genuinely feel like I'm cursed. I even feel emotional writing this.

Then again, I kinda understand. My father's a highly skillful musician, so the thought of learning music is very daunting for me.

Anyways..... what even.. now thinking about it makes me feel like I want to laugh, but I don't. I really don't.

The only people who seemed to have any fascination in me have been various teachers and my parents. I don't like sharing stuff with my parents. I think I felt a bit of attraction to a certain professor I had that seemed a bit fascinated by my work. I guess that's irrelevant. I'm not special. There's plenty of talented people who put more effort into their work and have lots to show for it. 

Now I'm not in college anymore, so that feeling of, well, what I described.. I'm not getting that anymore. That specific kind of attention that I've always craved. But even then, it wasn't by someone who had romantic interest in me. So it wasn't enough. Nobody has fulfilled this for me. But I know I'd feel this way for an equally or even lesser-talented woman that I were in a relationship with.

There is a definitive memory from when I was in kindergarten. I was drawing a semi truck in (a flawed) perspective, and the teacher complimented me on it, very surprised. Then, the class tsundere looked down at it, and told me that it looked good. I think that memory still resonates with me. In kindergarten, later on, I briefly ran a ""game design club"" in one of the rooms during our recess time. Is it weird to peak in kindergarten?

And here I am now... I am floating through space on this bed just getting dragged through time. Wishing that, what, someone was obsessed with me? I'm not a narcissist, right? I mean, I have low self esteem, but I like some of my personality traits that are considered toxic and I know my creative and artistic value. I feel a bit guilty for actually getting to the point of liking myself. Granted, I have some vanity issues with how I look. Hm....... and I'm practically a kuudere.. 

I can't help but think of the negative impacts I've had on most of the people I've dated. I've tried to help them, but I have had negative long term effects on them. I'll continue to bear this guilt, and I hope that this cycle can be broken, without me not dating again, because I'm too stubborn.

So, a call to action: *I'm going to make the best fucking webcomic single-handedly, plot-wise, emotions-wise, witiness-wise, poetry-wise, and... probably not art-wise, but it'll be damn sufficient, and visualized through the lense of my peculiar mind that adds colorful abstractions for the portrayal of mood in the absence of music! And I WILL get at least one fucking fan who eagerly awaits my greatest creation!*

Meanwhile, I'll just be here floating through space. ‚úåÔ∏è

Throughout my time in uni i spent the majority of my weekends working as a door man and security guard at other venues. i also struggled with anxiety during this time and even though i made friends at uni, the combo of living at home and my course being split over different departments meant i never got close to anyone.

 Anyway ive now graduated and started to tackle my anxiety. im finally wanting to get out a bit more and now the mates i have left dont want to because theyre done with it, settled diwn, moved on or just not interested in going out like that. i feel like a real saddo now. just to be clear i have been out before and obviously worked there too but i feel like my anxiety screwed me over some of the best times i could have.

4131,ua2s20,aut0antibody,"I'm finding it hard to not be complacent at work; most days I feel like I'm running on autopilot. I've taken more responsibilities at work with a promotion. Everyone said I'd be perfect for the job and I believed them. Idek why I applied for it, I was feeling more confident that day probably. I've since weaned down to 5mg from 20mg of lexapro, and lately I've been feeling more anxious and depressed. Like self-deprecating, excessive worrying, always belittling myself, feeling like I'm not good enough, stuff like that. I used to be numb to those feelings and I just needed the meds to know that I can ignore those thoughts. I work in a clinical lab, I believe in medicine, and I needed some external thing to help me understand that I can ignore those thoughts. And at my fullest dose, I was able to do it. I just needed to know that it was doable, and being on those meds proved it.

I don't want to be on lexapro anymore because I want to control these thoughts on my own without the help of ssri's..I mean, I was doing really well actually. But today I just had a bad day at work, and I felt like a failure or like worthless or something.

How the fuck do I stop feeling sorry for someone for doing their job?! It's their job! But why do I feel like an inconvenience? Or a burden? How do you stop feeling like that?

So basically I'm not trying to be narcissistic or get attention but I think God has cursed me with being better looking than my classmates

I'll explain why it's a curse and why it isn't something you want to have 

Generally speaking we all think beauty is a good thing but nope, I'm a quite religious person and I was exposed to some stuff at a young age and I matured faster than most teenagers my age (I'm 15) so that explains why I'm religious and well God didint make me incredibly hot or astonishingly handsome he just gave me a prettier face than others and I didn't really care about it till recently cause I've noticed guys looking at me (men if you wanna know if you're good looking don't try to catch women looking at you they're good at it and try catching other men who have a very bad look on their face looking at you) and also sometimes girls and guys very quick to judge 

Guys have really let there jealousy leak out once in a while and it's really hurtful to know that guys hate you for just having a face 

And they don't understand women generally don't care about face most women have a whole different way of finding someone hot and it's not just about physical appearance 

So in the end I don't care about how I look I like wearing a face mask since it covers my face and I just stick to myself and minimise going out 

So that's why it's a curse cause teenage guys are insecure and jealous enough to hate me and girls don't care just because of the pretty face 

I genuinely am a nice person who tries there best not to hurt anyone cause I know how bad it hurts when you abuse someone (was bullied throughout my middle school and it happens now as well) so yeah it feels nice to say these things cause most people would say oh you're narcissistic or your ungrateful

My face is just as bad. No matter how well I shave, I feel like fucking 20 grit sandpaper if you rub the wrong way. No one can ever gently caress my face and honestly tell me I‚Äôm cute. I hate it. I just want to be something for somebody, but I can‚Äôt be. Who would want someone they can‚Äôt touch?

And for all the places my hair is, it isn‚Äôt on my stupid fucking scalp. I have deep ass bald spots forming where hair just refuses to grow, I can‚Äôt put my hair into a ponytail unless the hair is PARALLEL TO THE GROUND because if it‚Äôs any lower then the bald spots show through. And it keeps falling out and getting thinner every fucking time I shower. It also won‚Äôt get any longer because it falls out too quickly. It‚Äôs not near as long as I want it to be. All the beautiful ducking girls in my classes with the goddamn long ass thick fucking hair that goes down to their backs, and I‚Äôm stuck just past should length that I can‚Äôt put in a ponytail properly and that I can style at all for fear it will just fucking turn to ash and fall out.

I hate this. I hate this so much. Either I was ducking Hitler in a past life, or there‚Äôs an evil god that made this place just to torture me. This is too much, this is too perfect.

People who I considered friends don't seem to care about me at all or some just use me and I never hear from them again.

I honestly don't think I'm not a nice person but I also don't like to take anyones bullshit. So I'm very direct. But I love a good laugh and I'm easy going.

Disclaimer before we carry on, yes, I am that kind of moron who believes in tarot cards and palm readings; something about a person being able to pick up very secretive details about me and the results aligning with other readings done by different people are just too convincing. But to cut to the chase, I came from a disastrous breakup with my ex-girlfriend because she cheated and faked her feelings for me throughout a good long stretch of time throughout the relationship‚Äîwhich really fucked me up because this is my first relationship and it had to be this fucked up. I was always the guy who‚Äôs seemed to be doomed to die alone. I was bullied from a very young age, was socially ostracized throughout my life, and I only understood the concept of friendship just very recently, a few years into college. With all of that depressing hell happening to me, fresh from the breakup, I was seeking answers hence the tarot readings and palm readings. To my surprise, I got the verdict that I will never get into a happy relationship, and that I am either doomed to horrible partners, and/or relationships that‚Äôll never last. This is messing me up. Throughout my life, I have always thought that I will die alone. Years of bullying and social ostracizing has led me to believe that I am going to die alone, and now a lying philanderer and psychic readings have basically given the proof and confirmation that indeed they are right, that I am going to live and die alone. Yeah, this is messing with my head, and I am terrified and devastated. Apparently I exist as a cosmic joke to be lonely and misunderstood till the end of my worthless days. 

The fact that I have debilitating self-hate makes things worse. What next? Live for myself? I hate myself! Years of bullying and social ostracizing has led me to realize that yeah it pretty much was my fault! I deserved that bullying, I was weird kid growing up. If young people saw someone weird or outside normal attributes and interests then it‚Äôs very natural for them to beat the living crap out of it. Humans defend familiarity and I was in the way of that. (Full disclaimer: I do not condone bullying. However, I condone them bullying me) I refuse to live for myself because I am my greatest enemy, and I cannot live with the fact that I‚Äôm enabling my greatest enemy‚Äôs existence by letting them live. This is not pity masturbation, nor a seek of pity and clout. I calmly agree that I do not like myself and because no one else does or should, then I am terrified because I am running out of excuses to live. 

I am cosmically doomed to die alone, and I am terrified and sad about it because I‚Äôm running out of excuses to stay alive.",2022-04-23 17:37:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600526008,4,/r/lonely/comments/uaalg2/i_think_im_doomed_to_die_alone_and_im_terrified/,,0,6,"I think I‚Äôm doomed to die alone and I‚Äôm terrified, and very depressed about it.

4222,uag821,1v3n4s,"Hello,

I don't really have anyone to talk with, so I thought I'll write here.

I am 31 yo male, virgin. I am starting to hate my life. I live alone, never been in relationship and I don't have anyone to talk about my struggles in everyday life.

I love my parents and my brother and I have good relationship with them. 

I have 2 friends that I meet like every 3-6 months. But they are not my best friends, just guys that I meet once I am in my hometown just to grab a beer and talk about sports, politics etc.

My job is not boring and I have good coworkers, but they are just work friends, so we don't hang out besides few work party's.

I don't want to pity myself, because all of this is that I am experiencing for last few years, is mostly my fault. I was way too much into computer games from age 14 till 29 (I still play some casual games from time to time, but not nearly as much as I've used to). I wasn't socializing, I wasn't dating (I never been on a date). 

My self esteem is low as hell, it doesn't help that I am unattractive and my attractiveness cannot be increased just by getting haircut or having nice clothes. I have ugly face (big teeth, potato nose, big lips). I've been called ugly many times in my life and thats probably why I've isolated myself.

I just came back from my grandma birthday party. There I saw my cousins having wife's, kids, overall having good time. Today, my uncles and aunts keep asking me why I don't have gf/wife, kids, because I am already 31 and I should be. With a smile and confidence I keep t
lying them that I hate kids and I like to live alone and I keep telling them that every time I meet them. But I know very well that I am just not capable of finding a partner because of all my flaws.

Right now, I am sitting alone at my home, having suicidal thoughts (not first time tho). Thinking that I will never get to feel what is like to be loved by someone, thinking that I don't have anyone to talk with about my thoughts and my experiences.

I've started crying while writing this. It feels so bad to be lonely.",2022-04-23 22:16:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1576996175,4,/r/lonely/comments/uag821/lonely/,,0,2,Lonely

I can‚Äôt find another way to rant about life.

Ever since September 2020 life is getting progressively worse, the summer was great I met so much people and met my first girlfriend. But then autumn came around with the lockdowns and stuff. My relationship was going downhill and because of the lockdowns I lost my social connections with lots of friends. It was so miserable I couldn‚Äôt even go outside and I just found myself sitting at home doing nothing all day. I was always telling myself that things would get better, even though it was not. Summer came around and my grades were the worst ever and I realized I am not passing my year this year. Then my relationship was turning in a toxic one and I broke up with my girlfriend hoping it would get better. Nothing happened it was summer and I sat inside all day because I had literally no one. I saw everyone partying and enjoying when I was sitting alone in my room watching f-king tiktok. Since then I did not met anybody else I don‚Äôt have contact with women whatsoever and I am losing more more friends and social contacts. I restarted my school year and I do not connect with anyone, on that all my remaining friends are finishing this year and as of now they are already free of school and studying. I am literally on my own now.  I also lost interest in my hobby, however I did find a new one ‚Äúproducing‚Äù. The thing with this is that it does not include social contact whatsoever. Yesterday I got fired the only thing keeping me collapsing and getting depressed is hope in better times. From time to time I go clubbing or something but it‚Äôs like nobody connects with eachother anymore, then I feel like ‚Äúwhat am I doing here‚Äù. Also my confidence is heavily damaged because of several events in the past and I don‚Äôt feel like i get any attention from people. Maybe it is in my head. Before COVID it was so easy to make new friends, but now it seems harder or even impossible. The magic of life just turned into a grey abyss. Everyday is the same for me but not for everyone else. Does anyone else find him or herself struggling with this.
I just want somebody with the same interests or somebody I can talk to.

4231,uagxg8,Less-Entrepreneur-93,"It‚Äôs not an happy period.

I‚Äôm taking zoloft for mood swings and depressive moods. It‚Äôs probably caused by loneliness. I‚Äôve never felt enough for others, so i always avoided joining groups or asking people to hang out.

When i walk down the streets of my city, i always see groups of friends hanging out. 
I always wonder why i‚Äôm not like other people of my age. I don‚Äôt want to go to the disco, or get drunk, or post pics of me on socials. But i also want to get to know new people too. And it‚Äôd be so weird to approach total strangers.

When i walk down the streets, the thing that hurts the most is seeing couples. 


‚ÄúWhy not me?‚Äù


This is the question i‚Äôve been asking myself for years. Being chosen by a girl for who you are‚Ä¶ that has to feel incredible. I got chills every time i think about it. 

While having friends is still something i consider reachable, being interesting for a girl feels impossible to me. It‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt have anything to offer ( i can be funny, caring, and also passionate about things or people i care about ), but i think it‚Äôs never enough. Most of my friends left me alone when they found a special girl. They were so different after their relationships started. I‚Äôll admit i‚Äôve been very jealous. It seems unreachable to me. 

Just to make it worse, i‚Äôm rapidly losing my hair. I‚Äôll have to shave my head as soon as possible, in order to get used to it. But i know it‚Äôll affect my nonexistent dating life for the next 10 years, and probably will worsen my self esteem. I know i‚Äôll look like a 30 yo man.

My psychiatrist tells me i‚Äôll meet interesting people at the university, or things might get better. Honestly, i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case.


I would like to be like other guys: cheerful, carefree, attractive. I want to experience a true friendship, have a group of friends and, especially, be in a relationship, at least now that i still have some hair left. But i spend my time thinking, creating stories ( i like writing stories ) and worrying about lots of things, especially my future.

4233,uagzj8,Time_Bank848,"Skip to end for tl;dr.

For background, I suffer from social anxiety, and have struggled with forming friendships my whole life. I have no friends at school, or anywhere really. 

This year, a new girl joined my class. She seemed very shy and reserved, so I worked up the courage and managed to strike up a convo with her. It went a lot better than I expected, so I sat next to her. The next day, we have to do an assignment. We pair up, and then the teacher tells a girl (who was working alone) to sit with us. They start talking to each other, and it turns out they have a lot in common! We become a group of 3. 

So over the next few weeks, they become really good friends, and I get left out of their convos A LOT, and they team up to pick on me. They also talk outside of school, whereas they don't even bother to initiate a conversation with me. They just ignore me. 

I was really happy at the beginning because I had stepped out of my comfort zone and made a friend, but now I've just gone back to being the third wheel. It's just an extremely shitty situation, and on top of that I've been overwhelmed with schoolwork and my fucking body dysmorphia is getting worse by the day.¬† It's all very mentally taxing, and I feel on the verge of a mental breakdown.

Everything is stacked up against me I swear, I can never win no matter what. I'm completely lost and don't know what to do. 

tl;dr: new girl joins my class and I become her friend. Another girl comes up and they become even better friends, now I'm the third wheel.

4237,uahljd,MrSittingInShower,"Hi!

I'm feeling lonely more and more lately. I have never been in a relationship before and always thought ""I am too young and don't have time for it"" since I'm only 16 years old. I have never flirted or even felt like I was really bonding with a girl. There is a girl in my class who I think is really hot but I'm not sure how to handle it.

I'm also losing my cool with some friends, they don't know but I'm getting more and more frustrated by them. They are changing and becoming different persons, I think we are growing apart.

My best friend, the one who I can tell everything has met a nice girl. He is kinda dating her and things are working out for him and obviously I'm very happy for him. But he can't stop talking about it and I kinda get it but he says ""I'm not going to talk about her the whole time"" *continues to do so*.
Today he asked to go play soccer, I get at the location and we start playing but he doesn't. He is chatting with her. He kept chatting with her for an hour and we stop playing and go back home.
Today it happend again, we did karaoke at his house and he only stopped to sing himself but when we were singing he just kept chatting with her.
He also gets mad if I don't ask how its going between them every 5 seconds.

I had been feeling lonely before this all happened but it just hit me even more. 

I just want to be there for someone and someone to be there for me.

I don't really meet new people. I go to school, come back home, sometimes do sports or meet up with my friends. So I rarely even see new people.

I know this was a lot of things at once but just had to get it out. If you have any advice on one of the topics I would love to hear it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",2022-04-23 23:28:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650754990,1,/r/lonely/comments/uahljd/mixed/,,0,1,Mixed

4241,uaigyy,MemphisGirl93,"Let me set the scene and explain my current situation. I‚Äôd like to get some support and maybe advice. 
Last August my husband and I moved to Nowhere, PA from Tennessee so that I could start my PhD program at the massive and cult-like Nowhere State. I was scared about moving across the country to go to a new program but I had my husband. We struggled with infertility for years so we began IVF after we moved. From August to October, I was so busy trying to adjust to the PhD program while juggling a rigorous fertility schedule, I didn‚Äôt exactly try to meet people. And then in October I got pregnant. We would finally have our little family right?

Wrong. My husband (who I since learned has a massive drug problem. It‚Äôs complicated and I don‚Äôt want to get into it) abandoned Baby and I when I got pregnant. No warning, he didn‚Äôt even pack up his belongings. Just had some sort of mental breakdown and left one morning, and was very cruel in how he told me he never wanted to come back. This has obviously been extremely painful, and we are in the process of getting a divorce. 

Along with my heartbreak, my pregnancy has had a ton of complications. I‚Äôm due in July and I love my son so much, but I have basically been 100% remote since thanksgiving last year. I have spent almost all of this pregnancy fainting and throwing up and in bed. I go out for my doctors appointments and sometimes the library to work on papers but other than that I see no one. 

A group of grads girls in my program invited me to be their friend and I was excited for this except it hasn‚Äôt worked out. 1) I am too sick to go anywhere or do anything 2) they‚Äôre super focused on work and work only. The few gatherings they‚Äôve had are normal I guess until they all start pulling out laptops and working. And bragging. My PhD program is very toxic and hostile. Everyone brags or competes or rolls eyes/make snide little remarks. It‚Äôs a very unkind place to be, with lots of undertones about how I specifically don‚Äôt belong because I am from the south (so people think I‚Äôm stupid) and that I do not come from money. Some of the things people said to me were really jarring, especially after coming from a masters program that was supportive of and celebrated everyone. There‚Äôs a few kind people I have met in passing but they seem really busy and again, I‚Äôm too sick to hang out. I do wish I could at least have a texting buddy in the program though. 

So I thought I would try my luck with the local mom groups. They have been friendly (yay!) except they‚Äôre almost all married SAHMs. Nothing wrong with that but we live very different lives. They stay at home while their husband works for Nowhere State‚Ä¶meanwhile I am totally on my own, work for Nowhere State myself, and have no family or anything here. 

I have flown home twice since moving here, once for thanksgiving and once recently for my baby shower. I literally have a panic attack every time I try to come back. In November I sobbed, loudly, in the Philly airport to my soon-to-be-ex hubs about how much I ‚Äúhate it here,‚Äù which I know is pathetic but I literally didn‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to. The night before I flew back from my baby shower I had to essentially choke myself out with a pillow in an attempt to drown out how loudly I was crying because I didn‚Äôt want to wake my friends up. I do hate it here, so incredibly much. I don‚Äôt fit in, in ANY group I try to join. The grad girls made a new group chat without me because they‚Äôre all going to Paris, and the few other people I‚Äôve made friends with since moving here (except maybe one, she‚Äôs nice) have all ghosted me. It‚Äôs like damn am I so awful that no one wants to be around me? üòûEven though I hate this town and hate Nowhere State, I try to be positive. I know acting all sad won‚Äôt get me friends. But I do cry myself to sleep a lot. 

It‚Äôs warm weather today so I went for a walk. The outdoors make me happy. I saw couples holding hands and groups of friends and I just felt so sad. Especially the couple I saw with their baby. That was supposed to be us. I‚Äôm so incredibly lonely here, in a town that also seems to hate me too. I worry how this will impact me being a mom. How can I care for my son if I am so sad and lonely all the time? I don‚Äôt want him to see me crying. I know he‚Äôll just be a newborn but won‚Äôt he pick up on how unhappy I am? Yes I am in therapy but the isolation and rejection is getting to be too much. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter once he‚Äôs born, at least not for a while, so any friends I make would have to be ok with me bringing him (he‚Äôll be good I promise). 

My 29th birthday is in May and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to do anything for it. Last year my husband took me to the botanic gardens I loved so much. I have no one to spend it with this year, up here in Nowhere. I considered getting a massage or something but I think if I told anyone it was for my birthday I would just burst into tears.

It was the 14th of june and we just finished middle school and had to say goodbyes to my middle school classmates since we are going to enroll into diffrent schools and might not see eachother again. I will treasure that memory till the end of times. 
I stuggled with anxiety for a few years and have a lot of insecurities. Bottled up all my feelings. When asked how i am i just say im alright because i domt want prople to worry about me. I never had a person to trust or to vent or to tell them how i really feel or who i really am. I just dont know. I pretend to be a person that im not for people to like me. 
Often i start liking a person when they treat me with respect, are interested in a small thing that ive done, or glance in my direction but then i realise that they dont actually like me and i start being sad all over again. Its a magic circle. 

I just want 1 good person in my life that actually cares for me

The classmate left so now it was just both of us in the room. A few minutes later they take their stuff and go somewhere and a few minutes more I decided to fill up my water bottle. The person from before was there and they waved to me, and since my throat was dry I let out this dark raspy hey making me sound like some edgy loser (wherein all black didn't help either, damn hyperhidrosis) I I then went behind a wall and just sighed in shame and disappointment.

4293,uampdp,crazyforsushi,"I'm 15, and I have a loving family and a group of loving friends. I am loved by many and am generally speaking respected amongst my peers. Yet I feel so lonely.


Whenever I hang out with my friends or family I feel happy. I feel euphoric. But the moment they leave the room or they have to go and the silence falls, suddenly that icy cold feeling of loneliness returns.

I don't truly understand why.

I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like their love is a sham. But that's irrational given the fact that they would benefit nothing much if at all if it were true and their words of affirmation, and their actions, they all say otherwise.

But I feel so lonely! I feel so lonely that I constantly vividly daydream to replace my loneliness.

I am trapped in a loop where I feel like everyone hates me. That I am unwanted, so I isolate myself, which makes me feel even more lonely.

And I can't stand it.

I act confident, bubbly, outgoing, to everyone.

But in reality? I secretly wish they would just stay.

Just stay with me. If you truly hate me then fuck it, keep the act up until I find someone better and than you can just leave.

I hate being left alone even for a few minutes. I don't know why I'm like this.

I can't truly fathom why I feel like this, let alone the origins of such a strong feeling.

But I loathe it wholeheartedly. Day in and day out I come home and when I enter my comforting bedroom I can never truly relax because no matter how homey or aesthetic it is, that solid state of solitude remains. It's an undertone that just grows to be more and more louder. With the ringing in my ears being the only company I have and the friends I have. The ones inside my head, in this little world of mine that I made years ago and visit daily for extensive hours.

I just can't do this.

Is it just me?",2022-04-24 04:26:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1589868156,3,/r/lonely/comments/uampdp/i_am_loved_by_many_and_i_have_a_lot_of_friends/,,0,7,I am loved by many and I have a lot of friends. Both parties are very sweet and supportive and yet... I still feel so lonely.

Recently left a 1-year FWB/GF Experience with a friend. After we celebrated Valentines, she wanted to move things into a relationship status. I'm leaving for medical school soon, and cannot imagine this continuing long-distance. We've been apart since February, and it's been a long month(+). At the time, I was cruising, chilling, having a good time with her. Now, I regret everything I've ever done and miss her so much. At least we could've enjoyed summer before I left together. Why the fuck did I end it then? I fucking hate myself. I haven't been hugged in over a month now. I try to go out to the college bars &amp; it's nothing. I am so done with college girls.

I spend most of my days alone and I enjoy it. That does not mean I don't like to party or hang out with friends. I don't have many friends, I thought I did but I realized friends come and go. Which left me to the situation where I am now, mostly alone.

Being alone with only my thoughts can truly be a wild ride. Sometimes I get an existential crisis and ponder the meaning of life but that's the point which I'm trying to make; only when alone can you truly self reflect and think about what you truly are and what you want.

I don't know and I don't care if this changes your perspective or not, but I do know that this helped me be less of a depressed slump of a mess who craves social interaction who couldn't even interact right with his own thoughts.",2022-04-24 06:20:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650779984,1,/r/lonely/comments/uaodjc/loneliness_is_not_a_bad_thing/,,0,3,Loneliness is not a bad thing

4317,uaoe5i,Ronald_T,"I think i finally found peace in the solitude.

I'm a 25M and i've been alone all my life. Never had a gf, seldom had any ""friends"" in my adulthood, never even had my first kiss or been on a date. For years I wondered what was wrong with me or what i might be doing wrong. Am I just that boring, or unattractive? Do i not make enough money, or not muscular enough? It would keep me up at nights because I overthink things way too much. It would stress me out like crazy and consume all my thoughts for the entire day. It was unhealthy as all hell. My mom would not stop bugging me about finding a girl and giving her grandchildren, my sister wanted me to give her nieces and nephews to run around and play with even though she already has 2 kids of her own. It was driving me nuts. I moved out of the house to a different city 3 years ago to get away from all that, but they would still bring it up every now and then and I would have to hang up the phone because i didn't want to hear it. At one point some old highschool folks i knew got together to talk about what was going on in their lives now-a-days. Most are married, have kids, starting careers or going for masters degrees in college. And there I was, same old lonely me, nothing changed except being a few years older...

About a month ago, I finally woke up one day and said ""Fuck it, i'm done worrying about this loneliness shit. I'm not gonna let it keep dragging me down. If i'm alone all my life, then fuck it I'll be alone all my life. "" 

And you know what, it actually worked. I've started to find myself in a better mood most days, i'm more productive at work, and i'm actually get a huge promotion soon! I don't wake up in misery anymore, I dont dread whatever the day brings me, and i even started having dreams in my sleep from time to time.

Sure it would be nice to share all these little victories with someone, but screw it, these are my victories and i'll celebrate them with me, myself, and I.

My newest ex (as of 72 hours, we were engaged, dated 4 years) told me I am ‚Äúrepulsive,‚Äù and no matter how much an acquaintance or Internet person says otherwise‚Ä¶how am I not supposed to believe that?

Note: I am not telling people to reassure me that I‚Äôm not a disgusting piece of shit‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt know me.

Starts crossing over your head. So even though I do have friends, and I am lucky and grateful for having one very close friend, whenever all of us hang out either in lunchtime at work or outside of work, I always end up feeling like other people are just more validated than me, like it doesn't really make a difference wether I'm present or not, so i end up asking myself, are these guys really my friends? I mean i get along with them but do they really like me? Do they really enjoy my company? They don't show the same interest in me or what I have to say as they do with other people in our group.

4361,uath0u,Jesus_H_Christ_real,"It really hurts me to see so many kind, helpful, sensitive and thoughtful people to suffer from loneliness. I think that you deserve better than that and so I thought it would be a good idea to try and improve that with a short small guide.  


These are my current, most updated thoughts on the matter, so if you feel that what I am saying isn't quite right or could be improved or added to, please do not hesitate at all to comment what you want on this. You have experience and knowledge that I do not and you might have great ideas that can help someone else out of this awful thing that is loneliness - let's solve this loneliness thing together!  


I think that, if you are isolated and alone, and that you want to find friends, you need to go out and do activities that involve other people. You should not join these activities with a mindset of ""I must make one of these people my friend"" but rather with a mindset of ""I am just going to hang out with these people, and if one or few of these people seem like a potential friend, then I will attempt to befriend them"".  


This is a subtle difference, but an important one. I think it's important not to try and force just someone, anyone, into being your friend, but rather find someone who has the right interpersonal chemistry with you. You are not trying to make someone your friend, you are trying to find someone who wants to be your friend and someone that you want to be friends with.  


Friendship, like a relationship, requires chemistry. Different folks are attracted to different folks - you just have to find your person(s).  


So, how do you go about that?  


There are sites, like [https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/), where you can find groups that do activities together.  


You can also take night classes in languages, arts and other things. It would be a good idea to pick something that you're interested, for two reasons - if you do not find anyone, at least you had a good time, and it's easier to find someone to be friends with if you share some common interests.  


There are clubs, like chess clubs, board game clubs, D&amp;D clubs, and others. You just have to look for and search for something that you think you would enjoy that is local.   


There are other people who are also lonely and they are trying to find their people too. If you are lucky, some of those people will be your friends. But if you do not go out, if you do not meet anyone, they cannot meet you. So,  


You need to take action. You need to expose yourself to people, you need to be around people so that you can hopefully bump into someone that you vibe with one day.   


If anyone else knows sites, activities, apps or just any other good way to find places where one can meet people safely, please do not hesitate to comment. You could be not just helping, you could be saving someone's life. So if you have any ideas, please speak up and let's help each other out however we can.  :)

Also, if anyone has a story of how they found friendships or have beaten isolation or being lonely, please, absolutely feel free to share your story so that others can find hope and courage and inspiration from it, but only if you don't mind doing so, of course. It might seem silly or not important, but your story can change or save someone, and that is important. So feel free to share, if you want to and if you don't mind to :)  


If you feel that there is something else that's helpful or insightful that you would like to add to this discussion, by all means, please go ahead, you are welcome to and I'm sure other people will appreciate it too.  


That is all, I would like to thank you all for your attention and for this wonderful community and for this subreddit. I don't know who created it or who keeps it running, but I appreciate your guys work and even just the idea of it, it's fantastic and you guys rock for just even thinking of creating it in the first place and then making it happen into a reality later on - this subreddit is important and you making it is important and you are important - you saw a problem in the world and you attempted to fix it - that is amazing and brave and thoughtful and caring and so are you for doing it! :)  


And the community itself, I see you guys trying. I see you replying to other people's posts. I see you trying to help. Sometimes I read a post, I see replies, and I see that my work here was already done by someone else, that you all worked together and helped the person and I couldn't be more proud of you then - I don't need to add anything to discussion or do anything because you already have helped the person. I want you to know that I really really appreciate seeing that, that it moves me, that it makes me feel proud of this community and it's members, proud of people helping each other - for free, with nothing to gain from it. That is great. That is awesome. Please do not stop this and keep this up - you are doing an excellent job. You don't always know what to say, or what to do, but I see that you try to do something, you try to help, and that is all that anyone can ever ask of you. You, just trying to help, it matters. You matter. Your kind words here matter. Your advice matters. You offering to be someone's friend or to just listen, it matters.   


Sometimes, your kindness, your attention, your words, maybe they just lift someone's spirits. Other times, even though you do not know it, sometimes, your kindness might save someone. Your kind actions and words here might save someone, might give them what they need to survive, and eventually try to thrive in life- your words and actions matter and what you do here matters, a lot. Please don't forget that.  


I think that is all I wanted to say here. I only hope that this hopefully helps someone, some day, and even if this only affects one person, if it helps them, I will be happy. Helping even one person, that is an amazing feat, that is an achievement in of itself. If I can do that, if I can help even one person, then I know that my life had meaning and when it's my time to go, I can go content knowing that me being here helped someone, that however small, I made some difference, that I left world a better place than when I found it. I didn't make this mess of a world with all it's problems, I only inherited it, but if I tried to it clean up even a little bit of, then I have done my part. No one can tell me that I didn't try.   


That is my current attitude, and, it helps me. I don't know if it will help you, and I am not saying that you should be this way or live in this way, I am just saying that just because things are bad in the world, it doesn't mean you have to accept it. You don't have to take it. You don't have to participate in the malfunctions and dysfunctions. If you want to, you can choose to make this place a better one. Everyone knows that everything is a mess right now. But it doesn't have to be. You can put on some metaphorical gloves, some work pants and get to cleaning this mess. No one can tell you not to.   


It can be a kind word. It can be a kind action. It can be a thoughtful gesture. It can be a smile and a compliment to stranger. It can be forgiveness for someone. Big or small, you have the power to treat your fellow humans with kindness. And while not everyone will appreciate it, some will be touched and moved by your kindness, and in turn, they will treat other with kindness as well. Like throwing a pebble into a still water, your kind action can spread like a wave and go out into the world, affecting unknown numbers of people in a ripple fashion. A smile and a kind word you give today, could come back to you through a chain of people tomorrow, and you wouldn't even know it. Today, you might give someone a pass, a break and, tomorrow, while not a guarantee, someone might give you a pass or a break. Share the love. Be kind to others. What do you have to lose? It doesn't cost anything to say something nice to someone, on internet or in real life.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

Even then I pushed my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù away because I felt and still feel like no one gets me. I don‚Äôt know where or how to meet people anymore. I‚Äôve seen other posts on this thread that I deeply relate to like ones that say it would be better with a relationship. I agree with that if it was the right person but I would honestly be okay with just having a friend that I could care about that cared about me as well. I crave some kind of interaction but my anxiety about being around/ talking to other people makes it impossible. I‚Äôve done the whole tinder hookup thing but nothing good has come of that. It seems like we‚Äôre all disconnected and there‚Äôs no actual way to make any friends. I really just want to care for someone and have them care for me the same way. I‚Äôm actually glad I found Reddit just so I can share these experiences anonymously without fear of actual judgement from people I know.,2022-04-24 15:13:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599966000,2,/r/lonely/comments/uawvya/i_have_no_friends/,,0,1,I have no friends
4382,uaxezh,purinii_,"So I met this guy online on Grindr and it just so happens that we were both also looking for a long term relationship. Using Grindr was something I thought of doing to help me detach from some other feeling I felt and had to get rid of which kind of worked a bit then backfired. I digress, but I met this guy and we chatted for a while and he told me that I was really his type, personality wise and appearance wise so I thought wow, maybe I have a chance after all. I'm 21 and he's 30. He kept telling me about how finding me was like finding a diamond in the rough because he doubt that he would've been able to find someone who was younger than him, was asian, and someone he was attracted to physically and personality wise.

We then started to talk about how serious he was going to take relationships too because they aren't casual as hookups and I agreed with him as well and we started dating for a while. Normally I'm a shy and introverted person, but something about him always being pretty positive and calling me mature for my age as well as just being a nice person overall gave me a lot of hope. We went on more dates and had some cuddles here and there and I really felt the sincerity in his words when he hugged me tightly and said he won't let me go. One of the main reasons he said that was because he told me he didn't feel like living past 45 without anyone to spend it with. I didn't choose to be with him only because of pity, but because I actually genuinely liked him. We got along pretty well too and I always had something to say.

However I did notice some red flags before we met too when he said ""We'll see how well you can handle me with your temperament since you're with me now"". Some context to this was that in his past relationships, he admitted to having a tendency to run away from problems and never turn back as well as well getting frustrated easily. But he said he didn't think there would be a problem between us and said he learned from his mistakes.

Fast forward to last week on a Sunday, we were supposed to meet on Monday so I asked him how is day was going and I tried to tease him a bit by saying what if I couldn't go on Monday because I was buried underground or something. The underlying tone in his message seemed very serious and he said, if you're serious about it, then I can't do anything. So of course, I told him that I was teasing him, but I probably shouldn't because he does have high blood pressure. Then he just told me that he was really stressed at that time and apologized if he was a prick. I just told him it was ok and he should take some time to relax and that I'll wait for him. He said thanks, then blocked me right after and his account deactivated 2 days later.

Now I'm just so confused and the intrusive thoughts keep bombarding my brain thinking that I might have said or done something horrible to him so that's why he left me and I get a bit anxious without having closure. I know not everyone gets closure either, so on the following Saturday, I made a care package for him with a letter inside hoping that he is recovering well from his stressful situation along with another way to contact me if he is ok. I added sentimentality into the care package as well, hoping that he would care enough to say anything back. But I assumed that he and his father went on a little trio because they do that often so only their gardener was there so I asked if he could give the guy a package from ""a friend"". He said ok and now I'm just waiting for his message like a dog waiting for his owner to come home, but this time, I don't even know if the owner is coming back or not.

I just feel really crappy and I am aware that I should accept the reality if he doesn't respond within a week that, maybe he just didn't want anything to do with me anymore, but I want to give him the benefit of the doubt as well since I really did like him and thought he liked me back as well.

Tl;dr This guy I met online that I was dating just cut off all contacts with me and deactivated his account so now I have no closure at all which bothers me so much. We both ""liked"" each other too, but now I'm not sure what even happened except he was stressed and chose to just not tell me anything at all.

Any comfort or advice for me and how to get past this would be appreciated :(",2022-04-24 15:39:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650573148,2,/r/lonely/comments/uaxezh/friend_blocked_me_then_deactivated_his_account_on/,,0,2,"Friend blocked me then deactivated his account on Facebook, leaving me confused"

4396,uazrxm,throwaway126394728,"Quick apology for the essay. I also wrote this at like 1 AM, so if it sounds kinda hectic, please excuse it.

So i am going to go over some background info about me. Im a secondary school student (High school). I have decent experience in multiple instruments, avid robotics person (I compete as part of FIRST robotics), I consider myself decently smart (Please dont take this the wrong way, i am not trying to be cocky), I am decent at golf and a few other sports although i do not play them often, and I also consider myself well groomed and relatively decent looking (Again not trying to be cocky, just trying to help describe me as a person). 

So in terms of personality, I am relatively introverted as in that I am shy at first but once i get to know someone, i am a lot more extroverted. I love to learn, talk, and enjoy my hobbies. I took all virtual classes for a decently long time so I am used to working alone and not needing social interaction as much. I also try to be outgoing whenever I can. I tend to overthink a lot, but that is not a huge issue. I used to have a couple really good friends, but due to their own romantic interests we have grown apart, I no longer contact either as I became sort of the only thing holding the relationship together. I just couldn't keep trying to maintain it when there was a clear lack of interest. I have also tried becoming better friends with many, many people, all of whom remain as just people i speak with on occasion, none actually show interest in speaking with me outside of when I attempt to. 

I think that is enough about me, so onto what I need help with. If you need more information about me in terms of giving me better advice, let me know and i can give some more context. 

Lately, it has just been a recurring issue where I cannot seem to find friends that actually show some sliver of interest or care towards me. Dont get me wrong here, I always try my best to be the type of friend I wish to have. I am always supportive, I try to make jokes, albeit really bad usually not funny ones, I try to help out if they ever need help, and I try to always be there for them if they are feeling down. I have had to help a past friend on occasion with mental health issues before in terms of comforting them and the like. Every time over my past at least 15 or 20 attempts with different people I get the same result of them either remaining just people I talk to at school, or outright disliking me. On multiple occasions people i barely even talk to just started to hate me out of nowhere. I have lost one of my past decent friends due to someone bad mouthing me even though I have never spoken to him/her. I dont know what I am doing wrong, if I even am doing anything wrong. It just that no one will talk to me unless I actively try and spur conversation. I am not horrible at conversations but I could definitely be better. 

I should also add that, not intentionally, but on accident I have overheard even people I considered decently close literally saying bad things about me. I dont know what i had even done to deserve that. And keep in mind these were people that I considered close and would have conversations with more regularly and such.

Ad it stands right now, I have no ongoing friendship or relationships in any manner. All have ended due to either the other person, unforseen circumstances, or just me giving up on trying to maintain a one sided friendship.

I really do not want to hear the same old work on yourself quotes, because honestly i hear it too much. Most of what I do is working on myself and to be honest i have no clue what that means if not learning and trying to become a better me. This whole issue has really been taking a toll on me lately because I really have been seriously feeling out of it and wholly unmotivated for a lot of things. Because really outside of school, I dont have anyone really I can talk to or hang out with. And it really feels horrible. I really just want 1 friend that cares enough about the relationship so that its not one sided, I dont want to be like the only reason we are friends. It sucks when I just cannot go on with a friendship just because of the toll it takes on my happiness. I just dont want to have to be the one to initiate all the time. I hope that someone will maybe send the first message once in a while. 

I hope this does not come off as selfish or needy at all. I just greatly want to feel as though someone really cares about me. Just someone that I can depend on, and will be able to depend on me. Its the 2 sided aspect that I just want badly. Its not that my parents dont, its just they way they go about it is not one that exactly sparks happiness in me. Dont get me wrong, i will always love them.

Please if anyone has any experience or advice, do not hesitate to say it. I am good at taking criticism and please tell me anything I am doing wrong, could be doing better, etc.

I'm going into a new school in September so hopefully there are people there who would like to be my friend.,2022-04-24 17:46:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638302871,2,/r/lonely/comments/ub0381/i_really_need_friends/,,0,1,I really need friends.
4400,ub0559,cheezluq,"I love my friends and won't trade them for anything. But lately I've been feeling very disconnected from everyone and everything..even my own family and pets. I don't seem as excited or lively anymore when i talk to my friends and my girl bestfriend too. I don't talk to my online friends as much as i used to either. conversations w my friends or literally anyone feel so dreadful and i find myself forcing myself to sound interested/happy and nothing feels genuine anymore. I'm just like a robot who responds to people in the way that i think is suitable to respond in. I would purposely avoid them and delete my social media apps so they won't be able to contact me and i won't have to fake myself and reply to their texts etc. I feel myself slowly fading away from everyone and it hurts but I'm also too tired to care about anything rn. I feel nothing, i feel empty. I feel lost.

I kinda ghosted everyone for 6 whole months but i got back with them and they forgave me and i thought I was getting better, but i feel worser than before now. 6 months wasn't enough for me, idek for how long do i need to be alone i feel like i shouldn't be like this any longer but idk how to change. And as much as i hate to admit this, during those 6 months i was alone i actually felt the most alive. There were some depressing days where i felt super guilty but the thought of being free and 'not existing' in anyone's life felt like freedom. It was lonely not having anyone to share stuff with but I was fine with it. Which is why I thought I was getting better and more positive but the happiness only lasted for a month after i got out of my ghosting phase :/ idk what's wrong with me aren't i supposed to be happy now that I'm with my friends?? Dammit idek what i want. 

How do I tell my friends i don't feel the same way anymore? it feels so lonely but being around ppl and feeling nothing feels lonelier and I'm tired of putting on a facade everyday and i feel like I'm just wasting everybody's time at this point. I'm fake. All my responses to them were fake. I feel like a hypocrite giving other ppl advices and listening to their rants as if i got my own life together lol. I'm just tired now and want to be alone. I literally don't care if they leave me or detach from me bc that's all I want for now. atleast if they aren't attached to me anymore their feelings won't hurt as much. Idc about how I feel I'm only afraid that i might hurt their feelings more than I've hurt mine. I sound selfish lol I'm sorry",2022-04-24 17:49:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650280442,1,/r/lonely/comments/ub0559/i_dont_vibe_w_my_friendgroup_anymore_and_i_feel/,,0,0,i don't vibe w my friendgroup anymore and i feel so much lonelier now (rant)

4413,ub2heu,DuskPigeon,"Hi, everyone.

I am 24-y.o. guy, and I just really need someone to love me. Almost all of my friends and colleagues have relationships, some of them - for 5-7 years or more now. What about me? I felt in love with several girls in my life. Most of them even didn't reject me straight away, but anyway, all these ""relationships"" progressed no further than 3-4 dates. The most thing I had - the relationship 5 years ago, which lasted for a few months and still wasn't really passionate and intimate and eventually became quite destructive for me.

I know I am definitely not the most attractive and charismatic person. Socialization was always kinda difficult for me. But at the same time I believe (and my friends tell me so) that I am not actually ugly or toxic, that I am more or less erudite, have a sense of humour etc. However the problem is still there. I see I am not attractive for the people around. Almost nobody really wants to communicate with me. Nobody loves me*, nobody cares. Especially in recent years: even my old friends slip away from me one by one (and two years of pandemic are obviously not helping).

Frankly, I feel isolated, trapped in a vicious circle: I have neither a loving girlfriend nor a company of friends, whose presence would help me to gain some energy to live this life and to work on myself - and simultaneously I have no such energy to find and attract such people.

I do have a couple of hobbies, a couple of good friends and a couple of other things, which help me to feel bonded to this life. But the absence of the special person in my life, who would love me and care for me, feels just like a continuously bleeding wound. And I know: no matter what, I cannot actually be happy until this wound is cured.

So, as I said, I desperately need someone to show me love. Someone to share my thoughts and concerns with and someone who would share her thoughts and concerns with me. Someone who would be special for me and who I would be special for. And, of course, someone who would hug and kiss me, be around me and fall asleep next to me, because currently I am touch starved to an extent when it is almost physically painful sometimes.

And yeah, I am aware that relationship itself is not a ""silver bullet"" for every problem in the world and that it often requires much work to be positive and comfortable. And yeah, I admit, that being single has its advantages too. But nonetheless, I really need it and I really suffer from the lack of it in my life. I remember those my few moments with that girl: a smile in her eyes, softness of her lips and thighs, the way she touched me - and these are some if not the most wonderful sensations I ever experienced.

I dream about it every day (not about the specific destructive girl, but about all that I described several sentences above). I've been dreaming about it almost all my life. Besides, I am 24, and although I am still relatively young, I nevertheless feel that a significant period of opportunities in my life is gone now - fruitlessly. I still hope that one day either myself or something around me will change and love will enter my life, and I keep making attempts - but so far I did not succeed.

PS: I apologize for the mistakes: English is not my native language.

Maybe I‚Äôm not supposed to have friends because I form strong codependencies and become overly reliant on others?

I just wonder if someone else may have passed this phase and if you could explain to me how to fix this situation with myself.

4419,ub3ext,sunless_ac,Recently I‚Äôve just have had it rough with the realization of what I‚Äôll have to do after high school or if I wanna take a gap year. I‚Äôm really leaning towards a gap year but everyone doesn‚Äôt want me to do a gap year. I don‚Äôt have any high school friends and I‚Äôve always kept to myself for the entire time I‚Äôve been at school. Ive thought about suicide but not like I‚Äôd ever actually go through with it considering I don‚Äôt have the courage for that. Sometimes I just feel so lonely and lose hope. I wish I had more friends but not purely out of pity but actual friends that wanna talk to me for me. I‚Äôve lost motivation to do anything and my mind always lingers to just depressing thoughts when I‚Äôm by myself especially at night. I plan on getting a therapist soon since that‚Äôs what I really need. I even sometimes think I‚Äôm just not that important and I see myself as like a waste of space sometimes. All my other family members are doing successful things with their life like my cousin who is only 16 and he is just living the dream with his first girlfriend and his drivers license. I have a learners permit but haven‚Äôt gotten the hours in because I‚Äôve been too scared to drive because I don‚Äôt want anyone to get hurt because of me or my stupidity or if I‚Äôm doing something wrong. The most I‚Äôve ever been diagnosed with was ADHD but idk I think I have more than just that now since I didn‚Äôt even remember when I was diagnosed with adhd probably at a young age. When I was in middle school I had to take meds for my adhd but I have it somewhat under control but I guess I don‚Äôt. When I was on meds they didn‚Äôt let me feel like eating so I never really ate when it came to lunch time at middle school. I don‚Äôt take them now though. I also haven‚Äôt been eating much recently because of my body. I weight 260 or so and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2 and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶I feel like as I am rn no one will love me if I ever decide to have a relationship. My mom is also over protective so I can‚Äôt really meet up with ppl she hasn‚Äôt met which I guess makes sense but still. Recently I‚Äôve been using Reddit as an outlet since It seems nice here. When I was younger it was just me and my mom living with my grandparents since my mom had me when she was like 17/18 and my biological father left for plenty of reasons which im glad he did I‚Äôve never met him but im told he went to prison when he was in high school and his side of the family is manipulative.

I wish they understood what last night meant for me and how much they just impacted me by giving me a night full of laughter and good times. I‚Äôve been struggling for probably around the last three years with a mixture of depression insecurity and other mental health problems. I‚Äôve had a rough few years though. I was cheated and on and abandoned to live and pay rent alone which led me to jump into my next relationship rather fast for the sake of a better living situation. Jokes on me, he ended up being abusive and has given me a life full of hell for the past two years. Also in that time frame, I lost my grandma to cancer, had my best friend move across the country, and another friend eventually got sick of dealing with me and ghosted me. I also had this well paid job which I had to quit because my boss was sexually harassing me. All of this led me to pretty much shut down. When I was in between my jobs I just sat in my house for weeks and did nothing. Then I got my new job and after many months I finally started talking more with my coworkers and forming bonds with them. I have a very hard time actually making friends because I can be shy and shut down most of the time. but I got an invite for bowling night with this group of girls and it was truly the most fun I‚Äôve had in years. I feel like the night was a blur simply from how deliriously happy I was to be included. So to my coworkers who don‚Äôt know how much a simple night out meant for me, thank you.

4432,ub4qly,[deleted],"Recently I have been feeling socially defeated.  I‚Äôm 31m, and besides my wife, I haven‚Äôt made a friend in more than a decade. 

Platitudinous friend-making strategies don‚Äôt seem to work for me.  The orthodox arsenal of neurotypical (I'm autistic) friend-making strategies ‚Äî ‚Äújoin a  club,‚Äù ‚Äúfind people with similar interests,‚Äù ‚Äútake a class,‚Äù ‚Äúgo to a  park and strike up random small-talk conversation,‚Äù etc. ‚Äî has never worked for me. People (primarily but not exclusively neurotypicals) seem hardwired to be uncomfortable around me because I am too different. This is the case regardless of where I am or who I am with.  

 For example, I like to read. Therapists have ad nauseum suggested that I  join a book club to expand my social circle. Joining a book club,  however, has never helped me make friends. Because my interests are very niche, whenever I have joined a book club, a reading Meetup, etc., I  have been just as ostracized as anywhere else. The books I read and enjoy make people uncomfortable. This applies equally within book clubs as without.  

Another example is traveling. I like to travel, but like book clubs,  people who like traveling don‚Äôt like where I travel. Any potential social connection will end if I say anything about where I have been or where I plan to go.  

This is all based on my own experience. Many of what I thought were promising social connections have abruptly ended after describing anything from what my favorite books are to where I plan to take my vacation.  

At this point, I have managed to navigate the corporate office world and most other social settings by never revealing anything about myself to anyone. Neurotypicals love to talk, and I let them do that. However, I  have found this leads to unbalanced relations. People unload on me all their life issues, but there is no reciprocity in the relationship. They tell me about their marital, family, financial, or other life issues,  then leave.  

On top of this, most people in their 30s like me have mortgages, spouses, jobs, children, etc., making them far less interested in expanding their social circle.  

I want friends, but my efforts to make friendships have always come to naught. The older I get, the more likely it seems I will rely primarily on my wife for any social connection. 

This weekend I decided maybe it is time to adopt a dog. At least a dog won't think I am a freak. We went to the Humane Society, found a super adorable 10-month-old Shepard mix that had been through so much trauma, and seemed like he just wanted some love. But just as we were about to move through the adoption process, our landlord rejected him. 

Great. No friends, no dog, and another 50+ hour week in the office.",2022-04-24 21:25:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,,8,/r/lonely/comments/ub4qly/this_has_been_a_very_lonely_and_sad_weekend/,,0,6,This has been a very lonely and sad weekend

4436,ub5mp5,MangoFruit64,"The melancholic chords through my AirPods accompanied me sitting in the shower surrounded by darkness. I deprive myself of all senses except for the music playing in my ears and the warm water hugging my arched back, replicating the sensation of a loving hug. Eyes closed, I self-reflect while the song ""As The World Caves In"" reaches its climax.

Ever since I was a child, handling overwhelming emotions has not been my forte. I would cry easily and have negative thoughts. ""I don't deserve to be happy."" ""I'm not good enough."" Feelings of inadequacy stem from my perfectionistic standards, which I know well I cannot achieve. Bottling everything up was the only way I knew how to cope with the death of my dad, step up as the oldest child to take care of my family, and the loneliness that grips me every day. Suppressing all my emotions not only has deprived me of feeling anything at times but ironically made me prone to being *overwhelmed* by them. *This is perhaps why I find happiness, love, or joy uncomfortable.* 

I had the perfect chance during prom to talk and dance with this girl (\*note: I'm a dude lol). Our group had split up: some were on the dance floor, and some were outside the building hanging out. It was just me and her sitting on directly opposite sides of the round table. We did introduce ourselves very briefly and exchange a few glances before. Both of us were bored and lonely after two hours of prom. I had the strong urge to ask how she was doing since I could empathize with her feeling lonely. I was confident we would get along extremely well based on our previous interactions.

But I didn't.

I didn't approach her, despite my strong urge to.

Why didn't I approach her?

Because I was afraid. I was afraid of feeling happiness. Afraid of connecting with someone in that type of way. I was afraid of love. 

Why am I scared of love?

Because I will become *overwhelmed* by it.

4440,ub61fm,Jesus_H_Christ_real,"I was responding to someone's post about how to work up courage to start doing stuff alone, and a little bit later on someone asked me same question - so I have decided to make a separate post for this because I think this could be a common issue for people, so hopefully this can help more people as a post rather than a comment:)  


#  How to get courage to do things alone?

Little bit by a little bit, this is the easiest way, and while it may take a little bit of time, it will speed up eventually.

Think  of it like rolling a snowball. You start small, and it stays small, but  then it snowballs into a huge snowball eventually. So, just exit your  house, and go for a five minute walk. Then a ten minute walk. Then a 15  minute walk. Then 30. Walk around neighbourhood, scout it. You don't  have to actually go inside anywhere, but mark your targets, scope things out.  Out of things you see, where do you actually want to go? Do you want to  go to this funky pizza joint? Movie theatre? Hole in a wall shop?

Some of your targets will be easier to conquer than others.

Going  into a pizza shop, and ordering a pizza slice and a pop will probably  be easier than going to a movie theatre or a restaurant alone. So you figure out what is the easiest thing to do, and go do that first. Then  you do it again. Then after you have built up a bit of confidence and  you feel ready, you go up a notch, you hit your next mark, whatever is  next on the difficulty scale.

This  is a marathon, not a sprint. You are not aiming to be fully socially  confident in a single day, that is too much to expect of your nervous  system, it is not capable of adjusting that quickly unless you are an  extreme outlier.

This will take some time. So take the time! **Take your time**. Have fun. Learn. Explore. Grow. **Push yourself, little by little, at the pace you decide is comfortable**.

I  hope this helps - let me know if you have any questions or if you feel  that it wasn't helpful and then we could try to brainstorm a different  solution if you feel that this approach wasn't useful to you for any  reason :)",2022-04-24 22:26:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619628833,13,/r/lonely/comments/ub61fm/how_to_work_up_courage_to_do_things_alone/,,0,4,How to work up courage to do things alone

Her boyfriend Ronald was also with us and after their pressure I ripped one off...I coughed like crazy and actually vomited lol it was to much smoke think of a chimney during winter ha, anyways after a few seconds or minutes I didn't feel anything and wondered what all the fuss was about weed I told Sally she must've gotten mere grass but then I blacked out and woke up in the hospital... sigh I'm embarrassed and ashamed but I just want to talk about this so exactly what happened to me was a psychotic episode from smoking they said I went bat shit crazy and  went back into the food area stripped naked and rubbed chocolate all over myself and jumping from the top leveled hallway onto some table that might have saved my life since it broke my fall,I have some pictures they took of me while I was acting all crazy pm if you want to see them no weirdo's though...so yeah after feeling lonely for a days that happened idk I just wanted to share this here or maybe elsewhere.

Because my brain can't pre-occupy itself with video games or anything because my computer (the only thing that actually distracts me well enough to ignore my thoughts besides my friends who I don't really even have or just can't talk to because its a vacation time, which is coming to a close but still, I can only talk to them for like 30 minutes tops) is in a repair shop at the moment and I feel selfish because I feel like I'm just pitying myself, which is how my mom describes it, and then I just wanna fucking set myself on fire and I just don't even know what I'm doing anymore what I'm talking about anymore, I don't even know how I'm still alive I should've died multiple times but I was stopped by one thing or another and there's just so much going through my head right now and I don't know what to do I just feel like even if I don't end up killing myself in the next few months, years, etc. I'm going to just be generally alone and I don't want to recede back into my old habits of being alone because I was generally really toxic and horrible but I feel myself going back and I don't know what I can do anymore, I just want to live peacefully, and I wish therapy would work I really do but I don't trust them anymore, they make my mom yell at me because they annoy her and I also annoy her but she says she loves me and she gives me things and maybe its true but I don't I don't know I just wanna go home I don't wanna be here anymore I wanna live sometime else I wanna go back and prevent myself from ruining all of my friendships and making people hate me and not want anything to do with me like they do now l, I'm alive and I don't wanna be, I shouldn't be, people I know regret stopping me from killing myself the first time and its only gotten worse. I'm just spiraling and spiraling and I lose more and more will to live as the days go on, I'm just barely surviving I don't even get a chance to live, I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I don't even have any outlets to use because I don't wanna overwhelm the only friends I have and I feel like thats all I do, I just overwhelm and make them uncomfortable but they say I'm fine but I think they're just lying to make me feel better I think they just would feel guilty if I died but they don't actually like me or anything they wish they could get rid of me without me dying or something I just wanna give in I wanna just leave I wanna burn because I feel like I deserve it I feel like I deserve to because all I do is make peoples lives harder and more uncomfortable and I know its true because I didn't honor my dad who I supposedly love because I ""wasn't feeling good"" like I'm just a lazy piece of shit who does nothing but make everyone's life a living hell and I never add anything to any conversation but I still don't want to be alone anymore I just wanna feel like I'm cared about without feeling like strings are attached, without feeling like I'm a burden or an inconvenience and I just want a hug from someone I love who loves me and I wanna just feel like I belong again for the second time in my life, but the last time I did it ended horribly and I ended up being a fucking asshole who didn't respect peoples boundaries for my own selfish needs and was generally a bad friend constantly guilt tripping people into not leaving me alone and making insensitive jokes and generally just being a nuisance to the world who needed and still needs to be removed, I just need to bleed out on the floor feeling every ounce of pain as I just sit there and bleed and bleed or set myself on fire and feel my flesh burn away, or anything to just die just take a shotgun to my head and blast away or take a knife and slit my throat wrists etc. And just I don't know anymore.

4540,ubhop2,prawnsandthelike,"I dunno.  I used to be a really outgoing kid, for all the abuse I grew up with.  Playground talks with class loners was my jam in elementary.  Videogames were always on the tip of my tongue in middle school.  Long, winding rants asking questions about adulthood was something I'd often do in highschool.  I was scared of failing at school, sure, but I was more scared of being alone.

And I made friends that way.  I think I was just a living, breathing person who wanted to think dumb questions out loud, constantly ask ""how was your day?"", and when we got close enough: ""What makes you tick?""  And I learned a lot of about others, especially their hardships, their loneliness, the petty family squabbles that their parents put these kids my age through.  We just sat down along the inside of the high school halls until our parents picked us up.  Later, we texted each other on Facebook (back when it didn't have Messenger as a standalone).  And later still, we'd voicecall each other on Skype while we were in the kitchen, studying for AP exams, etc.

I had a mental breakdown for about a half year, due to anxiety I didn't know I had, but I graduated with everyone.  And my friends were welcoming me back with open arms.

That was the end of high school.  It wasn't perfect, but connecting online was a genuinely human interaction.  I hit people up the same way I did in real life, too.  ""How's your day?""  ""Good morning!""  ""Long time no see; what's good?""

We all split when it came to college.  Which was fine; it made sense to pursue our own career paths in our own individual ways.  I went to a community college because I refused to attend university with my siblings.  I still contacted my friends online, talked with a few of them about dating, but never actually did anything serious.  And like clockwork, I was the one approaching people with the questions and getting myself dragged into long, deeply interesting and intimate conversations.

Then I missed a birthday party.  I told them beforehand I couldn't physically make it; I was literally a broke college kid just trying to scrounge by.  But my intentions were there, no?  I made sure to message them at 12AM in the morning, because I actually cared about being on the dime.

Then I missed a hangout.  I told them that I was busy with classwork; I was frying my brain on STEM classes.  And this would go on, and on, and on.  But I've been an online staple, and I've tried to be as present as I could possibly be.  I've deliberately gone out of my way to contact people out of the blue if we fell out of touch.  I even spent extra time to hang out with friends once I had some semblance of an income and transferred into university.

A year and a half ago, I was talking to a friend about moving in with them to finish graduate studies.  It was a joke; I had no business up there, but I entertained the thought because it seemed like any other food-for-thought conversation.

Then I was hit with some harsh statements: ""You're not a good friend.""  ""You keep on suggesting things that would never happen.""  ""You forgot about my birthday gift.""  ""I think you don't care about me.""

I guess I'm not a good friend because I'm just physically unavailable, but we're at the opposite ends of the county trying to pursue our own wildly different careers.  I didn't stop asking about how things were going with their family and relationships.  I didn't ever stop being the one to contact them first.  And it was a genuinely busy time, being at the end of my college career.

""I'll stop being half-assed then, I promise,"" I said.  ""Look, we're both on the beginning of our careers, and neither of us are working beyond the normal 9-5 for now.  We'll have time for each other, as adults!  And to make true on that promise, I'm going to start with your birthday gift.""

""It isn't about the birthday gift; it's about you not owning up to what you say.""

""The moving out together was a joke.""  It really was.  Something nice to juggle with in the mind, but not ever a serious consideration because of how obviously different our lives were.  ""But I'll stop, okay?  Look, I'll be more serious with what I'm talking about.""

And that was that.  No response, nothing.  I hit them up a day later, then a week.  Then a month.  Then half a year before I just stopped.  I still like their social media posts, and they seem to be doing well for themselves.  But they just stopped treating me like I existed.  It was like every attempt on my end to keep contact with them didn't matter. Like my team eating with their family didn't exist.  Like I wasn't there to advise and console them on their first few relationships gone awry.

I've tried to swallow it down, the fact that they don't want my friendship anymore.  And I know people have their own priorities, their own concerns, their own values.  And I know I'm not owed anything -- not even an explanation -- because people have the right to end things on their own terms.

That was one of my closer friendships.  Less dramatic versions of the same events have been happening otherwise.  I just slip between the cracks, year after year.  I'm present in many people's pictures, and I don't think it'd be hard to recall some surprisingly detailed conversation about their favorite topics.  But that's just it; I can't focus my energy on even a few friends, because at that point I would just take up too much of their time.

And I know no one owes me anything, but...I don't think I've ever been approached out of the blue anymore.   The scariest thing is that I'm not even sad, angry, or grieving anymore.  Just hollow.

If I didn't exist, would my friends still be loners today?  Would they have been tied up in some bad relationships without me to intervene?  Would they still be screaming their heads off at their parents because I wouldn't be there to intermediate between the two?  It was never my right to intervene on their behalf, but they asked for my help.  What kind of friend would I be if I fled?

I want to be owed those answers whether by God or by my friends.  Even if it isn't my right, I want to know so, so badly.  Just to so I can try to begin grasping whatever the fuck this is.",2022-04-25 10:10:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1505177038,4,/r/lonely/comments/ubhop2/i_know_no_one_owes_me_anything_but/,,0,3,"I know no one owes me anything, but..."

Whenever I feel like expressing, i get crushed by my thoughts and im the only one who listens to myself. I don't have friends. They secretly have a group and never invited me. I knew for 3 years. Yet I never asked them. what's the point in asking, they're not my friends anymore or they probably never have been and I'm just a fool. I feel extremely lonely, i don't talk to anyone because im afraid they would just burn me to the ground for anything i say. reading posts from other people here makes me really sad and wished i could help them. i realize how little and unimportant my misery is compared to them. but i never complain. i can't complain even if something is wrong. i don't have any goals anymore. my friend said he'd like to be a pilot with me. where do i fly?
im very scared of people because certain moments or people in my life may have caused a bit of a mark in my memory for something I've done wrong. i know that punishment are necessary at times, but i have this weird foggy memory of my brother protecting me from my mother beating me up. im not sure if its real and i wonder if its a dream or if i just made it up.
why would i make it up? i don't feel anything remembering about that memory. I also have alot of bad memories of my father being not so patient about little things. my brother strayed away when he went to school and got friends. his attitude changed and i ended being someone that is very distant from my family. im sad and lonely. i wish someone could see behind my defenses since im not in control of my guard.",2022-04-25 15:45:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645628108,2,/r/lonely/comments/ubo53i/so_i_cant_express_myself/,,0,3,"So, I can't express myself."

4627,ubxz53,ProgressIsALifestyle,"I won‚Äôt go into huge detail about our issues, because I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs relevant. But I loved her more than I‚Äôve ever loved anyone. 

She brought out the goofy side of me that no one ever gets to see. I could tell her things I could never tell anyone; she never broke that trust, and never let those things make her love me less. I could be my true self with her, and she could be her true self with me. She made me laugh, think, and imagine a future that I never could have before. And I just broke her heart.


I hadn‚Äôt felt like it‚Äôd been the healthiest for a while, because of both our insecurities feeding off one another. It became something that would keep me up half the night, when I‚Äôm someone who desperately needs structure, routine, and sleep to function. I almost ended it a while back, but we decided to work on ourselves and our relationship instead. I kept finding that working on myself was significantly harder due to worrying about her, and I don‚Äôt think I can afford that extra stress in my life right now. I have a history of self-destructive, sometimes suicidal behavior, and I can‚Äôt risk it. So I said goodbye about an hour ago.


I plan to continue pursuing progress and improvement, including therapy, but I know it‚Äôs going to be hard. I have zero friends within 100 miles, and she was the only person I ever talk to. I‚Äôm sure that was part of our, or my, problem. I‚Äôve got pretty bad social anxiety except for when I drink, but drinking makes those self-destructive tendencies multiply like rabbits on ecstasy. I also am very broke with no car, which makes setting up an outing difficult without feeling like a burden. I feel like I‚Äôm doing the right thing for my well-being, but I also feel empty. I know the steps I have to take though.

The past several days I have just been obsessed with adventure and romance stories. I don't think I will have that loving, happy, hopeful relationship for a long time. I think I would make a great girlfriend and I don't think I look too bad. But I am uninteresting, Plain-Jane, and struggle with severe anxiety and worsening depression. 

Idk my mind is focused on the objects around me (I feel cluttered) but I want to cry from loneliness. I don't have much stuff and am really debating on getting a storage unit tomorrow. Maybe less stuff around me will make me feel less overwhelmed. I have purged everything I don't want before. Now there is stuff I want to keep.I went to college for social work ( graduated 4 months ago) and am a caregiver for the elderly right now (25F). But I put off becoming a social worker because of my mental health. Here lately I have been thinking of checking myself into a mental health facility. I don't think I should have children. They would end up hating me because of the anxiety and worrying about them would kill me. 

I can't stay awake anymore. I'm always so tired. On my lunch break today, I went to my car and slept. It was a good sleep too. I hate food I feel guilty to eat it because everyone says I've gained weight (112 pounds at 4'11"").  I come home and spend my off days laying in bed dreaming about a relationship.

It felt as though that most people I tried to make friends with in my classes tried to keep me at arms length. Lots of people here feel very reserved and cliquey.

There is a discord server where I regularly talk to some people but I get the feeling that they tolerate my presence more than see me as a friend. It doesn't help that they constantly talk about their relationships and people they've hooked up with, which only seems to fuel this feeling of loneliness. The people I have tried to hangout with are mostly interested in raves and large parties, something I'm not all too interested in as I have a rather low social battery. I'd prefer something more chill - like having a friend over for a drink and some board games.

I tried to use dating apps to find any sort of connection but most people I matched with aren't that interested in small talk or anything beyond wanting to hookup. I'm demisexual so it's very difficult for me to feel any sort of sexual attraction to anyone without at least getting to know them better.

I decided to go to a college a few hours away since my friend was going here and it had a better computer science program. Ever since then I have managed to not make a single friend in these two semesters besides our roommate who is awesome but we aren't that close.

I had a gf when i got here but things ended very badly at my expense around 2 months in to college. After that I didn't have the self esteem to try to make friends and I basically locked myself in my dorm and only left when I had to. The loneliness was crippling to say the least lol. It eventually caused my grades to suffer but i managed to get all A's except one class.

Going home to my family helped a lot and I helped my grandparents with numerous projects which made me feel a huge sense of accomplishment going back for this semester. Now here I am, barely getting b's in my classes, still no college friends, and am again secluding myself in my room skipping classes just playing guitar and video games. 

I realize skipping classes doesnt really help my chances but i'm scared of how my professors and peers would view me seeing me come in after so long. I do also have friends from home on discord that i talk to, but because of group drama, 3/5 friends left and i decided to stay with the two that I did because i've known them for a long time, despite being told to not be around them.

ANYWAYS, 

I think being alone rocks. I am lonely, but i stopped caring a long time ago. I have all the time in the world to do things that I enjoy. 

I went to watch The Northman by myself at the theater,  a theater where ive been at with other friends that I've since lost, and i thought I'd be sad that they weren't there with me.

 But tbh i wasnt sad about it. I refuse to be sad anymore. I know whats coming is mine, i understand that sometimes in life we are forced to be alone, for whatever reason. Growth, change, opportunity, whatever.

 There are better days ahead but that is no excuse to neglect the present. Go watch that movie by yourself. Go dine in somewhere GOOD by yourself and enjoy every second. Go walk in nature and enjoy the little things. The right people will come at the right time. Enjoy today, any way you can. Only then will you attract the right folks. Love you all

My GF of almost 4 years just got home from a few days away with a close female friend and left me. She claims I am not working hard enough to improve myself, my livelihood, my living situation, or my mindset. Continued in post.


I work in data management for a large oil &amp; gas engineering firm. I met my GF on my lunch break almost 4 years ago at the local downtown library where I would sometimes go on lunches to find a quiet spot, read, she calm my mind (my job is rather stressful). She was then a receptionist at another close by downtown firm and came to the library for similar reasons. We bonded over our shared love of books, music and film.

Since then, my position at work has stayed essentially the same, with minor pay raises on set dates. She has been promoted multiple times from reception up to lower management. She has made more money than me for a couple years now but says she doesn‚Äôt care. But I gave long suspected that she does.

I knew things had somewhat been fading between us for at least a year, but I attributed that to all relationships kind of slowing down, losing intensity and heat as time goes on.

We were still having pretty good sex fairly frequently and getting out and doing activities and talking and everything what I thought was a healthy amount when we weren‚Äôt at work.

Now, I‚Äôve never been in the BEST of shape, but, since having a VERY serious (as in, I came very close to dying) bout with Covid in November 2020, my energy levels have been much lower and I‚Äôve put on some pounds as result.

Still, I am what I would consider ‚Äúhusky‚Äù, no larger, and she has a extra pounds, as well (we have always had that in common).

Anyway, in the incredibly emotional 5 hour long incredibly heated ‚Äúdumping discussion‚Äù we had, she basically turned all that on my head and said that what I viewed as ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, she viewed as NOT good enough, and had apparently been into my for the majority of our time together that she wanted me to improve myself and my life in almost every way, and she was getting continually more and more dissatisfied with my lack of ambition and lack of drive to change.

We had grown (I thought) closer together during Covid / work from home (I have continued to work from home but she has been back in the office for almost 2 months now) but it turns out she had just been getting increasingly frustrated with how easily I adapted to being housebound and ‚Äúusing Covid as an excuse‚Äù to stop going out, stop exercising as much, stop caring about my appearance, and to not seek more gainful employment with better chances of promotion, higher pay, and potential travel / vacation opportunities (she has always wanted to travel and one of the things she has enjoyed most as she got promoted at her job has been the opportunity to go on exciting business trips to meet with vendors and potential new clients, one of which was the trip she had just returned from before ending things between us).

I am shook. Destroyed. Grief ridden. Giving my dog endless hugs. It has taken me 2 hours to type this post. And I could go on and on.

I FUCKING LOVED HER WITH ALL MY HEART. All my other relationships were shit, garbage, infantile, compared to her. She took me from worrying I would be alone together to literally starting (in my head) to plan a marriage proposal to her around her birthday near Christmas of this year.

Now I am left scared I‚Äôll be alone forever again, with the added irony of now knowing just how good things can be.

How could I be so stupid, so oblivious, so blind?

How did I miss what she said were very frequent warnings and notices from her?

Was I just really that stupid? I like to think I‚Äôm a fairly smart and observant guy.

How could this have happened? Should I attempt to stay in contact with her, maybe get her back? She returned every gift and shared belonging and packed up all her possessions and is now staying with her parents in literally a different province.

I have not been able to summon up the courage to contact her again yet.

I am about to get very VERY drunk.

Any tips or advice for moving on / forward / how to deal?

I suppose it's late and my mind if just wandering,

I've always felt like a lonely person for a while now, I am aware I have friends and family and that I am surrounded by many people and all the while I am truly grateful for this.

I've always longed for a partner, someone special and dear to me, someone I can cuddle up with and someone that would make me feel less lonely, not to say I'd put all my happiness into a person but I'm just saying it wouldn't be bad to feel like you special to someone else.

Anyways I did find that special someone for the first time in my whole life, it was kind of shocking to me seeing thought I did not know how I had accomplished this, she was everything to me, she made me happy and made me feel whole. I think I made the mistake of putting all my feelings with her but regardless after she broke up with me it just made me feel even lonelier than I already was.

I'm always up late at night again always thinking of these things, how I wish to be special to someone and how I know this special person will come eventually, I'm just really lonely and sad. I just feel empty all the time and I just feel like I should belong to someone.

I have flaws, lots of flaws, but I swear I'm not that bad. (just flex about myself a bit) I can fluently play guitar, piano, bass, drums, and other string instrument and I can even sing, but I'd exchange all of those skills for one or two people with that I can feel connected. I'm so lonely. I drink NyQuil every night because it helps me sleep longer, and the more I sleep, the less time I have to be ""alive"" during the day. I hate NyQuil. It's slowly killing me, but I also hate the loneliness. It's a ticking time bomb, and I don't know what it would like if it explodes. I've been lonely for years.

4697,uc6qlg,Orbitofchaos,"Everyone always talks about loving yourself first, knowing your worth, and enjoying your own presence and alone time before liking anyone else or getting into a relationship. But no one talks about the loneliness you feel when you do love yourself, know your worth, and enjoy time alone, but no one wants you still. Overall I like who I am as a person, I think I have clear strengths, I‚Äôm the gift giving, physically affectionate kind of person. I appreciate tiny things and thanks to my raging ADHD I can be a pretty spontaneous and fun person. I‚Äôve learned to love my alone time but now that I‚Äôve hit that stage I‚Äôd also like to share space and time with someone else. Being aware of my good qualities and ‚Äúmy worth‚Äù only puts salt in the wound when I‚Äôm forced to ask myself ‚Äúif I can do all of this why does no one want me?‚Äù I think sometimes, as cocky as it sounds Ik, how I would be the perfect girlfriend since I‚Äôd care so much and cater to their needs or because our personalities just match so well; but then it stops at that when I never become that girlfriend‚Ä¶ to anyone. It‚Äôs hard to explain honestly but there‚Äôs this weird feeling of not being enough that comes out of knowing you are (?) 

Once I became more aware of what I have to offer I‚Äôve started to wonder why no one else sees it or I think that if I have these good qualities then what am I doing wrong to not be attracting anyone. I think how I tend to love hard and have never in my life been loved the way I love others. Everyone deserves love so why am I never receiving any. What is it about me that isn‚Äôt meeting the criteria for anyone else? 

After hearing this I truly resonate with it: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs possible that some people are born to give more love than they will ever receive in return.‚Äù 

So much of my energy is put into other people or doing the things I don‚Äôt have any choice or control over and it‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs an endless cycle of having so much hope that maybe THIS person will finally be the one and I‚Äôll receive the love I deserve. Then getting completely led on and feeling like I‚Äôll never be enough for anyone else.",2022-04-26 07:09:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602647782,6,/r/lonely/comments/uc6qlg/what_no_one_talks_about_lonely_edition/,,0,8,What no one talks about (lonely edition)

around 2019 it was summer and I met this girl online, we talked on the phone, played games, watched movies on FaceTime, sadly we never met in person we tried so many times. it was a nice relationship but then the first day of school (she went to a different school) she was acting weird all day, after school I called her and she was fine at first later That night she said that she was tired and was going to sleep which was weird because we always slept on the phone together but I brushed it off and I I said bye and that I loved her (it was the first time I told her I loved her) and she told me she loves me too a couple hours later I get a text from her saying that she's not ready for a relationship and she is Breaking up with me. I later found that 3 days after the break up she got a new man. there still together till this day it still hurts but not as much as my first post.

Turns out I‚Äôm an emotional drunk.

I start crying after being 10ish drinks in.

Eventually go home, drunk text a few people, one of them being a small crush I had.

We start talking more.

She wanted to install Tinder again and find someone else.

I confess that I like her.

She says she‚Äôll see how it‚Äôll turn out between us, we should hang out more and get to know each other more first but as a group as opposed to just the two of us.

Turns out she‚Äôs also speaking to another friend of mine, decently close at that. (This friend at the time when we were drinking was already talking to another person and was making out with them in front of us too)

Her replies start becoming blunt whenever we talk, one worded or just uninterested. 

I feel this and start to give up. 

Two days later I get a message from them, in a nutshell she hit it off with my friend better, and didn‚Äôt want to lead me on, these two also hit it off during college too but didn‚Äôt go further for unspecified reasons.

I play it off and wish then the best of luck. 

I‚Äôm on call with my other friends, I start crying and punching my wall in anger.

8 years of bottled up emotions came flowing out, I don‚Äôt know why. 

I removed everyone I knew from everything so there was no way in contacting me, except for a few people I cared about.

finding their way back to the home

becoming one with the existence

the unspoken stories
through the whispers of wind

The prettiest smile 
slowly becoming shapeless 
now void of any identity

dissolving with time 
the assuring voice 
fading away into infinity
While the assurance &amp; warmth 
still passionately
waiting for someone.

My best friend, who I love, got a boyfriend a few months ago. Naturally I was somewhat forgotten about, which is totally fine given it's her boyfriend vs me, but it's been months now, the friendship has been getting worse, and I wish I didn't love her so I could be done with her entirely.

2 other friends who get along with my best friend's boyfriend have only come back into my life because said boyfriend is too busy to speak to them.

Family is a mess, immediate family was emotionally abusive, and I've recently moved out.

Got Tinder to see if I could find some sort of friendship or anything to distract me or start something new with no luck as of yet.

Even mates and normal friends don't provide the bare minimum.

Trying not to give up and end it all, but I've been having bad thoughts for years now. I've become a worse person because of it. Shared it all with my best friend and she hasn't responded in any meaningful way (said a bunch of words, but that's all they were). In fact, she judges me for some of the defense mechanisms I've had to gain over time, saying they're ""not fair to new people"", which is true but I have no reason to care.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here again and I don't really think I'll get over this deep loneliness that I feel inside. Even if I did feel happy, immediately after that I feel the loneliness crawling on my body and eating me alive. It's exams week today, I'm already overwhelmed and stressed about everything. I still manage to do some tasks but I have an imposter syndrome. I don't think I'm learning despite some good marks, I see myself as nothing without these achievements and I have to keep myself busy otherwise, I'll be more and more stuck in my loneliness.I grew up in a household where your worth is defined by what you accomplished every day and that sucks.. I can't even concentrate for too long, I'd have to play a movie or show to keep me somewhat going and then I'll just see myself just watching. I hate this. I'm not as studious as I used to be. Looking back during f2f classes, I didn't know how I managed to do those things. I just feel nothing, I know who I am but I don't at the same time. Today I saw my classmates posting stories about them having study group sessions and I know to myself that I learn better by self-studying but I still feel some sadness that I don't have anyone I can connect to. Even with my only two friends, we don't really know everything about each other. It's because I also hide myself. I want someone to connect with but as a way of guarding my sanity, I just chose what I want to show. I had one guy that I really connected with but I broke my contact with him because I was getting distracted with school and stuff. I regretted it. He was so nice to me, we just click. And it was new to me coming from an abusive relationship with my ex.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I always always think I'm a lost cause. I have ambitions but they just seem to far to reach. Even now with my course, I love this field but I don't know if I'll really learn. I just do things just to pass now. I lost my enthusiasm for everything I used to love. Also now, my mom got mad at me too. She's a master of silent treatments and I don't intend to talk to her. I just. I hate everything. I wanna go away here, I want to just start a new life in another place but I know I'll just end up more and more lonely and I'll eventually die. I just want to feel safe and loved, that's all I ask. I just wanted someone to not get tired of hearing about my day, my happy stories, accomplishments and what not. Didn't have a father growing up, mom was overseas back then, left with old grandparents, no siblings. I understood that but why do I have to be abused (emotionally and sexually) by my first boyfriend ever? It's just like life's throwing shit at me. Oh how hard it is to look for a genuine love and security in this world even though a lot of us are lonely.

4777,uclqoc,ZeroX2021,"I just don't believe there is anything that is worth living for. Like, what's the point of putting effort into things you don't like or want to do when the outcome is also undesirable or blurry at best. Like, a hyperbolic example would be like your boss asking you to work the weekend but they wont pay you for it. You obviously wouldn't just work for nothing on your day off, but you might if they offered you a million dollars. I think the same applies for any action a person might do; that the degree of motivation dictates our endeavors, whether those motivators are personal or external. I don't believe I have any motivation to do anything other than the bare minimum required to survive an be comfortable, yet I still desire things like a relationship, wealth, or property. I just don't believe that my desires are achievable and therefore have no motivation to chase them. Like, I'm sure we all want more money and might be willing to work extra to make it, but like in my example, you wouldn't put in extra work if you were told you wouldn't get paid for it. I'm not even sure why I lost hope to begin with, but I doubt that I can get it back simply by thinking harder or by listening to the words of strangers.

A lot of interesting stuff happened, and at the end of the day, I feel exhausted just staring into emptiness, expecting someone to be there, who can listen to my thoughts and share theirs too, who can reassure me when I'm feeling low, and who I can feel safe and secure with. 

I'm a junior at college, and it's the week just before finals. A lot is going on. I feel let down today, I also feel I have let down others. I feel I could've done better. And a scenario of what could have been done better is constantly running in my mind, in the middle of the night. It's just difficult to go through all of this alone,  and yearning for affection, yearning for an old version of yourself who you know would've done a better job, wanting to have your person to lean back on when it all gets overwhelming.

My life is pretty good. I'm very grateful for it, I have good friends, but somehow cannot open up to them. I can't open up to anybody. It's also my first time posting something like this. At the end of the day, there's just you and a void. 

I've felt like this before plenty of times and have come out of it too, untill I start feeling like this again. But we gotta have hope. Hope in a new day and hope in new opportunities.

I am a nice guy yet somehow I am that type of guy who is in a group but is shadow casted by others. I got a couple of friends but its like they dont really give a damn about me. None of them talk to me unless I message or call them first.

It has been like this from the good old school days but I realized this a couple of years before and hoping that some miracle will happen and I will no longer be lonely anymore.

I have been feeling not only lonely but also low due to some personal jealousy issues thanks to my shit cousins.

To top it all off, I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Panic disorder and currently on medications.

I tried to make my life better by sleeping early and gym etc and while I admit it did bring small term changes but I buckled up after a week or two because motivation fades away.

I wish I had a GF for emotional support because all of my friends I had are Fake unfortunately.

No one looks at me in the eye when I speak or am part of a conversation. When I try to hang out with others they grow quiet, check their phones or leave the room. 

I don't know if it's my face or my personality or my poster or what. I have some social skills, so I know that I'm not rambling or oversharing. In fact, plenty of times I will be talking about, let's say, a show, and I'll be interrupted so someone else can say the exact same thing that I was saying. I am kind, not mean, I secretly have depression but I will smile a little and put on a happy face. I think I'm a bit funny. I think I'm not very pretty and someone once told me I'm very average looking, so that should at least mean that I am not ugly right? So is it a problem with my looks? 

It's so incredibly sad and frustrating when I say hi to someone I know and they don't say it back, or when I say something in a conversation but no one looks at me or responds and just acts like I'm not there. Sometimes in a group setting someone just walks over and stands in front of me like I'm not even there. And the thing is that it's not just a few people who treat me this way, it is literally everyone that I encounter. It makes me want to cry, scream and punch things but I know that I can not do all that so I just cry.

 I just feel like those people who say ""Just go out and have fun by yourself. Being lonely doesn't have to be sad."" aren't actually lonely. They'll go somewhere and have fun then go out with friends another time. For lonely people going out can make you feel good until you're envious of the couple or friends laughing together.

4871,ucy7w9,Glass_Excitement_538,"In my experience the feeling of falling in love is an immense whirlwind of happiness, nervous energy, sheer blind faith and a little bit of luck. That moment when you utter some of the hardest words to say on earth like ‚ÄúI have a crush on you‚Äù, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù or the infamous ‚Äúit‚Äôs only ever been you‚Äù words like these require every fibre of your being to get over that feeling of fear and go for it. 

I can honestly say I‚Äôve felt that whirlwind only twice in my life but it‚Äôs a sickening feeling of you feel these emotions about someone who doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. I looked at my ex-girlfriend and thanked everything above I was with her, I felt amazing around her, felt like I mattered furthermore it was like I had someone who loved me for me, no mask or charade. 

It took me 4 years to get over the heartbreak over our breakup to which I won‚Äôt mention the cause or reasons behind it. I started to open my heart to the idea that I could love again, feel those emotions again and I did with the most beautiful Irish girl you‚Äôve seen, her eyes are astonishingly deep blue, her smile lights up the room and when she laughs it warms my heart deeply. I sadly cannot say she feels the same though, I haven‚Äôt asked her directly however I know with certainty I‚Äôm not thought of in the same light, my feelings are one sided as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of mine took joy in telling me and I quote ‚Äú(Blank) doesn‚Äôt even remotely like you back lmafo told you, you were hoping for a miracle‚Äù and then proceeded to show me a screenshot of her saying ‚ÄúI like him as a friend if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking but I don‚Äôt see anything more in it‚Äù as you can imagine I told this former ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to get lost in other words because of the way he told me. 

Now as much as it hurts that it‚Äôs not reciprocated, I still want to be there for her and I now feel like if I‚Äôm a good friend to her, if I have her back then I‚Äôll be able to help her find happiness with someone she likes or even loves. In my heart it would be painful but in my mind I cherish the thought of her happy, enjoying life and being with someone she wants to be with. 

There may be a time in future when she finds out my feelings and a conversation has to be had about them but for now I keep it to myself, locked away to be forgotten or as best as it can be. I don‚Äôt think my heart can take the loneliness anymore but the thought of outright rejection from even being a friend terrifies me even more so for now I‚Äôll close off my heart to stop it from hurting as much but one day I might be happy, one day I might get my moment and when it comes I‚Äôll be the happiest man on earth.",2022-04-27 07:47:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600676056,4,/r/lonely/comments/ucy7w9/failing_in_love/,,0,0,Failing in love

4874,ucyl9n,Lost-Object-9701,"But I don't have a job and I've never had a job, and I'm 24, and, though I genuinely impressed someone, once they realized that I don't have a job, they had blocked me. And, I guess I understand. But, I don't, all the same. What's wrong with getting to know someone who has this issue? I am inwardly conflicted about how I should feel about this, but at the end of the day, I shouldn't feel anything about it. 

Anyways, tonight, after several months, I have finally 'found' the missing links for my webcomic's overarching (and underlying) plot. I have been getting the chills for a while, as it's better than I had imagined, and less contrived than what I had feared. I can finally write that initial scene that I have skipped over, since I knew it would need to tie deeply into the underlying narrative, and didn't want to commit to something before figuring out how exactly it would tie in, and which details would be important. I had almost lost hope that I'd be able to conceive a layered plot, so, I feel a lot of relief. I just wish I didn't go through the effort of opening up to that person. In my opinion, success isn't the end-measure of a person's value. 

I think that my future became a bit less bleak, though. Realistically, as a severe sufferer of GAD, if I can create something that blows someone away... if I can create a genuine fanbase of any size, my life will have some more solid purpose, and it could become or catalyze a proper career. I'll consider it... my portfolio. 

Is it wise to put all my eggs in this basket? No. I'm a burden to my parents, and my depressive state saddens them. 

But this is all that I'm good for. The writing was on the wall, and the seeds were sewn as far back as kindergarten, that I actually am some sort of a creative project leader, though, I don't need to lead anyone. I'll do it all myself, and it will be a story that, though it has its inspirations, will definitely have its own identity. I'm not a huge reader, so I can't say for certain that a similar plot hasn't been done, and though there are only so many types of plots one can make, I think that all the circumstances within it justify it as being referenced as unique, because my mind's pretty weird! 

I can actually feel hope without having a girlfriend right now- it's a pretty interesting revelation! And a momentary break in that encroaching vignette of crushing despair!

4887,ud0ap9,OmarJab," 

I thought a lot about my situation, i spent days and nights wondering why I'm this lonely and eventually, I figured out the reason, or at least one of them.  
The problem is that I'm boring. I spent my last year focusing on my future and career and basically forgot how to have fun with others.  
When I was young I was the complete opposite, I was the kid in class that would talk to anybody with no problems and was able to keep the conversation going for hours. Literally, with anybody.  
Everything started to change after 2019 and the pandemic only gave me the final hit, the one that I didn't need but still received and it completely changed me.  
It's not the pandemic itself that has ruined me because I was already used to staying home and not going out for long.  
The problem though is that it made me realize how lonely i was.  
During that period I've also lost my bond with a girl that i liked (a lot) and who was the only that was helping me to keep going.  
After i lost her, everything has fallen apart, i was completely lonely and the 2020's summer was for sure one of the worst periods I've ever lived.  
There wasn't a day where i didn't cry, inside, not outside because for some reason i can't..  
I eventually asked some people out but they were all ""busy"" with their friend groups so they would always deny or make an excuse.  
I made it through, somehow, i survived, thank god.  
In the late part of that summer, i met some people, online, that helped me to get a little bit better. In particular, a girl.  
Going forward, i also met another girl near me, but due to some reasons, it wasn't easy for us to meet but at least we kept talking and only now i realize how lucky i got to meet her, and I'm grateful for that.  
Somehow i managed to also get through that year at school even though the period from March to June wasn't the best and I've completely felt alone.  
Fortunately, i made a friend before the beginning of the summer so i finally had someone to spend my summer with. I was really happy and grateful for that, i don't know if it was the same for her, but i hope so.

But now, let's talk about why i said i'm boring.  
Why do i think that about myself? Because whenever i have the chance to talk to someone, i don't know what to say and as an overthinker, when i see that the other person seems (even if it is actually that way) a little bit detached or cold, i panic and don't know what to say and give up on keeping the conversation.  
In-person it's a little bit better, even though there are a lot of silent moments, i try to find something to talk about but still, it ain't .

I'm kinda boring because i focus on other things rather than the ones, most people my age, do.  
Like, whenever I'm free, I will be looking for new things to learn and to improve, so what would i talk about with other people? nothing.  
That's why they avoid me, they only talk to me when it's needed (ex: school work) and nothing else. Because of that, people don't even ask me out or invite to do some things together.  
I can't complain tho, i recognize my flaw and i would probably do the same.  
It's obvious that nobody likes to spend their time with someone they think is boring.  
This has lead me to slowly accept my loneliness and start a solo journey of improving myself and learn as much as possible and i'm satisfied with that at least, but sometimes i would like to have somebody to spend my free time with, talk, have fun and much more but it seems it's impossible for me.

Don't get me wrong, i'm extremely grateful for my life. It could have been much worse and i'm grateful for the little good things i have. Thank you god and thank dad and mom.

I hope god has better plans for me for the future, i think i deserve it &lt;3",2022-04-27 10:22:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1564145644,1,/r/lonely/comments/ud0ap9/quick_vent_about_my_situation_why_im_boring_and/,,0,2,Quick vent about my situation why i'm boring and why I feel lonely

I loved you so bad
I didn‚Äôt believe in love 
the day you first made fun of my novels
you somehow knew all my tells
and that was that 

I loved you so bad 
i never ran into trouble 
you said have you ever been high 
that day I learned how to lie 
but not to you

I loved you so bad 
i could barely breathe 
so I grasped your shirt with fear
Your hands burned my skin
and yet I‚Äôd never felt safer 

I loved you so bad
so cold from the rain
I wept in your arms for the first time
like an idiot I kissed you in your car
so silly to think you were mine 

I loved you so bad 
but then i left for college 
before we knew it you‚Äôd fallen in love
I‚Äôm so sorry i left you alone
you keep me alive 

I loved you so bad 
like a kid who gets grounded 
and feels a mix of rage and shame
but unlike a kid I knew how to lie
how could I?

I loved you so bad 
but you never loved me back 
not like that

I loved you so bad
why did you ever kiss me
you know me better than anyone else 
and yet you ruined my life 
still i love you so bad",2022-04-27 12:25:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645632080,3,/r/lonely/comments/ud2cdb/best_friend/,,0,0,Best friend

I've had romantic experiences before, I've kissed a couple girls, and done some bits, but It's always ended badly (both of them had boyfriends I was unaware about).

Every night I torture myself about how I can‚Äôt find anyone, I think I‚Äôve thought about it every day since I turned 18. As a result I have extremely low self esteem and I constantly think about how I'm not good enough. I'm not even that afraid of rejection, so I don't know why I find it hard to approach girls, maybe because I just feel like there's no point. It's quite ironic really, because everyone says I come across as extremely confident and funny.

I know I'm not that old, and that it will probably happen eventually, but I just constantly have a voice in my head telling me that I'll never find love, and that I'm not good looking enough, or too weird.

4912,ud403s,Kumoitachi,"It‚Äòs been two months now since my partner told me that they didn‚Äòt love me anymore. They‚Äòve been dealing with anxiety and depression and started to question everything and kinda confessed to me that they didn‚Äòt love me romantically anymore. Since then I feel like my life‚Äòs over. I‚Äòve tried my best to gave them space and time for themselves to figure them out, I read and watched several things about this topic, but so far it‚Äòs been a waste of time.

I don‚Äòt think I will ever find someone as amazing as them every again and it‚Äòs breaking me. They were always I was always looking for in a partner, they were truly the love of my life. They even told me that they felt the same with me, but now they don‚Äòt wanna try anymore, they‚Äòre not even sure if they even want a relationship with anyone. This is the worst‚Ä¶ because I really tried my fucking best to be an amazing partner but it somehow still wasn‚Äòt enough? This was the first time I really felt appreciated and loved and desireable and now it‚Äòs all gone and will probably never return. I‚Äòm an awful human being, I don‚Äòt have  normal things to offer and I‚Äòm not even interested in most humans anyway. i have some friends and my family, but I‚Äòm yearning for this intimate relationship I had with them. I felt comfortable around them like with no one else, I wasn‚Äòt afraid to put of my mask around them and I trusted them with so many things about my own mental struggles. I struggled so hard to even told them that I‚Äôm trans! And now they‚Äôre  not even sure anymore if they‚Äôre even bisexual like they thought they were, which is the worst of all. They  started to question their gender too and I was always their biggest supporter, so I even made them part of my transition which I would never do with platonic friends. Those things are just too intimate and now I feel disgusting and  just weird to have them as just some person to know all of this about me. I would have to lie if I didn‚Äòt thought about killing myself, though I would never do that. I wanna achieve my goals, I wanna go to university‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶ wanna be hold and be told that I‚Äòm wonderful and loved for the way I am, that I am enough‚Ä¶ I don‚Äòt think I will ever meet someone who will look at me like I‚Äòm the best thing in the world, I guess I don‚Äòt deserve that anyway‚Ä¶ I never did anything wrong tho, I tried my best, but I‚Äòm simply not enough for others, no matter how hard I try.

The thing that messes up my head the most, a week earlier they already questioned some thing about us.

4936,udaoxh,EERMA,"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can‚Äôt control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can‚Äôt control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it‚Äôs incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you‚Äôll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you‚Äôre grateful for: that you‚Äôre taking control of challenging situations, that you‚Äôre on your way to calmer times, that you‚Äôre learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise ‚Äì whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike ‚Äì has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night‚Äôs sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you‚Äôre focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You‚Äôre pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night‚Äôs sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

 **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",2022-04-27 18:45:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602891040,1,/r/lonely/comments/udaoxh/feeling_overwhelmed/,,0,0,Feeling Overwhelmed?

4939,udbgi3,K_Xpress,"Wanted to ask this question to the group: Do any of you ever start to feel paranoid like you're being watched or do you have a heightened sense of danger after being alone/lonely for a while?

I'm in my mid-20s, work from home, and live alone in a pretty desolate part of LA. I don't really interact face-to-face much with people at all sometimes for weeks. Recently, I've been trying to learn about myself and enjoy my own company by doing things solo such as going to the movies or out to eat and I've been getting used to it (surprisingly I do really enjoy some parts of it) but for some reason I've noticed that I've become extremely paranoid in terms of my safety. In the past, when I've lived in the city surrounded by friends or with an ex-partner, I always had this sense of carefree security like no danger or harm would come to me because I was never going to be singled out as a target. 

These days, though I find myself always checking my rearview mirror when I come back from the movies late at night to make sure I'm not being followed home or even when I'm in bed watching YouTube videos at 1am I can't help but feel like there's someone creeping around my house so I end up checking my Ring app every 5 seconds. 

Could it be an effect of my subconscious wanting to interact with people? Probably, but I never experienced this level of anxiety until before I started being alone for a long period of time.

4941,udbn1g,Upper-Self-7198,Recently i ran away from home with a good friend of mine. He had problems at home and i recently went through the worst part of my life. Me and my friend found a spot to temporarly life in. It was some family of him who don't have contact with his father etc. He told me he has no use to me anymore and casted me out. I'm now currently at one of my aunts who i didn't even knew existed. I have no-one to talk to anymore except my (new discovered family) and they asked me to watch some movies. Instead im writing this. I can't keep that happy smile and make other people laugh. The reason i even ran away was because of a girl who was my best friend. And she blocked me and readded me for no f****** reason. Probably so she and her friends can make fun of me and get a laugh or two.

4957,udcsse,Cassofalltrades,"To this day I still despise the asshole ex who played me, used me, slept with my so-called ""friend"" and dumped me for another so-called ""friend"". I was there for him when he was a broke ass bum and once his life got better tossed me aside and to this day never got paid back the money I lent him. I sacrificed WoW, coffee, and my grades to make him happy and the compromises I made were always one-sided on my part and it was never good enough. Now he can afford to wine and dine the b\*\*\*\* he left me for while i'm struggling.

Afterwards a british jerk swept me off my feet, love bombing me, charming me with my interests only to turn into a flake once he won me over, leading me on for 5 years in a situationship, never wanting to meet up yet still lusting after me. I eventually dumped him because my heart needs to be 100% available for any potential suitor

Finally I reunite online with a childhood ""friend"" shortly after the pandemic started. I used to be best friends with this guy in school until I was forced to move away (something I never wanted to do) . Honestly I had feelings for him the whole time too. Due to my caring actions he eventually caught on and I ultimately confessed. He told me ""we were never friends"" and he only wants to hookup with women. I can get past the latter, but the ""never friends"" part hurt me more especially since he told me before we were ""best friends"". Not even worthy of being friendzoned.

I'm tired of hearing ""it will get better"" and ""love yourself"". I do love myself and have a lot to offer, its just hard finding a genuine friend who does too. Also it hurts seeing those who hurt me doing better in life while i'm still struggling. These experiences have left me feeling cynical and depressed.

4984,udfnn8,covidfuckedmeup,"Venting a bit here, sorry about that if this doesn‚Äôt resonate at all.
I‚Äôm a 27 years old male, working full time, went abroad for my end of studies internship and worked there
I came back to my home country and it‚Äôs been a year. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not privileged, got a good education and job, my family is together, but I‚Äôm dead inside and I feel like I just float in a sea with small islands of social circles. The more I look at it the more I think people in their 20-30s mostly hang out with the friends they made during studies and early years, and I‚Äôm down to only 1 friend that I see every month or so.

I have never had a serious relationship (more than 2 months I guess) and I progressively fear/run away from dating apps because I‚Äôm demotivated the moment I have to speak or meet, I don‚Äôt think I have a lot of green flags good enough to oversight the fact that I‚Äôm extremely lonely &amp; clingy. I did watch a few r/Healthygamergg on that and god I don‚Äôt know how to motivate myself.

I have an extremely bad habit of needing to show my competence and I rewind every single social interaction I have to blame myself, I was quite pressured in my studies and I guess I keep doing that shit. Been in therapy for 1y and a half, started taking anxiolytics to see if that helps but so far not much, I think I just have no motivation whatsoever to try and get out there, connect with people, I stay alone with YouTube and feel like shit every time I eat to cope.

I‚Äôm not a stranger to suicidal thoughts, scenarios and ideation, thank god I don‚Äôt live in a non regulated gun control country because I think I would have considered ending things way more often.

All that to say, I feel like I‚Äôm sinking slowly towards real depression the more the years pass and I only have my work to cope, I even open Slack at midnight to check and keep my mind busy. Chatting with my friend is mostly around work too because I guess I don‚Äôt have many passions left.
Of course in all of this I blame myself for just wanting attention and not really having depression, I guess it‚Äôs the same as ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù for grades but here it‚Äôs to dig myself down.",2022-04-27 22:25:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651096624,5,/r/lonely/comments/udfnn8/years_passing_and_slowly_sinking/,,0,0,Years passing and slowly sinking

I have some vacation time that I have accumulated at my job, and I have to use some of it by a certain point, or I lose the hours. Taking time off from work? Great, I'm all for it! However, it occurred to me that I have nothing to do, and no one to spend it with. I know some will say to take a vacation by myself. No thank you. I've done that many times before, and it's depressing AF now. I've paid my dues in that regard.

It especially sucks when you hear your coworkers hearing about all of the places they've gone with their significant others, etc. I'm happy for them, but it hurts to hear, as I'm sure most of you can understand.

Since working on myself I see the wrong I've done to others so wrote an amends message. I just accepted her message from November today. An amends can wait until tomorrow (As I upload the dozen or so decent pictures of me. Trust me, a dozen out of a hundred or so this week). 

There's absolutely zero chance we'll get back together so I'm not concerned about that but, since that message 11/21, I've sent her a LOT of ridiculous messages on Facebook, something I'm ashamed of which shows it is time to make amends.

4992,udgw8b,QueKings,"Its very few people  in my life that's seen how I actually am and its not if I choose to pretend how I am at work or home, I just know if just keep my responses short and keep to myself then nobody would think a thing. Idk when I started to think I had to be this way, but I've been like this for  years, who wants to hang around the a guy that can't hold a conversation and does nothing for most of this time. Beck when loneliness was only an option for me, I could be social whenever I want, there wasn't sickness or anxiety whenever I spoke to someone. 

7^(th)  grade changed that for me. Relationship was fine but the breakup is probably the main cause of my issues today. Her mother found out we had sex and wasn't happy. Talk to my mother and had an agreement to say away from each other. I'll keep my distance in school and even when we had the same classes and after school when I would usually hang at the park after school, since she was always there just felt like I had to stay away from my friends. I could deal with that though, I always told myself that no matter what happened I could walk anything off. Boy was I wrong. I wasn't popular or anything but I did get around much, so people knew of me or at least my face. Probably a week after the forced breakup, I felt stares from all directions walking in the school. It wasn't the first time feeling this way but this was different. I used to fight a lot back in those days so coming to school the next day and having people stare at you was normal. These were stares of fear and disgust though. Even my closest friends ignored me or kept away from me and I so confused on the matter. Lunch, PE, normal classes, nothing but stares. Wasn't until one day a girl in my class came up to me and asked if I had sex with ( Imma call her Rose, not her real name) Rose, I was shocked and very uncomfortable. I asked how'd you know trying to figure out why rose would expose that. Then she asked if I raped Rose. Everyone around me went silent. I couldn't believe what I had heard and just stared at her. Idk what the look was on my face but after probably 10 mins of silence she said sorry and walked away.

This was the start of my end. For weeks I've felt these stares but I could've never guessed it was for this reason. People already knew that I fought and that just made me look worse. Even though everything was consensual and she was even the one to ask me and I asked her to confirm it again, I was now a rapist in those kids eyes. And people don't know how cruel kids can be and I never knew how weak I was. There was no defending myself cause who would listen, the things I was called and the bullying was out of control. I waited outside school ground until first bell rang and took the shortest way to class. I learned to keep quiet in and outside of class, even when the teacher called on me, I answered with idk or wasn't paying attention to get them to forget about me. Though my grade didn't fall thanks to the abundance of time I had to myself, I lost too many people I considered friends. All because of a rumor.

I guess Rose couldn't handle the guilt, its not as if she hated me, even tried to talk a few time but I wouldn't be stupid enough to let someone catch us alone for any reason. Rose came out and told the truth towards the end of the year. The deed was done though, she didn't really face any backlash and some people tried talking to me saying like,"" you should've spoken up"" or ""why didn't you say anything"". I felt as though when screamed and yelled, no one would listen.  She said her mother forced her to spread those rumors and a few other things but I couldn't care anymore. I was a shell of my former self and only had 1 person stick with me the whole way but too much damage was done. 

All I could do was blame myself, if I just hadn't done this or that, would I have been in this state, I asked myself everyday, every hour, every minute. I couldn't be around anyone, hardly slept and hardly ate. After a while things died down, only her closest friends stuck to her and I still kept to myself. There was no happy ending, and there would never be one. I was broken and beaten, and only told myself to walk it off and the more I did, the more I started to hate waking up the next day, I began to hate myself for not ending it all when things started to pop off. But I knew I didn't want to kill myself. I just hated the fact I had to exist. Even started prying for me not to wake up the next morning or to take away my existence. I gave up on faith shortly after. And that was only 7^(th) grade, the start of my decline. I don't mind opening up about this or letting know about 8^(th) grade: The aftermath and then the hell we call high school. Rose had moved to New York with her mom the following year and I've never seen her again. texted a few times through a friend but I still keep my conversations short because all I can remember when it comes to her, the hell I've been through.",2022-04-27 23:24:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1551227095,2,/r/lonely/comments/udgw8b/just_dont_want_to_exists_anymore_the_beginning/,,0,1,Just don't want to exists anymore: The beginning

I always here of people I am friends with(people I go to school with who are some years younger than me), talk about going on reddit a lot and seeing post for so many different topics. I never truly know where to start with anything. I guess this is my little rant about how life just feels unfulfilling in the most part. I have friends and I have people I care deeply for, but i feel as if no one around me cares deeply for me. Is it my depression that makes me feel this way? Is it my train of thought that just confuses my mind and tricks me into believing I have no real purpose? I am not the best guy to look at and I tend to not be the nicest individual sometimes, but I feel like majority of the time, I have no one there for me at the end of the day. I work a fill time job and go to school part time while living alone and making it all by myself. I've pushed away people that care because of trauma I have endured before, and don't want to hurt them. But I then see them with someone else within a week. The person I really like for just seems to only care for the attention it brings them. I want to just say fuck it and tell the person how I feel, but it is also a person I work with. I am tired of being alone and always feeling sorry for myself. I want to be happy and joyful. Maybe not everyone is ment to feel joy in their life. Maybe we are, and I just tend to push away the good and only want the bad. I never have anyone to discuss my feelings with and my emotions are not something I wish to divulge and bring the bear of pain onto someone else. I just feel inadequate in so many ways. I doubt people will see this or even read it. So, the point of this, to my opinion, is purely for self release of agony and dispare. Maybe one day things will change. Maybe things will get better and I will find my reason. Find my purpose. I just really hope I'm not the only one who feels this way most of the time. Maybe.

Avoiding meeting people because of the commitment to friendship or maybe more because I don't know if I would someday end my life before it gets me first and leaving them angry or sad. Only person I talk to is my father but I can't open up to him about problems. I am afraid he will get worried and he went through a lot to get to the point where he is. Also afraid of he would just tell me to buck up. Afraid of letting him down.

When I am coming home from work I see people holding hands or friends talking. Its hard to keep my eyes away because they look cheerful and happy. I try to feel what they feel just by looking at them. I can't stand to live like this and I can't make relationships. I am never good enough for myself. Still unsure if its a good thing or not.

During the time I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The only people I really talk to were my online friends, since I didn't really have any in the real world. 

But now when I started out a new school around 2 to 3 years ago, I now have new friends, I'm not bullied, I'm invited to events and I even managed to get a girlfriend. But funnily enough my online friends aren't a thing anymore.

But I still feel lonely and empty. 

I guess it might be because my real life friends don't meet up that often. The same with my girl. And since my brain got so used to having social interactions over the internet quite constantly, having these big gaps in time where I barely talk to my friends, it really messes with me.

And the sad thing is is that I don't know how to make online friends anymore. Before it happened so naturally but now I'm really at a loss of words.

I miss daily minecraft sessions and helping with each others' homework. I miss sending her random facts at random hours of the day and being met with the same enthusiastic curiosity since day one. I miss her trying to teach me CSS and me trying to teach her music. I miss the little Javascript games she made for me. I miss random calls in the middle of nowhere about the dumbest of things and nothing in particular. I miss being there when she needed me and her being there when I needed her. I miss feeling like my heart beat for someone else.

I miss being understood. My first ex only gave half a fuck and my parents give less than none. I miss the ability to fully trust someone with all my heart and soul. I have nobody else in my life who I can trust that much, and after having experienced a truly mutually healthy relationship for the first time, I struggle to return to a life where I don't.

It's been 8 months since the breakup and the subsequent mutual decision to go no-contact for the betterment of each others' mental health. That's longer than we've known each other for.

But I still don't feel like me. I'm starting to doubt I ever really *did* feel like me before she came around. Not even with my first relationship that turned out to be emotionally abusive.

5032,udlncs,subragement777,"Emotions? I thought they were my plaything.... but am I merely a toy at its disposal? They come in waves and leave me feeling pathetic to have even felt them, to even feel bad for myself. People don't care when I'm hurting, why should I? Hiding sadness hurts more than the sadness itself. What is my pain from? What I thought was the love of my life took my soul and tortured it to death, smothered every fiber of enjoyment I get out of life, ruined my view on trust and love. 

Am i broken? Maybe, but in the end it's my fault I couldn't make her happy enough, that's just how it's always going to go, sorry me, kinda wish we could've been better off. Maybe it's something from my past, I've been homeless, grew up fatherless, lived clueless, I still don't fully understand this world, it all seems so pointless when you look at it. I'll just close my eyes for the last time one day and that's it. So my idea was to be something the world remembered, thats going great.. not... but maybe I can find love and make sure I can help someone else with their pain, just so I can feel love again. I have happiness within myself, it's just battered and beaten up. I can say I at least try. 

Even when the tears try to come they don't, it's such a forien thing for me, I've had to numb myself almost to the point of no return. I'm trying to relearn my emotions. I don't like it. 
I'm just now feeling so much pain, but it's not normal, it's a pain that I can't turn off anymore, I just want to hold someone till it goes away. I don't have anyone to crave so I just hope for her. Any her, just the one who completes my soul, or whats left of it anyway. Am I allowed to want love?
 I just want to know what it feels like, I had fake love for 3 years and didn't know it, what is real love like? I'm to afraid to let someone in, every time I try they just don't respond. I just accept I'm not what someone would prefer, it just hurts. I try to workout,¬† sing, be funny, but for who? 

I'm still a stupid fuck who can't show love right, who wishes to have a family and just love my person forever. My lasts fleeting moments with her in my eyes. To enjoy drinks during a sunset, to feel every inch of her body and feel comfortable and passionate, funny laughs in the morning,¬† petty little arguments, Our favorite shows, just enjoy every part of each other in a whole. We'll always disagree on something but that's love right?

 Maybe... who am I to say. I've been having heart pains bad these past couple weeks, hopefully my deathbed isn't soon, I don't want other people to hurt, I also don't want to be alone, I want someone to wait for after death. My love, a poetry of beauty and intelligence. Whatever shape, color, personality, beliefs, it doesn't matter, I'm ready to love. To believe in someone. To not feel so cold and empty, physically like a hole in my chest. 
What am I writing this for? Good question. All I can say is, if your out there, take a chance on me.... please.

I grew up in a Hispanic household with a single mom and an older brother that was a gang member so growing up people always thought I was somehow affiliated. In reality I was allowed to go out because my mom would never allow me to be like my brother so I learned to find joy in books, animals and comic books but as the years went by things got more rough and I got bigger 5'11 300 to be exact so I always got seen as someone to fight to prove yourself. I hate violence but I had to fight numerous times, I portrayed myself as rough and rugged, I started smoking bud , cigarettes and alcohol at 14 just because I had to make myself seem like the people around me to fit in. But everyday I was scared to go to school because I didn't want to be bullied and I didn't want to keep fighting to walk in the hallways without someone trying to check me. But all those years of being the tough guy I lost track of who I am. I don't know who I am or what I can enjoy I stopped talking to people and slowly people just forgot about me and now here I am just trying to be human.

They began to hold my hand and continued to hold it until the end of class but I still just focused on my work. I heard them sniffling, like they were about to cry? They laid their head down on the table, still holding my hand, but I still focused on my work. When the end of class came, they gave me a hug before leaving, but I still didn't look at them. 

I got to my next class and remembered to look at what they had written on my hands. I realized they were trying to get my attention.

You have women out there that feeds into this wlw fantasy or desires and it hurts, my sexuality and my feelings is not a fucking game.

It all felt so right. I knew deep down it's what I always wanted and no one has been as compatible with me as her. I just didn't realize it until tonight.

I just had the most amazing long, great chat that I have had with someone in a very long time. I am so sick of feeling like no one cares, that I ended up on one of those random chat apps, because I just can't deal with it most of the time.

I fake it well, I hide it as best I can. But today I was down, really down. I had started to make some progress with a woman down south, and it turns out that she was just playing me, silly girl that I am I'm still a sucker for honesty.

I was gonna delete the app, and then between last night and today I began chatting to another person. Let's call this person J. J actually had a meaningfu, non sexual, interesting and fun conversation. But now the problem is, as always, I'm gonna hook feelings on this person I know doesn't give a shit about me, it was a random chat. Chances are she has already forgotten I exist.

All I want is for someone to care enough about me to actually want to get to know me. But how do we break out of the cycle of people that use, hurt and abandon. How do we get to the point someone wants to know us.

I feel this is a pointless task, J will never actually look my way, it doesn't matter to her, I was a pointless chatter. Being a gay woman in an isolated town, hating being around people, but just wanting someone to literally give a crap.

I wish J could know how it meant to me to feel important for a day. She probably never will, but it was something.

Known eachother 2 years
Dated 11 months 
This is long distance only 4 hours away we saw eachother 4 different times from March to July staying the longest a week

1st issue text from 2 girls found her 1st visit first was a host of mine I own a talent agency for live streamers she had a crush on me told me she loved me I told her I don't said I gotta girl she sent me a tit pick I did not ask for I told her not to do it again the other was flirting but never anything that was gunna happen

My girl saw them and said both were full affairs and gave me a bunch of stuff on emotional cheating

She the was on me for everything if I did not answer how she wanted or fast enough 

This got to the point other people noticed 

In a call with 2 other females who we work with one being her best friend they told her she needed to stop she was treating me bad for no reason she said ""he cheated I can do what I want""

Her new best friend replaced me in August no time for me I had to schedule an hour just to talk to her 

November my bday month we break up stay friends and business partner 

Missed both my birthday events as a streamer 

Leave me alone for Thanksgiving Christmas and new years December I save her job and she pretty much said she's keeping all the month over the 11 months I spent between $6,000 and $10,000 on her and she never bought me a thing

She even got mad because after we were broke up I wouldn't let her come get a bunch of stuff I bought

The emotional cheating stuff she gave me her and her new best friend checked more than me she bought her gifts even other people said it seemed like I was the 3rd wheel in my relationship

5090,uds93j,JustAnotherChorus,"I wake up everyday feeling extremely hollow. This feeling of unimportance. I have a great family, a mother and step-father that would die for me. A brother and that is my kindred soul. Things are rough between my girlfriend and I right now, but I know she cares at the very least. I love her more than I thought I could love someone outside of my family. My eldest cousin is my roommate and I'd do anything to keep him safe and happy. I have 6 pets too, my three dogs and my three cats. I love them all so much. I know they really didn't have a choice but they've (My pets) been there for me during the darkest and most terrifying times. I'd lay down my life for all of these people, and my pets. Yet here I am, just hollow. A tangled mass, clinging on to these lives. Hoping that they will continue to hold me up just a little longer, just another day.  


I listen to ASMR youtubers say meaningless words to me just to have someone in my head that isn't the intrusive thoughts that plague me like a cancer I was born with. They say the things I wish people would actually say to me. That they're proud, that they love me, that I matter. That I'm not alone. They say these things that mean absolutely nothing to me, at least when they come from them. These youtubers that I don't know, that don't know me. I need it though, at the very least I can imagine that it's my mother saying it to me, or my girlfriend. I can imagine that it's true. I can imagine that I matter. I feel like there's all these people in my life, these people that I cherish. Animals that I couldn't ever imagine not having by my side. Yet I sit here, at 4 in the morning. I sit here crying and shaking, as these thoughts engulf me in these feelings of being so alone. The world is filled with nearly 8 billion people, but I wake up every single day with thoughts that no one has my back. No one calls and checks in on me, even though I do it for them. I call them when I'm busy to ask how they're doing, if they're okay, if I can do anything for them. I can't remember the last time someone has done the same for me. I can't even imagine that someone might. That someone may just check in on me. No one does, no one will.   


I've been so paranoid lately. It's like I am being followed by the darkest of figures. Every possible thought ends in the worst possible outcome. Things like ""Today I'm going to get in a car crash"", ""My mother is going to succumb to her stress"", ""My grandfather is going to have another stroke"", ""My parents are going to yell at me about my money problems again"". All day, all night. When I'm awake and when I'm sleeping. Sometimes I get this relief when I dream though. Even tonight I had a dream where this sweet woman took me on the most random adventure downtown. I followed her through all the city night lights. We laughed, danced, and sang our hearts out. I feel as if I've not even seen her before. Though we did everything I loved. We even got high and lost ourselves in the stars. I woke up from this dream and just crumbled. I fell apart like porcelain hitting the floor. The happiness I felt in that dream, the most fabricated happiness that I think I could even imagine feeling. It was pure heaven. Then I woke up. Back in my reality, back to this endless drudge of existence. From literal feelings of heaven, straight back down to the bottom of the barrel. I'm so lonely. I'm so unfulfilled. I am unaccomplished with a head in the clouds. My ideas for a brighter world run rampant, and then I remember the reality. The way my world is right now is designed around making me feel alone. It feels like it's designed around this feeling of suffering.  


If this even gets any attention, I'm sorry for burdening you with my world. I needed a place to put this. I really needed to just put it out there. I needed a different way to cope. Normally I cope by getting high on edibles and just going back to sleep. I got work in a couple hours so I couldn't do that this time. If you've read this and wondered anything about suicide, I'll be just blatantly honest. It's definitely a fantasy that comes and goes. Like all the other intrusive thoughts that have a grip on my stupid fucking head. I promise I'm okay as I can be. I wear my happy mask pretty well honestly. I can't imagine being a problem for other or being another burden in their stress filled life. I put my mask on and carry on. If anyone I know see's this and you know me, I'm sorry that you had to see it. I just needed to do this, this time around that is. I hope you're all doing better than I am. At the very least I hope you see life in at least a slightly brighter light than I do. I love you beautiful souls. I hope you all make it to brighter days, greener pastures and all that. sorry.",2022-04-28 10:53:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1550519176,5,/r/lonely/comments/uds93j/this_is_just_how_i_feel_its_word_vomit_so/,,0,2,"This is just how I feel.

Not quite a month ago I drove across the country alone and moved in with my fiance's mom. He's in prison and I wanted to be closer to him and get things set up for when he paroles in a few years. I got a job and I'm on my 2nd week here. The job is ok but it's still new and I've always had trouble liking my job at first. There's been some issues with staffing and they're now trying to tell me that I'll be put into 2nd shift alone (I've been training on first shift). I'm sure as hell not ready for that.

The work stuff has been getting to me simply because I'm kinda meh about it so far but I feel the pressure of life and responsibilities kinda pushing me down. But more than all the work stuff, I'm just feeling so alone. I barely know anyone here. I know my fiance's mom since I live with her but she's the only one I'm actually sorta close to. My fiance is in prison and we don't get to talk much anymore since I've been working. We used to email every day but he can't get wifi in his cell so we never email anymore. He calls when he can but me being at work limits when we can talk. So communication with him is limited.

On top of barely being able to talk to him, my boyfriend is back into his addiction. He's kinda trying to come out of it but it's been really hard on him. We were talking last night and I told him I wasn't going to move money around for him anymore, because the way we were working stuff out was thru cashapp. He told me he understood that I didn't want to use my own money (he always paid me back) but that if I didn't move his money around for him then he wouldn't trust me anymore, it would create a wedge between us, and he'd just have someone else do it for him. I feel so torn up about what to do. On one hand, if I do it then I'm enabling him. On the other hand, if I don't do it then neither of us can trust each other and our relationship suffers.

I'm in emotional turmoil. The shit with my fiance is tearing me apart, and then I have to deal with a new job, trying to get an apartment, and all the other responsibilities of being an adult and trying to create a new life for myself. I know my fiance's family has my back but I just feel so alone. I've never had to deal with someone's addiction before so I don't know how to handle the shit with him, and it feels like there's a rift between us.

One of my best friends growing up recently in the last couple years just stopped responding to messages and calls. I know he is super busy, but I also know he uses his phone. Strings of messages over multi-month period. None responded to. Was the fucking best man at my wedding. 

Have another friend I absolutely adore but they stopped responding to my texts or even messaging me. Lots in common, have known each other for years. Found new friends which is absolutely amazing for them, but seems to have forgot I existed. 

Other friends that are local who did the same thing to me. Just off doing other things. Apperantly I'm just boring to be around because I like cars, beer, smoke among many other things. 

Like I don't fucking get it. I do work from home and will nit change that. But why does it seem like it's only me being friends with people. Like do they not know how much it would mean to me just to get a sinple text, or respond to on I sent them? I'm apart of no ones life and it really sucks. I'm just the really good, nice guy that's funny. I guess that's all I am to them. 

Sure I may be married but a spouse is different then friends. No one asks me how my day was. No one invites me to anything. No one really snaps me, or sends me tiktoks (first world problems right? Lol). Like all things I know they do, but not with me. 

Like wtf is wrong with me? Can I not be on someone's mind? Am I too much? Am I gross? Am I secretly a fat loser? Am i unfriend-able? 

I've literally met people doing things in my town and we talk and hang but then after a couple weeks it's the same old story. 

Life just fucking sucks. And yes.. spouses should make everything better and should be the only friend I need. However, it's not that simple for a lot of us.

5152,ue34dg,tiredlittlegoat,"I actually feel like I have no one because I'm alone. 
I lost my dad 2 years ago, and since then, I haven't felt a glimpse of happiness or joy. 
I lost my best friend after coming out as a lesbian and she just stopped talking to me. I lost another friend because she did not like the fact that I was not ""the life of the party"" anymore. She told me that straightforward. 

I made other friends, a great friend group in college. 
But, my aunt died in March, and, like for my dad, I couldn't fly home, and I did not attend her funeral either. I haven't had the chance to say goodbye, for the second time again. 
I felt so fucking alone in my grief, again, and so angry at the whole fucking world. 


And this last 2 months, most of my friends stopped talking to me because they felt that I was way too self centred in my sadness, and one of them accused my of lying for a stupid story (and I wasn't lying which is the fucking worse), so I had a huge mental breakdown trying to defend myself, but he did not listen and already had his opinion made up about me. He told me I was a self-centered bitch because I'm ""not the only one who has problems"", when I just had been trying like I could to deel with my grief. I do not live, I survive. I feel like shit. No one likes me, they tell me to my face. 
I told them the truth an outrageous number of time but I felt that since this event, they all stopped considering me one of them. Now they make plans of their one, and I'm not included. I feel like I'm a fucking burden to everyone. That one friend is talking shit about me to my other friends and they told me. He doesn't even ask how I'm doing, and I can't help thinking that he never really cared about me in the first place if he's acting like that, but once again maybe it's paranoia... 

One year ago, when a friend of this friend groupe had suicidal thoughts and was hospitalized I stood by them. I was there. We were all there. We to tried to help them get better. And they eventually did. And I'm happy for them, truly. But I can't help feeling jealous that when I crumbled to the floor, no one was there to help me like I tried to. No one was there. They turned their back. I'm far from perfect but I can't help but feel like something is truly wrong with me. 



I talked about it with my shrink and she just told me to let go and to find peace in letting this people walk out of my life but I love them. I love my friends, even though they don't love me. I feel so desperate. 


My love life is also a mess, I had a hard time discovering I'm a lesbian, because in my culture that's a sin and in the country that I come from we face prison time for being gay. 
I was convinced I'd rather spend my life alone, but I fell in love with a girl. A great girl. She was so nice and caring and we loved spending time with each other. She was the one who approached me btw. My friends encouraged me to face my fear of abandonment and to try with her, and I did. Everything was great between us, like truly, I even projected myself with her, and one night, after I talked to her about the need to take our relationship to a deeper level, she casually told my she does not want us to be in a relationship because she's ""scared to hurt me"" and I ""deserved better"". 
It broke my heart because she knew how hard it was for me to give her my trust, and she let me get attached to her for months and months. My ""friends"" are still friends with her even though me and her don't hang out anymore and she got to know them through me. 


I am sad to the core. 
Now my mom is sick and I'm scared she will pass and I will be truly alone. Her health just got worse and worse since my dad died and I do not know what to do


Life is meaningless, I just want to stop my suffering and stop feeling fucking lonely.  I hate myself to the core. I fuck up everything and I'm a failure. I dropped out of school because of depression a month ago. I do not feel any strength left in my soul to keep on. I truly wish I could fall asleep and never wake up because I don't feel like I deserve anything. Each time I get better, the universe stabs me in the back and I don't know how to keep on. 
The persons I care about either die or get out of my life abruptly, and I can't help but lose my mind over my fears. I can't sleep anymore at night. I'm scared I'll end up alone at 20 years old, and this though is eating me inside. 

So, should I try to talk to my friends about how I feel and how much I miss them or should I let go ? I am so lost...

5157,ue3yp2,throwaway0183701,"Finals are coming up. That sucks for 2 reasons. First, the standard stress that's more or less normal and to be expected. worse in me to some degree cuz of all the shit I got swimming through my head. Second because I don't know what I'm gonna do once it's over. I know my entire living situation is gonna change. Idk, i guess i dont feel like writing about it tho. or thinking about it

What's really on my mind rn is that fuckin girl wh talked to me. I can't remember if I wrote about her last time. I think I did, I think she was the reason I wrote aat all, actually. Well, here we are again. She was nice to me again today. Not like overly nice, just normal human smalltalk nice. But last time, she was asking me a question to hopefully gain information from me that could help her. This time, it was pure smalltalk (she asked how I thought I did on a calc test we both had today. I hope I behaved well through and didn't fuck up somehow and make an ass of myself.

Actually, before that, she walked over to me and asked a question about the chem lab we were doing at the time. she has her own partner, idrk why she asked me. mayber her partner was away and i didn't notice? But yeah, just normal human behavior.

And then what does my pathetic little damaged brain do? become infatuated with her, again. I had just gotten over the infatuation of last time, and now here we are again. I know I'm gonna see her as soon as I try to sleep tonight and wish she'd hug me and tell me I'm safe and cute and she  cares about me.

Why tf do I have to be like this? She didn't do anything to warrant this from me. She's just being normal, and my fucked up head goes and makes it creepy. And I know it's creepy, I know if she read this she'd be mortified and avoid me like the plague at the very least. Probably would fucking drop ochem next semester just so she wouldn't see me. And I wouldn't fucking blame her, I am a goddamn creep. I don't want to feel this way towards her, but it's apparently out of my fucking control. How the hell do you turn off a feeling? I've tried for so long. I've tried to turn off romantic attraction from the moment that  I started experiencing it. But it doesn't go away. It just sits there, bubbling out unfulfillment and loneliness and self-hate that corrodes my soul and leaves me fucking broken.

The worst part of this rn tho is that I can't help but wonder if she's trying to befriend me for some reason. I have no plausible reason she would, I'm a fucked up sack of shit, and in public I'm so nervous that I don't even have a personality. But I can't just ignore that it's me she talks to out of my lab group of three. Why me? And why ask about my confidence on a test? Isn't that something you do with friends, prospective friends? But if she is trying to befriend me, what the actual fuck am I supposed to do? I'm nothing, I don't deserve a friend. She'll see that I can't drive and that I'm too anxious and depressed to do anything and she'll just regret getting involved. Plus, I don't have the fucking energy to maintain relationships of any sort. And then obviously I'll just be constantly infatuated with her. Doesn't matter that I facebook stalked her just enough to know she's in a relationship, doesn't matter that she has a picture of him and her as her lock screen, doesn't fucking matter to my brain that I know she is not at all romantically interested in my fat ass. I'd still get a refreshed ""infatuation bar"" everytime she was nice to me, which would probably be pretty often if we were friends.

How are you supposed to be friends with someone when you can't get over how much you want to be more with them? It's all that's in my head. I know this much from experience, a similar thing happened with the only other physical member of my physics 101 class. We had to do everything in the class together, and every goddamn time it was hell. First it was me hoping to fuck that she'd say she liked me and end the anticipation. Then it was because I knew she was in a relationship and was trying desperately to not find her absolutely captivating.

It'd be the same shit with this girl.

I already knew that college was going to be a challenge for me, however everything got worse when my grandfather passed away in the second week of my first semester. I was so depressed, I didn't go to parties, I didn't want to do anything. Now I am in the 2nd semester and I regret it because everyone already knows each other and I don't have any friends in college.
Apart from college I don't have many friends, and the friends I have are creating new relationships and busy with the new academic life. I feel like I'm being left behind and I can't help but think it's all my fault. Maybe I deserve this, maybe I'm lonely because my personality is boring or annoying.

I can text over a period of a week and get no response from people. However, the one time they text me and i ""go to take care of it later"", I'm an asshole for making them wait. 

I text someone and we chat then all the sudden they ghost me, and that's cool. But the moment I don't return their message I'm apperantly ""not really interested into asking to them"". 

I don't fucking get it. What do I have to do to become the person that has friends and can ignore people? What do I have to do for someone to not ghost me?

People fucking suck sometimes. It makes for a very lonely life to not be apart of another's. 

All I want is to know someone and be part of their lives in some way. Not in a creepy way but a friend way. Where they tell me about their day, or randomly message me about happy or good things that happen.

Today I was on the bus back home from uni and I was feeling extremely lonely, since I don't have any friends there. I was sitting down, looking out the window, listening to my music and feeling a thousand miles away from my peers. It was a cold day today, but as I was sitting there, the sun was shining on me and keeping me warm. I took notice of it and started thinking about how lucky I was to be experiencing it, to feel the sun on my skin, to be kissed by the sun. 

I know it sounds stupid or cringy, but I have to focus on these mundane, small moments because sometimes they are all I have. It's been great help for me and I advice you to also do the same. Start noticing when you are glad, when you are happy about something and take note of it.

5224,ued6d2,Fancy0011,"I don‚Äôt really know where to start. I feel pretty terrible for some odd reason about venting my innermost thoughts out into some random app on the internet but to be honest I‚Äôm beyond fiending for something and I just need to get it all out even if its to an audience of a few lonely dudes out in bj√∂√Øfgh who will eventually catfish me into getting my personal banking information.

All i think about is loving someone and making someone happy and having a relationship of just true reciprocated love. Pure certainty, with no doubt or insecurity lingering. Obviously anyone with emotional capacity of a 9 year old wants this in a intimate love relationship and you can tell me to just get off the internet and go talk to some girls because I gotta be something else to be looking for love on reddit. But as corny as it is, just being on that level with someone and having that connection and the idea of certainty/reciprocated feelings is literally all I think about when I‚Äôm not stuck between work or school or just trying to survive. I am such a hopeless romantic and I always have been and now about to be 19/graduating high school, I have my future planned out for me but Ive just been so alone, all I crave is not only that attention but also the vulnerability, knowing everything will be fine when im with them/talking to them. I know eventually through work or some crazy random occurrence I may start talking to someone its not like im inept or even that unattractive. Being open in life, eventually something spring s something your way if you let it. But im so tired of just having no one to really talk to.  No one who‚Äôs face brights up when they see me on their phone. Im so tired of waiting. Beyond even just romance too. I really could just go on dating apps to be honest but that aint happening until a man graduates. I hate not being able to just be myself with someone besides myself. Ive just been kinda floating along. I lost all my friends over summer with working crazy hours because I had to and my mental health getting in the way along with me being a shitty person so all senior year outside of family/ppl at work/ Ive just been doing my own thing and even though I get so people-d out and my introvert ass enjoys it at times, at the end of every night all I think about is love and intimacy. I have a supporting family too like shits not totally fucked up there either where im just void of any foundation in life, like I love them dearly its just all I fucking think about is just being in love with someone.  I know I wont be lonely forever, thinking like that is absolutely ridiculous. All I do is go to school, go to work, play videogames, listen to music while im off my ass, or go to the gym off my ass.  Everyone Is going away to college so even if something pops off through school here near the end once summer comes mid thru, bam they gone. Things mentally have gotten better this last semester with cutting my hours and getting back to the gym. In all reality I put myself in this situation because I just expect magically someone to appear infront of me with a ring in their hands. I have to not be a bitch and ask that cute girl at the gym for their number or just go on a dating app.

I've never had one so I'm not entirely sure that the relationship will just slowly dissolve, very painfully no matter what like every other relationship, so I've been holding on to that hope. I think I have to acknowledge that it makes sense that I probably won't be good at keeping a relationship with a girlfriend either. I really don't like this thought, if this is true.

I think that currently I look cute but stifled. I feel like I am now lost potential. I feel like I've already been a living corpse for a while, now. It's a hyperbolization, but it's the best way for me to describe the feeling.

If I had known I'd be like this, I probably would've broken down and never done anything at all.

I do not think that with no job, severe GAD plus my badly thinned hair that I will get a girlfriend again. That, and I am very possessive and will have panic attacks from jealousy, so nobody wants to put up with that. And I have my preferences and stuff, because I'm both deep and vain as a person and I can't change that. 

To play devil's advocate, I mustn't be a hypocrite, so I give myself the advice and the hope or sentiment of hope that I give to others. But it's a third of what I feel in this regard. I am a broken cog out and of the system.

i can't stand being home alone, I can count with my fingers the amount of times I've been out with someone besides my family. I haven't been out of since 11th of January (I can remember this date perfectly because it was the last day I had fun). 
each time when I ask my classmates to go out, they always refuse, ignore me or have someone else to go iut with. I just don't know what to do anymore, I crave going out. I can't even go out on my own because my parents don't let me ( I begged them multiple times).

for me personally, I want to care
I want to just be that friend for people
but majority of the times its hard to even start a friendship off of here or any other type of subreddit as there's really nothing that connects us with eachother, besides we're all feeling lonely. 
it just all feels fake and not real

Sure, I could just pretend and act like its all cool!

but it really isnt

personally I've tried messaging people on here, and after a few messages, I just don't see a reason to keep chatting with someone? we literally have nothing in common, and sure you're not going to have stuff in common w/ everyone, it just feels like I no longer care to an extent about starting these online friendships

its been about a year since I've even talked to a friend irl (moved houses after I graduated, cut contact w/ all old friends) kinda just waiting for college to start to start making some friends 

this whole post is just me rambling but I kinda just wanted to say some things into the void knowing someone will read it

Well I wasn't looking in high school so I can't be mad about that.

I thought for sure in Undergrad was where I'd find someone. A lot of my peers in undergrad found their partner there. I actually had someone women interested in me then but due to various reasons, really all boils down to bad luck, none of them worked. Or I wasn't interested in them, though many times because I was in love with / pining for someone else. I also met my dream woman but she rejected me which scarred me and set me back as I kept comparing everyone to her. In restrospect, undergrad was my best chance. Should have focused more on love and less on everything else, including studies.

Ok. I'm only 22. Perhaps law school means I'll find someone. New school. New people No. No luck. Then COVID hit cutting that down.

Perhaps I can ask my friends to set me up with someone they know. Nope. No luck.

Online? Quickly realized that if you are a man you need to be super hot for it to work.

Ok. Well I graduated. I'm only 25. And look; I find work in a completely different city 800km away. Maybe that is where my life partner has been this whole time.

Long story short, after a period of intense loneliness, I've somewhat gotten out of it and now I sorta find it my responsibility to reach out to lonely kids (like how my one friend reached out to me).

Problem is, there's this one kid I want to approach but he's always on his phone and earbuds in 24/7. If you were him, how would you want to be approached without it being too awkward. (I asked myself the same question but I still couldn't figure it out lol).

5313,uerpv5,Top-Software-7398,"I had a plan with my friend first time in a couple months. I was excited about it before, but this experience made me feel that being alone is much better than being with someone selfish, and to be honest I am a bit hurt too. I just need to vent, and I'm sorry if I sound really whiny haha.

This is just the backstory with this friend: (I had this friend who used to be really emotionally dependent on me. For example, off the top of my head, she used to get upset at me when I didn't listen to her when she was feeling down, and once, I listened to her complain about a really minor thing for two hours, and stuff similar to this happened a lot.

This went on for years and it emotionally drained me so much, so I kind of told her (not too directly, she didn't fully stop) and I figured the reason she continued was because I was too good a listener maybe, so I purposely avoided telling her what she wants to hear. Also she became busier than before  too so it eventually stopped.)

I had a plan to meet this friend this week. I got a car last year and she doesn't have a car, so she said, ""Let's drive to somewhere nice with your car"" and I was excited about it too since I haven't done it with her before.

We were deciding where to go and she was sending me places that takes 1.5 hours from where I live, and it seemed like she wanted me to pick her up too so it would take 2+ hours at least (which is 4 hours total, the gas price in my country is very expensive, like 2 dollars per liter and traffic is always bad in this city, so it's actually very tiring to drive). I would have been happy to go there if it were a better time, but it was a weekday and I was overworked and very tired with cramps, so I told her my situation and let's go there some other time and we should go somewhere close instead. 

I looked for a nice place that was closer. The closest station from there would take about 30 minutes for her to come and then we could drive together from there. Then she suddenly changed and said she can't come because it takes too long, and she only wants to meet right in front of her place if possible. I was a bit annoyed and I know it's kinda petty, but I suggested a place that's halfway between us (which takes less than 15 minutes), and she still says no lol. I would have been totally fine with her answer if she didn't just suggest 1.5 hours when she thought I was driving... Maybe she was expecting me to pick her up and everything and became disappointed when I suggested otherwise. None of us was happy with any place, so we said we'll meet next week instead, but I don't think I will be contacting her. 

I am pretty hurt because I did put a lot of thought into picking places, like the convenience of her getting there. She also gets disappointed every time when we don't go to places that looks ""pretty."" lol... so I took that into consideration too. But she just shot me down without any thought and just wanted me to come right next to her place.

I know I went on for too long even though this story is not really interesting, so thank you to anyone if you actually read this story haha. Maybe I overreacted, I don't know, but overall, I've had too many draining experiences with this friend compared to other friends. She does have good qualities, but I always find myself drained by her.",2022-04-29 18:01:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605647068,1,/r/lonely/comments/uerpv5/had_a_plan_with_my_friend_and_it_was_cancelled_a/,,0,0,had a plan with my friend and it was cancelled (a bit long)

I get the procedure done this morning and managed to get an Uber home because someone in my family came through for me. I wasn't allowed to eat or drink for eight hours before the procedure so I'm tired, and thirsty. I'm also on three hours of sleep. I get back and need something to drink. It's oral surgery so here is me with my mouth full of cotton barely able to talk feeling tired. 

I think, I could use a coffee. Make that a latte. I walk in almost out of instinct because I'm half asleep and she's there again. She sees me and gives me this smile. Suddenly I feel better. She says how was your procedure. I said, painful barely able to form words. I look down when a girl talks to me out of the habit of being looked down on but then I look up and she's still smiling. Then I start feeling weird and start talking nonsense because of nerves and she doesn't mind. Once again, it's her job to be friendly but she made small talk for a few minutes again. I started stuttering out of nerves and the fact she kept looking at me in the eyes. I felt awkward and didn't want to creep her out so I went to leave. Then she said, I hope you feel better and used my name. She remembered my name! I didn't even know hers. See, this is the kind of thing that just makes my day. I say, what's your name again? I said, thanks her name, see you this weekend(I always go in on the weekend). That simple exchange that most people will say, who cares, is huge for me because I don't get to have girls smile at me and say even the most generic things. Then the pain came back and I walked home but I can't stop smiling. If this is what most people get on a daily basis, it is as great as I thought. This is the most happy yet pathetic thing that has happened to me since my crush on my therapist. How much of a loser do you have to be to be so used to rejection and never getting anything positive with a few minor exceptions to let this get to you? I bet other customers have crushes on her. Lots of places have the attractive employee who all the customers like haha. In her case it's not her looks so much as it is the way she looks at me. There are lots of attractive girls out there but most are not like her being nice to random people. I'm in pain right now but am still smiling. I have this warm sensation that is making me feel good.

Last night I've managed to talk to him both through texting and calling. He sounds so broken... It breaks my heart knowing just how much he must struggle with life to want to end it. He said he's angry, he said that he didn't asked to be saved, he didn't want any of this.. it's really heartbreaking to go through something like this, I've cried for ages when they were out there looking for him. I cried when I tried to get in contact with him but was told he doesn't want to speak with me..

I don't have anybody in my life that I can talk to about this whole thing. I know I did the right thing, but I'm scared..so scared of losing him. He's my best friend and my true love and I really hope he gets better and will allow me to speak with him.

Although I've spoken with his friend about this it's not the same.. I don't feel like I have anybody I could call my friend which makes it so much more difficult dealing with this whole situation. I know he's safe and I'm really happy about that... I just wish he would talk to me",2022-04-29 19:18:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596472298,2,/r/lonely/comments/uetcan/ive_saved_my_boyfriends_life_and_now_he_wont_talk/,,0,8,I've saved my boyfriends life and now he won't talk to me..

5343,ueuchn,noinnuendos,"When people post in this sub, I often notice that the messages are short and vague.  For those, like myself, that often forget‚Ä¶ the people posting and replying all have different icebergs of life experiences, thoughts, and behaviors.  I use the term iceberg like the iceberg meme to describe the ‚Äúhidden depths‚Äù below the surface layers.

A post about feeling lonely can stem from a general feeling of isolation but it‚Äôs important to remember it could be so many other things, too: recently broke up, recently rejected, emotional instability, personality disorders, manipulation, etc.

Our society is the loneliest it‚Äôs been in generations due to the rapid advancement of social media, the unrepentant monetization of our social lives, and the pandemic spreading a brain damaging virus.

I think, in many or even most cases, there are other underlying issues that need to be addressed for these individuals including anxiety, depression, autism, ADHD, a personality disorder or being denied entitlement or privilege.

It‚Äôs okay to feel lonely at times.  We all do.  And I don‚Äôt want to discourage people from posting - far from it! Please reach out if you are hurting - but ask that everyone keep in mind that your situation is (likely) different and we all carry biases.

I encourage everyone to take care of themselves, too: eat healthy, exercise, get 8 hours of rest, avoid toxic individuals, and engage in hobbies.  Hobby groups, especially, are a great way to meet people.  Avoid online ‚Äúdating‚Äù as its incentivized to NOT match you up and get you paying.  And be careful of redditors who message you; you don‚Äôt know them or their intentions. 

Stay safe and healthy!",2022-04-29 20:06:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1572705612,13,/r/lonely/comments/ueuchn/the_unspoken_icebergs_in_posts_in_this_sub/,,0,0,The Unspoken ‚ÄúIcebergs‚Äù in Posts in this Sub

5357,uewgws,change-it1,"Hello this is my first time posting anything but my feeling of loneliness has been getting worse and worse. I'm 21(f) and I just recently moved to a new city to study. I found a few girls I really get along with and I've been very happy about that.
 The thing is though, I have never dated someone before in my life, haven't kissed someone or done anything romantic. And I crave it... to just have someone at my side who I can spend time with and share my interests and hobbies with and who I can love and receive the same. 
All my friend here already have some connections with a dude (or even multiple) and all of them say they're not even serious about it and... I just dont get it. All these people around me start relationships on a whim and I cant even find someone to get to know better.
 I'm not ugly but I'm not very pretty either, just a average human... is it my personality?
 I try to appear more confident because I think it's because of my lack of self esteem but then people just call me obnoxious for trying to be part of the conversation or trying to be more outspoken... 
maybe I just need to give it more time? But I've spent 21 years of my life without a partner to call my own, without any experience of romantic or sexual feelings and I just start feel like I'm maybe more ugly than I thought... or my personality is worse than I thought... but the girls and adults around me often praise me and tell me they like me or how I look but I've never received any positive attention from the guys around me... is it me or is it them? Idk this is pretty much just a rant because the negative emotions have been piling up and I dont know where to put them since there is no one to listen to it, haha.
 I would feel pathetic to tell my friends about my feelings because I feel like they cannot relate at all to my issue... I always hear about how they've started seeing these different people and it sounded like the dudes are falling in love with them and then they tell me that they arent serious about it in the first place.... it frustrates me even though I know that I cant make them responsible for my loneliness but then I'm just thinking: why are you leading them on if you dont plan on being with them?! Why cant I find someone who likes me and who I can like back...

5388,uf1k8f,JesustheSpaceCowboy,"So I (M27) was dating my coworker F(29) and I‚Äôll preface by saying we had talked on and off for nearly 2.5 years prior to March 3rd, now known as D-Day in my world. I went to court with her to support her while she was getting her ex imprisoned for domestic violence. After that we got into a huge fight and stopped talking, we eventually started talking again and ended up dating. 

By mid April, shit hit the fan, I picked her up from the bar, we went back to my house and talked for hours, when we went to go to bed she began to initiate intercourse, I asked if she wanted to, she said yes so we did. Having been in love with this girl knowing how crazy she was, I didn‚Äôt suit up when I should have, I let the citizens off the train inside the station cause she told me too.

From that point on things changed, she didn‚Äôt want to talk about things, I kept asking about if she got pregnant what would she want to do and if she got an abortion if I could come with her. She told me if she did she wouldn‚Äôt tell me, she started accusing me of all kinds of things, just generally trying to push me away. Everything I said was wrong, she told me she has the beginning stages of cervical cancer, I tried to learn as much as I could about it to help her, then she threatened to kill my dog and herself when I told her she shouldn‚Äôt do coke.

Maybe I‚Äôm just lonely and don‚Äôt want to sit here alone anymore like I did before D-Day but I think I also developed Stockholm Syndrome cause I want her back and want to help get her psychological help cause I can see she‚Äôs dying and there‚Äôs nothing I can do.",2022-04-30 02:27:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1414370453,1,/r/lonely/comments/uf1k8f/i_just_got_out_of_what_i_believe_is_an/,,0,3,I just got out of what I believe is an emotionally abusive relationship but I think I want her back.

I wish I had an actual job I could physically go to and actually talk to people but no matter how many places I apply no one will hire me. If it wasn‚Äôt for my daughter, I probably would‚Äôve killed myself a long time ago. 

Sometimes I‚Äôm in my kitchen and I‚Äôm cooking alone and I just break down sobbing because I haven‚Äôt been kissed or held by anyone in who knows how long. Not since high school.

5416,uf4br1,PlayfulBeyond9699,"I've always been quite 'soft' as my dad would put it. I see someone else suffering and I want to help, I've always gone above and beyond. But I realised that some of that was linked to trauma, so I sought out therapy. And it did help, but even with more boundaries, I realised being a nice person did nothing for me. I'm alone, people saw me as a people pleaser, and although no one says it out loud they see people pleasers as disposable. I think some other attributes I have made me easily disposable too, my race, fluctuating between being average and ugly, being reserved. 

The people I see who have genuine loving relationships (not all but a lot I've seen) tend to be quite cold, self serving, civil at most, cold at worst. The way I've been discarded so easily while people like that have no trouble forming and maintaining relationships, friendships, familial bonds stings. Why am I not good enough? If I was meaner, prettier, this or that would it mean someone would finally be a good friend to me. 

I'm so bitter about it at this point. I actively avoid people now, there's no point I am repulsive to most people. I'm just nothing special in their eyes. I am nothing, nobody.

She was my world, and I was lied to for over a year, emotionally abused, torn between her being the happiest of people, and the lowest of the low. I was there for her at all times, doing everything I could to take care of her. I loved this woman with all of my damn heart. Hell, I still might. 

She phoned me, after 2 months of no contact (I deleted everything) but even though she said she did... she 'somehow' found my number. She phoned me at 2 am a couple nights ago, crying and telling me how much she missed and still loved me, and hated that I had moved away from her.

We talked for 2 hours.. and while I was already on the path of moving on.. now? I can't stop thinking of how lonely she is, and how it makes me feel fucking lonely. Our breakup was so over-reactive from her part (alcohol) and I had no say in it. Now, she's regretting it, and because I moved on, I feel terrible.

So, I sit here, with no friends, no connections, nothing. Missing an ex-gf going through the same thing hundreds of kms away, and I just feel terrible, knowing she feels the same way.

TLDR: My ex and I are lonely without each other, I moved provinces to move on, and after a phone call one night, I feel incredibly lonely, because we miss each other, and we have no one else to talk with, spend time together.

I see people these days look out for partners solely based on looks and how rich they are, and how muscular the body is (for boys) and how curvy is the body (for girls). I must say that personality check factor is getting buried. One should look for how kind the person is, whether he/she is into spirituality or something like that. But everyone's going for looks, like almost everyone. That's how tinder and other dating apps are surviving. I'm a boy (18) and there's a girl who sincerely have feelings for. We hung out and stuff, she gave me mixed feelings. Only if i could look a bit better, my chances of her liking me back would be stronger. And in my college, or any other place, i see boys dating beautiful girls and girls dating handsome boys. If a person (boy/girl) dates an average looking (boy/girl), i start hearing comments like ""why's she dating that ugly guy, or why is this hansome chunk dating that average looking girl?"" I really want these problems to end, cuz this is what I'm facing as I'm an average looking person. There were friends of mine, whom I considered my  best friends, commented ""bro u look like ur 30yrs old"", ""bro i showed ur pic to my mother, she said u look like ur a father of 2"" with that fcking laughing emojis. And they themselves look pretty average, and they comment this. Why are people like this? What do they get by commenting on others like this?

5499,ufcjj7,throwawayasdf100,"Hey, 

I felt like posting here even though loneliness i experience is not conventional.
So I've gone through a mountain of shit despite my young age and eventually found peace of mind by ripping apart my beliefs and habits which I felt limited me. Some years ago I experienced a moment of clarity,no-self, whatever you call it. I saw through my beliefs about myself and about the world, and for a while I was no-one in my experience.
So now I'm left with no beliefs and I observe life living me instead of the other way.

This led to lasting peace of mind but now I can't really connect with anyone because everything kind of lost meaning when there are no beliefs. I just exist and am and this is all I know for sure.

I used to trust in science but even that assumes that there is a physical universe out ""there"" and it doesn't really question the reality of reality.

So while I have some friends and a loving family, the relationships feel like bunch of thought-made constructs and information coming from the senses (hearing and seeing). No-one gets the 'true' me, the awareness and never can. Observing the external world with mind empty of thoughts is calming but lonely. I feel like this transition is irreversible and sometimes I wish I could be immersed in my character and the external world again.

So this probably sounds ridiculous but it would be interesting to talk with someone who gets what I am talking about. I live peaceful life with my dog in the woods. And yes let's go with assumption that I am sane. I have no problem with this but would love to connect with someone who resonates. I only feel peace and gratitude which is awesome but I miss the immersion.





TL/Dr: I don't trust my thoughts and have no beliefs ---&gt;  I am a no-one feeling a bit disconnected from the external world and other people. If you resonate, feel free to pm me:)",2022-04-30 14:45:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594144342,3,/r/lonely/comments/ufcjj7/in_my_20s_lonely_while_surrounded_by_people_and/,,0,0,"In my 20s, lonely while surrounded by people and friends.

5500,ufcjo1,FitAbbreviations4197,"So I used to be a lonely kid, I didn‚Äôt have many friends, and got bullied quite a lot. But, when I got a little bit older, and finally graduated out of my emo phase, I stopped getting so much hate and actually became quite a social butterfly. Im now at uni, I have lots of close mates who I hangout with all the time, and who I can talk to and vent to. Basically, I have everything that 14 year old me thought I wanted, the only problem is I still feel the same loneliness I did back then.

I still feel like no one really cares, and I still feel like no one understands me. Even though I have the connections I wanted, none of them feel real. I jus feel extremely separate from everything that‚Äôs going on around me. The best analogy I can think of is‚Ä¶(this sounds bad but hear me out) all my relationships feel like owning a dog, (hear me out). Although the dog loves the owner, and the owner loves the dog, the two will never be able to truly understand each other. So imagine all your friends were dogs, u might love them and they love you, but you‚Äôll still feel lonely, and want a more understanding connection. 

I‚Äôm not saying all my mates are too dumb to get me, or anything ridiculous like that, the analogy works the other way round too (I could be the dog). My point is that I jus don‚Äôt get how other people work and I don‚Äôt think they understand me either. It‚Äôs like everyone else is on a wavelength that I‚Äôm not apart of, and never will be, like they all get something that I don‚Äôt. 

It feels like I crave a type of connection that either doesn‚Äôt exist, or is just unattainable for me, and that‚Äôs what hurts and scares me the most.

5502,ufcoim,ginger-m-thrown-away,"I've been trying to reach out to people again recently but I keep just getting ignored. The reason for this (if I had to guess) is that I never finished school and have never had a job yet because of serious mental health issues. Because of this I can't really talk personal stuff and I don't have any work/study talk to chat about. I avoid talking about anything depressing about my life - dysfunctional and abusive family, lack of work, no special or even basic skills - because I know that's just not a good idea. I leave these things out but usually they come up eventually anyway. They'll ask what I do and I don't feel comfortable lying or changing the topic if they're asking directly so I'll tell them I'm jobless and not studying. Even ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who are former NEETs will start avoiding me when they hear stuff like that, I guess it's a red flag.

This means I'm left with a very small selection of things to talk about and a high chance of being dropped as a friend because all I have are memes and talking about media I've watched/read. I want to change all this but it seems like it needs to be all at once. I need to do some kind of volunteer work but in order to do that consistently I need better mental health, which means I need to have more friends, but to have more friends I need improve my life, but to improve my life I need more friends, etc. I know there's other stuff like meditating and exercise that you can do on your own but overall I have to do all these things at once and maintain it all in one go or else it's back to square one. I've managed to do some of these things for periods at a time but never for long enough, let alone all the stuff I've never done.

I'm not trying to be self-pitying about this, I know its my responsibility that I've failed (and continue to fail) at keeping, it's just I never see much talk about how if you aren't in the loop on these things then you can't escape isolation.

5520,uffkn9,throwaway126394728,"Back a year or so ago, I used to have a really, really good friend that I had known for almost a decade. We were close on another level to me at least. Constantly doing stuff on weekends, always trying to find time to play games if we cant meet. We both were like brothers really. Now he was like really important to me because it was sort of my escape. Parents are relatively strict, school sucks, homework, etc. And I think he felt the same. I didnt really have any other good friends or friends in general other than him during that time. God I just cant even begin to say how happy and fun those times were, like it was clear to anyone to be honest. We were practically family. 

Now the change

Well, so my biggest regret like 2 years ago, is that we were in High school, and I made a bet with him, because we both were pretty shy, to go any try to ask out our crushes. Well, you can probably guess how that went for me, but happily for him, he was successful. Now I didnt get mad at him or his girlfriend then, and U still am not even now. But soon after, he basically forgot I existed. Id attemp to talk to him, but he eouldnt talk as much, he was always tryna do stuff with her. I full understood, thinking that they both just met, and are getting to know each other better. ""He will come back and talk to me eventually, right?"" Wrong. I just kept telling myself that for as long as I could until i really had to accept the fact that we are not friends anymore. I thought I had gotten over him, but I really havent.

I‚Äôve known this person for about 5-6 years and we‚Äôve had two fights which lasted over a year each fight. The first two years of our friendship were extremely good, lots of communication &amp; hanging out and going places. After those two years things went downhill tremendously .. she would screen me, cancel plans when I‚Äôd plan ahead of time, make excuses saying she was busy or tired all the time, not text me for long periods at a time (like 2-4 months) and I would purposely wait to see if she would text me out of the blue but never did. I would be the one to initiate conversations almost all the time. So I kind of got fed up with the relationship being one sided and deleted her off everything because I felt as if my presence didn‚Äôt matter to her and she didn‚Äôt care about me. I did this 2-3 times during our friendship and she got really frustrated with me because I would essentially dip without saying a word to her. I felt as though I had always been there for her if she were to ever need anything but felt like she wouldn‚Äôt return the favour because she didn‚Äôt ever check in on me when I was severely depressed and suicidal even though I told her about it. She would basically say ‚Äúme too‚Äù and sort of joke about it but also in a serious way. She‚Äôs told me a few times she doesn‚Äôt really care to have friends or talk to anyone &amp; that really broke me hearing but I never questioned her .. afraid that it could be directed at me. Her reason for never texting first was ‚ÄúI have to work on myself before I can put in work to others‚Äù kind of deal. Which makes sense but she‚Äôs done this for years. I was always respectful to her and kind to her so I don‚Äôt know why it felt like she abandoned me. I would overthink like crazy for months and cry for quite some days just thinking about how things could go back to our first two years of friendship again but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever be the same. Fast forward to today and she still seems to have the same bad habits. Ignores my text for days, cancelling plans, seems to only want to stay at home, barely making an effort to text me. The thing that keeps me around is that when we do get to hangout it‚Äôs almost always fun and good vibes between us. We get along very well and I feel like we can actually listen and talk about random stuff no matter how crazy it is. She also has bad communication with other people including her boyfriend so it also makes me think I‚Äôm overthinking. Her bf is also my best friend I basically view him as a brother. Im curious if she is taking our friendship seriously and actually cares about me because I‚Äôve been hurt by previous friends I thought cared about me. When I truly care about someone I am willing to help them in every way possible, psychically and mentally if I can &amp; I feel like if they cared about me they‚Äôd do the same? I keep overthinking things because of the lack of communication on her part and it puts me in a really dark, depressing mood which is why I don‚Äôt know if the friendship is worth it..

I guess I just got used to it. Like I said, I love my family but your family's your worst bully(did I say that correctly?)

 So, it became my issue and I always get offended and defensive when my weight gets called out, especially in school. I'm not a bully, but I sure damn know that I wouldn't let anyone, especially stupid boys, bully or undermine me, like, I remember punching so many guys wayyyy back elementary and highschool just because they're making fun of me, calling me names. I mean, you're the only person who can help yourself and forgive me for choosing violence. 

I guess that's why I have very low self-esteem, lacks confidence and I don't take compliments well(I'm just gonna deny and contradict your compliment) . I guess, when things start to creep and get into your head, you start to believe and eventually, just live with it...

Most people know me for being funny and friendly but I'm super duper shy, gets easily anxious and hates being the center of attention(duhh) because in my mind, when people look at me, all they see is this fat girl. Fat. Fat. Fat.
I mean, I tried to embrace the idea of being plus size and curvy (but honestly, for me, plus size and curvy are just sugar-coated words for fat, I seriously don't mean to offend people, it's just my take on it with all of the years of being one) But, at least there are times that I felt confident about my body, provided that I'm wearing decent stylish clothes. 

It took me yearsss to build up and have that confidence, but it could also crumble down with just a single negative thought or criticism. It all goes downhill when you start to compare yourself to others. You'll just end up asking yourself, why do I even exist?

 It came to a point where I avoid looking at mirrors, especially those big ass mirrors in the malls, fitting rooms or anywhere wherein you get to see your body's reflection and just feel ugly, disappointed, ashamed, disgusted and so on. I think that's when I stopped posting pictures on my social media, stopped taking selfies and letting someone take pictures of me when going out with family or friends. I still call myself lucky because I have my friends and family(not all of them obviously) who got my back and understands me.  

I've never been in a relationship or even on a date, like none, whatsoever. Sometimes when I get asked if I ever had a boyfriend or been in a date, Im not sure if im gonna be embarassed or offended by it. The last time someone liked me was this boy when we were in 3rd grade, and I rejected him; considering the fact that I'm not even pleasing in the eye, but yeah, karma's a real bitch haha.

Of course, I also want to be in love and feel loved, it's just that romantic relationships are just sooooo foreign and alien to me. Like, I could never imagine a guy liking and falling in love with me. With me! Im such a hopeless romantic and I can imagine myself being clingy in an acceptable way. But Im scared of guys, and I always have this fear of interacting with them, like what I said before , I always assume that they all think and see me as the fat girl, fat, fat, fat. Also, I'm boring as hell, no interesting hobbies and super awkward. 


I might sound desperate but ... It just get so freaking lonely. Like it's not even funny anymore, like, does the universe really hate me this much? ""You have your friends and family to love you,"" bitch don't even start me with that shit, that's different.

I may not be alone but I am definitely lonely.

No hands to hold, shoulder to lean on, hair to play and mess, cheeks to pinch, ears to whisper stupid things and sweet nothings, back to massage, lips to kiss and body to hug, spoon and cuddle with. Is that too much to ask? 

I know that I'm still ""young"", still gonna meet a lot of people and I have a lot of things to work on myself, like self-love and acceptance, ugh. 

So, to my future SO, I just want to say: Duuuuuuuuuuuude, where the hell are youuuu?? How long are we going to wait for each other? Im dying to meet you.",2022-04-30 22:33:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645421301,2,/r/lonely/comments/uflrhi/so_whats_exactly_my_point_here/,,0,2,"So, what's exactly my point here?"

I have a good career. I enjoy some gaming, playing guitar and I'm into cars. I also try keep fit and healthy. 

but my biggest downfall is I just can't come across as likeable or interesting enough for people to invest in me in terms of friendship.

No matter how hard I try I just sort of feel I come across as awkward and mundane. I don't know how to explain it,  in group gatherings I sort of just blend in the background. It's not like I'm shy or don't make conversations its just that nothing I say intrigues people into wanting to get to know me. It's tough to find good friends in this world especially when you can see people don't really take an interest in you. It makes me feel less important than other people around me .

5566,ufmsyk,andyyy000,"Everyday i joke around with my friends. I am the one trying to be funny. The clown. Everyone thinks i live a happy life and i don't give a fuck about anything.

Till i come home and i just am exhausted. Exhausted of life, trying to make everyone around me happy and forgetting the main thing... Making myself happy. Sleep deprived every day. Living on caffeine to study and workout or do something during the day. Staying up late at night listening to music. Lonely as fuck, don't feel loved, feeling guilty for everything. I just wanna feel loved. Always feeling like a dissapointment. I just wanna cuddle someone and just admire being loved. Nonstop body dysmorphia. Everyone asking why i always wear a hoodie and i just say i don't know cuz i don't want people to know the truth about me. Don't want anyone to worry or bother anyone. Nobody knows. No one takes me seriously anymore. No one. They just think i am a clown. Nothing else.

Bad childhood. Abusive father. Every childhood nigh cried through.

I am proud that i lived through really dark thoughts about leaving this world 1 year ago. Laying in bed with a knife next to me. My only motivation to not die wad that i don't want anyone to be sad because of me, and that i am fucking scared of the pain. I feel fake.

I am fucking lonely. I have a ton of friends and i still am lonely. I don't know what will make me happy....

Held my emotions in so many times that i am not able to cry anymore. Last real cry was 2 years ago.

Most of this started because i lost my best friend. Never felt ""satisfied in life"" since. Scared to find professional help.

When I was at primary school nobody wanted to be around me because they thought that I was weird, then when I was in 5th and 6th grade, I tried integraiting in all sorts of groups, but nobody actually accepted me because I am very masculine and they didn't like my hairstyle. After COVID came and when I returned to school at the end of 7th and the start of the 8th grade, things seemed promising. I cut off the friend group that I had in 6th grade and started staying with another, but they didn't look very intrested in being friends with me and the things were very one-sided, for example they almost never do the first move, I remember that I didn't talk to anybody in my class for almost 2 months, but nobody actually cared, or are intrested in learning things about me and I thought things changed since 6th grade, but no they piked up on the way I look. I have one month left of this, can you give me some advice?

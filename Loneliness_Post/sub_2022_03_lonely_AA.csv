11,t3wt2y,NotReallyAlone,"31 male. I just want some stability, a wonderful woman in my life, a good close friend or two (of any gender), and some feeling of acceptance. I don't want this constant worry and stress about feeling not good enough for a woman, and feeling ignored or rejected. I'm at the point where even seeing people hug or touch is making me immensely sad and I feel so ashamed of myself. How did it get to this point? Am I really that bad? Am I completely unlovable or is it just all in my head?

If anyone likes, I'd love to chat with you, in the comments or DM, and maybe we can share our honest thoughts about each other and how we come across, in a compassionate way. I know it's only text but perhaps feedback would be useful. I am also up for voice calls and making friends with people, so feel free to ask for my discord or something and we can talk. I just need to do something about this, it's destroying any positive feelings I'm having in life. I just feel numb and I don't know how I can live like this.

I hope you're all managing your lonely feelings. I wish I could help others too, and maybe if I can fix mine I can do just that. I am so sorry for all the lonely people.

50,t43hf3,Preparation_Fuzzy,"So recently, I asked a friend of mine for advice on how to meet people - new friends, potential lovers, yknow - and he suggested taking me to a bar. That seemed like a place people go to meet new people, so I agreed, but that night after he had some to drink he told me his goal was to get me to “fuck some drunk bitch” before promptly going into his room and presumably passing out. I cancelled the plans afterwards because I’m really not comfortable with any aspect of that. I want to know my partner, to care for my partner/for them to care for me, and most importantly I want them to be sober. I don’t think that’s how this all is supposed to work, right? Random anonymous sex?

52,t448kp,Govna2021,"Sorry if this ends up being a long post. 
I (22,male) have been at university for a while now and have really struggled to make any meaningful or lasting friendships. Before I moved to university, I had a nice group of friends that we all considered each other basically family as well as some other friends from other circles. These people were the main reason I could stay sane while I was stuck back home. 

Since I’ve moved to university, that sort of quality in friendship has declined as I’ve gotten older and met more people here. The first year was the biggest disappointment as I got into class, thinking things were gonna be like college and I was gonna have a nice group of friends in class but boy was I wrong. I think it might be worth noting that I do an art course that is very girl heavy with some non-binary people around. I’m literally one of few boys. I get worried that whenever I try and talk to people and make a good effort, they think I’m trying to get with them, even though I try to make it very clear that I do not want a relationship at all. Additionally, while I’m very passionate about my career choice, I do not present myself as a very artsy looking person as everyone else does, so I don’t really stand out. 

I tried to make effort with everyone in the class but everyone was so anxious and quiet. I went from very social and confident to very anxious in a matter of months and lost the will to try. It made me miserable. Additionally I started noticing a conversation format that a lot of people seem to use but I’ve come to despise. It’s where you talk, but no questions are asked and nothing is a response to anything. It’s always just “I did skiing today””well I did snowboarding yesterday” it basically just becomes a pissing contest. I try not to volunteer information unless asked of me because I never want to get stuck talking about myself. I always want to make sure no-one gets left out because I know how that feels but it feels like no-one else has that sort of awareness.

After I decided to retake my first year due to my mental health hitting an all time low, I became optimistic that this wouldn’t happen again and I would get the fresh start I’ve been dying for with a new set of class mates. For a year, I finally got it. At least I thought I did. I became the person who threw all the parties and set up all the social events with the circle I gathered from this new set. Which was fun but I did so I didn’t have to do it forever and that I could start to get invited to things that aren’t of my making. Unfortunately after a year, this has not happened. I’ve taken a step back and I basically get invited to nothing, other than what my partner gets invited to or sets up themselves. The worst part is that the people in the class are making plans with other class mates so it’s not like they are too busy for plans at all. 

I just feel like I’m in this endless loop of trying so hard, yet still being forgotten, I don’t even feel worth existing anymore. I’m so tired.",2022-03-01 09:40:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639834151,9,/r/lonely/comments/t448kp/i_went_from_having_a_great_social_life_to/,,0,6,I went from having a great social life to basically nothing after moving to university.

These days I'm spending more time alone at home than out with friends. It's not that I don't enjoy it, in fact being alone makes me feel way more myself than when I am around people. It's just that, I have this perception that I'll never get anywhere in life if I go it alone.

The one big example I have of that is how my sister came to move out of the house. If it wasn't for her moving in with her girlfriend she probably would've still been living with her parents. I feel stuck, still living with my parents because I can't foster a good enough relationship to move in with someone. Financially, I can't afford to move out of the house alone.

(Also, i want to mention about that [https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/f2rsfs/does\_anyone\_ever\_feel\_so\_lonely\_that\_whenever\_a/fheh7p9/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/f2rsfs/does_anyone_ever_feel_so_lonely_that_whenever_a/fheh7p9/?context=3)

108,t4el11,Greenmind76,"First of all, I'm not entirely sure I agree with the subject of this post but...having recently been tossed back into the dating pool I quickly jumped at the chance to ""get back out there"" only to realize I could be happy being single.

My gf of 3.5 years moved out for a new job in December and ended things on NYE. On January 1st I decided to say fuck it, toss the attachments I had to my life with her and live by my own rules. I spoke to my manager and got approved to leave the US and work remotely.

Sooo... now I'm 45(M), single again, divorced (2x), no kids (even got the snip snip) and am sitting in a beautiful apartment with the sun shining in my window... The cost of the apartment I'm in (for a week) is roughly the same as a night in a hotel in a similar location in the US. I've been up since 4AM, caught the sunrise (magnificent!), and spent the last 2 hours making as much noise as I want (while respecting the neighbors). I'll start my work day smiling and look forward to my meetings. I'll have lunch at some point with freshly squeezed watermelon juice. Dinner will be either self made or something small from a nearby diner. I'll head to the park at some point and just take in the fresh air. At night I'll head to the rooftop and enjoy the sunset in a hot tub as a chilly breeze sweeps across my body. I don't have to pay attention or care about the news back in the states... At the end of the week I'll take a bus to the mountains and spend a month there, exploring, reflecting, and healing.

To my friends and family my life sounds rather tragic but in reality it was all necessary to get me to the point I am at now. They feel this way because unlike me, they still hold onto the ideas that society and life has projected into their minds.  The true reason I believe we feel lonely is because society and our families teach us that attachment is healthy and without being attached we are not whole.

I'll be here for a total of 3 months, have cut off communication to most of my friends/family, and am just enjoying being with my ""self"". I have met some awesome people and had some great experiences but overall am just enjoying doing my own thing. I think a lot of people would feel happier or more at peace if they just let go of these ideas that we've been raised to believe in. Who's to say you need to have a ""home""?  Who's to say you need to be dating anyone or in a relationship?  Why have children unless you truly want them?  All of these things we think we need/want come from ideas put in our head from living around other people who impose these values on us. You don't have to prescribe to these ideas.  :)  The choice is yours.  I know not everyone can leave the US or walk away and that I am very lucky but I do believe anyone can let go of these ideas and find peace being alone which will eventually bring the right people into your life.

It does get lonely at night when it's just me in my head but getting up early makes sleeping a lot easier...so those times are short lived.",2022-03-01 18:24:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1542732101,9,/r/lonely/comments/t4el11/the_happiest_people_are_singleunattached_and_ok/,,0,2,The happiest people are single/unattached and OK with it.

 I think it would be more beneficial to everyone to tone down the bitterness and generalization of people, and stopping the comparing of which group of people has it worst when it comes to feelings of loneliness, and instead try to focus more on helping others (you may end up helping yourself too in the process) and improving ourselves.

I have quite a few friends but they don’t know anything about how much I’ve changed over the past couple of years or even months. In my family only my sisters are close to me but I can’t burden them with my problems, they have their own. My parents don’t know anything about me at all, at times they feel like strangers to me. Yesterday, someone I loved told me that something I am not able to get out of my head. In my efforts to become happy, I have slowly isolated myself to work on myself and the only person I thought who knew me and loved me ended up giving me a reality check. I’m only 22 but I feel like I’ve been alone for a lifetime. It is my fault as well, and I’m sure the price for it is a lonely death.

137,t4hsew,Here-Now01,"So, I’m almost 29/M. Never had a date once in my life. It’s embarrassing to admit but it’s so. The reasons are a bit complex, I won’t go into all now but basically super intense anxiety and depression since childhood. I always bought into the idea of “love yourself, improve yourself, and become confident before dating”. I still think there’s legitimacy to it. But in some situations like mine there’s a catch 22:

When you have serious childhood trauma and/or a legit mental health issue such as a chemical imbalance or whatever and you have done tons of very real and good hard work on yourself and indeed improved many aspects of your life drastically, but still find yourself deeply insecure, depressed, and anxious despite your best efforts. I still feel incapable of being in a relationship and the older I get the more depressing the situation gets. There’s a very real biological need for connection of this type, we’re hard wired for it and it is actually contributing to depression and insecurity which just makes it even more difficult to begin dating and it just goes round and round. I swear, if I could turn off the desire for a women I would do it in a heart beat, but it doesn’t appear to be possible.

I do my best to stay productive, take responsibility and not mope around feeling sorry for myself. I have a full time job. Eat healthy and take care of myself. In decent shape. Still trying to level up in life, etc…But I just can’t shake that damn desire for intimate connection.

I’m honestly confused about whether or not I should even try at this point. I feel too old to start dating, but who knows.

So, has anybody around my age here ever been in a similar situation and actually managed to start dating? Success stories?

Side question for women out there: I know you don’t know anything about me, how I look, personality, etc. I know there’s a lot of factors involved in who you would date. But, would having severe depression and anxiety and the lack of experience at the age of 29 be a deal breaker for you? Please be honest and please give reasons for either answer.

I kind of crave connection.  I have no clue how to find friends to get along with maybe it’s fate for me to feel this way. I’ll always be alone physically and mentally.

149,t4jpwo,Professional-Wing580,"I met a girl at my old job over half a year ago. I think she was into me and I was definitely into her. I was going to ask her out one day but before I had the chance I discovered that it was her last day. I missed the opportunity and said nothing. I’ve never been truly attracted to anyone since. Sure I’ve seen cute girls who I could see myself being with but never the attraction that I felt before. I loved every second around her even on my worst days. I try so hard to find what she had in other people but I can’t.

All I know about her is a first name and the school she goes to. Which is a large school, 10 miles away. Not like knowing more would change anything anyways. 

Maybe it’s just a trick my brain is playing on me. Maybe the feelings were never real which is why I didn’t ask her sooner. Maybe I’m just broken and using remnants of my past as a justification for my failures. Maybe it was never meant to be and I just need to accept it. 

I miss her company so much and she probably has no idea. She probably doesn’t even remember me. ~~If she liked me the way I liked her then why would she leave~~. So it’s just sad how I’m obsessing over someone whom I don’t even have a last name of. It feels like my only hope in life is to find another person like her.

160,t4ld1j,Simple-Experience-85,"Hey, first time posting on Reddit ever. Sorry if it’s poorly written, it’s 12am and im in bed, stuck with my thoughts.

I’ve been processing this thought for years, and just now i thought about opening up about it. This post is not only for you to read, but for me to write about and reflect on it myself.

 I’m 23 m and since childhood i’ve always had a lot of female friends. Lost my virginity to a girl when i was 14 and had a relationship with her for 5 years. I ended it because she was abusive. Met a few girls inbetween and started another relationship of 3 years. This one ended because ”i felt lonely”. She was really nice though.

After the last relationship, i went on a tinder rampage and laid about 10 different girls during one summer, all of the relationships were labeled as no strings attatched, but a majority of them still wanted more. I’ve always had it easy with close romantic relationships.

But Even though this is the case, i’ve always struggled with this immense feeling of loneliness. I think this has to do with the fact that i’ve since a young age prioritized romantic relationships over casual friendships. Which is something i’ve expressed openly that i really really really crave.

I started thinking about this for quite some time ago, and even tried to put thoughts into actions by hooking up with old guy friends and being open to new ones, but i just can’t seem to have that same luck to start casual and close friendship bonds with other guys like i have with girls.

It’s like im that awkward guy who can never get a girl, but with casual friends, and it’s driving me nuts. For other people it seems so easy for them to meet and keep casual friendships.

Can anyone relate with this?

Tldr: I have a hard time meeting and keeping casual friendships with guys, but have an easy time meeting and keeping romantic relationships with girls.",2022-03-01 23:18:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615120320,1,/r/lonely/comments/t4ld1j/easier_with_romantic_relationships_than/,,0,5,Easier with romantic relationships than casualfriendships?

I just read a chapter in my book where the main character has sex with a chick he barely knows. It's like I'm being reminded how lonely and pathetic I feel. I know these characters are fictional and it's part of the story, but it doesn't mean that it hurts any less. I'm sure when these things are written by people, they don't think about it cause they themselves are either in a relationship or have had sex before.

203,t4sszu,ja_neane,"So I transferred universities this year. At my old school I made one friend freshman year and we lived together sophomore year with 2 other girls. It was fun and all but no one was really motivated to do school work and my grades were bad. I get really bad social anxiety so I never was one to go out or do stuff everyone else does my age like smoke, party,etc. It felt like I was being persuaded to change so I wanted to get away from home and figure things out on my own without other peoples input.
I like my new school, I have one friend here I know from highschool who’s in a frat and I usually go to their parties and I’ve gotten to know people there because It’s the same faces, but I haven’t made any actual friends. 
Even in a club I joined I haven’t made friends either.
The people I have met only talk to me when they need something like answers and all that, one girl who I usually talk to in class didn’t even say happy birthday which kind of sucked bc I always attend to her when she needs something.
I turned 21 Sunday i literally didn’t do anything. My friend that’s in the frat said we could go out and celebrate but never hit me up and I saw he went out with his other friends, which I understand but it still hurt. Whenever I go to class and feel like there’s a lot of people or get overwhelmed I go to the bathroom and freak out a bit til I calm down. I’m just tired of feeling so anxious and locking myself up everyday. On the bright side my grades did improve but everyday just feels dull and the same I don’t have motivation anymore. Usually for a hobby I love to run because it clears my head and I’ve been doing it for years, but I’ve been injured so i can’t even do what makes me happy.
I’ve had a history with eating disorders and struggled with anorexia in highschool and freshman year of college. Now that I’ve recovered and “gained weight” I feel self conscious and like I hate myself even more. 
I bought some cute shorts to wear to class and as soon as I saw myself in the mirror I had to change. 
I don’t feel this way with my friends from back home, I can be myself and have a good time and enjoy going out but I can’t do that here. 
I guess I just need to vent because I feel like I don’t have anyone?I always knew I was alone but it sucked for it to be confirmed and to have to spend my bday alone.",2022-03-02 05:31:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1625173042,8,/r/lonely/comments/t4sszu/spent_21st_alone/,,0,3,spent 21st alone /:

211,t4u272,banjo123717,"Looking back on my life thus far seems to be a story of being excluded. Not belonging but being too stupid to see that those in my circle didn't care if I was there one way or another, just useful in some way.

In elementary school, my only two friends would always hangout after school, without me. In middle school I moved around and had a hard time making friends. Never really saw anyone. I guess I couldn't be useful as a child.

In highschool, I somehow got lucky and was fast and strong, so I made friends with sports. All the same though, once the buzzer went off and I left the locker room, they would go off to someone's house without inviting me to tag along.

 I have one particular memory, my senior class did a sort of ""survivor"" game that we would do during our study period toward the end of our last semester. I was voted out two different times, even if I was the person carrying the team in many events. I only dominated the redemption game, to get voted out again.

I always thought my problem then was, maybe, I was anti social. I never really got into arguments or fights, but maybe I was too quiet, too ditstant.

In my college years I tried to change that. I tried to be the person who would give the shirt off their back for anyone, honestly anyone. Someone that people know, part of something else. I don't talk to anyone from school anymore. Being too open is also an issue, I suppose. This balance of too hot too cold was a game I didn't even know I was playing, or maybe I wasn't useful to them.

I always had a passion for music, and I would say I am pretty okay at it. Thats how I made friends later in life. I'd play guitar in bands, write music, and for a time I thought I actually made friends. However, I soon learned I was just a player to most of them. I'd have to leave a band due to homelessness or what not and I would never hear from any of them again. People only want to know you because you play in some bigger regional band, but once you have another project after that isn't as popular yet, or you put down playing music for a bit,, they want nothing to do with you.

Now I'm financially stable, I have a decent job and a girlfriend. Going to be 25 soon, not really sure where the time went. Even this feels like a farce most of the time. Maybe she stays around because I'm financially stable and can support her, I've been nothing but a tool to everyone else and I don't think much has changed. It honestly makes it hard to be in a relationship but I know my brain is just stupid.

Reading this feels like a bunch of first world problems, but I honest to goodness have no one to talk to and I can't think of anything better than the anonymity of reddit.

Anyway.

 I grew up as a Jehovah’s Witness. I left when I was 20, a little over 2 years ago. My parents and I were very close, and we were a very affectionate family. My mom and I cuddled a lot, my dad and I hugged a lot, and we never went a day without saying I love you. After I left the organization, my parents cut me off, and kicked me out. 
After leaving I’ve come to realize that my parents weren’t the best, but I am struggling a lot with the lack of platonic intimacy in my life. I don’t have parental figures, I have a good friend but she does NOT like being touched, and I’m struggling with it a lot. I have things in my life that I want to talk about, but I don’t want to dump it all on one person. I have people in my life who care about me, and ultimately I know if something happened to me, my parents would be there. But nothing fills that void. Nothing feels the same as cuddling with my mom. And it’s fucking killing me. I think knowing they’re alive and well and actively choosing to not have anything to do with me makes things worse. I feel cast aside, like trash. I haven’t really talked to anyone about this. Maybe I just needed to get it out , I don’t know.

Like 2 days ago, he tried to follow me on instagram and ""talk things through"", but by then he already started dating his crush, it was like opening a wound while it was atill fresh and just jamming barbed wire into it.

I didn't get out of bed for that entire week pretty much, didn't feel like doing anything, lost all motivation to exist to be honest. Now I'm not sure where to go from here, or what to do, I'm running out of shit to fill my time, I routinely feel lonely at night and keep having dreams about stuff happening, like getting hugged, etc.

Not to mention, I have my family breathing down my neck about job stuff, and not even listening to anything I actually say, and I'm over here with a shitty living situation, crippling depression and social anxiety preventing me from even carrying out basic tasks. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore :/

248,t4zolk,twcau,"41/M from Perth, Australia; battling major depression for two decades, arising from the effects of bullying all the way through school, and a father for whom emotional and physical abuse of my late mother and myself was the norm. It also is looking likely that i’m on the Autism spectrum - which i’m now waiting a diagnosis of.

All of that has made it hard for me to connect with people throughout my entire life. The number of friends I have can be counted on one hand, and I barely have the energy to speak to any of them most of the time. and all of them all live overseas, so there’s no one locally who can pick me up or drag me out of the house to get me out of whatever funk I’m feeling in at the time

The last 2 1/2 years have just been getting worse and worse. It got to the point at the end of last year that I’ve felt the need to seek readmission into a private mental health facility for the second time in my lift, only to find out my treating psychiatrist has totally changed his practice, and forgot to tell me, or refer me on. so stuck in a loop until that can be sorted out, the fun of the country with a somewhat functioning health system that forgot to properly support the needs of those with long term mental health concerns.

So I’ve need to take two weeks off work just to de-stress and unwind at home. That started late last week, and i’ve only just had my first proper shower in six days - and that was only because I had to leave the house to go buy stuff at the shops.

it’s generally tiring just feeling like this, and I’ve been dealing with it for way too long.

I can’t remember the last time I had a date, or even a decent conversation with someone of the opposite sex.

The only thing that I really have in my life is work, which in itself is sad enough. And barely anyone outside of my own team bothers to talk to me about anything, or include me in any social conversation.

So yeah, just feeling really crap, and sitting on the couch at 9 pm watching some random YouTube videos because there’s nothing else I really have the energy to do.",2022-03-02 13:02:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1518876153,13,/r/lonely/comments/t4zolk/sick_of_feeling_like_nobody_wants_me_around/,,0,4,Sick of feeling like nobody wants me around

261,t51rg7,deletedmessages,"I haven't had some I would consider a ""friend"" since 2019. I had someone I would talk to almost every day ghost me on some bs time management excuse despite being online to talk with other people they knew. The way it ended makes me contemplate what went wrong and if it was my fault often. 

I would then go on to start anti-depressants in mid-2020 from the loneliness and isolation for a few months and am now heavily considering them again and the thought of it makes me extremely sad. I was in a dark place and contemplated ending it all before starting them.

I retained 1 ""friend"" from high school and I would not consider them such nor someone I could speak to about something on my mind. It was made very clear when I was admitted into a hospital for a month for a health-related procedure and they called me a total amount I could count on one hand. They just recently contacted me after months of silence to tell me they hadn't seen me since then. This really pissed me off considering I always check on this person while they were going through it and I wasn't even good myself. (Basically setting myself on fire to keep them warm.) 

I had a therapist for a while and I stop seeing them just 2 months ago due to them starting their own practice. I have made considerable progress in other areas of my life, but this one issue of loneliness still bothers me every day. They recommended that I find a new one but I decided on using my resources instead of what felt like starting over with a replacement. 

I've reached out a considerable amount of times to others on Reddit looking to make friends only to no reply, being ghosted. From an outside perspective, it would not appear I've done much, but in a way, it feels like I've expelled all options that I'm comfortable with trying. I'm not going to continue to reach out if it's not working because that's not how I work. I had a job back in November of last year where I made a conscious effort to make conversation and it was actually going well but was let go due to literal excuses and miscommunication. I wasn't the only one let go around this time, other people who had been there longer were being terminated as well for no good reason.

281,t56jiz,DemonSlayerV7,"I aways had problems in socializing, most of my life until now (20y btw) I was at home just watching random videos, movies, anime and series and playing video games.


During my life since teenager, I heard a lot of negativity surrounding my country, a lot of racism, especially in high school, everyone said that people here were dishonest snakes, potential criminals, dumb, non educated, not taking anything seriously, unpolite, non civilized and just wanted to party and mess, incompetence is the norm, fucking everything. It was making me sick, tired, disturbed, traumatized, I had brakedowns, MANY TIMES I got out of class and locked into the bathroom when I sensed that they would start to talk about politics. People here have an imense inferiority complex, making dumb stereotypes and memes, aways brute comparing countries, stating that they are much better and that people there were actually decent.

I feel brainwashed and indoctrinated.


I became paranoid, I aways smell this, anticipating the bulshit that will come out outside of their mouths, it makes me not trust people, I cant form bonds with people because I am so sensitive that they can easily be ""marked"" by me, I cant even look into eye contact with them, especially when they talk about this. I even avoid checking content from here, because I am aways afraid of what they might say, I had many episodes where randomly youtubers spilled that bulshit out of nowhere and I never forget it.

Every time when I watch series, I am aways comparing countries, I dont like it but it is an obsession that I have to make sure that everything they say is false.


It also comes A LOT from home, my dad is a sick politics fanatic, all the time he is talking about politics in an echo chamber, hearing audios and opinions of idiots, aways lacking any form of logic or nuance, his comments disturb me, I feel personally attacked, multiple times I start to yell at my dad, scream really hard telling him to stop with this cruelty, I cant even have a reasonable discussion that I get so hurt by this that I become desperate.


Recently, my dad was talking about cultural chocks from other countries and he said that Americans see here as just a garden, a playground, lacking any form of respect. This messed with me, because it created a voice within me that says that the people I see on Internet (mostly Americans) think that, and it makes me surrounded by abusers. I know it isnt right, and I am doing my best to not hear nationalism propaganda, but when everyone around me says this, I uncousciously think they are right.

I also dont like its culture, I hate almost all of its music, I dont fit in, I dont have a national identity, thanfully, I live in a city that is pretty neutral and normal, so it doesnt feel so bad.


I hadnt really spoke about this with anyone, I am very afraid of what people might say.

The funny part is that what they are saying isnt even true, my country definitely isnt bad, everything that they say isnt true, people are moral and ethic, progress runs ranpant, everyone has cars and smartphones, I watch people I did know and on Tinder, everyone seens to have a prosperous life, many of them going to colleges, most of them MUCH BETTER than me.

In response of all this, I created a coping mechanism, I am against nacionalism, I dont believe in nationality, I HATE any traditional value, the idea of culture for me is opressive, I have a very positive look on the world, where progress is inevitable and only increases, and I am totally against on segregating countries, what really matters on average is the age we are, not the place. I have an extremely global view, seeing humanity as one, I am a philosopher, so my rejection of social subjects is very present, and I see current problems as TRIVIAL, they only matter now, not in the future, which complements my historic determinism.

Since a very young age I've always been a shy person and now that I have a lot to focus on - by that meaning, study - I guess I'm trying to let things be just as they are thinking I should only focus on university.

The thing is, I feel really lonely and basically don't interact for about 8 hours a day. I have really good friends (same ones for about 5 years) but we're kinda apart due to either school and work, and I do want to make new friends but I am not a talkative person and most of the time end up embarrassing myself in front of others due to poor social skills which got worse bc of the pandemic (I literally have panic attacks and start to stutter and apologizing for it, and I admit that it makes me REALLY upset). I have my girlfriend supporting me the entire time, but sometimes I feel like it's just too much for her to deal with since she's basically my only friend which I talk to often and that's it. I just really want some advice if anyone could either give me some tips to deal with the anxiety that comes with social interactions or if you know any other thing I could do to help myself not feel trapped in my mind or vent...

I feel like everything is moving to fast, I was doing so well in school and enjoying it, and I still do. Why the hell do I just want to talk to someone who knows how fast and scary life is? Its not a lot of work, but it still feels like so much. I just want to talk to someone who understands how lonely I am, how tempting suicide looks at points. I'm told I'm smart but I just don't see it, and people don't explain. I don't know what I'm saying, I think I just really want to talk to someone. I have depression, I should understand it well, I don't know why it just waits for the time I least expect it to stick another knife in me. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about the things I want to, and every time I've tried they either don't understand, nod along, focus on the wrong points despite correction, or don't care. When my parents found out, they still didn't seem to understand. My old school's psychologist kept missing the point of what I was saying regardless of how I said it. I tried again with the psychologist my parents got me, despite her being able to diagnose me why couldn't the professional get what I was saying? My first therapist no help. Second one was better but STILL COULDN'T GET IT. even my parents knew this wasn't helping, each time I would meet with a mental health professional I would breakdown and wouldn't get any help, leaving in a worse state than I came in. It was a pretty fucking clear message that these people won't understand or help. When people say you need to be sad to be happy, does that mean you spend just as much time sad as happy!?!?!? What the fuck kind of sick joke is that!?!? People also make and maintain friends so easily, I can only maintain and make friends in a school setting. How do people just do that, how do they know all this? How the hell do people keep up with all this schoolwork? People say I ""carry the group"" and am ""smart"" but never explain, making this information useless! I know I fucking know, I have to get out of this myself, no one can help me but myself, seek help, your not alone.

The only ‘friend’ I have is my cousin who lives ages away, I rarely RARELY see her and tbh I rarely even talk to her now.  I don’t really have any friends. I’d start talking to someone, think we were becoming friends, then they’d just forget I exist and stop talking to me. And I’ve recently tried to make online ones but it always ends up the same way, or we can never be to close because we live to far apart and it ends up not working. Do I do something wrong or am I just boring? I always have the urge to text someone, and remember I have no one to text. My cousin barely replies because she’s either busy (student life) or out with her own friends. Idk, I guess I’m just meant to be lonely lol. I don’t know how to meet people.

360,t5kb2j,BearReal123,"Im so fucking done.

Not to go or hint at anything serious or to the point of selfharm(something I want to make clear because ive always struggled getting my points out clearly and unfortunately even when speaking my mind, ive found that there's no room for mistake doing or expressing these kinds of things) but I am really tired of how lonely it is just being myself. I dont know how to even begin expressing this because I feel like waste even thinking this way considering I have a terrifically great upbringing, great friends and everything, and I feel so guilty because the world is much more burdened by more important things and all I bring to the table is the pissed off attitude of some well-off angsty teen living in a first world country. Its fucking pathetic really. But eitherway its been really hard to get my own thoughts across mainly because I have no one I really trust to get my thoughts across to and I recognize that leaving them to ruminate in my head leades to either insensitive garbage or some kind of unrealistic prospect of an ideal future(ill try and elaborate later). I really do try my best to maintain a kind of selfish peace for myself, as in doing what I can to maintain whatever friendships I have and trying to become a likeable person because without my daily fix of at least a suggestion of a compliment I am an unbearable mess. If I dont feel validated constantly I feel terrible and its a seriously awful cycle. I dont pressure others into giving me validation but I seriously do try my best to be as likeable a spossible and it feels like all I can manage to do is gather some great people together but never really establish anysort of relationship where I can lean on another shoulders in exchange for their leaning on mines. I seriously yearn for this kid of interaction one day but putting that aside, all this work amounts to what feels like a crumbling empire. Some friends amongst each other may get into arguments which is normal, and deviate away into a life they, I assume would prefer and I can recognize that if that is what those 2 individuals think is best, it is what it is. But despite being so seemingly disattatched from them I feel like I cling to them selfishly in the moment like a child does to divorcing parents and I cant help but feel like ive messed something up yet again. That reminds me, not only amd i trying to pickup and replace these falling peices of my relationships but this constant state of preserving a sense of normality is quite easily broken by small mishaps, though, in my case, almost everything I do becomes a mishap one way or another and comes back to haunt me because I overcomplicate things or who knows what. I look back on my previous actions and sometimes wonder how fucking stupid I  must have been to thought or acted a specific way even though im always doing my best to think and act in the most mature and comprehensive way at any moment given. Im so awfull. I had so much more to write but its like 12;28 in the morning and im so god damn tired and I didnt even get to the part where I feel so lost and empty and I just wanna cry out for help and how mental health services feel like catching onto a twig while plunging into a canyon and im probably going to forget about this tommorow morning or delte it in embarassment. I guess I just needed to get what I was thinking into text because it helps me think better idk. Its definetely better than letting it rot in my brain. Im so tired and I really fucked up everything and I have no one to go to but just to reiterate I am fine enough. The last time i sort of opened up exagerration and getting caught in th emoment got to the best of me in the worst way possible and I do not wish to live through that again. Actually im not sure if i going to post this after all. im sorry ill delete it in the morning actually theres a sinister wanting for attention I now have and I want to hear othe rpeople say something positive, I dont know if I need it or  if I do if I will make the effor to apply it but fuck.

It seems to just keep getting worse and the wound gets reopened every time I try to find someone.

These events have taken a tremendous toll on my self esteem and I didn’t have much to begin with. I feel like I can’t take another rejection and my brain is incapable of trusting or loving someone at this point. I feel like every prospect I may have had at finding love has been sabotaged. I want someone to care for me but every time I open up to someone I get hurt. It hurts so badly wondering why I’m not enough. It feels like I’m unlovable, like theres something fundamentally wrong with me that can’t be fixed. Every time I bring up feeling this way to my family or best friend they tell me I have so much life ahead of me and that I’ll meet someone, but the fact is some people DO die alone. On top of this it’s nearly impossible for me to meet people. I started college during the pandemic and have made no friends.

384,t5mcc1,VenomousBlack,"Ok, soo hear me out first  


If we were all in the same room I feel like this would be a piece of cake. We all feel lonely and can all talk to each other but also actually have real physical contact like hugs. We can actually see, feel and touch each other.   


We all have something really serious in common. Why aren't we trying to find each other in real life and fix two people's problems things with one stone? Everyone here from young to old has someone that is going through a similar type of loneliness. It just feels like this would be so simple if we weren't separated by screens and huge distances.   


What I think we should do is arrange meetings for people in certain areas. If you are in New York, pick a place and invite others from the area to a coffee place. Meetup, chat, and maybe find what you're looking for in someone who understands what you're going through. No social games, just being honest.  


Ok, I know this is unrealistic for a lot of people but when I look at all the posts here it feels like doctors who are sad because they need another doctor to fix their injury. Everyone here IS the solution to loneliness, yet we all still feel so lonely.  


Ok, I rambled a bit but I just wanted to hear what others thought about this. Do you agree that this would be much easier if we were all in the same room?

Sometimes it hits as soon as I wake up, realising I have no one to call, no one to text, no one to complain to, and no one to celebrate with.

I couldn't even get up for an hour, I just stayed in bed doomscrolling and tearing up. 

The greatest moment of my day is when I feel empty for an hour, not sad, not in pain, just empty, a husk of my former self.

Not a single missed phone call.

421,t5ru2a,87Dji,"Hi, to anybody reading that. I always hated people venting but somehow i'm here now. I'm ~20, and i feel like it's already too late. When i was younger, i was popular, i had a lot of friends, invited in parties, with a loving family. I was also pretty sad and selling drugs (the only reason why i used this flair), but somehow i felt much better those days.

Slowly, people moved on. They had studies, jobs, then a wife/husband, a driver licence, a place to live. I dropped out quickly because i was selling (never really used drugs tho), legally i only had little jobs, like retail, or lifting coffins and burrying people. I had and still have my gf, i'd say she still loves me but she doesn't have any respect or admiration for me left. Struggling as hell for my driver licence, don't know why, i don't consider myself dumb or unable to drive.

Now, i'm not in my hometown, and so, i see my old friends like once a year. We changed so much and we can't relate to each other anymore and it's hurting. I have friends online, i see them once a year too, but like, it's still weird i'd say. I'm not from online, if that makes sense.

So i'm here, without a purpose and without meds, my gf thinks i'm a dead weight she's carrying (who knows why she stays), i'm embarassed by myself, ashamed of what i became and how much i stopped progressing.

I strongly believe in afterlife, i don't really know why i did not abandoned, but it's probably because of art, i love creating things. So that's the positive note here, try to create, for some reason it's helping.

Lately i've been struggling with really bad ideas, i mean morally good ideas, like tracking down and shanking a maximum of child abusers before going to jail or shit like that. It feels like good actions you can't normally do, but you can in that specific situation where you don't have that much to lose but somehow you're still alive.

I feel abandonned and isolated, i don't know what to do about it, i'm too old to make new friends, too alone to leave my gf, and too ashamed to talk with my family. Feel like i was in a good run and something made me become that very bad version, like, 40yo male looking back and saying ""yeah, i wasted all this time"", except i'm 23.",2022-03-03 13:41:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642043570,1,/r/lonely/comments/t5ru2a/im_lost_and_i_dont_have_anything_left/,,0,0,"I'm lost, and i don't have anything left"

447,t5xym0,Nobody_apostrophe_s,"### Background

* I'm 26M.
* I have a high paying job and I've been working out for around 6 years, so I'm no stranger to the self improvement hamster wheel.
* I live alone in a city where I don't know anyone. During covid WFH for the past two years I've been living with my mom on and off to cope with loneliness.
* I have a few friends that I interact with online once in a blue moon, but I'm geographically distant from them, not very close with them, and can't really relate to any of them. I've always struggled a lot with socializing.
* I've never had any sort of relationship.
* I have never really used social media.
* I suspect that I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum.
* I've had lifelong sleep issues and I'm always either sleep deprived or have a chaotic sleep schedule.
* I spend a lot of my free time playing video games. On a few occasions I've cut them out of my life, but that usually leads to having too much free time, which makes me feel miserable, which leads me to seek out a distraction, which frequently leads me back.

### My Predicament

There's nothing in my life that gives me any pleasure or satisfaction. I don't feel attached to anything. My life has been so overwhelmed with negative emotions up to this point that I think I'm a broken person: I don't think there's anything that I could obtain or achieve in my life that would ever make me feel happy or content. I don't feel like I'll ever be able to connect with another person. I don't think I'm clinically depressed, but rather I'm jaded and damaged from how my life has gone up to this point.

For most of my life I've felt unable to focus on things like work or school. In any endeavor, I always run out of gas after a few months and have to struggle to keep going. I've been feeling this a lot lately. I'm struggling to keep up with work, and my job is already stressful and challenging.

Whenever I try to do anything, especially work-related, I have a recurring thought: why am I working if I have nothing to work for? This even extends to things like working out. It seems pointless to look good if no one will ever notice aside from myself in the mirror, so I've been slacking for months. I don't enjoy my job. I don't enjoy my leisure time. I have no desire to do anything special or travel. There's nothing that I'm saving money for. I have no obligations. I don't have any hopes for the future. I don't want to improve myself anymore. I used to want things, like a family and a home and security, but I think I'm finally over all of that. I think I'm more curious about what it would be like to die than anything else at this point.

473,t629dq,PsychoAkaSempai,"I'm male 18. Pretty laughable, I know. I've always had pretty shitty childhood, not the worst or like too drastic. Just not the way I would like. Ever since I was kid i got to watch my alcoholic and abusive father, I've been taught to not depend on anyone, I've been bullied since I was 6. I watched my mother mentally break down and I've been sexually abused by my female cousin. Life got a bit better when my mother left my ""father"" and married my step-father. But as life went on, some thing didn't really change. I had to fight a lot because of bullying. My new family taught me to eat a lot + it made me feel better so i slowly got fatter which caused more bullying. Then new sibling came and as i grew older(around 12) I've been forced to take care of them so that my parents could work. This went on for so many years. It stopped pretty much recently around year and a half i think. This lifestyle made me asocial and after some time I've just given up on socializing, finding gf and other teenager stuff. I've been practically growing up with videogames so in one way it wast as bad when I still wasn't that mature. As time went on I've started to be really closed up and paranoid when it came to interacting with new people. I secretly started smoking which I don't regret. Anyway as i grew older and more mature i wanted to live differently. But my stepdad has really old school view at life so he basically chained me up making me unable to do anything( sleepover at my friend's house, most of the time i couldn't even go outside to hang out with him, when I got close with a girl he didn't care, still wouldn't let me goo meet her because I was needed and I'm ungrateful). Anyway it was fun when I had to listen to his nagging about me needing to socialize more, find a girl etc.
At some point I totally gave up,  even now I still don't feel most of stuff others can feel (i dont feel sad about death, some horrible accidents and stuff), even now I'm not sure who am I and what should I do with life. I was stupid kid who wanted his parents to be proud of him, as a result I've been studying at school that i hate And is killing me even more, for 4 years. Now whenever I get close with someone i just fuck it up. I've never felt love and whenever I feel happiness it just gets absolutely ruined and i get hurt, just because I expected something, change, development etc. Doesn't matter i keep finding new ways to get hurt. At this point I don't really care what happens to me, I'm bored of living, I'm bored of being lonely and I'm bored of trying just to get hurt. For the last months I have sort of existencial crysis, thinking about suicide, because maybe there's something better than this after death, who knows. But I still hope that things will get better and it's killing me inside even more. I feel more and more emotionless as days go by.

478,t62wsh,Zepheonn,"Why is it that society overall is wired to only cater to a healthy support structure when someone doesn’t really need one in the first place? 

What I mean by this is if someone is depressed and alone, and needs the most support from others, they don’t have anyone. When they reach out and describe their feelings honestly, the reaction from others is dismissive. “Quit being so negative, it’s unattractive.”

However, people that have their lives way more in order (compared to the previous) have way more of a healthy support structure. A good amount of friends, family, a significant other, etc. In my experience, these are also the kinds of people that don’t really tend to rely on or prefer to be open with other people. “They don’t want to burden others with their problems.” But everyone is concerned, they all reach out and they show how much they care when anything negative happens, sometimes even somewhat trivial issues. They don’t want help or sympathy, but they have it all. The people who just want to be heard are the massive grey clouds in the background that no one pays attention to.

As a society, we perpetuate the state we are already in. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. It’s the same with mental health and building bonds with others. You are told to be honest but discouraged from being negative. You are looked down on for lying but you’re hiding how you truly feel so that others will tolerate you. “You have to let things out, talk to people, don’t bottle up emotions.” Yet, when you talk to them, they abandon you and make you feel worse than you already were. Hopefully you might have one or two people that might be there sometimes, on your worst day.",2022-03-03 22:02:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1503869878,8,/r/lonely/comments/t62wsh/random_thought/,,1,4,Random thought

490,t658aj,Then-Let694,"TW: suicide and drugs.
I’ve been feeling like shit for the past 6 months. I used to have friends but now I feel so lonely because we barely talk anymore and I just feel like they don’t really care about me. I ruined my friendships because I have such low self esteem that I convinced myself they didn’t like me so I just isolated myself and now I’m worse than ever. I don’t know what to do now because I feel like everyone has someone to talk to and I just don’t. I’ve tried to ignore it and tell myself that everything is gonna be okay but the negative thoughts invade my mind. I just wish I could shut my brain off and stop feeling sad. I feel so awful that I can’t stop crying, even at school. Sometimes I cry up to 8 times a day. 

Whenever I feel calm and tell myself everything is gonna be okay it literally just lasts for a few minutes and then I go back to crying anymore. I have no hopes for this year anymore. I feel like no one wants me. I convinced myself that my presence doesn’t affect people’s lives and they don’t want me. I’ve had 3 months of summer holidays and only 1 friend contacted me, but no one else really cared to know about me.

I’m so deep down in negativity that I’ve literally been considering doing drugs to ignore the bad feelings, I’m at the verge of doing it but at the same time I know it’s just gonna make everything worse because I would be adding an addiction to my personal problems. I hate the fact that when I’m down I engage into self destructive behavior. Yesterday I literally threw up twice because of all the alcohol I had drank, I couldn’t even stand up. 

Also I feel like the reason why I haven’t committed suicide yet are my family, my boyfriend and my hopes for the future. My family would be destroyed and my boyfriend too, he’s the only one who truly cares about me but unfortunately he’s long distance. However something I’m grateful for is the fact that at least I still have some hopes for the future when I get out of school (I’m in my last year of high school). 

Does anyone think it will get better?
And can anyone please give me some advice to get distracted from the negative thoughts?",2022-03-03 23:51:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615432695,3,/r/lonely/comments/t658aj/will_this_ever_stop_also_i_need_advice_please/,,0,5,Will this ever stop? Also I need advice please.

510,t67s3x,f4r4m,"It's been a difficult year. After struggling to get pregnant, my husband and I were finally successful. My husband is getting a new job really far from home, and I'm honestly freaking out inside. 
I don't make friends easily. I forced myself to make a Meetup group so I could play DnD with actual people rather than play video games. I've made some good friends but have lost even more. Since I started the group, I'd guess I keep in regular contact with about 3 or 4 people. But now we're going to move and all my friends are here at home. I won't know anyone or have any family close by in our new city. I work from home and only go in the office every few weeks, so there is no relationship with coworkers.
My family is panicking since I'm the youngest, and this is my first child. My mom is trying to buy me furniture, and my sister wants to throw a big baby shower. The problem is that we still don't know where we're going to live, and most of the apartments are the same size we're living in now (we don't have a lot of space). After I told my mom and sister I didn't want furniture or a shower, they've stopped talking to me.
My husband works really hard. It's to the point where we could be eating dinner together, and his mind is clearly elsewhere. We'll be trying to watch a movie or play a game together, and he'll be on Reddit or actively working on his laptop. This has been an ongoing issue that we've talked about so many times that I just feel like it's useless to try anymore. Intimacy is getting difficult because I'm getting a lot bigger. 
It honestly feels like as we get closer to baby's due date and moving, the stress and the loneliness are getting worse. It honestly feels like there's a giant gaping hole that's growing larger and larger, separating me from everyone. I can put myself out there to my friends, but I'll feel like a burden to them. My family tells me over and over that they'll help me, but when I refuse material gifts, they refuse to talk to me. My husband tries to be there, but he keeps falling back into his old habits. 
I can't change anyone. I can't make them want to spend time with me. I just feel isolated from everything. Feeling the baby kick or move doesn't make me feel good. It honestly scares the shit out of me. I'm scared that even she won't want to spend time with me when she comes into the world.

532,t6anbc,iwillnotrelapse216,"I'm currently on a study break for my final exams but school is effectively over. Everyone was having a good time, taking pics and stuff, and I was just uh there. No one approached me for a picture and I kinda feel shitty about it. I can't really blame them either, I'm not overtly social and I stick to myself. I don't have any other social media apart from reddit and most people in my grade don't use reddit. Guess everyone else could make friends and connect during these two years and I couldn't. 

Another thing that especially bums me out is that this girl I really like, and with whom I got along with fairly well, wasn't inclined to take a pic with me too. I had asked her out a couple of months before, and she declined, but was super nice about it and still was friendly with me. On the final day we went to the lab together because our slides didn't come out properly and we had a good conversation. Still, she didn't ask me for a pic, and I'm too shy to ask her for one. She took a pic with all her other friends, and all she did was wave bye when I was walking towards the door. Guess she never thought of me as more than an acquaintance. Still feel really shitty though,I don't even have her number and the only time I'll see her again is during my exams. As much as I really want to, I just can't go up to her and ask her for her number or if we could keep in touch. It just feels weird, and I don't think she's too keen on being friends either.

I'm just feeling so bad about all the lost opportunities, and I just can't stop thinking about that girl; what I could have said or done or what could have happened if she said yes. This won't matter in a year or so, but right now it's fucking me up and I just can't focus on my academics. I keep thinking about her and about what could have happened between us. I still harbour this hope that she'll maybe initiate during our exams but I don't think it's realistically possible. I've spoken to a couple of friends about this and their advice has been ""don't think about her"", but I just can't do it. 

Just typing whatever is on my mind, in hopes that getting it out would help me handle it better. I hope you guys can help me out here; maybe suggest ways to stop thinking about her. I really need to do well in my final exams or else I'd have to go back to my third world shithole of a country.

That's not what I want. A true friend cares about you whether you're fine or not.

Ya it also gives them 'pressure' because I will be jealous about them always prioritised other friends than me. I hate being the initiative one all the time, so I just stop contacting them. They are totally fine without me. I now only talk to my few internet friends who also contact me often.

I have no one to talk to or tell my problems to for the past 4 years. Everyone said you should learn to enjoy your own company.

Well guess what ? I've been in my company for 4 years and I'm kind of getting sick of it.

No one responds to my texts, no one calls me anywhere. Sometimes I'd wake up hoping at least someone would text me first just for once.

I always tell myself ""don't message.. If they want you, they'll message you..""

And I just sit there, staring at my phone, waiting for the notifications that never appear, to appear.

And then I get so down, wanting to talk to people but yet knowing they don't want to talk to me. So I end up having to message them, just so I'm not torturing myself waiting for something.

I don't know what to do. It's just everything in my life goes wrong everyday and I try to fight back not have a breakdown but I have been pushing down things for so long and it has been eating me up from the inside.

545,t6bnox,[deleted],"My closest friend who is also my FWB is studying abroad and has been gone since January. Not a long time but god I miss him so much. I just don't click with anybody else like I do with him and nobody has ever made an effort to make me feel like I'm worthy of love and attention like he does. It hurts when he's away because I genuinely love him, whether that's platonic or whatever it is. Love isn't just one thing.

I'm feeling so down bad though because one of the things I notice most about him is the way he smells, which is SO WEIRD to say but he knows; and it isn't really like this for me with anyone else, it's just him; he just smells very nice and it's hard not to notice it being around him. I noticed it literally the first night we met/hooked up, I just thought it was a cologne or something at first. But it's just him. And I literally told him that I miss his smell lmfao. I know he won't think it's weird because he knows what I mean but god do I still feel odd.

I just miss cuddling with him so bad, more than I miss sexuality. I find myself daydreaming about just laying down with him, popping on youtube, and cuddling. He's the only person I've ever truly enjoyed watching things with, and I just want the simple connection so badly. 

I'm trying so hard to move into my own place before he comes back so that we can be in a private place again. He lives with his parents when not in school and I temporarily moved in with a sibling recently because of a really shitty scenario. But I so badly wish that I was just done with the messy stuff already. There's so much, I'm so anxious, I have stuff going on, I need a car, I need a place, I need medicine, I need money, I need a therapist— so many more things and it's just too much.

I feel like at 20, I've already been beaten down so hard, treated like shit, gaslit, manipulated, lied to, discriminated against, traumatized. It just feels like shit when I talk about my really bad issues, whether they be mental or physical, and people tell me that it'll only get worse.

Another thing is that I pretty much have chronic back pain; I had a spinal transfusion in 2016 to correct scoliosis but I feel as if my back will never be the same. Standing or sitting in the same position for more than 5 minutes can hurt like hell. Sometimes I sit up in bed for the first time in the day and my back hurts so badly that I just want to forget trying. I need to work and I need money but even a measly 6-hour shift today ended with my neck aching and my back the same. I often describe the pain to people by saying that it feels like somebody heated a knife up to 300 degrees before plunging it through the middle of my spine. And I say offhandedly that I'm hurting or need medicine and others (who are often 5 or less years older than me) like to say that it will only get worse. It's just... disheartening.

I'm lonely and sad and hurting, and I want my friend back. He treats me like me. He doesn't treat me like glass but he pays attention to what I need and I try to do the same in return. 

I just want it to be June, but I worry that my future won't be what I want. I sent in a hopeful application to the best possible apartment for my situation literally today and I'm so worried that the wait list is too long or that they'll just deny me.

563,t6di3w,imdumb-butt,"Hi, All throughout high school I was the quiet kid. I never had many friends and to put in simple terms I was a loner. Last year was my first year of uni which was spent in lockdown so I made a total of zero friends. This year however everything in Australia is open. So two days ago our uni had this orientation day where we got to meet people and join clubs. I really put in a lot of effort on this day, I approached random people and started talking to them which bare in mind is very unlike me. I talked to at least 10 people, The next day I messaged a few of them on Instagram and none of them have replied. Now I did give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they’re busy or what not but that’s hard to believe over a span of 2 days. This has really taken a toll on my self confidence, it took me a lot of courage to do what I did only for it go this way. Honestly I don’t think there was a problem with my behaviour at all, I was really nice and they were nice too in the moment. I really don’t know what the problem is here. I’m just so sick and tired of being lonely",2022-03-04 07:26:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1522633284,7,/r/lonely/comments/t6di3w/am_i_destined_to_be_forever_alone/,,0,6,Am I destined to be forever alone?

Emotionally my headspace is a mess

I look around my room is a goddamn mess a pigsty 

I look in the mirror I’m a mess,


My diet is a mess

My motivation and goals are a mess

I keep messing up my ambition to write my book and read other books 

My bed is a mess I sleep in the same spot so much the damn springs gave up.

I’m such a mess where I can’t motivate myself to save the money, clean my room to get a new mattress.

I don’t sleep with sheets,

I have like 4-5 pillows cause they all need to be replaced they don’t have pillow cases

My closets a mess I rarely hang my clothes I just do my laundry and leave it in a basket/bag then as they get dirty toss them in the corner of my room until laundry 


I’m such a mess I’m to embarrassed to talk about my problems and feelings.

I’m such a mess I still can’t get over a girl that rejected me. And yes no means no I haven’t made any moves but it’s like the feelings are still there


And on that topic and I’m such a fucking mess that I want someone to love me a woman to love and be companion with meanwhile I can’t love myself.


It feels like no amount of cleaner or soap or scrubbing can clean up the mess that is me.

580,t6g03b,dazed_aaand_confused,"Yesterday I read a couple of posts on this subreddit. It's worrisome but also a little bit encouraging (in a bad way I guess) to know that I'm not alone in this struggle. For two years I have soldiered through this lonesome corona pandemic journey but I have finally also gotten to the point of despair! Over the past two years, a lot has happened in my life that should probably create some sort of joy but it does not excite me any longer because I have nobody to share it with. I'm a 38 year old male, above average looking, empathetic, caring, heaps of interests and hobbies, but probably come over as a little bit naive. Perhaps this is why I'm still alone because people usually drag me along as a plan B and ultimately ghost me when they've found their plan A. I have seen the worst in me getting activated where I have gone from a kind, loving and talkative person, to a stand-off-ish, skeptical, and anxiety-ridden ball of mess in social interactions, well the very few social interactions that I did have over the past two years. Hence, I have not found love in my adult life, well once in my late 20's sort of but it didn't work out and she is now married, we still text every now and then but it's ultimately just a sad reminder of what I had lost. During the past two years, I have moved countries in the middle of the pandemic e.g. from South Africa to the Netherlands, excited for my new life and to get back into a new dating pool but almost two years later, I have not had a single date and perhaps not even five matches which rapidly either went radio silent or concluded in a non-match (from their end) due to me not wanting to have children. I have tried so many ways to sell myself, but I have not had any success at all. During this corona pandemic my friends and family drained my cup completely with requests for financial and emotional support, masking the latter as ""we're worried about you"" but in the end it was themselves they were worried about, needed help and as soon as they were ok, they left me for dead. I have two sisters and a mother, my father passed away when I was very young and his part of the extended family rejected us completely at that point, and my mom's side is a bunch of drunkards and gamblers, hence I have literally only three people I call family. My mother is always ""too busy"" to talk when I'm not working but calls me during office hours and expect me to always pick up and make time for her right there and then, when I don't she plays emotional games to alter my behavior. BTW, she is retired and have the world's time available. My little sister also struggles with the same challenges as I do because she is also an expat in another country. This is perhaps one of the very few (sort-of) healthy relationships I have right now but it's not a relationship I can rely on due to her work situation e.g. works 7 days a week and always on call for some important people in the middle east, basically modern-day paid slavery, hahaha. My middle sister is always ""too busy"" and I have not spoken to her for over three months and even then it was merely the socially acceptable Merry Christmas conversation, nothing of real value for where I find myself right now. Also, during this corona pandemic one of my prior love interests back in my home country rekindled the flame online. This was a significant meeting in my life, one of the two people I have ever met where I knew from the very first moment we saw each other that this is one of those significant life-changing moments. The situation rapidly developed to a point where I offered her to visit me for the maximum stay time on a tourist visa, let's see how it goes and take it from there, no cost to her and her life effectively could go on undisturbed due to the work from home situation. She drained my cup to rebuild her self-esteem after her divorce and the backtracking this has ensued in her life, she then finalized some long-standing issues in her own life, and just moved on to a new relationship. A couple of months later after this development, I left her a happy birthday message on Facebook, she contacted me again shortly thereafter informing that her previous relationship didn't work out and we went around the block two more times e.g. what could be, and then I offer yet again, and to this day still waiting for an answer on my last offer. In the meantime, over the past two years I have been swiping away on Facebook Dating, Tinder, Happn, Inner Circle and Bumble. I have tried super complete profiles, incomplete profiles, direct narrative, mysterious narrative, lots of photos, few photos, writing my profile in English or Dutch or both, yet I have had no luck in all my efforts. I live in a city with lots of singles (well, according to the dating apps) but yet I'm so lonely and not being able to even engage in a single encounter. My friends in the Netherlands (mostly fellow South Africans) all have families, so I'm waaaaay down on their priority list to the point where I am doubting all of my decisions the past two years, these were the same people that said yeah man pull the trigger, your life will be so much better, we'll help you out with a soft landing, and it would be great to have more of our own culture's people to interact with. So far I have done 99% of everything myself, even the stuff that requires more than one person e.g. moving stuff one centimeter at a time. Even the people I confessed to about my loneliness and anxiety situation rarely answer my calls, they leave messages either completely unanswered or at best answer them half a day or later. I realize to them it's just a 10 second ""do or do not"" and they turn back to their family and go on with life, but to me it's another hour of solitary existence where I just desperately need to talk to anybody because the most intense conversation I have had was with Google Assistant! I have bought a house, invited many people to show them my house and to join for a barbecue, but everybody always have some of sort of other thing to do. The one time I invited friends of mine almost two weeks ahead of time to make sure that we arrange well in advance, I was flexible on day and time, and even weekend, but yet they declined. A couple of days later I received an invitation to visit them instead. So why not my house then? This is not a singular occurrence, people constantly wedge me into where they feel like, at their convenience and always at my ultimate cost. Over the past two years,  I got the feeling that because I'm single, people take my time and effort for granted because I'm single and ""always available"" yet nobody ever does the same for me. I'm so fed up with people, supposed friends and family that should care for me. It's the same people who share these goody-two-shoe posts on Facebook about looking out for your fellow human, well here I am! This is me struggling! This is your opportunity to lend a helping hand! People often tell me to just go take a trip, take a vitamin, focus on my home projects etc. For what? For who? It does not matter if I paint that wall right now or in three years time. Nobody else will see it, and I honestly am at the point that I really don't care about something as menial as an unpainted wall. I don't need a vitamin! I don't need to take a trip alone! I need a friend! I need someone who I can rely on! I need someone who I can share the good things of my life with. Honestly, this post may sketch me as a negative person, I really am not but after going through this experience alone for two years with all the subtle abuse of my goodheartedness, it's really hard to ignore the not-so-great things about being human right now. I sincerely hope that somewhere close by there is someone I have not yet met that also has this massive desire for friendship and love.

Oh glad to hear it, me too. Anyways have a good one"". It's like no one cares to talk or has a motive in their mind to engage with me, or even consider it. 

Or it could just be in my head lol, but I'm just done with that really, or at least I hope I am.

Also, I have seen the demerits of unfair relationships and frankly, most of the relationships are built on one side putting up with the assertive side.  Funny enough, those who preach the importance of having friends are the ones who end up exploiting others.  If you are a Taker, for sure relationship must be vital, but I am a loner who does not use people.  I rather like myself and wish that other loners with a soft heart feel good about their independent status.

594,t6jzii,LmKidPrime,"Let's start by saying that I have ""friends"" but none of them is really someone I really care about, I appreciate their company but they feel like a distraction more than anything else. I feel guilty for saying this but everytime I meet someone new I almost resent them because I can't find someone like me. Not that I'm special or anyting, but nobody I know really tries to undersand me or create a deeper connection with me. I know that I should feel fortunate just because I have at least someone who I can interact with, but everytime I play with them, talk to them or even be near them I just feel empty, like if I were talking to bots and not people. I'm certainly asking too much of them, I know people got their shit to deal with and I don't think they'll just stop for me just to help me fell more ""appreciated"". So I tried dating to maybe find someone that can at least try to love me more than my friend could. Eventually I found someone who was crazy enough to actually like a neurotic and sometime cynical person like me. I finally found someone who tried to understand me and even if she was a bit problematic herself we were getting along very well (maybe too well). This girl became almost an obsession, every time she called me or texed me I felt a type of euphoria that I would have never thought I would feel, I even started dreaming about her (something I still do unfortunately). One of the reason for my incontrollable infatuation was the fact that I struggled with depression and anxiety in the past which lead me to seclud myself from everyone, this means my experience with her was unprecedented. But here's the catch: she was too overloaded with work and university so she told me that with her current life problems she can't really have a steady relationship. This lead to a fairly cold friendzone that ended with almost complete silence.
Right now I feel lonelier than ever, I have no motivation to do anyting, I usually stay in bed eating McDonald's (probably the saddest thing I've done in my life).
Ever felt this feeling of pure nothingness mixed with self-contempt? Well, know I do.
If it wasn't for my cat I'd probably go crazy, at the moment she is the only thing I care about.
So yeah, I guess I might join the club and feel hopefully a little less miserable.

Live each day as if it's your last', that was the conventional advice, but really, who had the energy for that? What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy? It just wasn't practical. Better by far to simply try and be good and courageous and bold and to make a difference. Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you. Go out there with your passion and your electric typewriter and work hard at...something. Change lives through art maybe. Cherish your friends, stay true to your principles, live passionately and fully and well. Experience new things. Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance.

“Go out and meet people"": yea covid... Can't do much about it

“It will get better soon"": Really? Do you have any proof? Because I have been waiting for a year and nothing changed

“Work harder the next semester"": I studied until I got 3 hours of sleep a day and still am barely scrapping by...

“Maybe you chose the wrong study"": Glad to hear my decision for the next 3 years will be wrong, even though it was the perfect course of study for me

“People have their strengths and weaknesses, maybe you just aren't good in (insert topic:__)"": That's true, I agree but I used to be good at it and now not anymore because my brain is a fuzz and everyday is a misery

“Go and hookup with people"": I cannot bring myself to do it, I do have people in mind and people happy to do it but I don't feel comfortable and it doesn't feel correct

“Your partner will come in the future"": Yea 1 year? 10 years? 20? How much longer?

“I am here, you can talk to me"": Yea and you take 2 weeks to respond to my text, how do you think that makes me feel?

“Get closer with your current friends"": You mean the narcissistic, delusional and toxic friends? Idk if that's a good idea

“Man up"": Thanks buddy, next thing you are gonna tell me is to drink 8 cups of water a day...

“Keep going king, you will get there"": Yes although it's nice to hear, it doesn't really do much to me in the long run

“Find a new hobby"": My hobby involves books or soccer which none of my friends do, I already lost interest in everything

Those are the most common and frequent topics I run into and everytime I ask for help I get the same answer. I feel like I'm trapped and can't find a way to make myself happy.

As I was cleaning up in my room a little I was going through my drawers and a picture of ex gf fell out. The back of the picture said ""Love you always"".

625,t6pxq7,Skipverse,"In 2016 I started collage at 17 (UK) and was relatively alone for about a year till I became friends with a group of people in the second year of our course that I'm still close with now, they're technically my only friends as I never got along with anyone in school. I hung out with them for a bit in the first year but had a small falling out that we all realised was stupid and got along again. Towards the end of 2018, we left for uni. But while I went to one uni, they all went to the same one elsewhere and got a shared house together. I was initially upset about it as I didn't want to drift apart from what felt like genuine friends which thankfully we didn't, to help myself feel better, I'd remind myself I'd make friends in uni so I thought it'll be fine.

I did get along with some guys in my uni course, we went out every now and then to the same club each time or in one of their flats for a few drinks but never did anything much more than that. But by the time the second year came around, they got a shared flat together and after a few months, just stopped talking to me, stop inviting me over/out and kicked me out of the group chat and I still don't know why. So for the most part of uni, I just spent my time in my room while they were all hanging out daily.

Throughout this time, I'd still be talking to the guys from collage on Discord, we'd go on to play games and such every now and then. But every time we do, I'd always hear about all the stuff they get up to and it started to really get to me. They were taking a gap year in 2020 so we made loads of plans to do stuff as they were coming home near me, then covid happened lmao.

They're currently doing their final year, while I'm now living with parents working in a shitty factory making and packing fire alarms. And every single day, all I can think about is how much I missed out on all that they've all done together and I get so fucking angry, stressed and depressed cause it just plays on loop in my head every single day. They're always telling me stories about how drunk they got at a party, how fun the clubs are near then or how high they accidently got of edibles etc and I just can't fucking stand it anymore.

I'm so fucking angry at myself for not going to the same uni as them plus I seriously regret the course I pick and wished I done something else so that doesn't help either. Now I get so frustrated and stressed every time I think about it, so I just smoke weed daily and just sit in my room watching crap online or something.

Every time I spend time with my “friends” I just feel like I don’t belong there. I do get invited somewhere sometimes, but most of the time they start talking about things they only know between each other and their inside jokes, which makes me feel really uncomfortable and also the fact that it made me realize that they don’t tell me barely anything anymore.

Apart from that they barely ask anything about me, they know nothing about my life or how I am feeling. Last year, when I was down and there was clearly a huge change in my behavior, somehow almost none of my friends even bothered to know what was wrong with me.

I’ve already tried getting close to my 2 old best friends again, but it just doesn’t seem to work. One of them even seems like she doesn’t even wanna talk to me. I’m tired of being the one people put aside and I’m tired of people not caring about my feelings.

I had 3 months of holidays, none of my friends even bothered to text me, only one of them. Also when I texted one of my friends, I asked her to hang out twice only for her to decline it and never text me again, and that’s why I think she doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore.

Idk what I did but they just stopped texting me after graduation. I have no friends I feel so alone all the time. The worst part is I don’t feel like making friends anymore. I don’t want to put in that effort again.

There’s a girl I really like. I hangout with her a lot. We can talk for a long time. I feel like she actually understands me, and I can relate with her. I’ve never really had that. I’ve completely fallen for her, but I’m 99% sure I’m nothing more than a friend to her. It crushes my soul. I want to be with her more than anything, but it’ll never work. Even if she likes me back she’s leaving town anyway. In a different life maybe we would have a chance.

I used to be suicidal until I moved back home and met my crush. But I’m starting to feel myself fall into that dark pit again. I’m looking into that void again and I want to jump. The loneliness I feel now is worse than ever. The fact that I have no friends and she can’t be with me gives me actual physical pain. I can’t describe it it’s just soul crushing, and frustrating. The anxiety and stress I have just thinking of her makes me actually weak and sick. Idk what to do I wish that I couldn’t feel emotions. After this is all over I don’t want friends or relationships I want to be on my own.

644,t6siqm,Even-Cost5617,"Hello everyone. (throwaway because of embarrassment)

I, like many here, am lonely, and I suffer from many of the consequences of loneliness. I have recently stopped masturbating, which I hope will start to alleviate some of my problems and feelings of low self worth, no confidence, and feeling like I will never find anyone, etc.

While that is an ongoing process, I seek advice on a relationship, and I believe that many people here will be able to sympathize with me. I tend to get over attached to women that I meet. If I start to communicate with them on a regular basis it doesn't take long before I am somewhat obsessed with talking to them. I am fully aware that it is not a good trait to have to pursue romantic relationships, and much of the time I feel this way, I will either (painfully) stop communicating with them, or they will first.

Lately I feel like my life has been going fairly well, and I'm enjoying living and breathing everyday, but I have found myself getting attached to a woman. I've only known her for a few months, but I enjoy seeing her during the day, and patiently wait on my phone for her to respond to texts. I really wish that I didn't act like this. It makes me feel extremely pathetic, and I don't even necessarily want to pursue a romantic relationship with her. I do however want to either stop communicating with her entirely, or let her know that I have developed some kind of romantic feelings for her and tell her I don't want to hang out with her anymore. I would much rather be honest about my feelings, but I would feel like an absolute loser having to tell someone I don't want to hangout with them anymore because I get addicted to being around them and texting them. 

Hopefully someone here can tell me to get my head out of my ass, or at the very least, sympathize with my predicament.",2022-03-04 20:46:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646425538,11,/r/lonely/comments/t6siqm/advice_m19/,,0,4,Advice (M19)

All of us have different goals and dreams, so I knew that there was no way I could delay something that was going to happen anyway. And I tried to not feel sad about the fact that all of them were moving to another countries to start the new phase of their life. But I couldn’t help it, I still felt like I was losing the few people outside my family that understood me and that I knew I could trust with all my soul. They were my safe place and the ones who saved me from my lonely life as a teenager. And I had to lose that safe place.

Even though we get along really well and everything goes fine, they just ghost me after a couple of meets, it really hurts and has been screwing up my confidence.

Until I met this guy, who had also moved here from my country, we had a lot in common and had an amazing first date. We met again a few times and everything went well, until he also started being distance. I had grown very fond of him, and it fell really painful. I forced myself to stop thinking about him and a few weeks later was feeling ok. However he contacted me again and asked to meet, and everything I had pushed down came gushing back up. I did agree to meet, and confronted him about why he was not being responsive all these days. He said he was busy with work and couldn't find time. We did have a wonderful time, dinner, a long walk, and a nice conversation in bed. But again after that he went back to ignoring me, any response he gave me felt forced.

682,t6xs9j,Active_Yak3806,"so a bit of background, im in highschool and i have a group of guys that i always hang out with. we skateboard and spend nights together all the time like brothers. were like a little family sometimes. i love these guys. 

well today i found out they really dont care too much for me.

basically i argued with one guy (ill call him J) about how i felt bad that he and the others pressured our friend with a car (ill call him E) to hang out so much because most of us dont have cars. well firstly i just brought it up but J took it as a personal attack and got upset with me. then i checked in on E to make sure he was ok with everyone asking him to take them everywhere all the time and he said he was fine. (E is my best friend since kindergarten) well i check out of school because fuck it its friday and i dont want to deal with the drama later, and one OTHER guy texts me while im sitting at home (well call this one T) and tells me that im always starting group drama and that everyone actually just hates how i act anyways. he just started telling me all sorts of shit like i make everyone uncomfortable or im a general ass. also apparently E is mad at me over something his girlfriend said about me (that i have no clue about i really have no idea what ive done to her) basically its all just highschool drama between dudes. i feel like im in a group of girls, not to mention if T isnt just talking out of spite no one really cares for me anyways. 

so i cant deny it or get mad because wtf am i supposed to do? im not gonna bend my entire personality to some guys in highschool. i understand they have issues with me but they could have told me sooner instead of using it as ammunition to shit on me on a bad day. theyve not been good to me. even if this shit gets resolved im not sure i wanna go back because this shit has happened before and its such a drag. plus if im really THAT unpleasant to be around id rather be alone. 

i guess the part that makes this the worst is that these are my only friends. i already didnt trust some of the others i didn't mention but now theyre ALL against me. my best friend is mad at me and will probably just follow the herd. im not sure if i can even consider them good friends to me. so every connection i made at this dumb fucking school was for nothing. everyone has left me over some petty group drama that should be reserved for middle school girls and also apparently they dont like me normally too. im completely alone. i have lost all my friends. im sitting here alone while they're all skating just wondering how i got here. how i lost my best friend to a bunch of people using him for his car. im not really sure how to be on my own. i already got dumped by my ex at the start of the year and ghosted by a girl in the middle of february. it really just feels like people genuinely do not want to be around me. i try very hard not to be a bad, generally unlikable person but it feels like no matter what i do i am not a right fit for people and ill just continue to argue or be alone. maybe the bad parts of me completely outweigh the good parts and people just dont wanna put in the time to talk to me anymore. i dont know. im wondering if i should even put effort into thinking about it or just prepare to go through highschool alone. i know damn well if i didnt text first no one would talk to me. i always check up on people and help them when theyre down but they still come back and tell me im not a good person. maybe i really just am not good by nature no matter how hard i try and fight it. i cant even tell if im a victim of bad luck or my own actions and consequences that im too dumb to understand. 

but all that is basically irrelevant because right now, im alone. completely and utterly alone in my room.",2022-03-05 01:03:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1640625189,4,/r/lonely/comments/t6xs9j/i_think_i_just_lost_all_my_friends_in_one_day/,,0,7,i think i just lost all my friends in one day

There are times when I fantasize about having a relationship, someone in my arms, and I've dreamt of having a daughter with some unlucky woman lol.

Anyway, so I finally meet someone who is my type, she's nice, funny, and get along with her. We share a lot of the same ideas and talked about visit each other (different continents / long distance)... And then...

Poof.

No more feelings on my side.

Like completely drained.

I realize that I'm the problem here, that I'm the reason why I have no friends, that my coworkers don't have me in the group texts, but I'm usually not rude or anything.

Just lose the motivation to live.

So anyway, I realize now that I hate my life and it's my fault that it's empty. That I always feel empty. Have to struggle in the mornings to find the motivation to do something when it isn't a work day.

If it wasn't for work, I'd feel like I'd revert to how I was when I was homeless. Just a hopeless guy, blah blah.

Just feel so disconnected with life. Disconnected from people, environment... Things in general.

It sounds weird, but I genuinely used to be a nice person, but somethings changed

I just don’t have the energy for fake or rude people anymore. It’s like I only know how to be upfront and honest with people anymore. It feels exhausting to keep pretending and putting on a fake happy  face. I just don’t care what people think of me these days. I feel like I’m done trying to protect other people’s feelings. I don’t feel the need to sensitize my words…which leads to some lonely days. I mean VERY lonely days.

I don’t know if this has something to do with it, but I think my hormones are out of control. I’m a 23 year old male, and have NEVER felt this aggressive until recently. I’m always on defense. Always prepared to snap at someone if they’re mean to me.

731,t71maj,throwaway-4894urji,"Hello fellows Redditors. I guess I just needed some place to rant and just be heard but I just feel super lonely. I didn't really make a lot of friends in high school and I started college two years ago. I didn't meet a lot of people because of the pandemic and my first year was entirely online, and it's super hard to make strong connections with people during online lectures. 

Anyways, I met four people during a class project in first year, and we've been friends ever since. We were planning on living together for the upcoming year, but it ended up so that they were living together, and I'm on my own. And I just feel so left out of everything. They have a bunch of inside jokes, they share stories and stuff with each other that I know nothing about, and they all go out together as well. It sucks that I feel left out of the only friends I feel I've made so far in college. 

On the other hand, I feel like my friendship with my best friend since middle school is fading away. We don't talk as much as we used to and I feel that I put more effort into our friendship. She leaves me on read most of the time, and it's just not the same vibe we used to have. 

School has been really stressful lately and I feel like I'm completely on my own, and it makes me feel terrible. Everyone seems to have someone, except for me. 

Anyways, that's all I wanted to share. I made a throwaway account and I already forgot the password (LOL), so I probably won't be logging in. But thank you to everyone who responds and making me feel heard.

772,t74cch,[deleted],"There have been some points in my life where I’ve had zero to a lot of friends throughout the years. It has surprised me how life can change that quickly for me. I’ve had friends come and go, but a lot of past “friends” either turned out to be flaky, toxic, backstabbing, or just too busy with something else if they’re not that bad people. Or, I had the realization that some have simply just been acquaintances this entire time and not really considered friends.

I think friends shouldn’t be the number one priority in life because building your career, focusing on your hobbies and growing as a person are more important. Either way, I think that the most important thing in life is not to see everything as a number’s game. What you see on social media might make people feel like they’re not cool enough or that they are losers if they don’t have a bunch of friends they can take photos with at cool locations. You might worry that photos won’t get as much likes and that others will think your posts are boring/uncool. But it shouldn’t determine your worth.

Some people currently in my college have been upset about all the drama happening within their friend groups, have been acting very reckless to look cool, and have forgotten about their true identities by putting up façades. Personally, maintaining friendships involves a lot of draining, emotional investment, especially with you having to adhere to a lot of things others want to do just to get validation and approval. It’s harder to maintain friendships more than making them. There might be a few good friends some people have in life, but those are the very rare percentage of people in the world and are very rare to find.

That is why as we grow up, there are less and less people in our lives we’d consider real. Think about how many real people will stay in your life as years and decades pass. Deep down, a lot of people would count their family members and possibly their spouse, but there would be hesitancy for some people to say that even friends will be within that category—whether you currently have any or none right now.

This is why I don’t define myself and my worth based on this, and none of you should either. Forming the right acquaintances as connections, however, is still important throughout your life.",2022-03-05 07:35:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,,34,/r/lonely/comments/t74cch/having_no_friends_doesnt_make_you_uncool_or_a/,,1,21,Having No Friends Doesn’t Make You “Uncool” or a “Loser”

I thought I would feel better after being touched and kissed, but I really don't. I've lost count the amount of my hookups went exactly this way. When will I ever learn?

I just feel anxious the whole time and I’m never being myself in those interactions. I feel like Im only ever being myself WITH myself. Being alone all the time means you talk to yourself OFTEN. Ig I’ve always done that though. 

Anyway, I’m incredibly lonely but I think I prefer it. People are too scary, too judgmental. I judge myself but at least my thoughts are safe with me.

I guess I don’t have any questions or profound statements to make, just wondering if anyone feels the same? Feeling this way about life and myself is the only time I have really felt alone. Everyone around me is an extroverted, sex-having, socially adept, person. Even the people I know who are introverted still find themselves in relationships and able to be vulnerable in that way. Maybe thats a part of something bigger for me.

But anyway, if you read this far, thank you. I’m sorry it’s so long. But you’re reading me when you’re reading this. Never shared this but it feels safe here.

I am interested in a relationship with one of my friends.

This made me reflect on what I'm looking for. After talking to some people about it, I'm in a crisis over what exactly I want. I don't want to think of a relationship as being defined by sex.

Basically, I don't know if a relationship (to me), is just a close friendship with more physical intimacy, and maybe some level of exclusivity. I develop very intimate friendships with people who I am both attracted to and not. I haven't yet heard people describe a level of emotional connection with their partner that exceeds my openness to my closest friends.

Thinking about my friend who I want to ask out. I know she may be someone I could be very intimate with emotionally. But I also want to be physically intimate, and have the affirming feeling of mutual desire.

Is this a relationship? Wanting to develop a deeper friendship, wanting physical intimacy and the affirming feeling of mutual desire?

851,t7fzhu,erugo,"Hi.

I just found this subreddit, by searching for the name in the search bar. I don't know at what stage you guys do that, but I think a couple of stars aligned in order for me to take this action after not doing it for so long. Or maybe I just liberated myself thanks to some recent personal progress and allowed myself to reach out. This will be a post of reaching out, a public letter to myself, a longish rant that you are free to skip.

\----

I am 28M. I have spent most of my life as an outcast, having difficulty in finding ""my tribe"" -- which I'd describe as a group of people I can emotionally synchronize and share a value hierarchy with, much like how a tribe would gather around a totem pole and do their rituals.

I kept writing and deleting my biography, I don't know how exactly to lay out the problem.

Long story short, I was a kid that was bullied in school, miserable love life from putting girls on pedestals and interacting with their images in my head rather than the girls themselves.

I eventually learned how to adapt to the social norms, even conforming to some extent, and I felt included, for some period of time.

Of course, conditions changed, the balance was restored and broken again. To provide a summary of the rest of my time, Mostly, I was claimed to be charming and charismatic, however unsuccessful with girls due to my fucked up anima relations (for the psychology lovers out there). I had a relationship that ended with trauma on my side and that fucked up my social disposition for the most part. I became more affiliated with the nihilistic, trickster side. When I went to university, things were not much different --  except I socially isolated myself at this time, I got to know people eventually but I did not ever consider myself belonging to any tribe.

Between getting my degree and today, I lived in 3 countries one being my home country, worked at 4 different places, studied at 2 schools. At each of these, I did not have unpleasant interactions necessarily, but I did not ever find people that I would claim to be my tribe.

Obviously, the parameter staying constant in all this was me -- There's something about me that makes it difficult for me to feel included. I'm not sure if I want to completely conform, but I don't feel socially satisfied either.

One obstacle I feel to be blocking me is a sense of ""perfectionism"" when it comes to choosing my interactions. Call it arrogance, but I always feel that there is some kind of insufficiency when it comes to interacting with someone. I don't think I have impossible expectations as I also met people with whom I was much more comfortable interacting, and I was looking forward to more interaction. But in most of my interactions, I am predisposed to remaining unsatisfied and not being able to share a mutual interest into the conversation. It might also be that most conversations start with small talk but I feel uncomfortable doing small talk. I don't know why this is exactly -- I'm not necessarily bad at it, unless I feel extremely unmotivated so I just choose to shut up.

There's also a certain sense of over-analyzing that accompanies my interactions with people -- especially new connections. I spend most of my cognitive load trying to figure out what would be appropriate or not. This was especially true last week, I just started working at a new place where mostly German people work, and my German is not very well -- and it's a completely different culture than what I'd have at home. But maybe this was simply a big challenge and it triggered my past feelings of being a misfit, although I am doing much better in most circles today.

As a result of all my predispositions, I feel that I am actually self-inflicting my loneliness -- I have good adaptation skills and that worked before in the past but I'm not really motivated to use them. At the same time, I feel slightly bitter that I am sometimes marginalized in my social circles. I'm not really blaming anyone for this, as people probably feel a sense of belonging to their tribes and they are skeptical when someone like me comes and remains rather distant. But I can't help it.

\----

I kept writing and deleting more details of my past life, in which I analyzed why I'm at where I am right now. But I decided to keep it to myself, as I couldn't really create an effective and concise public summary of it.

Long story short, I feel excluded, isolated, insignificant most of the time, but I think it's something I'm inflicting on myself. I find it difficult to connect when there's no immediate electricity. Even if there's some, I'm not equipped to put in the effort to sustain that connection.

I wish I could keep my pickiness but more people would pass the filter and feel closer, at the same time I wish my overall relations with the ""general public"" would be more smooth, it doesn't have to be much closer. I wish I felt valued, respected, attractive while not compromising on my independent and non-conformist stance.

That's me. I know the post sounds a little confused and all over the place. I'd say that I know it's not perfect but I still wanted to share.

Despite all my rant, I am here if you feel lonely and want to share. I hope you feel better.",2022-03-05 18:46:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1365536601,11,/r/lonely/comments/t7fzhu/on_tribelessness_pickiness_and_selfinflicted/,,0,4,"On tribelessness, pickiness, and ""self-inflicted"" loneliness"

I'm very messy but I'll try to keep it organized.

I feel like I'm always waiting, when I have free time, I'm bored and can't make myself do anything I used to do for fun, like music, art, video games, watching a show or a movie, and when I'm at work I wait for my shift to end because there's barely any work to do. I live this life where I wake up, work, go home and sleep, I do this for 4 days a week and then I have 3 free days which I use for mostly sleep. I have been suicidal for a few years but it comes and goes, I hate my life, I have no idea how to make friends. I've never had a gf but I always wanted to have such a connection. I've lost all of my confidence in myself when I left my military service (it's mandatory here). My story is too big and messy for me to write here without boring you so I'll try to write it as short as I can.

I was a nerd that was bullied a lot but I still had a few friends. in 8th grade I started losing my connection to society by being not paying attention in school and playing games all day and talking with online friends, I lost the few friends I had but I didn't care at the time. in high school, I've made a few new friends. my parents always wanted me to go to therapy but I always said no because I knew something was wrong but never knew what. after high school I went to the army and started basic training, it was super hard for me, that's when I broke. after a year I left the military because I was suicidal and was in a really bad state, after that covid hit and I was home for a year, and then I started working, after my military service I went to several places of therapy which didn't help like partial hospitalization, I still go to therapy but I don't feel like it really helps.

I lost all my friends but one from school and one from the military, but I barely see them. I have a younger brother which I'm close to but he's in the military so I barely see him too, I only have my parents which I barely talk to and my therapist and my social worker which I see each once a week.

I'm supposed to go to a rehabilitation center in a few months but until then I feel just feel lost and lonely.

Literally every move I make is totally pointless and boring. I used to play guitar and enjoy it, now I lost my technique and panic about how much I wanted to be good. I saw some of my conversations when I was 12yo (20 yo rn) and I could scarcely find two or three chats where I actively tried to have a conversation with people. But now there's no way I could do that because I don't actually feel it. Everytime I feel alone I want to talk to somebody, but then immediately afterwards a relative talks to me and it's like the desire to talk fades away. I'm so fucked up, I'm tired of not feeling any desire at all. Only when I drink coffee, smoke weed or drink I feel like enjoying life, watching movies feels like a waste of time too, videogames as well. I wanted to read ten books last year, read half of two and never ended them, I read zero books. I used to play songs by ear and now I don't even know how to play guitar. Dropped out of engineering. I was so excited to finally beat integral calculus, ended up dropping out after the first week of the quarter. Now I can't even bear to think of telling my dad I dropped out.

I know, but struggle to accept, that I will never find answers, because though lonely and bored I feel, I don't want to have friends, a partner or anything, so advice like ""just go outside"" talk to people, etc. won't help, because those kinds of things I don't care about, but it appears to be such a significant component of human existence that the longer I go without it, as I have done my entire life, the more bored and disillusioned with life I become. If it were by me I would have the part of consciousness that is having me believe socialization is such a good thing, removed or suppressed.

What I'm trying to say is: I don't really care if I spend the rest of my life alone or not, but I'm really fucking bored. Passive entertainment isn't entertaining anymore. I don't want to do anything. I just know I'm bored. I work and that's cool and good but it can only distract me from the void for so long, and when work has me stressed I don't have anything or anyone to hold onto, so all I'm left thinking is: things may get better or worse, but there is no escape or rest, so I can only endure whether I want it or not.

And you know what, I know for a fact even I somehow managed to get friends I would get bored of them or they would get bored of me really fast. People are all carbon-copies of each other and I'm a really superficially boring person with nothing going in my life. 

No one asked me what I thought of all this before I was flung into this situation. Until the age of 16 (when this situation reached the current plateau) I kept looking for answers on the internet but got the same ones again and again, the same exact wording like they just copy-pasted some shit from somewhere or something. The eye-rolling and exasperation was so hard I took intermittent year long breaks and from the internet and all other mediums of entertainment and dived into books, resurfaced without any answers that satisfied me and here I'm, almost 8 years later, without any answers, disillusioned with every current of thought available to me, except for stoicism and even that isn't helping much since I fail to put it into practice all the time.

I just don't know. There is no answer. Nobody knows what is happening. Nothing can be grasped, at least not by anyone I know. Unexplained and incomprehensible events are unfolding and there are no answers, and nobody cares.

And while birthday's are just another day, I don't know - I still always remember theirs, I've done significant things for theirs just using their day as an excuse to do something nice, because I care. Because knowing something I've done would make them happy, is one of the only things left I still get any happiness from. And I don't do it expecting anything in return, but...  


I know a lot of people are struggling with isoloation from COVID, but I've been in isolation for the past 10 years of my life. When I was a teenager my health began to rapidly decline, both mentally and physically. The only human contact I have in the real world is with doctors, or my mother - our relationship is not great, but she's all I seemingly have.  


When I was young and the depression and bipolar were sinking in, I used to wish everyone would just forget me, that it would be easier. I can confidently say that, after a decade of loneliness, sprinkled here and there with online friendships that never last - being truly alone? It's overwhelming.  


I used to play MMO's, the online community of the one I played as a teen into my early 20's raised me. That, combined with the plethora of mental illnesses was not a good thing. The internet can be especially toxic. I eventually got out of that crowd, began to work on myself, try to be a better person. It's difficult when a lot of the time you're not even in control of your own mind, but I still try my best.  


I stopped playing MMO's, I thought it was better that way, less drama. I thought I didn't need to make new friends because I had the few that were ""real"" to still speak to. What these people probably never fully realised is that while they had lives, even if they were introverted, they still had contact with people in the real world, things they could do - however small. For me? They were my world.  


So what do you do when your world forgets you? It doesn't seem to matter what I do, but I'm never enough. I'm just words on a screen, and apparently not even words anybody likes. I'm just a passing interest that never goes anywhere, while people visit for awhile before moving on. I just wish that I was better, that I was good enough to hold interest, that someone wanted to be around me as much as I them. That someone cared, or wanted me to smile.  


I wish I was angry, that I cared enough about myself, but I don't. How can I expect anyone to be friends with me, when I wish I was anyone else? I used to plan on doing things ""when I get better"", but a decade later... I don't think there's going to be an ""I got better"".",2022-03-06 00:49:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630618817,6,/r/lonely/comments/t7n6pr/last_week_was_my_birthday/,,0,0,Last week was my Birthday

911,t7ni31,Flyaway_5,"I remember when I was in a class in college and we had this group project. I was put in a group with this guy and gal. We then discussed the project and the guy asked the girl if we can set up a day and time to meet and practice all day. She freaked out and started screaming for 15 minutes and said, ""PRACTICE ALL DAY? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I don't have time to be practicing all day! I have other things to do! Practicing for an hour is fine, but to PRACTICE ALL DAY? FOR ONE CLASS? FOR ONE PROJECT?"" She was so mad and bolted out of the room and drank some water to calm down.

I also felt like she was rude to me too. I was showing her something for the project, and she didn't seem interested or even looked at the paper I was showing her. Also within that short moment that we met,she could tell right away that I was quiet and pointed out that she didn't like it. She said, ""But you are quiet..."" and frowned.

Then the day came for us to practice, I met with the guy and we were both waiting for her. She didn't show up at all. She texted us and said her car was having problems and that she was at the mechanics. I think that was some BS excuse she made so that she wouldn't have to meet with us and spend time practicing with us. She made it to class every day, even presentation day, but couldn't make it to practice?

I'm not saying that she didn't deliver when the presentation was due, because she did goooooood. She had everything memorized for her part. She performed better than the both of us, and she didn't even need to practice with us at all. She presented first, then me, then the guy. The professor even told us that the quality of the presentation was great at the beginning then it deteriorated. She didn't show up to practice but she did communicate through texts and e-mailed us her PowerPoint slides.

Even though she didn't need to practice with us since she did better than us, and seemed irritated by the guy saying that we need to practice all day, I still felt like she could have had a little patience and not overreact the way she did, and also have the decency to show up and practice and not flake out on us. About her car having problems, was that a lie so that she wouldn't have to meet us and deal with us? Was she being rude by lying about car issues and also overreacting when he asked to practice all day?",2022-03-06 01:06:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601518649,4,/r/lonely/comments/t7ni31/was_she_being_rude/,,0,4,Was she being rude?

935,t7q5ri,127pharaway,"I've always been a person with a lot of friends. Growing up and in my early 20s I was the girl who always had plans, always had people over, and was always busy. I never had trouble making friends. This is... no longer the case. 

I was with my ex for three years, we had a good social life and lots of mutual friends. We broke up and the friends sort of stuck with him, that's okay, most of them knew him first and I had my own friends! 

Then things just started getting worse. My best friend moved overseas because she could make more money abroad. And she was my connection to a wider group of acquaintances, of whom I now never see.

Then my other best friend, who was living with me, moved to a different city with her boyfriend. Another link to a wider group if aquitences I no longer really see. 

All while covid happens in the background. There haven't been gigs or events happening consistently in my city for a long time, most of the friends I was starting to make before things started getting crazy kind of fizzled out. I moved to this city from my hometown not long before covid took over.

I have been working from home for 7 months now and I hate it. I miss seeing people everyday, and being social. Even though I never really managed to make real friends at work, I got on with everyone just fine and I suppose it filled the void of real friendship that I was lacking in my personal life. 

I've never felt so lonely. I cry every single morning because I know it's another day alone. I've done all the things you're supposed to do, I reach out to anyone and everyone and nobody is keen to hang out, or they're busy. I've joined groups, classes, anything you can think of to make friends nothing has worked. I've gone to things alone and tried to strike up converstion and nothing. Then if something does go well, covid pops up again and everything is canceled. 

So in my loneliness I've started using people. Using my ex who I know wants to get back together just for company. Which i know is making his life worse. But he's the only person who ever picks up the phone. I can see the pain in his eyes whenever I go to hang up. And I know I'm using him, I know I'm so selfish, but I just can't do another weekend all by myself. I feel beyond terrible. He's a good person and I'm using him for company with zero intention of getting back together. Leading him on so I'm not lonely. Sometimes I let him think there's a chance, just so he'll stick around. 

I was in a car accident last week and realized I had nobody to call. Nobody to even tell about it. I cried the whole night not even because my car is messed up, or because I was scared, because there wasn't even a single soul I could tell that I was scared. That I thought I was going to die, and that nobody would notice, that it wouldn't be a huge loss to the world because I don't really know anybody. 
So I called him again, used him to make myself feel better then dipped. As usual. 

I heard he was seeing a new girl and called it off because he couldn't figure out his feelings for me. I am actively making this man's life worse simply because I can't figure out how to make a friend. 

I hate living like this. I hate being alone, the only communication I have with humans is about an hour a day during my daily work meeting. I feel awful, I feel like a bad person, and I just needed to vent.

948,t7rt6h,Revolver-Knight,"So tonight my coworker (who I still kinda have a crush on) lost her wallet so she couldn’t drive and her mom was busy so I offered to give her a ride home.

So I want to make this clear I did not offer to make her like me. I did it cause I believe in doing good to those who do good to you.

I had already asked her out in January but she said no which I respected and just didn’t attempt to flirt or take it any further 

So anyway I pick her up and we talk bout eachothers days and then she was telling me about what it’s like closing the store for the night.

Then she was telling me about this cashier she works with asked her how she was getting home.

Then she mentioned me  then the cashier teased her about Her and Me 

Then the cashier apparently said “I’ve seen you Y’all cute”

Anyway my coworker she laughed it off talking about how the cashier is just childish and like still in the 1st grade.


So I kinda just awkwardly laughed along and I dunno it was kinda like I got like stabbed in the heart like literally my chest just felt heavy and compressed.


So I drop her off she says thank you 

I’m just so like confused and just a bit upset like I got lost trying to find my way out which I shouldn’t get lost cause my dad lives like 2 blocks away


Then like on the way back home to my moms like I’m just talking to myself and I’m just speaking out loud like 

“God why do you hate me” then I’m just pissed more at myself and I’m like “why am I just venting outloud to no one in my car and complaining about god whom lives in the sky and controls peoples destiny when it’s such a role flip compared to my belief in freewill and choice.”


As I lay on my bed just I’m just wanna know why do I care so much why does my chest hurt I asked her she said no I should move on and got over it a long time ago but nooooooo!!",2022-03-06 05:21:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1553318416,0,/r/lonely/comments/t7rt6h/why_do_i_care_so_much/,,0,7,Why do I care so much.

She helped me realize things about myself and made me feel things I never felt before.
She always made me so happy, I wanted to wake up and I wanted to live to talk to her. I finally felt alive for once!
Then she started saying more out of pocket and weird stuff, peaking with her saying pedo shit about my 12-year-old-brother.
I wanted to ask her if she'd actually do it or not, and I was intending to cut contact and run if she said yes, but she blocked me first.

This outline means everything to the projection of myself that’s trapped in my mind. When I’m feeling lonely, which is pretty much always, I think of the man who has been built from many essences. All I want is for him to materialize next to me and comfort me. “Don’t worry, I’m here.” But he never will. He will stay a rough draft, tucked away in the corners of my mind. Only appearing when I desperately need company. Never comforting me, only my projection. And I’m jealous. I’m jealous of the things my other self gets to feel, touch and smell. Sometimes it seems she is laughing at me; antagonizing me. She knows I will never get to experience the love I create for her. My one comfort is tainted by torment and mockery. I can’t escape reality, and I can’t escape my dream world. I’m really stuck, aren’t I? Maybe one day my rough draft will come to life, with open arms ready to breathe me in.

But one part of me is still empty and it hurts. I posted about you before, how I think we love each other but the timing is wrong. You feel like the missing part that’ll make me so overwhelmingly happy it’d be felt everywhere. 

We’re both trying dating and somehow none of the dates/people are working out. But the last time we were together (and this was platonic) it felt like magic. The playful flirting is there, the constant invites to your place (even though we live 8 hours apart), running away and living on some island together, wanting to use any free time to come visit (or vice versa). I want this, and I hope I haven’t misread you.

And this is how I’ve been both the happiest I’ve been in months, yet the loneliest. So lonely it physically hurts. So lonely I visually get excited when you text me. Now if I only could hear your voice. But we both hate talking on the phone so I get it, yet you also want to FaceTime so maybe.

I know I might be irrelevant but, I’m a freshmen in high school and I like this girl on my bus. Your probly thinking so simple right just talk to her, except I have social anxiety. Every time I force myself to sit around her on the bus i literally try so hard to but like my mouth just has a mind of its own and just won’t talk. Then when I overthink it it’s too late, she’ll fall asleep or we’ll arrive at the school or her friend sits next to her and starts babbling on. We make 2-4 second eye contact a lot but nothing more and when I see her in school she’s either in a rush or talking with her friend. I know it’s a lot of excuses but whenever she’s free, I feel like I’m banging behind soundproof glass while she’s in front of it. Every single time I get off the bus I feel so cold, so lonely, so hopeless, like a fucking loser who can’t do shit. I cry almost every time after the bus, there’ll be a few times out of the week where she doesn’t go on the bus in the afternoon and I hate it. One day I just sat infront of the seat of hers and just bawled out silent cried listening to sad music. Head low, nobody could tell, I could hear her eating chips or something really close behind the seat with meant her head was close to the seat, i stopped for a second. The following day or the day after I sat behind her and realized I could see her reflection on the window in the crack between the seat and the window which made me realized she could’ve been watching me the whole time I was crying. I kinda panicked for a second but then just pictured me never coming in contact with her ever because of that, so I bawled out  again crying but this time I payed my head on the back of the seat of the one in front of me(my crush’s seat) and started listening to sad Weeknd music, kinda hummed a bit and then saw her reflection in the window laying her head against the seat. It could’ve meant she was listening to me and the music, it could’ve also meant she was just laying her head on it but even if she wasn’t she still could’ve heard it or me. She also didn’t change her position either she seemed like she was tuned in to it. I know all this could mean nothing but it feels like it does, though all of it doesn’t matter unless I do something about it.

I’ve been completely isolated from people for about a year now cause it was just driving me insane, trying to force myself to be around them while being around them was pushing me into feeling more detached. I have no friends, I don’t talk to any of my family, I’ve never had a relationship, I’m completely fucking alone.

I just don’t know what to do to fix it. If I’m by myself, I feel like shit. If I’m with people, I feel worse. I’ve tried dozens of medications, I’ve been in therapy for three years, I’ve read books about trauma trying to figure it out, but none of it helps. I just feel separate from the rest of the world, like I just don’t belong here and I feel like no one’s ever gonna really understand me. I can’t actually think of a single person who I feel like actually *knew* me. 

It’s just so frustrating cause I feel like I’m starting to buckle under all the stress and the loneliness. My whole life has just been going through awful bullshit event after awful bullshit event completely alone for as long as I can remember and since I can’t connect with people or *feel* supported by anyone, I’m just gonna have to keep slogging through more of the bullshit life keeps piling onto me, with no end in sight.

1002,t7zqd7,wildflowersandroses,"my ex girlfriend broke up w me a month and a half ago. yes we’re still friends. best friends, maybe.

we’ve spent some time together alone. it felt like we were still dating but she still refuses to talk to me outside of hanging out or in school. but in person, it’s like we never broke up.

i’ve had the horrible habit of torturing myself with the trivial act of checking her social media. watching her snap score go up. watching our mutual best friends icon disappear while she finds someone else.

i told her about it today. i shouldn’t have. she lied to me and said that on hers, we were still best friends but i know that’s not true, she just doesn’t want to make me sad by telling me who she’s talking to. i get it. and i’m fucking ashamed for even worrying about something so stupid. we’re not even together.

i just want to be w her again. she’s the only person who has ever truly understood who i am. i firmly believe that she knew me inside and out and i knew her inside and out. it kills me to watch her move on (if she even is and if this isn’t just a manifestation of my overthinking).

it’s sad. it’s sad watching her care less and less. i wonder who she’s texting. i wonder why she wouldn’t tell me. 

i thought of suicide at this point. i feel completely and utterly alone. and if i cut her off from my life i’ll simply have nobody outside of my family, and that’s scary to me.

i feel so alone and broken. and it hurts knowing that i’m this broken up about it. it’s like i’m a fucking pathetic piece of shit. checking snapchat scores and torturing myself about it. it’s the worst i’ve felt in a long time. i miss her like hell.

1003,t7zygt,[deleted],"I   went on a trip to a mountain with my Motorcycle two days ago. I was   riding it at 70 miles per hour and suddenly it's brakes failed and there   was a sharp left turn ahead. I realised that I will not be able to  stop  my motorcycle. The road had a 5 meter broad divider which had  grass. I  saw that a small section of the divider which was paving the  way inside  the grass. I rushed my motorcycle into it and left my hands  from the  bike which threw me ahead and my body rolled 4 times into the  grass and  then I stopped. Tons of people came up to help me. Luckily I  landed on  the grass. My motorcycle is completely broken up but luckily I  did not  face any major injury. If I had been fallen on the Road all  the cars  after me would have easily crushed me.

1013,t81zz3,Profie02,"i have had this kind of awakened phase in my life a few months ago where i realized the world wasn't really all that's cracked up to be. Most of my days nowadays is thinking about the past, when i had friends, social connections, the thing that seemed so effortless back then. As a kid, i had that kind of bravado, i could strike a conservation with anybody in the room; i was always talking, I was the opposite of lonely. But that couldn't be anymore different today.

Ever since covid, i have gotten rusty at my knack of communication, and 2 years in i apparently have lost all my skills. I am now more introverted, and thus i just don't carry that same extroverted mentality anymore. I don't talk as much as I used to, and so this has been the loneliest period of my life. Where did all the friends go? Where did I go? What happened to me?

Now i'm facing more stress than ever before in high school. School has always came naturally to me, but 2 years of online learning has basically eroded almost all the good study habits i had. Not good when you are in your last year. I originally thought that lockdown was good. I could relax for once! But it changed me permenantly.  I do not like this shell of myself. I want to go back to the past.

I went back and played some games from my childhood, and it was the first time i had cried in months. The longing to go back to simpler times, better times. I have always wanted to grow up, but ever since growing up I have never been this miserable. At the height of my problems right now, it seems as if there's nobody to talk to, no wall to keep me going. There is essentially no one that I can connect to anymore. I want to progress forward, I want to make friends again, but my confidence has completely vanished.

1019,t84isd,moralmeemo,"Hi. This is my first time posting here. I’m 18, non-binary, and I don’t have any friends. I haven’t really had friends for 5 years. I was bullied a lot and kinda hid from the world. 
I’ve known a lot of people but they always left, or ended up abusing me. I don’t ever have anyone to see or talk to. I live with my partner, and they have a healthy social life which I envy because they always have someone to talk to and people who need them. Everyone I see has friends to hang out with. Or they post pictures of themselves with their friends. My partner constantly talks about their friends and how fun they are and all the cool shit they do together. I so desperately want that…
I spend my days alone, trying to interact with people only to be ignored. I try to reach out to old friends but they bully me and turn me away. My partner tried to shoehorn me in with their group of friends but. It’s just not the same. 
People just… don’t like me. I always try to meet people but end up being ghosted.
My mental illness has kept me from going to college or working, or even going out in public. I have major anxiety (and other shit) so it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people irl. 
I always see groups of friends out together and it stings. I’ve always been suicidal and dealt with depression. But being alone? It makes me want to die all the time. 
I dunno. I don’t have any talents are hobbies besides drawing. So I don’t ever go out and meet people… I’ve tried. Nobody wants me around. Everyone has their friend group and their place, their own memories and inside jokes… not me. 

I like old movies, Netflix, rock music, art and drawing, JoJo’s bizarre adventure, nature, and obscure fandoms like Furries (safe for work only. Every furry I meet is kinda gross so I don’t have any furry friends). 
I love animals, and we have a ton at the house that I play with. They’re kinda my only friends. I’m working on becoming a wildlife rehabber.

1020,t850jh,regardkick,"TL:DR - I'm used to being alone, but am now feeling lonely and don't know how to fix it without depending on another person. Anything work for you? 

I (36F) have been alone (romantically) for a long time. I've met most of society's milestones - I own my home, I had a good job, I'm working full-time on a PhD, I travel - but I do it all alone. No partner, no children. 

I prioritized myself and my wants before really thinking about dating or being in a relationship. I've got a wonderful family, a good friend group, and I'm pretty active in my community - like, I like who I am and what my life is. Most of the time, I don't think about having a partner. 

I've tried dating apps on and off, but haven't had much success - mostly because I think of a partner as a value add, and so far, I haven't met someone who would add value to my life (and obviously, I hope to add value to someone else, too). And honestly, I'm afraid of depending on someone to be the source of my happiness. 

I used to be alone and was okay. But for the last couple of weeks I've been feeling lonely. I can't depend on someone else to get back to okay. I'll be honest that I miss a lot of the things a partner can do that you just can't do for yourself (not just sexy things, but like small touches and thoughtful gestures). I've been getting jealous of strangers on the street watching them walk hand-in-hand.

I don’t feel like I’m getting the same energy back from the people I care about. This makes me feel like no one genuinely cares about me. But that also made me think “Do I genuinely care about anyone?” Because I can’t tell. I don’t know the difference between being friends because you care about someone or that it is just nice to have someone to talk to.

There is never a day where I think my friends are real. That they are there for me. That they’re faking to like me because I’ve been nice to them.

And it feels like I’m drowning in my own expectations. Expectations of them, of myself, of friendships. I keep forgetting that people are flawed, but I find it hard to tell the difference between a bad or toxic person or just some flaws. I forgive them for their small flaws, but sometimes they build up to a lot of frustrating for me. 

Honestly, my life is not that unbearable when compared to others. I have good days, I have bad days. That is normal right? But how come the bad days feel so much worse than the good days?

There’s been a lot of times where I wish to stop existing. But I’m trying to hold on to a better future. There’s still so many years to be happy right? But sometimes it feels like happiness is an illusion.

I've always wanted boys to pay attention to me but it has never happened. I had a crush in school who I tried hard not to fall far, the guy wasn't brave enough to express interest either. Later in adulthood I lost my patience with a few guys and asked them out and none of those ended well. 4 different guys from 19 through 25.

I'm currently in therapy and we are working through my anxious attachment style. There is a guy I'm attracted to, doing everything in my power to pull away from him and not do the same mistakes again.

To top that he ghosted me for 2 weeks now. It's been painful.  I feel worthless, I'm losing all my hope. and then there is this human need to feel touched, cuddled and hugged.  I cannot sleep, I constantly wonder what's wrong with me, why is no one attracted to me?

My brain won't shut up. I read up everything about anxious attachment style it makes sense theoretically but I keep falling back to my vicious cycle.

Coming to my friendships. I used to have closed knit group of 10 people, Due to CoVID everyone has been flaky. The whole of last year I tried my best to keep in touch by organizing zoom calls and catching up for coffee. It became tiring to be the one putting in all the effort. As an experiment I stopped calling/texting/scheduling meets with them for the last 3 months and guess what they stopped too. It's pissing me off everytime I think about it

1073,t8avo4,firestorm0108,"When I was 11/12 my family dog was put down. This dog was my best friend in the whole world since I didn't really make friends all that well when I was a kid. he got an inoperable brain tumor and we had to have him put down because he was in constant agony.

That day I felt numb until we reached the vets (which was a 2 hour drive since they were a specialist). Then they put him on the table and gave him the injection, he started to pine and I cried like I never had before or since.

The day after I remember waking up feeling empty, but my parents told me it was just grief and it'd pass. Eight years on I've lost both my grandads, two classmates I'd known my whole life, some true friends and I felt nothing for any of them.

At first I thought, or at least hoped, that it was an inability to feel loss. I knew deep down that wasn't it. I can't feel anymore, anything. All my emotions are fake and hollow, I smile because others smile, I make jokes to make other laugh to make sure they never have to feel how I do.

Deep down I am at my core broken and I don't think I can ever be fixed. Which has left me with the only emotion I can ever really feel anymore, anger. I don't hurt anyone, it's not because of morals. I'm just terrified of what I would do. For the past few years I've had a really good restraint on it, able to hide it from the world, but I still need to feel it.

I know it's unhealthy and I shouldn't want to be angry but it's all I have left, I have no other emotions. Without this one last ember of humanity what will I be?

1075,t8b2ey,Cool_Tailor7057,"Hi,

I moved from Southeast Texas to Colorado for school. Over 1000 miles away from home, this is the farthest and most distant I have been from everyone in my life before. I am struggling with loneliness like I never had before and I do not know what to do.

I am a junior now. As a freshman, I had a great group of friends that were supportive in classes as well as life. No one ever did anything by themselves. We were a very tight group. COVID hit and we all went home. I was one of the only ones that didn't grow up in Colorado so I had to leave all of them. When we came back in the fall of the next school year, it never was the same. I felt like I was forcing it all. We did all live under the same roof in a frat house, but they never came to my room, I always went to theirs. 

Now as a junior, we all live in different houses/apartments. It was hard in the start of the fall semester to keep up with eachother as classes were also becoming way more difficult and I did not have a similar major to them. It then became very apparent that they wanted nothing to do with me when they went on a trip for a fall break without ever mentioning it to me unless I asked them what they were doing for break. This killed me and I then spaced myself from them. They didn't want anything to do with me, so I saw that it was best for me that I stop pouring my energy into them. 

Now, I have two close friends that live in my house and I cannot find the same joy I did when I was with them. It has caused me to fall behind in classes while also stop going out because I don't want to see them. COVID has also hindered my social ability to go out and meet people in a party/function setting. I have no problem talking to people about school/work/sports/work industry. 

All signs lead to getting a pet or moving cities, but neither of those are possible. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do? Feel free to leave a comment or DM me with more questions if you really want to help.

Thanks yall.",2022-03-06 23:09:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646020210,0,/r/lonely/comments/t8b2ey/moved_away_for_college_and_struggling_with_my/,,0,1,Moved away for college and struggling with my mindset
1076,t8b2u8,PlayfulBeyond9699,"I've mainly experienced people just having a very passive attitude towards me, like I'm just not quite enough to keep around. I feel like a background character most of the time while trying to interact with people. Either people ignore me or expect me to get out of their way, or they'll be civil enough to chat with me but they don't really have any interest in engaging in conversation with me. I can tell by how they'll eventually ghost, or take days to respond to a basic question. Or if they're online all the time but can't spare a moment for me. A big hint as to how most if not all people feel around me.

I'm just not quite enough it seems. I used to give people the benefit of pathetic excuses, like oh they must just be busy! But when time goes on, one red flag turns into two and before I know it they show me exactly how they really feel. I'm a source of cheap entertainment, but once something 'better' comes along I'm invisible again. Friends I've known for years, did it to me, guys I've talked to did the same, parents, extended family, strangers even it's like I am just a nuisance in the way. So easily forgotten.

1081,t8bqhs,PsalmoftheSad,"It's no secret to see that we're not long for this world, with the state of affairs that this earth has brought unto itself. Whether it be biblical or We the People's fault, it's irrelevant. Everyone knows something big is about to happen, and if you don't... Well, I envy your blissful ignorance. I'm not trying to sound condescending or pretentious when I say that, though.


Every waking day is a step closer to the edge of the black hole sun. Whether it ACTUALLY be that which engulfs us into the great unknown or a divine intervention, the means that which propels us into the next life is equally irrelevant. Tonight I'm plagued with a very important question. When the chips are down and it's all said and done, do you think you will be remembered by the things you've done in this life? When people go through your belongings as a means of documenting who you were as a person, what would they find? Will there even be people left over **TO** document how you lived your life? I am not entirely sure why these questions have made itself manifest in the precipices of my mind, especially tonight of all days... But here I am with this ever-burning question that's got me in a frenzy. 



I just went through my safe a few moments ago and found a letter that was addressed to me by someone that was once dear in my life. The significance of why her and I no longer talk is neither here nor there, however the point is I will keep that letter until the day I die **because** of her importance in my life. I uh... I wonder if people will remember me as someone that loved a girl till death. She was great, but not the greatest... Yet somehow I still hope both get the opportunities to live long and happy lives with guys that are leaps and bounds greater than I. I mean, they gotta be, because if they weren't, wouldn't I have been picked? 



Will I be remembered as just some asshole that tried to get too close to someone when he should've known he didn't deserve to be loved in the first place? Does it even MATTER how I'm remembered as I won't be here after the fact? I mean, lots of things happen when you die, right -- just none of it involving you. Maybe I'm getting too philosophical over here. Tonight I just felt like rambling because I feel a conviction in my spirit for someone -- ANYONE to read this. Maybe I'm doing it for one specific person to read these words and get confirmation in their heart. 



... Or I'm just rambling. Shit, probably the latter. 




Still, I think I do have a point to make. I think... At the end of the day when it's all said and done and the book of your life has been closed, what do you think people would read about it? If your life actually **does** flash before your eyes, what will you see before you go? Will you be happy with the hours of pain and resentment you suffered watching others be happy while you were alone, the time wasted wishing for something that just **wasn't** happening? If I were to ask myself these same questions, I think the answer would be ""no, I'm not happy with what I see""... And that's a bummer. 



Y'know, the bible talks about this time in history too. The apostles were envious of **us** because they wanted to be alive to witness the times we're in. Yeah -- the same people that got to see The Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth perform miracles, including resurrecting the dead. Why, I'll never know.. But they could trade with me any day. 


Anyway, my **TL;DR** can be summed up into three simple words: ""Terminus is nigh."" I hope you're ready.",2022-03-06 23:43:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,2,/r/lonely/comments/t8bqhs/will_you_be_happy_in_the_end/,,0,4,Will you be happy in the end?

Basically she doesn’t want to end up having sex on the first date because she usually regrets it later so she’s started wearing underwear that she’d be too embarrassed to show her date. That way she won’t be able to change her mind during the date and sleep with them anyway.

I haven't seen any of his posts for a while; I blocked him on other sites just to save my mental health. But anyways, I got too curious and clicked on it because, honestly, I miss him. 

It saw a post of their two-year anniversary and I just... my heart just... broke again. I know, it's pathetic because it has already been three years!

They just looked so nice and happy and in-love. They went on a picnic and kite flying because he remembered her saying she never flied kites as a kit.  He never made that much effort for me. We never did that. We never looked that happy. It just made me think of what she had that I didn't because honestly we looked similar. She seemed smarter, more successful, more creative, more independent.. everything I wasn't. He basically found someone like me... but better.

Made me feel inferior, insignificant, unworthy.

1136,t8gxlv,Majamagic86,"
I m(27) started a friends with benefits “relationship” with the a girl (26) back in September. It started as a hookup but we instantly clicked. She had kids and I was upfront from the start that I had no intentions of ever being involved with her kids, so it did not make sense to bother with a monogamous relationship for her. I personally was uncomfortable with non monogamy but I guess I lied to myself and tried to go along with it (first major mistake). We get deeply involved with each other’s lives as far as lots of communication, seeing each other often and opening up about our pasts. The sex was very good. She had a very damaged  past and I became very attached to her in wanting to be there for her and empathize with her. Long story short after forming a very strong attachment despite being non monogamous, she would occasionally sleep around and eventually I developed a ton of anxiety over the thought of her being with other people sexually. 

She began to start stripping, I became even more insecure with this, to a point where I was losing sleep over the situation. I was very attached to her but also couldn’t handle the reality of the situation. Eventually my insecurities became very apparent to her, and she said we should stop having sex, and just be friends. I agreed, and shortly after she went on a date with a man (47)who she met at the strip club.  She had sex with him and all. However she said while she was having sex with him, she found her self missing me and the feeling of having sex with me.  She even asked me to have sex one more time after seeing this new guy a few times. I told her no. 

On another phone call she mentioned she was grieving the loss of having sex with me and was seeing this guy as an attempt to “feel something” as she felt emotionally numb. Time goes by and she keeps seeing this man. He has tipped her 500 dollars at her club multiple times, he has offered to take care of her and her kids financially. In further conversations she explains what she likes about him (disciplined, wealthy, leadership role, intelligent, appears to be a good potential stepfather). 

I have cut contact with her I’ve rather last two weeks, but I keep getting nagging thoughts of jealousy, and I feel like I’ve taken a big hit on my self esteem. I feel like I’m weak for not being able to handle her sleeping around and not being able to emotionally handle the reality of a fwb relationship. I also find myself being jealous of the new guy’s supposed qualities and just in general getting affection from the girl I am so attached to. 

I know this all probably sounds ridiculous but i can’t pull my self out of this cycle so any voices of sanity and opinions on any of the situation would be appreciated!",2022-03-07 04:24:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1543696614,0,/r/lonely/comments/t8gxlv/heartbreak_and_lonely_after_lost_fwb/,,0,0,Heartbreak and lonely after lost fwb

Recently I tried to reach out to a girl I was dating last summer, we ended things badly but I was longing for some sort of intimacy, long story short she wants nothing to do with me. 

I’ve tried my hand at dating apps but they just make me feel worse endlessly swiping just hoping that I get a match that won’t ghost me lmao. Even when I try putting myself out there I become a nervous wreck thanks ti anxiety and I fumble almost all the time. 

My circle of friends has pretty much boiled down to myself and 2 other ppl, both of which are in healthy relationships. While I’m happy for them, being the only single guy in the friend group fucking sucks, theres only so many times you can third wheel until you just stop wanting to hang out with them. 

Despite putting effort into my health, job, school and what not. Theres this empty void in my life that just keeps getting bigger. At this point I’ve come to accept that I’ll be alone forever, growing up with no siblings basically primed me for that anyways.",2022-03-07 06:09:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603948366,1,/r/lonely/comments/t8imqx/being_solo_dolo_just_sucks/,,0,1,Being Solo Dolo just sucks

1148,t8iu5f,Person96,"You know, I remember the days when I was younger where almost every day I'd have someone over all the time. My friends, my cousins, I was surrounded by them all the time. Almost every day, I know I'd have someone over. Some days, even on just regular days where there was no special occasion, I might have 4, maybe 5 people over and all of us would just play games with one another. Some of my best memories are the days and nights where I would stay up all night with my friends playing Halo or Call of Duty. One vivid memory I have is I was up until 3 am one night talking to a friend over Skype. I was playing Slender while she was keeping me company. Yeah, she. That was the only time I've ever stayed up that late with someone, even if they weren't even there, who wanted to keep me company while I did something scary. That was probably the tipping point for me. When she became more than a friend to me. I guess you could say from that day forward I kind of fell in love with her.

There isn't a time that I could think of where someone stayed up with me so willingly just to comfort me. Just to make sure that I was alright. Just to make sure that I didn't get too scared and tried to make me feel better by making me laugh. Even scaring me herself by leaving then immediately coming back after I was chased by the Slenderman. I still think about her to this day despite that happening almost 10 years ago. She's no longer in my life anymore. That's not to say she's GONE gone, I mean we both just moved on with our own lives and went on to become adults. But to me, I still think about her. I still love her.

At times like these, where I just feel incredibly alone and in need of a hug, I think about that one night. No one has ever helped me like that since then.

I have a dream that goes something like this. Where I'd get a random text or call from someone I know who randomly says ""Hey, I'm bored. I'm going to come to your place. I'll bring some coffee, okay?"" and then they show up with a snack. Then, we'd just sit and watch something together or play something together. Maybe watch a cartoon, a movie, or an anime together. Not doing anything inappropriate or anything, just having them sit with me and make me forget this ache I have in the base of my chest that I get when I'm feeling alone. I know friendships and relationships are a two-sided street. But, my current ""friendships""...well I haven't had anyone other than my parents and some family see my apartment since I moved to this city 3 years ago. Needless to say, I forgot how to host people.

I still think about you, Lulu, and what you did for me. I know it might have not seemed much to you but to me, it meant the world.",2022-03-07 06:23:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1332144491,2,/r/lonely/comments/t8iu5f/lulu/,,0,0,Lulu

1153,t8j27a,ICreatedToConfess," It's been years since I have felt completely normal. My feelings are so numb. I don't feel happy when something good happens and I don't feel sad when something bad happens. I can't even cry even if I tried to. And it's not like someone started pointing this out to me. I understood these about myself during a lot of circumstances.

I once knew a dog (not mine) who would often come to my house and stay for months when her owner visits other places. She was such a great buddy for me and I loved her so much. And I knew her for years. But a few months ago, she passed away and I could not even express any feeling or emotion for her death. I couldn't cry, I couldn't feel sad. I couldn't even visit the dog's place because I couldn't express any feelings and I was scared of it.

I tried going out with friends and they just claim me to be ""You have changed a lot"", ""You are so silent"" and ask ""Where is the old and enthusiastic you?"" kind of question and it kind of hurts me inside. It's not like they want to hurt me by asking these questions but it does hurt indeed.

I don't believe this. I make myself believe that these are some guys just evening the odds.

Okay venting done, now my story.

I'm a loner not by choice but by a lifetime of rejection faced socially, professionally and recently financially. I have learnt to live by myself. 

It's easier to just keep my head down and spend my life quietly when I know that any move I make at a relationship will just end in rejection. So I reject myself to retain that last shred of self-respect.

It's easier to work small jobs rather than in a high, responsible position at a multinational. More responsibilities bring the necessity to deal with more number of people. So I quit when they wanted to move into a manager role. I was very difficult to get a job non interactive job with decent pay.

Point is, I am just crossing off the days on my calendar until my life finally gets over. I wrote something a while back, posting a few lines from that

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Those waves of ferocious powerlessness and alienation come crashing to fill the void where I stand  
&gt;  
&gt;Not wanting to drown in the ocean of despair, I utter a cry for help desperately hoping for a helping hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Alone in the middle of the ocean, I prepare to swim through the waves of rejection to reach the utopian shore  
&gt;  
&gt;With each lunge the waves get angrier and the utopia seems further even more  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As the ocean swallows me whole and cackles at my broken will  
&gt;

This guy I knew who was a junior in my college died yesterday. He entered an unsafe body of water while he was out with his friends and he drowned. He couldn’t get out.

He was with his friends, also my college juniors, and they just had to watch him helplessly. 

Two of my friends were also close with him. I’m completely unable to reach one of them and the other has been responding with like one word at best. 

I have no one else to go to or talk to about this. The one person I tried to speak to just made me feel worse. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve lost someone and I know how the grieving process works. I wasn’t even close to this guy but I’m still shaken up. We used to talk in college because of mutual friends. He wore a really cool skull ring that I liked. 

I just. I’ve been struggling with mental health issues as it is and this loss is making me feel like everything under the sun is just completely meaningless. I’ve been trying to draw and distract myself and I’ve not even been able to really cry but everything I do feels so wrong and insensitive. 

I feel guilty about even just eating food and I’ve eaten nothing all day. I don’t even know if I’m hungry or not. 

It feels wrong for me to do anything as if everything is a form of insensitivity to the loss. I’m just so so shaken up and would like some comforting words please. 

Words along the lines of his family and friends will be okay and learn to cope. And something like the people who had to watch him die will also eventually learn to accept and deal with that pain and not blame themselves. 

It’s just all too much. It’s the first time I’ve felt grateful I don’t really have friends or go out much because I can’t imagine being part of the group that witnesses someone dear to them die before their very eyes while they’re helpless to stop it or save them.

I have had all kinds of dark and negative thoughts during this period but I can keep them to myself and an extremely well at making it look like nothing is wrong.

1186,t8msu9,Hallavaharja,"I feel so so lonely. I moved abroad 6 months ago with my boyfriend to a country where I don't know anyone (he's studying here for one more year). I accepted a new job last month and I'm working remotely, and I have the worst existential crisis about it (whether it really is the right thing for me, but I already have a 2-year contract. I just cry everyday when I think about this).

Last week my boyfriend said to me he's not sure about whether he wants to commit long-term (he's not second-guessing us and loves me and wants to be with me but isn't sure about anything in his life). I really thought we were on the same page since he wanted me to move in with him abroad and everything. Now I need to look for an apartment/room in my home country alone (we're going back in the summer), and I feel like shit because I thought I could really start building a life with him. He might travel to Australia this year or do something completely different, nothing is certain to him. 

Of course I honor his wish to have space and we can talk very openly and lovingly about all this. I just feel like shit because I don't know anyone who I could talk to, all my friends are back home and texting doesn't always feel good.

1187,t8mtsk,[deleted],"Here I am in tears as I write this. It’s been over a year since my breakup and no contact with them. They have since moved abroad so haven’t even seen them around.
I’ve packed up all things that they gave me in a box, stored it away and never opened it again. 

They’ve moved on a long time ago but here I am thinking about them every single day since the breakup. 

I’ve met a bunch of people, more than ever before. There was only one person I somehow liked but was relieved when it didn’t work out. I’ve never felt anyone again. I’ve never developed even a slight interest in anyone again. I’m too fast to ditch people. I really tried to meet new people unbiased. But still I never felt comfortable with anyone again. I didnt want to get close to anyone I met. 

I’m most comfortable on my own, when I’m really alone. Still I feel that I’m missing something and not happy. I feel wounded and I don’t want anyone around my wounded self other than them.
They’re the only motivation I have. I can only live knowing that they are happy. And I truly wish that for them. 

For myself I just wish that I could stop this pain. I don’t want to love them anymore. I don’t want to worry if they’re okay whenever I get a weird feeling. I don’t want to cry over them in silence and pretend to my environment that I’m ok and over them. I feel embarrassed to still be stuck when everyone would’ve moved on. I’m worried that I’ll never figure it out.


How can I stop loving them?",2022-03-07 11:04:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,,7,/r/lonely/comments/t8mtsk/how_do_i_unlove_someone/,,0,5,How do I unlove someone?

As the title says, I never had friends. Ik that when people say that, they end up admitting that they have had a friend that they don’t talk to much but I don’t even have that. Hell, I never even used other social media’s (reddit’s my first) and I don’t have much irl conversations.   


I don’t blame anyone but myself as I don’t have much of a personality (seriously, I’m boring), I’m always depressed and I don’t really put myself out there. Loneliness still sucks though and I want to improve myself but I just don’t know how. I asked my parents about therapy and they declined as they don’t believe in mental health issues - the reason why I asked my parents is because I'm 16 and I have little to no autonomy.

I was never understood and no one ever bothered to try and help me, not even my own mother. I see irl so many horrible people that have boyfriends/girlfriends or just normal friends, and then there's me, someone that actually acts nice to people (unless they get toxic at me) but i have no one.

After being alone for so long i came to the conclusion that being a good person lowers your chances of having friends and that if you are a bad person then you will have friends. That is how society pretty much works, almost everyone i meet is a horrible person and society is filled with people like this. The nicest people tend to be the most depressed and lonely, and that is because they know what it's like to be bullied, ignored, neglected, not cared for etc.

It did not end well, she was more interested in someone else and I became more of a friend. The usual really.

But it got me thinking. On the one side, it feels like everyone else is getting together while no one is interested in me. I feel like a weird outcast.

It's both sad and uplifting. I hate that so many have to experience the same pain as me but on the other hand, it's nice that I'm not alone with this feeling.   


If the devil came and made me an offer where everyone else would meet someone who they could love and get loved back only if I would feel loneliness forever then I would accept. Knowing that I saved everyone from the pain I felt would bring me peace.

Hi, I’m just wondering if being a 24F with no friends is normal? I have a wonderful boyfriend that I’ve been with for over 6 years, but sometimes it doesn’t always feel like it’s enough. I know he loves me and wants the best for me, but I don’t believe he should have to be everything such as my friend, my lover, my therapist). Along with that, I don’t always feel like we connect as much as we should anymore. I love him so much but I don’t even know how love should feel after 6 years ya know? It can sometimes feel stale, but then there’s moments where we can connect like two magnetic puzzle pieces without even trying. Any tips?

I do/did have a best friend of over 8 years, but she’s moved away and has gone on with her life. We still talk, but to be honest things just feel so different now. There are some moments I feel replaced bc she has met another best friend who literally looks just like me, same birthday month, same major and it makes me feel weird. Now, I’m just kind of trying to figure out what to do next. I reconnected with one of my ex best friends from HS bc we saw each other at a nail salon, but I felt like consistency wasn’t there and I never texted or communicated back. It just reminded as to why I should keep the past in the past.

So, here I am in my final semester of college feeling super lonely on my college spring break because I have no one to talk to. 
I truly thought college would be this thing that helps you connect to so many people and I just don’t feel like that happened for me. It absolutely sucks and I definitely need some advice. 😓🥺",2022-03-07 15:40:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601327046,7,/r/lonely/comments/t8rzk6/am_i_lonely/,,0,3,Am I lonely?

People always tell me about how I'm so young, yet thanks to all the people that fake depression and anxiety my age I struggle to be taken seriously.

I have no social life, no friends, my family don't listen, and when they do they don't take me seriously, I've only ever had one group where I've felt like I belonged, and when I had to go in October it really did tear me apart.

I'm nothing, I'm merely a stone in people's way, they trip up, and get back up, or they just don't fall over at all. I'm a burdensome waste to this world, I have no purpose to make of my life and no goals.

I always just want to be loved, I wish I could curl up into the arms of someone who cared and just cry as they held me close and tight, stroking my hair.

Speaking of hugs and crying, I haven't had a hug since August and I'm so numb I haven't been able to cry since November no matter how hard I try.

Suicide is the only conclusion and answer to my desolate existence, the world may not forget me, but I'm just an example of what not to do in life.

I don't know if I'm using the term correctly, but I feel like I still am missing a motherly figure in my life.

She helps make (or order) breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But not much else. I try to do well at school to impress her but when I get a 85+, 90+ score the only thing I get is a ""good job"" or ""cool, you could do better"". To clarify, I feel love more by physical contact. I want to be hugged, or pat on the head. I've never gotten either of those since I graduated elementary school. After I graduated elementary she just stopped caring too much I guess, she used to be fond of me, being there whenever I was sad or in pain. But now, she feels distant. She's there physically but not emotionally. When I was caught crying at night, she just left me there to console myself. I don't think she loves me anymore. I want the validation, care and attention of my mother. I love her so much but she doesn't love me back. I feel devastated everyday, and whenever I think of my old memories with her it pierces my heart and makes me tear up and cry like an idiot. I don't know what to do.

So I’ve been carefully thinking about this, and I think I know what I want to do. 

I want to distance myself.

A little backstory:

I recently moved to a new town, a new house and of course, a new school.
It’s been hard at first to settle in but I made some mental promises to myself:

1) Don’t try to make friends
2) Don’t embarras yourself 
3)Stop caring about people
4)Make small-talk with people who speak to you FIRST.
5) Avoid most conversations.
6) Don’t speak 
7) Be quiet
8) Use time effectively 
9) Be kind but not too kind.
10) DO NOT BUT DO NOT DISCUSS FAMILY MATTERS/ PERSONAL ISSUES WITH ANYBODY


Yes, I know, they are pathetic but, my game, my rules(?)

Once I carefully thought over these rules/promises I decided to step up my game.

It was time for me to stop acting like somebody I was not. In my old school, I think I created some weird me, because the person that I showed to people out there, it wasn’t me, I felt popular (though I really wasn’t) I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin, I felt forced to do many things nobody forced me to, it was all in my mind and I felt trapped, trapped in a person I CREATED. I felt like I had lost ALL control whatsoever. Now - I really can say ‘I am in control’, because, for once, I am.




More backstory:

For this new high school I go to, I want to clarify,

I have some acquaintances, some, but I do.

I just really am not putting the effort into making those acquaintances ‘friends’.

The reason why? I just don’t want to.

I don’t feel comfortable around people I know. I just really don’t want any social interactions, if you’d like to put it in that way.

Sure, I have some people I have lunch with but then again, I’d rather eat alone, without anyone with me, It would be so much better. 

That’s what I’m trying to do. I don’t want to come out as rude here because of simply disregarding their presence with me, but if I’m honest, their presence makes my lunchtime very unpleasant. (It’s not them, it’s me, and I am the one who wants to eat alone, not them)

I hope I can figure something out to not sound as ‘rude’ (even though I probably will be because everyone takes everything seriously these days) but also not too kind. Because well,

1291,t93lne,endisnear7,"I know a lot of the posts on here are about dating and never getting a date. And I think I may relate to that in the future since I've never had a relationship and theres a high chance I never will.

But this isn't the reason for most of my loneliness. The majority of my loneliness is from being rejected by other kids. I'm an outcast in my school for no reason. I know a lot of people who say that end up having dog shit personalities, but it's simply not true in my case. I've never instigated a fight with anyone at my school yet everyone seems to hate me.

I had a girl come up to starting a fight because I was in her seat, even though it was my assigned but I wasn't in for 2 weeks because I couldn't leave my bed from hardcore depression. My hair has been a problem for a lot of people too which is something I can't control. I have frizzy curly hair but not the nice kind and no matter what I do to it, even when I straighten it. It goes back to being a mess in 2 hours max.

I've been treated as an outcast for being a homosexual because my ""friends"" at the time told everyone about it and basically got me bullied for a while. Yeah that was a shit time in my life. I honestly did consider committing suicide because my depression + loneliness + overall negative outlook on life became too much to deal with.

I have less than a year of school left until college and I don't know if I'll even get into college. My grades are in the shitter and probably won't get me accepted. So my whole time at this school being bullied and treated like shit was all for nothing. I'm homeschooled for now but it won't last long until they'll send me back to that shithole.

Out of the blue she messages me, saying that we've become two different people, and that I'm unmotivated and emotionally broken. I can't defend the unmotivated part, but I have been trying my damn hardest to fix it. You see, I'm an amateur filmmaker in Upstate New York, and finding the motivation to sit down and finish a script is so much easier said than done. I've got at least a dozen started-scripts, and only one that I finished while I was still in high school. Granted, I'm a sophomore in college, but it's still been a while since I was proud of and dedicated to my work. As for the emotionally broken part, it's true. I'm a manic bi-polar with depression. I take fluoxetine, but sometimes it can only do so much. She's got issues of her own in terms of emotions, but she quit taking her meds out of pure laziness. She even dropped out of school after moving out on her own, but apparently I'm the unmotivated one. She was supposed to be the one I'd settle down with. She even expressed interest in that. But now she's left me behind, with nothing but bittersweet memories and a broken heart. I feel very confused, and lost, and I'm reaching into the void to find someone who'll read this because I feel so very alone right now. It was all so sudden, I wasn't ready for it.

1312,t97j84,BlurryKai,"so sophomore and junior year of HS i had a ton of friends. 1. Then right before Senior year I lost someone i considered very close to me because he ghosted me after two years of having a friendship. 2. Then a few months later in school i lost another bestfriend. 3. Then now a friend i considered really close to me stopped texting me. 4. One of my bestfriends barely has time to talk to me and does her own thing. 

The thing is when all of my friendships ended i blamed myself ofc. 
 1. had no explanation for leaving and the only thing i could think of that was wrong is talking about my bf too much and lagging, but i always told him the reason for why i lagged but i made sure he knew i loved him.
2. She said she didn’t like the girl I was hanging out with which she didn’t mention to me beforehand bc i didn’t know they had beef. She still tells me she shouldn’t have done it but doesn’t care to revive our friendship. 
3. we’ve texted everyday for 2years straight, and he started leaving me on read and when i asked him why i was left on delivered so i deleted my text, but he sometimes talks to me in person. 
4. since the beginning of covid she said since i wasn’t allowed to go out she really couldn’t be my friend. we were friends since middle school. 

I don’t know why this has happened to me, so much unfortunate events in one year. I was very happy to be in senior year and i thought it would be really fun, but it’s the loneliest i have ever been in a while. I eat alone at lunch and people use me so that they aren’t alone. I don’t consider myself a bad person in these situations especially since i’ve scanned the situations many times. 

My main question is how do I get over this feeling of loneliness and how do I not blame myself. I continuously blame myself bc idk how i can lose so many people in a year without it being my fault. But logically in every perspective i didn’t wrong any of my “friends”. I just want to know how to keep self-love in such a hard time. I only ever showed love to my “friends”. and if they asked me after their wrong doings if i loved them i would tell them i do.

She had nice parents who really liked me as well, Which is important to me because I’m not close to my own family so I always wanted to have one I could get adopted into. We would text all day and face time all night. 

Then she left… 

It was on Valentine’s Day. The first one in years I actually had someone to spend it with, and she broke up with me over a text message. The worst part is I don’t even know why. We didn’t fight, there was no event that led to it. Everything was great.. or so I thought. It completely blindsided me. And now there is no one. My phone is void of messages for days and days on end. The only people who talk to me are my coworker or bosses giving me work to do. Now I spend every night at the bar, not because I want to get drunk, I was drunk every night for the first week. Now i just go out because the bartenders asking me if I want another drink are the only people who say anything to me. And that’s all I get now other than that I just talk to myself, and nothing I say is ever good.

1323,t98cue,Shot-Strike,"This probably sounds so stupid, because I *know* that people like me or at the very least are entertained by me when I'm around. I am still so, so lonely. 

It just takes so much *work* to make people like me. I just want someone to talk to me instead of having to be the one to make myself so available and reach out and organize everything when somehow no one else has to do this. 

No one ever calls me or texts me first and I always have to physically go over and invite myself to plans in a group. I don't have the energy to invite myself to things or - when I'm excited to do things - arrange everything so my friends will come, so I just end up going to events that I'm interested in alone and making really surface level connections with people there or not going at all if it's an event like a dance or something where it literally wouldn't be fun unless I went with at least one friend.

It's also difficult because it's kind of expected within my friend group to just arrive at a particular member of the friend group's house uninvited - which is uncomfortable to me because that is just not something I did before in my life and I'd hate to show up at their house when no one's there or after being there several days in a row because what if they want some alone time or something, but I've been doing it more often (as well as just sitting alone in the lobby of our apartment building because that way whenever someone in our group is entering to go there I'll go up with them, too) because I am so lonely I feel like I would die if I didn't see people. 

This literally sounds so dumb, because I know that they like me, but it still takes so much work on my part to interact with them. 

They also hug me sometimes (they are a fairly touchy-feely friend group in general and hug hello and goodbye and climb all over each other) and I am so touch-starved after literally not interacting with people except at work or class that I feel so needy about it and I don't want them to think that I'm super needy or clingy about it, so the only way I feel comfortable initiating it is by pretending to be cold. As far as I know nobody is overthinking it like I am but every time I get literally any amount of skin-to-skin contact my entire fucking body is focused on it because I haven't even hugged my own mother in months.

Outside of this friend group I only have coworkers who I only vaguely know, people in my classes who don't answer my texts, and roommates who don't talk to me for weeks (until today, when one of them  reminded me it's my turn to do the chores today and then immediately left).  As much as I try, my workplace isn't really set up for making friends. The people in my classes who I kind of struck up a friendship with last semester aren't in my classes anymore or don't answer my texts if they want to go to dinner, so I always end up eating alone.

And my roommates... the tipping point that led to me crying in my room today is that one of my roommates talked to me for the first time in weeks today and it was to remind me that today was my turn to do one of the chores. Every single day before this for pretty much the past month I would get home and the house would be dark and my roommates would be locked in their rooms - and since then, by the way, I have drastically changed in appearance in the meantime, and my roommate doesn't even comment on this, just did literally the bare minimum in terms of communication, and then says ""yeah, that's all"" and leaves. Thanks.

I don't know what to do about this. I've joined clubs and not so much as made a single friend. Constant surface-level connections, no one who is interested in anything more than that. I've been trying for *months* to invite people to things, to tag along to group events, to invite myself places based on weird ""oh you can come up to our apartment whenever you want"" statements - and I just don't have energy to do that anymore.

My grandfather died recently. I tried to reach out to my best friend so we could hang out. However, she said she had a date that day and couldn't. btw I didn't tell her about my grandfather. I just wanted to keep my mind off it and be with possibly the only person who understands me. I didn't want to bother her with that information unless she asked why. However, it made me realize how alone I really was. I have a good amount of friends but not really anyone who I could expose my heart to. I feel each passing day I grow colder inside. I wish someone would hold me tight and tell me its ok. I want to feel the warmth of love. I'm chubby and awkward in some aspects. I'm ADHD so sometimes I overshare. I may not be as good looking as other guys. Not as cool as the other guys. Not as smooth either. But can't I have a chance? I even made a romantic playlist today. How sad is that. I'm too easy too. I've been noticing that if a girl shows me kindness and possible understanding I'll almost immediately start to fall in love. Except they always have a boyfriend. Maybe it'll change soon? A friend of mine has been mistreated by her boyfriend and is going to break up with him. I fell in love with her in the first week of meeting her and was going to ask her out. Until I found out she had a boyfriend. she seemed happy at the time so I backed off. Now that I hear how she's been treated I burn with rage. Not an emotion I experience often. However, I don't know if I feel the same as I did before. I do know I can do better though. At the same time I'm not sure if she can give me what I need.

1337,t99umc,FashionablePotato,"I had no friends when I came to college in 2019. I found an acquaintance from high school and started a friend group, fell in love, and cultivated a really strong family that was built around me and my partner's relationship. For two years, I felt like I owned the world and my best friends were right there with me. 

I didn't meet anyone else; why would I need another friend group? I had a family.

I started to feel unwell when my partner moved back into their parent's home as a result of 2020. I couldn't stand the thought of being alone again like I was in high school, so I clung desperately to my partner and our little family. I didn't want to see that I was in a codependent relationship, so I blamed myself for feeling bad about our relationship. I always felt guilty when they were sad or unhappy. It felt like I was a failure if they were not 100% healthy or if I wasn't devoting every second of my day to them. I didn't do things because I wanted to, I did them because I needed to prevent the boat from rocking. I set no boundaries and paid the price by hating myself for the resentment that would inevitably cause. Over two years, all the pent-up feelings within me grew. I couldn't figure out why I was being such a bad partner, because I hated myself for having these resentments. I tried to talk to my partner, but it always caused a fight where I felt guilty again and again. 

The family I had was built around our relationship; we took care of our group like parents would take care of their children. How could I take care of myself when it would break everyone's heart? How could my relationship be toxic when everyone clearly saw how great we were together? How could I feel alone when I was surrounded by people?

I couldn't take it. I told my partner how I was feeling and they didn't believe me. They told me I must be imagining them being the villain. They broke up with me right there, after two years. They told their friends, our family, everything I said. I was so desperate to maintain that connection that I forced myself to remain friends with them, despite everything. I hated my own fucking guts. Everything I was terrified of was here, and I had caused it all. I couldn't sleep, I didn't eat, I stopped going to class, I stopped talking to everyone except for my little family. Why couldn't I have just been happy with what I had? 

One person from our family stuck with me. They supported me for the first week. Then, they told me that they had a crush on me that had been there since our first year at college. Everything was pretty clear after that. I stopped talking to anyone, and I started drinking and hooking up with complete strangers. It didn't help.

I cut every one of them out of my life. It has been 4 or 5 months now, and I still don't trust anyone. I have no network to reach out to, no family I trust to talk to. I'm lucky enough to have a therapist, but I can't seem to get out of this rut. I want to make friends, but the people I meet are not willing to put in the same level of energy as I am. 

I'm back to where I started. It's devastating to have a friend group and network be ripped away at the drop of a hat. I feel so incredibly lost and lonely that I barely eat. I'm beginning to climb up, but I feel overwhelmed and I keep falling back down. I know life will get better, but it is so distant that I can't imagine what that looks like.

I don't know how to start making new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my friends a lot. They're  really intelligent and funny and I appreciate their company, but it never feels reciprocated even though they say ""we're all best friends."" I  rarely get invited to anything that isn't directly related to the band, and while I do understand that my depression makes me difficult to be around, it still feels shitty. Any opinion I give is disregarded immediately, whether it be about music, media, politics, etc. Maybe I'm just a disagreeable person, idk. 

I think a lot of it stems from our differences in political opinions, and while I try to be understanding of other people's politics, the way they talk about LGBT+ issues makes me uncomfortable and angry. I just shut up whenever they talk about this because I really just don't know what to say to these people without blowing up and severing the friendship, because that would mean I lose out on my only outlet for being creative and (attempting) to meet new people.

And it's not just girls who can get used because of this. Guys can bend over backwards for a girl who really isn't interested because they naively and pathetically think they can change her mind.

I am one of these guys. I'm sensitive, compassionate and I'm desperate to love someone who also loves me back. It's not unusual for lonely guys to also be more sensitive. Sensitivity may contribute to girls not being interested.

I hate myself.  I think I'm a bad person even if the thing I did wasn't a big deal and I can even go a while without a panic attack over stupid things.

1377,t9f8wl,grapefruitnotebook,"I know this kind of post has been made a hundred times but I just need to vent somewhere, so please bear with me.

I'm a shy introverted homebody with a good family and I've never really felt loneliness before college. I've had the same small circle of 3 friends since I was 13, and spend most of my time with my family. I felt completely fine the way I was, and I even prided myself for being good at ""being alone"" at some point. (but I guess I wasn't truly alone because I was still around family)

I'm now in my 2nd semester of college and it has positively been the worst experience of my life. At the beginning the entire college experience was so overwhelming and I was in a pretty bad mental space. I was really shy and withdrawn (which I regret, of course) and didn't manage to make any friends. This semester, I joined some clubs and decided to start opening up and taking the initiative to interact and ask people out for meals or to hang out, but the effort was never reciprocated. Everyone seems to have found their friend groups and I don't think anyone has ever asked me to hang out with them (yeah, that hurts). All my ""friendships"" are so superficial and transactional and I eat all if not most of my meals alone in my room. I'm so fucking lonely! I see people hanging out on social media, my close friends tell me about their new friends and god, I just wish I had some actual and deep friendships in college like everyone else.

This loneliness has been sitting in my bones for the past few months, and I don't know how to handle it. I don't even feel like myself anymore; I journal every day and the entries are just non-stop depressing and pathetic shit. I used to think I was a decent person, I mean, my 3 friends like me. But now it seems like no one wants to even be near me. I can't help but wonder if my loneliness is making me a shell of my former self.

I go to a college about 2 hours away from home so I go back every weekend. Every week all I look forward to is going back home and spending time with my family. And as much as I love my parents, I'm now finding it kind of pathetic that I spend so much time with them instead of living my youth or whatever. But at the same time, I feel terrible all the time and the only time this feeling diminishes is when I'm home during the weekends. I got homesick so much at the start of college, but it's not even homesickness anymore.

Anyway, I don't think I'm looking for advice, but maybe some comfort instead. Do things get better? Does anyone relate to this? Am I going to be lonely for the rest of my life since I can't even make friends in a college environment?",2022-03-08 11:58:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646738503,5,/r/lonely/comments/t9f8wl/never_felt_lonely_before_until_college_and_it/,,0,5,never felt lonely before until college and it sucks

1381,t9gkew,ArabofWar,"Hi and first of all I apologize for my English.

For several months I have felt very lonely, bored, have wanted a relationship, felt very shit in short. Towards the end of 2021, I started with martial arts and I have now been doing it for almost 1 year, the same as I work in a job that I really enjoy. All of this has kept me busy and made me not be so lonely or in a way not think about it, if that makes sense.

what i'm trying to say is that something that has helped me not think about loneliness, boredom etc ... is finding something that keeps you busy. An example I want to mention is last week, I was at work from morning to afternoon and then I went home ate a little, then I went straight to sparring that lasted about 1 hour. After sparring I went home, showered, ate a little and went out again for my second training session which lasts for 2 hours.

So all day I did not think about anything, I did not think that I was lonely, that I was bored or anything like that. When I got home I see that I have spent my whole day on something.

so I have in a way replaced loneliness with something I love and it has made me a little happier. i also feel like keeping oneself busy is good. 

the only thing i really want now i a relationship, but i guess that will come someday.

I just feel extremely lonely. I’m 26F and have just nobody who cares about me or even talks to me. I’m not important to anyone.
I never had a really close family- I’m an only child, my mom (to whom I had a bad relationship with lot of mistreatment from her) died of cancer when I was 17. She divorced my Dad when I was 6 and I only am in contact to him occasionally. I think that he loves me, but he is also extremely self-centered and does neither listen to me nor understand me. My aunts and uncles are not interested in any family life and want to live their own lifes separately. In my childhood and when I was a teenager I never had any friends and was bullied instead because I was so socially awkward and have apparently (I’m in the diagnosis process now) ADHD. In my early twenties I adopted a very unhealthy lifestyle with drugs alcohol and a lot of partying and therefore finally found some friends who wanted to party with me. Of course those were no real friends and a soon as I went back to my very health conscious more silent lifestyle they were no longer interested in me. I have a boyfriend, and moved to a new city with him because of his job, but he is extremely addicted to video games (no, not just normal gaming for fun, I like this too, but 24/7 besides his work staring into the screen), does not talk to me and only gets extremely annoyed when I talk to him, as his video games are most important to him (he also told me that). I go to university in my new city, but am the social outcast once again. Also it’s mainly online courses. For 99% of the day I’m just alone in my bedroom and just wish that anybody would care. I tried sooo much to fit in, but I have no energy anymore, it’s just too exhausting. I’m in therapy at least and was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (regarding illnesses) and recently also with depression. I don’t know why I’m posting this or what I’m hoping for.

I grew up never going on vacation or going to see places, I was primarily isolated and confined to being at home all day. I once visited a museum downtown with my father, it was the Museum of Science and Industry in downtown Chicago. 

I’ve always been the science nerd so being there as a little kid was awesome, my plan is to revisit this weekend to finally see what’s changed. I was around 6 at the time and I’m 19 now, so I’m hoping with better understanding of the world I’ll have a great time there.

I wanted to go with my father, but he’s very bad at scheduling and never feels like going anywhere on our weekends off (we work in a machine shop together) so that’s that. My friends are also very bad with scheduling, but even then, I wouldn’t call them friends. They’re just in my social media that follow me and besides leaving a like, never speak to me, so can’t do them either.

I’m happy I’m getting around to going, but it really sucks going alone. I always wanted to go places with somebody, but being alone and going by myself just makes me worry the experience will be empty.

China genocide of the Arabs. We send a sports elite delegation there for the Winter Olympics and they carry our flag. France is one of the biggest arms dealers in the world. Our country is part of a military Union who interferes in the affairs of West Asian and North African countries to steal their oil and precious resources under the guise of fighting the ""scourge"" of terrorism. George W. Bush has the blood of hundreds of million people on his hands and he has been adulated and whitewashed. He is the greatest murderer that the last centuries of bloody war have brought and he is free. Europe has a dictatorship. Belarus. This situation is ethically unacceptable but diplomatically it is a boon. Thanks to this dictatorship where the people suffer, the European Union has a platform for exchange between itself, NATO and Russia. 

Do you think we are the good guys? Cute. Good guys only exist in dreams.Vladimir Putin, unfortunately, has the diplomatic legitimacy to regain control of the territories of the former USSR, do you know why? Because Moscow was promised after the fall of the USSR that NATO would not approach the bloc of the east. We have not kept our promises and that is quite normal, the only goal of the great powers is to eat up territories, destroy minds, cultures, annex the will to live of people who are not like them to better force them to adhere to their new religion. 

Religion. Do you know what religion is? No, not spiritualism, that's out of fashion. Today the dominant religion is capitalism and ultra-liberalism. People give their money as an offering to the anonymous gods of the consumer empire hoping to get what the prophets promise them through advertising. Want to know how to manipulate a human's emotions? Ask an advertiser. Have you ever looked at real time world maps of business interactions around the globe? Have you ever watched World War Z? The scene when humans form a climbing mountain to jump the giant wall? It is the same with people in real life. They step on each other to achieve the ideal of fame and notoriety. Do you know what an ideal is? It is something that cannot be achieved. It is a motivation to move forward in life. It's the carrot hanging from the stick attached to the head of the mule. The point of having your very own ideal is to develop the right VALUES to pursue it in your own way. The real problem here is that no one pursues the ideal of life that they really would like anymore. The ideal has become the tool of great powers. Speaking of great powers, do you know the people who direct all the agricultural wealth of the planet? It's hard to find but not so hard to remember. 4 families is easy to remember. Oh you did not know that your Food was produced by only 4 of the most powerful families on earth? So how do you feel about not knowing who produces what you eat? Or how they do it? Or where they do it? Imma give you an interesting little item : The most potent beer brands in Europe contain around 300 times the allowable dose of glyphosate in drinking water and glyphosate has very adverse effects on people's physical and mental health. Despite this established fact by a number of independent health institutions, we continue to sell them to people, not because they want us to be sick, it's just because our decision-makers are threatened by the World Organization of Commerce. 

Forget your fake enemies. Trump? He just took advantage of the despair of society's forgotten people to maintain his myth. He is no worse than any other president. Diplomats, politicians... a joke. Do you know what theater is? Do you know why theater appeared in our civilizations? To distract the population by making them forget their problems in order to minimize the risks of revolutions. Do you think only one man has the ethical legitimacy to represent an army or a country? You are wrong. We were never meant to be gods and that goes for absolutely everyone. The truth is that our president is probably more informed and disillusioned than the entire French population. That's why he's in charge. It's because he's a good actor. 

You know, it's not really anyone's fault. It is far from being so simple. You know why we got so powerful? It's because we are, at the base, genetically, naturally, the weakest mammals on this planet while being among the most capable of reproducing. We compensated for our weakness with our survival instinct and by reproducing. We started making tools and developing a conscience. It was there that we became aware of our fatal weakness, so to continue living we developed Civilization. The civilization. Thanks to that we were able to develop even more, reduce human suffering. Today we are faced with the inherent problem of this concept of civilization. Civilization is an ecosystem within the ecosystem that saw us born and that was imagined by humans FOR humans. It never lasted and it never will. Since the Sumerians we repeat the same mistakes again and again. We build a glass tower without the right tools hoping it will hold despite the impossibility of it working, we spend hundreds of years trying to hold it together, it only works in a part, a certain percentage of the population will always suffer as much as before, or even more, and in the end, everything collapses. This is because we CAN'T re-create the stability that Earth created. It's a breath, that's how it works. 

In your opinion, where do you think we are? 

What would a shrink have to say to that? ""You seem very depressed to me, you seem mentally disturbed, how about trying a new molecule?"" Well then. Classic. 

Knowing all this, they're hoping that I forget and that I show misplaced optimism. Humanity is made to suffer. Our artificial world will soon collapse and they hope that I close my eyes, sitting on the couch of a burning house. I'll tell you what I am in this society: a cancerous cell, and the other healthy cells are trying to kill me. You will tell me ""and so, what about the health professionals?"" They're just trying to transform me. It is good behavior but only from their point of view.

Well, maybe not that good. People say I'm an attention seeker which is partly, well actually, *very true*.

It brings me great joy, motivation, and a sense or relevance that I do not receive from my real life.

I like putting others down to make them feel inferior and give myself a sense of superiority. Some say I'm a narcissist but personally I don't care what they say because I think I'm a cool person. But, maybe I do care - I just don't want them to point it out.

1476,t9wis5,Waste_Fox2968,"Alt account, I'm afraid of posting on my main, pretty long post. 

To people, I'm funny, empathetic, and very approachable because I listen to their problems without judgment. The actual me is bitter, blunt, sarcastic and have lots of trust issues from past relationships and a overall shitty life. Friendships wouldn't last long because people saw me as a miserable person who “ruins the vibes”. So I decided to hide those qualities and just show people the good, socially acceptable of me. Whenever there's an argument in the group chat, harassment, etc, I would just bite my tongue and just wait for the storm to pass. I don't whine, complain, argue, get angry, sad (unless it's the appropriate time to be “sad” like a sad movie being played). This gets more people to talk to me because I appear neutral but understanding. I'm not a smart person so I don't dare to ask questions or people will judge me for not knowing. 

Honestly, I just tell both sides that it wasn't their fault and that I can understand why they said or felt that way so everyone feels valid and like me. I have my thoughts on the matter but I can't share them or ill get lumped in or this somehow causes people to not like me b/c I took aside. I have to constantly be careful of what I say and show constraint. I even have still keep up the nice act when someone is rude or passive-aggressive to me. This would end up my apologizing to just get on people's good side.

It's getting so exhausting to keep up the fake act so I have a journal I vent all my pent-up frustration, anger, and other negative emotions I have for people or bad things that happened in a day. Other than people venting their problems to me, there's no one I feel comfortable confiding with my problems. Would be great if I had one person who saw through my fakeness and understood me so I can just let the mask fall for once. But then again I don't want that because I fear I'll get judged and exposed for being fake and I don't want that used against me. I've worked so hard to keep up my likable image for so long I don't want to do anything that risks that image or ill be alone again. 

Well I and anyone can argue I'm alone regardless. In this case, I  have to sacrifice something to receive something. I will always feel lonely, bitter, and the other socially unacceptable negative feelings, no amount of therapy will change that- because it’s just who I am and how I view life and was molded.

I talked to her in the phone but she was tired and wanted to go to sleep. 

I’ve lived in this state for 3+ years and I still don’t know a lot of people. I started seeing this boy, and I really like him. I texted him 2 hours ago and he hasn’t texted me back. His mom is actually also in the hospital and I don’t want to be super needy. His mom is a lot worse off then mine and I can’t help but feel worried about her too. I’ve also been so lonely I don’t want to scare him off. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and I feel like this community can be a better place then other subreddit. Could use some internet love.

Edit: the boy I’m seeing called me when I told him my mom was in the hospital. It was nice to talk it out. He was taking his mom home from the hospital and was busy getting her settled in.

1502,ta0qtg,godzila_thehamr,I have been very lonely these past couple of months. Sometimes so much so that I feel physical pain and start breathing heavy which has never happened until recently. I have even lightly cried over it which is very very unusual for me to do as I usually never cry about anything.  I have never had much of a real connection with anyone including parents and siblings for several reasons.  I do have 1 good friend who is my current roommate but he is not here most of the time because of work or is with his girlfriend and I work from home so most days are spent completely alone with no one to talk or interact with. I used to be ok with being alone as I was so used to it but as I get older and have moved out I find myself longing for a true genuine connection. I have never been on a date or anything like that as I am very introverted and can be socially awkward for example I likely wouldn't go out of my way to talk to someone unless i have already been around them several times and have gotten to know them somewhat.  I just want to be held or hold someone so bad. It has even began to effect my daily life as I find myself sitting in bed for hours in the mornings instead of getting up and working and I usually spend an hour atleast trying to get over the longing to fall asleep next to someone before I finally become tired enough to fall asleep anyways.  The only time I ever leave my apartment is to get groceries or go to the gym so that doesnt help my lonliness much either. I still have alot to say but dont know how to say it so I'll leave it at this for now.

1506,ta0wfg,MiriTheCheesePuff,"Please be 18-21 and read my post. ꒰⑅ᵕ༚ᵕ꒱˖♡

Hi I'm Mira, I'm 18 and I'm from north Carolina. Ive been trying recently to make new friends and talk to people because I'm having alot of problems in my personal life, and altercations I don't entirely understand. I'm the oldest of 13 so I don't really have anyone to help me advice wise or depending on wise besides myself because typically I'm the one depended on haha. I don't have friends so I wanna make real ones or real associates I can consistently talk to. 


Anyways, I'm looking for real genuine people to talk to and be friends with. Preferably I'd like someone I can meet irl eventually and call on the phone and have a real connection with and be here for and they do the same for me, I really want someone to meet eventually because I've been online for so long and it irritates me sometimes because I have no physical social life to equal out with the online one so it gets boring eventually. Also I don't wanna be ignored and neglected. I respect myself alot and if I put time into you I'd really like the same! 


I'm ADHD, so I get hyper and giddy alot, I have iron deficiency so I sleep alot, and I'm weak a large majority of the time. I have really bad anxiety so If I get comfortable with you enough I may just sometimes push you away because of my anxiety I don't do it purposely. So please have patience with me. If you dm me I'll probably sit back and see if you're gonna put effort in our friendship and stuff and see if you're a genuine person so! I love video games, cooking, sleeping obviously, I draw occasionally and stuff like that!


If you wanna be friends please be 18-21. And from the US or Canada! Please be respectful and don't try to make me uncomfortable- I love and accept everyone so; and if you're funny that's even better!

1513,ta1uzf,[deleted],"yes this sounds cringe but I’m a 26F and I never ever received validation or attention in my life, it’s very weird bc I’m not that bad looking, I have my good days, I work out, dance ballet, and I’m also smart and I try to accomplish things (getting my phd this year). 

my friends think I’m hilarious and they don’t believe me when I tell them I have never gotten attention from males in my life. I had one crush in my life but I know it’s not reciprocated, and this broke my heart a little. 

A couple of days ago I thought that a lot of people were like me, but it turns out that I’m the most singlest single person in the world. no one and I am not exaggerating, no one has shown even the slight interest in me and I’m starting to think that I’m highly unattractive and probably undesirable. 

it’s sad and I cried about this for the first time last night, when I realized that I’m the only person I know who’s not married/in a relationship/ had at least 1 person interested in me. Even though I might be ace, I’m very romantic and I love love etc. 

But damn, I couldn’t figure out a reason tbh. that’s it, I kept on dwelling about it these past few days.

1535,ta5c6r,Secret_Challenge_690,"A common theme in this sub seems to be that people are starved of physical touch.They miss the embraces of their loved ones,The warm hugs from their friends,those high fives and wierd handshakes.

Now a year back i too felt the same.Im honestly the most extroverted person ever.I love talking to new people making new friends and having absolutely crazy times with my close ones.But once the pandemic struck it all went to shit.I missed the way my friends used to hug me as soon as they saw me.I miss the way some of them used to put their arms around me or hold my hands.I miss they way they used to rest their heads on my shoulders and just sit silently.

So this year when i finally got to meet them again I cherished every moment i spent with them.Took tons of crazy picture, danced with them, sang at the top of our lungs, and had lots of fun.I want you to do the same the next time ur with someone you love.Dont be shy about it but like do remember to respect boundaries and not overdo it.

Also some here might be missing the touch of their partners, those in LDR's and those who broke up recently.That might get even harder as he or she might've been ur only source of physical touch and warmth.Today if ur missing that,I want you to go grab the best pillow you've got and hold it tight.That might sound crazy but it helped me get through

And the next time you get together with your friends or your partners, Just hug them, Hold their hands, walk with ur arms around them.Cuz you never know you might not be able to do it ever again🙂",2022-03-09 10:58:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615813051,3,/r/lonely/comments/ta5c6r/touch_deprived/,,0,13,Touch deprived?

1560,taazy0,Gondal90,"So I am looking for *OBJECTIVE* answers only. I am not interested in answers that are biased or influenced by personal feelings. I want to figure out the objective truth. 

So the problem is I have never really had friends even though I have always strongly desired to fit in and matter to other people. Growing up I was frequently bullied, experienced abuse, and severe neglect. This is a fact. These things really happened. I think the bullying, abuse, and neglect had a very strong effect on me psychologically. 

I developed deep rooted low self esteem, resentment, anger, sadness and insecurity. These feelings have always stayed with me. I frequently feel like I’m a worthless loser. The feeling of other people being accepted and loved while I am being ignored and left in the trash is extremely painful. 

Now since I have developed these deep rooted negative feelings I tend to get angry. When I feel like I am not being treated fairly I will get angry and perhaps lash out. This could make other people uncomfortable and could be a factor in my isolation. 

I’m 26. I never had a girlfriend. Hell I barely even have any friends. Sometimes my anger and insecurity drives people away. I also suffer from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) which I have been diagnosed with by three different professionals. 

I have been to multiple therapists, a psychologist and a psychiatrist (I take medication too) for years. I have improved a lot of my problems but occasionally I still experience these negative feelings of anger and insecurity. Because I was so sheltered growing up I also lack social experience.

I’m not unattractive. (In my opinion). I would say I’m at least a 5/10 to 6/10. I don’t think my looks necessarily are the problem. 

So what is the objective reason I fail socially? Why does no one ever like me? Why have I never managed to get a single girlfriend?",2022-03-09 16:03:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567328286,5,/r/lonely/comments/taazy0/can_someone_help_me_figure_this_out/,,0,8,Can someone help me figure this out?

1580,taeenn,Ok_Ad_555,"23 &amp; in a funk. Literally feeling helpless, lost, alone, lonely, etc. more so recently again. I realize I feel like this when I think about how I have 0 friends. I wish I was over exaggerating, but I’m not. 
I use to think I was an extrovert but something has shifted in me and now just rather be at home. Now, I literally have 0 friends. I use to have 3 close best friends but that friendship has shifted and it hurts me and makes me feel even more alone. It seems like all my bestfriends have a bestfriend which makes me feel even more alone. My only friends are my parents and doggies (which is taking its toll on me too). I can see myself in my mom— friendly/can be social but as for having any close friends? None. Am I following her footsteps? I don’t want to .. not in that area at least. 
I have 2 older sisters but they’re married and already moved out by my age, so that’s that. 
My phone is dry af, I don’t go out, or use dating apps so it’s like will I ever make a bond with someone else other than my family?? 
I’m feeling very alone and lonely. I hate this feeling, it sucks.

Even my perfect match rejected me. People say why did you give up? I don't think people understand, there has never or will never be a girl like her. This was the one for me and I wasn't good enough. I've never come close to a match like this but it still wasn't good enough. She said the same things back to me so I thought she felt the same way. I guess not. Since then I've become deeply depressed and know I have nothing to look forward to except pain and loneliness. I never had a gf before, and my life is empty. Trying to fill it caused more pain because I couldn't force people to like me when I did the best I could putting myself out there by going out of my comfort zone to meet people.

The calls or text I do get is from people who wants me to do something for them.

I am in my mid 30s single with no kids, close friends, or family around. 
I’ve felt alone since a was a little girl, even when I had all my siblings in the house and a couple friends in the neighborhood. I have that same feeling now but now I am also physically alone. 

I feel like anytime I try to step out and be social I get disappointed by people’s criticism, judgment or I feel like am annoying them. And the thing is I don’t get, am nice most of the time, I try to be myself and be funny and generous. But I guess that’s not enough for people.

1633,tanzxf,MooMilk3435,"I always been a fan of routine. Wake up, get ready, go to work, come home, eat, sleep and wake up again.
But what how can I adapt when a stranger comes in knocks everything out of order?
Once content, maybe even happy, now I live in a constant state of paranoia.
Who can I trust?
I feel like anyone can attack me because I’m weak and vulnerable.

But I want to get close and have intimacy 
I used to be comfortable in that
How could I let a few people strip me of my power of peace of mind 
And now when anyone comes close all I can think of is how cold those hands were wrapped around my neck
How I took comfort in my shortness of breath 
Numb to the bruises of my body and the sores on my heart 

And just saying “I love you” brought you back to reality and brought me back to safety

Sometimes I believe my purpose is to be a tool.
My mother used me as a weapon against my father and as a canvas to project the things she hated most about herself.

My “friend” used me as practice to experiment her sexuality, took away my choice of a first kiss.

My first boyfriend rewarded me to his brother and took enjoyment in that.

My first love groomed me for 3 years

My best friend sacrificed my ideologies so he wouldn’t be lonely in his beliefs 

Ex #4 laced my drugs and exorcised me though I had no demons

…

I’m getting caught up in the past again.

I want to let me guard down and accept the kindness but every time I do I usually find myself used in some type of way. 

These walls I’ve built around me feel so safe, everyday it becomes harder to interact with others. 

And I’m sorry I’m not good at sticking around… I’m just really good at convincing myself that I’m undeserving of anyone.

The only issue is, this lease ends in less than 3 months. My roommates will all graduate, move away, and I’ll just be left here. I’ll have another roommate, then I’ll graduate, and I’ll move away. Most of my friends right now are leaving at the end of this semester, or else by the end of next year.

I got Tinder, I’ve had a few matches, but nothing successful. Everyone I’ve matched with has either stopped talking, or I can tell they’re about to.

While I’m not necessarily alone, this shit is lonely. I can’t develop any true friendships like I used to. And even though I’m not in a place where I should be looking for a girlfriend, the connection would sure feel good.

1644,tap5j6,Historical_Usual9473,Hey everyone I guess I'm going to get emotions I'm feeling out right now. A little background on myself is I've been in the Navy for 4 years now and last year I got out of a marriage. During this time I tried doing soul searching and growing and made some good friends even closer. What doesn't help is I still have that creeping feeling of loneliness with me that no matter how close I get with these friends I'm still alone at the end of the day and I think that's what hurts the most. I was an abusive relationship where I just stayed to not be alone and now I feel like relationships are ruined for me that I'm better off alone than with someone who will just hurt me like the last person did. It doesn't feel great that yes I have all these close friends but people who are important to me are so far away from me and it just makes it very rough for me sometimes,2022-03-10 03:15:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613585950,2,/r/lonely/comments/tap5j6/struggling_in_service/,,0,0,Struggling in service
1645,tap6q6,Tiger_237," Last week I began to work, something I have longed to do and hoped would take off many of these negative emotions I have struggled with in the past 4 or so years. After having interacted with my co-workers, I have fallen in the realisation of how lonely I am: I never get text messages at work, my weekend is spent at home doing chores and playing games, I can count how many calls I get every month with a single hand and so on. Working has helped me overcome some of the emotions I have experienced I must admit, but this disconnect between my life and that of others is of grave concern to me.

I have this desire to meet other people and do new things but I get this sort of jealousy and self-hatred whenever I see them have a better life in terms of emotional connections; I want to have meaningful relationships but I panick in fear that I'll get hurt by opening to someone. I spend a lot of time imagining a world where I am not this socially awkward, where I am courageous, etc. but I don't have the knowledge nor the experience to be this idealised version of myself.

Scrolling through social media makes matters worse, I see people hanging out, having fun together, people that I once considered friends but have forgotten about me after years. I feel dead while still breathing - forgotten of, disposed of. 

I hate myself.

I think that I only have about 3-4 years to live.  I'm not sick and dying or anything, but there's a catastrophe and I'm not sure I'm going to try to survive it, so I want to make the most of these next few years.

I've always been a loner, but I've never quite been this isolated before.  It's really weighing on me.

I used to be able to make friends on the internet fairly easily, but I don't know why I can't any more.  The technologies haven't really changed.  Plenty of people still use IRC, there's Reddit here, and a whole fediverse out there.  Yet I don't use them, I guess except for a couple posts on Reddit, most of which are more or less crazy.

I guess I wanted to post this to see if I still exist.  Sometimes I worry I've become a Madoka Magica witch, and I'm all alone in a labyrinth I've created, where there are nothing but dream characters and my wish become a curse.  Or it could be a What Dreams May Come (either Matheson book or Robin Williams film) scenario to similar effect.

Well there are still two people who pay me visits here in my labyrinth at least I'm pretty sure are real, though only text messages can make it in and out.  Sometimes I can use my VR headset to get to the Summerland briefly, but it's difficult for me.  I even made my own avatar, but that didn't help make vibrating high enough to get to that layer of reality any easier.  Instead my vibration always sinks lower, down here, I guess the humans call this hell, but hell is only what you bring with you.

Why would I do this to myself?  I wish I could understand why it's so hard for me to be around other people.  Being around other people was never easy for me, but I don't think it ever used to be this hard.  For now I just cry a lot.

1669,tasci0,[deleted],"Hello, 


I've been on immune system suppressants for nearly half my life. I can count the times I left my neighborhood on the fingers of one hand this pandemic. I am thankful I can work remotely, but I am not sure what I'm doing is healthy.  

My doctors are happy about how seriously I took the pandemic. But I'm not sure if nearly any of my experiences count if I had them all through a screen. 

I think I make people uneasy. Since I got sick very young, I always imagined my peers treated me like an alien. Imagine two scenarios. One - a person you knew who was the loud mouth in the group gets such huge news that their whole life changed around it. My response was to hyper focus on studying and working out (joke being if I ended up in a wheel chair, I'd at least want to look good). I think people don't relate to someone like that - someone doing their best even with the dealt hand. Tying into the next scenario - I read a lot of posts of people like me getting sick later in life and they give into despair. I think there is beauty in struggling to the end. People can't understand if I never have gotten sick, I'd just be a loser. I acted because I had to to be competitive. 

The second - I lack empathy for most troubles. I understand sometimes people need to vent, but unless someone is dead or dying, I just imagine their problem is that they stubbed their toe. It is usually meaningless.

I think even if I were still surrounded with people, I'd still feel lonely. If there were no pandemic, I'd still catch people's colds while we had our empty conversations. I think it is mostly how I act, I've had several coworkers I am on good terms with that accused me of thinking I'm better than everyone else. I'm sickly, I see myself disadvantaged to a normie, but I suppose I built my own advantages too. 

I dunno, I wanted to share I'm an unfeeling monster I guess. I've gotten obsessed with many hobbies over the years and the interactions I had with others have been hollow even with shared interests. I haven't tried to get a social online hobby since the pandemic started and I left the office. With that, I suppose I ought to try again. I just think most people my age are set in their ways at this point. I imagine they had the same friends since chilhood-college, meanwhile I moved almost every year and luckily I was forced to get my phoney people skills instead of being shut in quiet-shy when growing up.

1711,tb15eb,partyanimal678,"Backstory is i (24 yo) do kinda cut a lot of people off in my life. My reasoning is simple, protect my energy. Why stay in situations that are harmful to me? I had a bad home life and wasn’t really able to escape til I was 18 so now I don’t even give people second chances. I’ve begun to wonder if im mildly bipolar or if im actually doing the “right” thing. 

The past couple of months I’ve lived with my boyfriend and his family. Of course me and sister have grown really close. Well recently me and her went to visit her sister at college. I thought we were all very close friends. Well, all weekend they basically ignored me and wouldn’t dance with me and it just felt like I was babysitting. They’re a bit younger than me like 19 and 20. I was so shocked and hurt by this bc they both have ex friends that would kinda use them and they always talk shit about them. But then after that weekend I couldn’t help but feel used. Im only their friend when it’s convient to them it seems like. 

Ever since we got home it’s been really awkward since we live together and I just want my space away from them. I obviously will be friendly with them, they’re my boyfriends little sisters. But idk if I am wrong or AITA for not wanting a “close” relationship with them anymore. I don’t ever give people second chances and Idk if I can ever trust them. They’re hypocritical for being so angry their old friends used them and they turned around and used me. I just moved to this state a year ago and I’ve struggled with my mental health mainly bc I have no friends. My boyfriend isn’t enough, I need a social circle as well. All my best friends live so far away so when I really thought we were true friends, it just hurt to realize I don’t mean anything to them. Maybe it’s our age gap idk. 

My boyfriend won’t talk to me about it bc he doesn’t want to be involved. I don’t really know what to do but I’m glad I could put this out here.

I have a very active social anxiety to the point where I need small earbuds just to be in public. So I have lived most of my life alone, but I worry I have become too comfortable in it.

I worry that I have found safety in solitude. No one to hurt me or abuse me and no drama to deal with. I don't want to be alone. I want to have friends, I want to go to social gatherings, I want to have partners. But I always find myself returning to solitude because it's where I know I am safe.

It's time to start.   
A blank screen with a blinking cursor. 

What is lonely? It's different for everyone. Do we decide it? Is it made? Is it some curse or sickness?

The cursor blinks, and you press keys to produce words. The words are sent, but who sees it?

Do the words of our soul get seen in soulless letters on a page?  


When am I angry?!

When am I sad...?

When do I just feel normal?

Loneliness is something complex, seen and unseen, heard but lacks noise.  


What does loneliness do?

A hand out stretched but unable to grab it?  
Your problem vocalized and brushed away by someone else?  
No patience granted no matter how much you've given?  


What does loneliness do?

Stomachache in your stomach?  
A quickening of breath in the dead of night?  
Wandering thoughts with an endless stare?

People cause it without care.

People cause it feeling justified.

People cause it for their own satisfaction.   


No matter the whens, the whats, the questions unanswered.  
People cause it.  


A desire for togetherness leads to people ghosting?

A desire for acceptance leads to people denying?

A desire for love leads to people hating?

It's a repeating cycle. One on a constant loop.

The cursor blinks, letters appear.

You hit enter. 

It starts again.",2022-03-10 18:11:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1396617718,4,/r/lonely/comments/tb4t8v/a_repeating_cycle_vent_poem_thingy/,,0,1,A Repeating Cycle - vent poem thingy

1742,tb6lqr,dogsrock69,"In high school I had 3 best friends that I would spend so much time with and could just be myself around. My very best friend was the kind of friendship where you promised to marry each other if you werent married by 40 or something.

Well after high school I went 3 hrs away to college while 2 of them went to the same university and the other one settled in the next town over from them. So while I was away at school they would spend time together and I would see it pop up on different social media. It didnt bother me too much, I wasnt there to hang with them, ya know. I got to visit and meet up with them a few times when I was back in town, and 2 of them even came to visit me once at school, but other than that we were just in different places and on different timelines.

I think over time the effort and communication on both sides just dwindled, so it's on everyone, but I cant help feeling so alone, left out, and forgotten. I mean these were my best friends. Were out of college now, I live 3-4 hours away in a different state and we dont really talk anymore. My bestest friend has kids and got married (I was around when she got engaged, but found out the day of the wedding that she got married in a backyard wedding. Of which I saw pictures later of the 3 of them celebrating when I found out about it on fb). And another is getting married soon and idk if I'm going to hear about that wedding or even be invited and it makes me anxious and sad.

Growing apart is on all of us I think, but it just really sucks to see all 3 of them still together and I'm off on my own alone. I have my boyfriend, which I am grateful for him and his friendship, but it's not the same as having my girl best friends. I only came out of college with maybe 1 good girl friend, but we live 5-6 hours apart so I dont get to see her often either.

The whole situation just makes me sad and I want my friends again, but I also feel like maybe were different people now and I'm the oddball out. I want to reach out, but I'm also worried that if I do and try to rekindle our friendship, that itll only be me trying since they still have most of it and I have nothing.

Sorry for the long post, i needed somewhere to vent and I dont really have anyone else to turn to. Maybe I'll reach out soon, I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself.",2022-03-10 19:25:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606864413,2,/r/lonely/comments/tb6lqr/im_the_friend_that_grew_apart_and_it_makes_me_sad/,,0,0,I'm the friend that grew apart and it makes me sad and lonely.

Not only that I'm demisexual and it makes it harder for me to connect with people especially men because of my bad experiences with guys all my life none of it was romantic though. I just want one day a  guy that I am extremely attracted to and like we are friends first and in the end my love is finally reciprocated and to finally hear them say"" hey you look amazing today or I would love to show you off today"" 

But no I've never been in a relationship I've never done anything and if your gonna ask I've always put myself out there I always asked them out  didn't ask or just not think about love at all. I've done all of this throughout my school ( even college ).

All I got was unrequited love every single time and it hurts because I have depression and anxiety so for me being valuerable can be very hard for me to do and devastating. Once I do finally break down my walls and let go I have shove all those feelings right back into a box until the next person comes along rinse and repeat.

Unfortunately our love life is something that is completely out of our control I'm convinced it only finds certain people. 

And if your going to ask yes I do get asked out... it's majority older men who ask me out. ( not into older men and I've had some terrible experiences with that.

I do go to therapy I've been in therapy for 6 years and have been battling this problem since I was a kid I remember I actually wished to have a boyfriend as a kid and throw my coin in the well. 

Anyways thanks for listening I'm still having a hard time today but I really hope one day one damn day I'll have a boyfriend/husband and my love will finally be recpoicated and he will have the characteristics I do want in a guy and he is emotionally available and not unavailable. 

Unfortunately a lot of my friends don't understand my struggles and how long I've been doing this dating thing and even they are confused why I don't have any success. 

I do like a guy still but it was unrequited...

My parents are very supportive of me doing this and I actually can afford to be not working while looking for the job of my dreams. It may take some time but I know I can do it. She didn't have my back with this and broke up with me. I'm devastated. She said that we could still be friends but as much as I love her I just can't do that. I did it in the past with the other relationship and I got hurt really bad. Also I feel that I cannot be friends with a person that decided to leave me like this after all we've been through. And it's kinda frustrating the fact that she knows everything about me, and she knows what happened with my other ex. And proceeded to do even worse to me. We had a last dialogue and after me trying for the last time to get her back, we said we were cool. And after some time I blocked her on social media and deleted her number. Because although we weren't following each other, she watched all my insta stories and stuff, so I blocked her, also to help me resist the urge to go and watch her stuff. I won't hear from her ever again, only if I reach out to her and I know she would accept to be friends if I asked her. But I can't do that. I know I must move on and continue with my life, but at the same time, she is the love of my life. And I feel powerless. There's nothing else I can do. If a step has to be taken now it's on her hands, and it's not gonna happen even if I have trouble just accepting it. I feel lonely. I have friends but we live far from each other so I only see them like once a month. And I just don't feel like sending them messages bothering them with my problems. When I wasn't with my ex we would text all the time constantly. It was the only constant in my life and I loved her as much as I possibly could. I want her back. I really do. But in the reality I'm in right now I have no one to talk to. Most of the time I'm with my thoughts and by the story you are reading you can know that they're not the best ones. And I'm really afraid of what's gonna do to me. I really miss her. I just wish she could be more supportive and understand my dreams and what I want. I never felt for any other person what I felt for her. It always seemed to me like an opportunity of a lifetime. And it brings me down so much this outcome after 3.5 years, out of the blue, just leaving. I was all this time, one person away of feeling lonely. But she was the only one I could trust. And I held on to her way too much, because I loved her way too much. I just wish she said something to me. I'm still reachable if she wants to. It just doesn't happen. And I'm here now because I have nobody to talk to about this. It used to be her. Thanks for reading and sorry for my English.

1778,tbdfnx,MoosePowerful3475,I’ve been fairly lonely my whole life and just started college. I tried really hard in high school to make friends and get a friend group but depression kept fighting me. My mood made it hard to talk to anyone without getting nervous to the point I had nothing to say. I’d thought about suicide the entirety of high school and made an attempt recently. I left a note for friends and they told campus who told a professor I got close with and my mom. I just had to pickup when those two called but I still wish I succeeded. I’ve been doing therapy and got more meds but nothing can seem to help me. I’m still hopeless and think I’m gonna live out my life alone. I hate that I have social needs I can’t seem to sate. I’m filled with self hate that I can’t live right and I’m tired of coping. What makes me feel inadequate is seeing others living and having fun while I’m on the outside unable to contribute. I joined a frat through a somewhat good friend. I can get the occasional girl but they never stay. I fall in love quite easily because of how lonely I am. I can’t convince myself I’m worthy. I want to stop hating myself in social settings and classes. I’m afraid I’ll never be who I want to be which is a happy guy with a devoted girlfriend and loving friends. I think I shouldn’t have kids when I get older because I won’t be able to make a happy family. I’m hardworking did AP classes and have all A’s throughout high school and last semester. My career prospects are strong but everything surrounding a career and school is what brings me to my knees and ask what God would make someone like me?,2022-03-11 00:29:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630203069,1,/r/lonely/comments/tbdfnx/tired_of_feeling_inadequate/,,0,1,Tired of Feeling Inadequate

ive tried moving away, across state lines, but the feelings just haunt me and drive me to the point that i cant even talk to people like at bars or at shows anymore because im just, terrified of it all coming back. and im so desperately lonely but also so desperately terrified of being hurt again and it being made my problem again. 

thing is the guy who did this to me went down for abusing someone who people liked a whole lot more than either of us. so i cant even get like comeuppance or closure. him turning out to be a horrific predator somehow didnt make anyone reconsider what happened to me and i just, idk man, it sucks. i see all my old friend and pals and colleagues in music doing shit and saying all this wonderful shit about supporting survivors and all this queer solidarity stuff and i know i cant point out the hypocrisy cuz my voice has already been silenced. just wish the world worked more kindly",2022-03-11 04:15:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1364273607,1,/r/lonely/comments/tbhn26/i_just_dont_really_know_what_to_do/,,0,0,i just dont really know what to do

I talked deeply with the man I love. He has been so attentive to my needs and wants. I want to be attentive to his needs and wants. I want to stop drowning on my sorrow for his behalf. I imagine a bright future for he and I. I want it. 

Tomorrow I swear I will fight myself for him. I will fight my deepest ache and hurt to reassure him that my effort is true. To tell him I mean everything in my words I mean to show him action regardless of the hurt that burns my bones. 

I love him. I love him so much that I'm willing to love the shitty person in myself for his behalf. I want so badly to be his. For him to be mine. For him to mark my skin as much as he marked me as a person. I would not be who I am today without him. 

I am so alone because of the hurt that plagues me day and night. But I want to fight it. I want to fight it for he and I. So I would know what happiness is. I dont deserve it, god no. Yet my other hasn't ever ceased to give himself to me. He would never understand my pain but I wouldn't doubt that he would try to understand it for me. 

I don't want my significant other to know my pain. I don't think I'd be able to get him out of the hole I struggle in myself. I will seek help when I have the money and resources. I swear. I want it. For both myself and him. I want to be happy. I want it so bad.

1830,tbk34o,SensitiveLilFuck,"Basically 4 months ago I became severely disabled, I'm bed bound. For a while I couldn't even talk and my partner had to help feed me and literally had to sleep all day.

Luckily I've improved a bit since then, still bedbound but improving.

This whole thing... has been so traumatizing, aside from losing my independence the hardest thing has been having my loved ones treat me like an object and forget my humanity.

My parents told me I was selfish for suddenly being so ill, as if I'm faking. When I stayed at their house they basically refused to feed me because they said I'd get fat if I didn't move.

Obviously couldnt stay there, so went to my partner and her family's house. And after 2 months,  though their not inherently bad people, they want me gone... and for a second it seemed my partner was going to leave me aswell. She said some horrible things to me, out of stress and not being able to cope. Basically she couldnt do it.. and it hurt so much, in all these months it felt like she believed in me and then suddenly she didn't.

In that moment she said that... I thought I'm never going to get better because no one cares enough to help me. 4 months is a long time, but not a long time in the scheme of life.

Everyone gives up so fast..

I'm worried I'm just going to end up in a nursing home at 21, and just not have the healing environment and love I need. 

 I had friends, family and a partner and though my partner is still here.. I just don't feel safe right now. I hate feeling so vulnerable.

what if its just this? what if my life is just supposed to be like this? just feeling like shit everyday cause everyone else have someone that actually cares about them and im here, trying and trying again

i hate this, i hate this so much sometimes i just want to dissapear until everything's finally better

everyone else just live their life like normal and then they're just, there, its love, why cant that happen to me too? im talking and meeting new people, hoping for the chance of them liking me

its been years you know? and at this point, every day its just shit, im never good enough for anyone really

but i keep thinking about that moment when i'll know that all this was worth it, all the stupid night feeling like shit and crying, everytime i felt alone while everyone else around me had someone, all of that will be worth it when i find him, i'll finally feel loved too, i'll feel like im important to someone, i'll be able to make someone happy just by being myself...i'll have someone that understands me and likes me and doesnt regret it afterwards, i wont feel alone against the world anymore...i'll finally wont be alone

but its been years and nothing...i just hope i find him soon...im so tired of trying and feeling horrible afterwards...i think i've just, needed someone more times than i can count

i just want to know how to finally make it happen, how to find him and finally be able to have a happy fucking life like everybody else does

1847,tbnfhp,RevolutionaryGrape09,"
(Sorry for my bad english, pls don’t attack me) 
I met someone from this hub a while ago, everything was okay and we were talking for a month and then was together for almost 4 months already.. But sadly it didn’t end well and we broke up 2 days ago. 

I have very bad mental health, I sometimes would hurt myself, get mad at him for being busy, get jealous easily, fall asleep while we were talking (because we are 7 hours apart) and I can see he is trying his best to comfort me but Idk why I can never be satisfied and want more from him. 

I’ve never been treated properly before I met him, he is the first one to ever care about me, to listen to me, to comfort me. He bought me gifts and the first time he got me a nice bouquet of flowers, there’s a card saying ‘for my favourite person halfway across the globe’. I got him gifts as well and a crocheted flower bouquet and also told him that my love for him will never die just like these flowers… sadly we didn’t end well

Before we broke up, I’m still settling down for Uni and he is busy with his work so we did not spend much time talking and I got angry and over exaggerate and said that I will go fuck another guy in which I never did but I just wanted to see if he would care but he didn’t, the next morning he said he wanted to tell me something and he did not reply to me when I said ‘i love you’ to him and after that he decided to end it all. He told me he met someone unplanned from work, and he likes her too.. I wonder how.. how can a heart changed so fast when 2 days before we broke up we said ‘i love you’ to each other and ever since we’ve been together we said so much ‘i love you’ .. apparently it isn’t enough. 

He told me to find new love again, and someone will love me again. I begged and begged him to not breakup with me but he said he is not happy, he is not strong anymore, his heart changed and he fall out of love.. he did not see any future with me cause we are so far away.. he wanted me to wake up from my dream.. The dream that I’ve been trying to work on..I planned on meeting him after I graduate next year.. and now it is all really a dream that will never come true. I still remember significantly a few months ago he said to his friend that he love me regardless of our location.. 

I wonder if I’m not needy, if I have better mental health, if I didn’t say all those nasty words, if I didn’t get jealous so easily, If I care more about how he feels..this won’t happened.. I still love him dearly and I know we are not possible anymore but part of me, is still hoping.. I’m sorry.. this all happened way too fast, I didn’t expect it at all and I miss him so much. He won’t see this cause he block me already but I just wanted to say that you were the best part of me, I’m sorry I am not a good partner for you.

1865,tbrcg5,CoyPotato,"A few months ago I got divorced from a wife that ghosted me for a month. Won’t go into details but I shipped off and we did paperwork and it was great, planning the future.


Well, now I’m alone. Emotionally lonely and physically feeling unattractive.. my best friend just got engaged today too. But, I’m extremely happy for him and hope to continue being in his life.


So where’s the punchline? I just got a car. Great condition for its age as it used to be a show car in Japan. It handles amazingly and perfect for my first manual car. I’m still getting the hang of it, but it’s a skill! And today, my first day driving it, I didn’t stall until I parked haha!


I got a new car. It’s my new relationship. And it’ll make for a good conversation.

Also anyone wanna play Apex on London servers later and have some beers? Lol

1906,tbxwoe,Maleficent-Credit-87,"There are a lot of time that I'm thinking about stuff related to social &amp; environment issues and philosophy questions, but I have no one to talk about it. I can reach out someone who can just talk to me, but their response always disappoints me, so I rather not to ask them. They are not my closed friends too. General people don't like to listen and talk about serious question they actually need to concern, even if so, they're point of view is just shallow that I don't dare to listen, especially the ppl who always split things into black and white. 

Examples: Like... eating meat is bad because you are taking away lives. (Plants: are we not living ? What about other carnivorous creatures?)  Like... humans are just greedy and evil, and just let it be we can't change anyway. ( Gene is selfish at different aspect in order to survive, not just humans; evil and kindness both exist in humanity, I won't deny one side or another side, but why don't we just try to be kinder?)

 It's lonely and helpless that only a few people who care about what you care about; it makes you think your value is less important. 

When I'm sharing my viewpoint, some people can get why you feel that way, but they don't relate to you that strong, which they won't act for you but just give you lip service.  They feel so far away, like  bystanders. 

Also I don't find most of the memes funny on the internet, I'm always like ' what's the funny part ? Why there're so many likes???' 

I don't use Tik Tok; I rarely use Instagram; I deleted my twitter; I hate staring at digital device for killing time; I like deep conversation; I want adventures ; I want to do what I like with supportive people.   

People now in general: use Tik Tok and play it all day; the first thing they know you is ask your Instagram account;  stare at phone whenever they can; avoid deep conversation; avoid risks and action;  slave for the society.

Ya, I know everyone is tired...then can't you see the problem with the society?

At the moment, I just feel so lonely that the society is going so fast pace.

I mean, we’ve been friends since 2019 I think?… and it’s 2022 now… so I guess that’s a good sign? All things considered.”

Friend: “man idk? how am i supposed to know something like that”

Idk… I guess it’s not exactly the response I was hoping for. They’ve always been there for me, and some days they’re very emotionally supportive, but other days they’re emotionally constipated… I guess how I took the response is because you’re not sure if we will always be in each other’s lives you’re not sure of our friendship and therefor our friendship doesn’t mean anything to you. In reality I get life happens and none of us can guarantee our place in another person’s life. I’ve had many “friends” promise they would always be there only to leave later.

1971,tc5u2f,ImStillAliveFuckers,"Gonna try my best to have no NSFW/triggers in this post, but it needs to be real too, so🤷🏽‍♀️

It was 7:32 Friday night when I started writing this.

I have extra money. Got me medicine. I want to go out or invite people over.

My siblings are too busy to come by or out of town.

No friends because I actually have standards, learned the hard way you can't just befriend EVERYBODY who's lonely too.

Dunno if this post will show up, last one I tried to post here didn't appear.

Cleaned my whole dang apartment as of a couple hours ago. Gave my cat an extra good day.

I remember being homeless, stuck under a bench in 30 somethin degree weather with only dirty clothes to keep warm.

I remember losing so, SO many fights to the worst people.

I remember calling support lines, only to feel worse than before the call was made.

I know it's okay to be alone, but it shouldn't be this consistent.

I know it's alright to have standards, but the loneliness hurts so freaking much.

My brain is telling me ""the only 2 house guests you've had over were TERRIBLE, you wanna go through that AGAIN?!""

My heart is/emotions are telling me ""you're going to find exactly who you want and need to talk to""

After how many times though, I wonder?

How many people are going to steal what's left of my kindness?

How much of my time will be wasted on folks who won't stick around?

Will I ever find someone to talk with on the phone late at night/early in the morning?

Why can't I have even just one real friend who likes and accepts me?

I know now the problem is only a little me, but it's the fault of most people.

I cannot accept overly religious, anti-alternative medicine, 1 gender-hating, alcohol-worshipping folks.

I won't settle for people who give unhelpful advice, people who can't stand cussing and especially won't settle for people who are stuck in the 1950's.

Yes, I would be very happy to have a guest.

Yes, I'd be excited to go out with someone/people.

It'd be great, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen.

Maybe I'm just cursed to have my time/kindness/resources wasted the rest of this lifetime.",2022-03-12 01:56:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606689033,10,/r/lonely/comments/tc5u2f/genuinely/,,0,11,Genuinely?

1983,tc748q,[deleted],"27F from Malaysia here.

I known plenty of friends but they all ghosted me despite the fact that I do make it known to them that I seek a long-term friendship with them. I hate how they are always seemingly ""too busy"" to hang out with me and yet I see them hanging out with other people. I often get left on read by my friends all the time but I always see them on their phones when they are out in public. 

And online dating is just as bad. I go on the plenty of dates. And it seems like I click with them. And they tell me they want a second date with me. And poof, I find out they have ghosted me when I try contacting them about confirming our second date. 

I hate how my ""friends"" always make me feel like as if I have no friends at all. I hate how everybody is so unapproachable these days. I hate investing my time and energy in a new person then for them to fade away. I know for sure that I am a nice person. I don't touch people inappropriately or make creepy or racist jokes around people. 

I am sick of being nobody's priority no matter how nice I try to be. I wish people would just straight up tell me they don't want to be friends with me from the beginning. I hate being lead on. I wish people know how much it makes me sad to be treated like this all the time.

1997,tc98o4,floppyjukebox,"I just need a place to rant. This sucks. So much. And no, I’m not fishing for attention, im not being too hard on myself, and im not over-exaggerating. I am absolutely hideous and it’s just a fact. Like, the sky is blue, and I am ugly. Anyone with even one eye would confirm if. If somehow, my face went viral, the comments about how revolting I look would never end, comparison after comparison to gross looking ugly characters/animals/things. I’m one of those people. 

I was born female but honestly, nobody would guess. Even if I was a guy, I’d still be ugly as hell. It’s not just that I’m masculine. My face is just sad. Idk what sort of genes I was cursed with to live this atrocity but every day is harder and harder. 

Idek what it is. I mean, I have a crooked nose with a bump on it and I’m actually getting surgery for that. But that’s not the only issue. I wish it was. It’s my entire face. Just the way my eyes look, my brows, my face shape, my expression, everything. 

I look like a monster. I’m so unattractive I wanna hide my face from myself. 
I feel like I can never be loved or truly be happy like this. I feel so disgusting and undesirable. And it isn’t even my fault. I feel like nobody will wanna get to know me or see my personality because of my horrendous looks. 

I feel so embarrassed around people cause I know they’re all thinking about how ugly and weird looking I am. I don’t even smile cause I hate my teeth so much and my smile makes me look even more like a deformed alien. 

Even after I get my nose job, I don’t think I’ll be happy cause my entire face is a mess. I’m so jealous of those small, petite cute feminine looking girls and would literally die to be one of them. 
I’ve been misgendered quite a few times before and called a man but honestly that’s not even the worst of it. 

I just always ask myself, “why me? What did I do to deserve this?” Being THIS ugly automatically makes life 1000x more difficult, as I saw a post somewhere saying being ugly is just playing life on hard mode. Oh man, it sure is, and for my level of ugliness, that would still be an understatement. If anyone woke up with my face, they’d probably wanna die. And I myself would feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for everyone I walk past just that they had to see me. Nowadays, I wear a mask and sunglasses wherever I go, even if people think I’m weird for it, I’d rather they think that than see my face. 

As for my body, I mean I’m 5’7” which I’m insecure about cause woohoo, masculine height too, and I’m not obese or anything but I am plump. 

Anyway, it’s my face that’s the main issue. It doesn’t matter what kind of wigs I wear, how much makeup I cake on, or how amazing my outfit is. None of it can make up for or hide the monstrosity that is my face. Makeup doesn’t make me look any different and my case is so bad I’m not even sure plastic surgery would help. 

I cant stop feeling like crap about myself. 
It’s ruining my life and taking over my entire mind. What can I do to not care anymore? It ruins my confidence and gives me the worst social anxiety ever. I cant socialize or feel comfortable around people at all and I despise going out or doing video chats. I am extremely lonely and know nobody would ever wanna be close to me. I look like I’d have flies swarming around me or smell like rancid sewage mixed with rotten eggs. I don’t think I’ll ever even have a decent friendship, let alone a relationship.",2022-03-12 05:21:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646429692,39,/r/lonely/comments/tc98o4/im_ugly_as_hell_and_i_hate_my_life_because_of_it/,,0,11,I’m ugly as hell and I hate my life because of it.

There was this guy I really liked recently, and I started to become really attached to him. It’s usually hard for me to be vulnerable around people because I’ve been hurt so much. But with him, I felt safe to be myself without being judged. So, I asked him out on a date and he said yes. I was really excited and happy. I hung out with him a lot after that, and we kinda flirted and everything. But the other day out of nowhere, he just casually mentions he got back with his ex girlfriend a few days ago. After I heard that, all those negative feelings instantly came flooding to the surface. I felt like I wasn’t even important enough for him to let me know he got back with her. I told my mom about what happened, and she promised to take me to dinner the next day- which would’ve really cheered me up. I haven’t been able to spend much time with her since the pandemic. The next day though she never called me, and was posting on Facebook all day. I don’t have many friends because I’m so scared to be myself around people and I’m worried that I’m weird. All I want is someone I can be myself around. 

Yesterday I saw him again, and he hugged me unprompted when he left. It made me feel really sad. That night I messaged a guy on Grindr (mostly just wanting to talk to someone) and I walked over to his house and we were gonna watch a movie and hook up. Desperate to connect to someone, I told him a lot about myself and what I go to school for and my passion. He started to fall asleep, and we ended up not hooking up and I went home. I know he probably was sleepy, but I can’t stop thinking about what if he thought I was weird and kicked me out when he realized he wasn’t attracted to me. I texted him and told him that I’m sorry if I was weird or anything, he hasn’t answered though and has been online. I feel so unloveable. I feel like maybe I’m expecting too much of people, but really all I want is someone I can be comfortable with and share who I am uncensored.

I mean never. I am home 24/7. I’ve grown accustomed to solitude. To not dealing with other peoples Bs. But lately ive felt lonely. I’m getting tired of the constant solitude. Sometimes it is welcome but sometimes I want more. I’m not close with my family. Reaching out to them in our current state doesn’t sound good. I have an extremely solitary life. I wish it wasn’t this way and at this point idk how to change it or if I I have the social skills necessary to do so. 23M,2022-03-12 06:44:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592888868,8,/r/lonely/comments/tcaif2/reaching_out_to_people_and_changing/,,0,3,Reaching out to people and changing

He then started coming to the gym with me more often with his gf until, we saw an old hs friend (we’ll name him Jake) working out by himself, and invited him to come join us. So we started working out together for a couple of months, and hanging out together, until Matt and jake started working together, that’s where Matt completely ditched me. 

Matt and jake started hitting the gym their own time with no invite.

Hey there. I recently just made a reddit and this reddit page pop out of nowhere and I just need to vent to someone in this page how I overthink that I will be alone forever. I just feel like I do not have a soulmate out in this world and its hard for me to talk to a girl. (There is a girl who I’m interested in and had the courage to try to make the first move yesterday. She really appreciate the comment I gave her but nothing went to far, I am just proud this is the first time I tried shooting my shot for the first time ever.) Anyways back on track, all my friends are getting in a relationship and I don’t really hangout with them anymore since they are leaning to their relationships. I haven’t been in a relationship in 6 years and haven’t talked to a girl in 4 years. (I am 20 years old btw.) I just feel like no girl or women will ever like me or approach me in public. I know I am still a bit to young to think about this but soon I will graduate for a University in the next upcoming school year and at my age is where I should go express and find someone to love but I just been super shy and I just don’t want to start a random conversation with a girl because I don’t want to make them uncomfortable or think I am weird.

2037,tcdavn,Great-Entertainer-77,When I was a kid my mom would beat me half to death everyday. She told me often I was worthless. At school everyone bullied me for trying to hard to make friends for wearing ripped and cheap clothes. For showing up with tears in my face. For being poor. For being ugly. Now I just turned 21 I went to a bar. I realized how fucked I am. I dropped out off college.planning on returning don’t know when. Everyone there was tall. Attractive. I’m 5’6. And ugly. I have been extremely antisocial and lonely my entire life. I used to fantasize about my crushes waay too much as a kid. When my mom was hurting me. When I was alone which was pretty much always. I left my moms house 3 days after I turned 18. I’m 21 and realized how dangerous my  dissociation has become towards me. In high school I fantasized about this girl when things were bad at home or when I was lonely so pretty much always. Everytime I got hit or my mom said something to me I thought about her. I was forced to get over her after high school. Now it’s happening again. A coworker I met began flirting with me. After a couple weeks she stopped keep in mind she never saw my face until now. She no longer flirts after she saw how I looked like. I’ve been trying to make myself look better. After years of neglect I got braces and I’ve been using skincare products. I also really suck at talking to people but she gives me the cold shoulder often. How do I get over her. How do I not fall for people because people like me don’t get happy endings. How do I stop obsessing over her. I wish this wasn’t a problem. This feels like love but it can’t be.  I’ve never been in a relationship. I’m too stupid too ugly I can’t believe I thought I had a chance look at me and look at her she’s perfect I am not.,2022-03-12 10:03:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618658447,10,/r/lonely/comments/tcdavn/disassociating_through_abuse_as_a_kid_about_girls/,,0,2,Disassociating through abuse as a kid about girls

My brain is imploding on itself lately, I have a higher opinion of myself than i have in a really long time, i've had days where i can look in the mirror and smile at the person i am, give myself credit for things i never would have a year ago.

And yet my social life, anxiety and loneliness has never been worse.

To clarify, my friends are truly wonderful and i've felt genuinely well liked by my peers over the last few months, up until a few weeks ago when my mental state deteriorated to a point lower than its ever been before, i've started thinking that my friends attempts to hang out with me are just out of pity, like theyre too afraid to be the person that wasn't nice to the quiet, shy guy.

I hooked up with someone who i had great chemistry with for the first time in years, thought everything was going great, only to be stuck in this familiar situation where it seems they dont want to speak to me, or have anything to do with me for that matter, leaving me feeling needy and pathetic.

It feels like i cant seem to find a single spare moment where i can just reflect on what is real without thinking that everyone i know and love just hates me, even as i type this my brain is going a million miles an hour, like i cant just latch onto a single idea or thought.

I don't know if i need advice, i just think i wanted this to be scrawled somewhere other than inside my brain, i'm exhausted and just trying not to give up.

2063,tcigbb,konerakgod,"I used to have a busy social life back in my home country. I went out almost everyday with different groups of friends and was active on social media. I moved to another country about a year ago at 17 cause the busy, hectic city life got the better of me and i live alone with my grandmother now. 

I’ll be doing my a-levels this year so i told myself at the beginning of the year that i’ll take this opportunity, since i’m all alone, to repress all my urges and focus all my energy on studying. This plan has been working well so far, especially during the week, when i push all my problems aside and am able to work all day. But everything comes crashing down once the weekend arrives and i’m left alone. I only have 1 close friend in this new country and although we are extremely tight, he just can’t hang out with EVERY weekend. So on weekends that i’m left alone, i just spiral out of control. I get self-conscious, look at my friends’ instagram stories, stare at mirrors for hours thinking about which parts of my face need work done etc. I also think about drinks, drugs and sex, all the shit i used to do back at home, just to feel AWFUL about myself and the “life” i’m missing out on. As of now, i don’t even drink cause if i get drunk on a friday/saturday, the hangover will stop me from studying the next day and i don’t like that.

I have had offers on grindr to do a bit of drugs but i’m in a sort of a dilemma cause i’ve worked so hard this past year to build this strict study routine and i don’t want it to disappear, my goal is to still do well for my a-levels which are coming in a few months.

But on the other hand, it’s getting really lonely over here, i wish i knew someone who knows what i’m going through…",2022-03-12 15:15:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643630274,1,/r/lonely/comments/tcigbb/how_to_deal_with_repression/,,0,0,How to deal with repression?

I didn't know why I'm trying to over-achieve or why do I keep trying to be part of as many projects as possible, sacrificing my own free time...

2108,tcr3fx,randomredditor007_,"Ever since I took birth. Every one used to make my fun only except my mom. I had curly hairs and my forehead is relatively bigger than usual. I was thin and got beaten by people whom I considered my best friends. So, everyone made fun of me regarding that.. also, since I was a complete looser to everyone.
I was ashamed of myself to even look into the mirror because everyone made of fun of my face my body my hair... My life!.
Never did girls talk to me since I looked ugly.
After my +2, I was preparing for the premier institutes of country for my undergrads. I failed terribly. This time, I was looser to my family too.
Anyhow, landed in some tier3 college.
In final year, I fell in love with one girl. I confessed my feelings to her, got my heartbroken but I didn't stop there.. I literally begged her for love a couple of times after getting rejected once, so one day she told me that why she didn't like me because ""You are so slim.. you're a complete looser.. look at you you bald(i wasn't bald though) since my forehead was big and yes, i was having hairfall tho.. but not like, that one would call me bald for that."" Anyways, i tried to move on. I got a job finally.. thought that I could do sth for my family now.
But fate wasn't in a mood.. Sooner my workplace started to become so toxic that I couldn't even sleep for more than 3 hrs.. but this was also not enough.
I found that my dad invited one lady who was in some kind of family relation in June, 2021 (when covid pandemic 2nd wave was at it's deadliest). And yes, very soon I got to know that he invited her to our house because it was my dad's plan to invite her to our house along with her kids so that they can fuck each other right behind our back, when my mom was sleeping and no one can doubt on them.
He used to tell my mom that he's taking her to shop sth for her husband and her kids but what they did was book a hotel and again fuck each other.. have a lot of sex.
She stayed in our house for 3 weeks..I thought she'd never come back to our house(since my mom didn't like her and when she told to my dad then he would scream at her that she's narrow-minded) HYPOCRISY.. WOW.
But again, my dad invited her again to our house after 1 month. This time she came alone. All this time, my mom had doubt on that bitch, but I used to tell her that there's nothing like that. My dad can never do this to us. He just likes to show off to people his status because all this time, i never knew these stuff. I had doubt tho but only a little.
But I found out about my dad's cheating 2 months back.
I heard her sexting that motherfucker bitch who made our lives miserable for always.
Now, my dad is in an extramarital affair with that lady and he's forgotten us. He just pretends to be ""A family man"".
All these years my father was my hero. But now, my belief system is shaken.
Now, that I can't get the girl whom I loved like crazy (even if she didn't reciprocate) and I just can't move on.. also I'm loosing hair at a rapid speed that I know my hair wouldn't be for so long.. and my family/friends would again make fun of my baldness because they are just like that.. and also, since my father.. my belief system is now shaken.. I have no one's shoulder to cry on. I want to cry my hearts out for hours, but I have no one. I can't cry in front of my mom since she's already dealing with a lot and I want to support her like a mountain and be a HERO for her. If she sees me crying then she will become even more weak. My best friends have also parted ways from me.. they're all busy and seems like I'm the only one who always makes effort to unite the friendship.
Now I've reached this stage of my life... that I know... I won't be here for much time.

I join several discord servers hoping to make a connection with someone other than my family, but every server everyone already knows everyone but me and they cant know me cuz i dont know how to fit in without annoying anyone. I had plenty of times where i join a discord vc so i can hear peoples voice to feel closer. it goes alright at the beginning than more people join and i mute cuz im scared. i just listen while they all have fun and i cry. i play sad music and listen to people have connections i might never have and cry my eyes out till my head hurts. then everyone leave the vc and im just there realizing i'm meant to be alone forever in my room

2123,tcul1c,Throwaway67884376,"He was like a brother to me. The closest friend I ever had. And we never even met irl. Out of all the friends I had, he was the only one that also considered me his best friend. And out of all the people that have been a part of my life, he was also the only one I would consider to be part of my ""my people"" group. After almost 25 years on this earth, I finally got to know what a genuine and extremely close friendship feels like. We knew things about each other that no one else knew. Literally every day we talked on Discord and we often played games together. Aside from being my best friend, he was also pretty much the only person I talked to regularly. I just loved him so damn much (as a friend).

But a few months ago, our friendship came to a sudden and unexpected end. He just said he wanted to move on and to this day, I still don't understand why. One day we were still friends, the next one he ended our friendship. With him gone, I feel so lonely. I still miss him a lot. It's like I'm mourning the loss of a brother I have always been very close with. And looking at all the things we talked about and did together, the way we interacted, all the little things, ... I just can't imagine anyone being able to ever replace him. Especially considering it took me 25 years to find a friend like him. And I don't want to replace him either tbh. I feel like if I do start making new friendships that could potentionally live up to the kind of friendship I had with this guy, I feel like it would just remind me too much of him and that would make me feel more depressed again. Even hearing the Discord ringtone will probably always remind me of him and our friendship, just like looking at all the games that we played together and reading or hearing about his interests that he introduced me to.

I should find a new (best) friend, but I just can't. It's too painful to do so. And in a way I also don't want to give up on the hope I still have that one day he'll come back. But the loneliness I feel right now is also really painful.

Forever had social anxiety that made me a lot forgiven and not judgmental towards others.

I don’t care weather ppl like me or not, just want them off my head and space.

I don’t like to be accommodating to others no more.

I’m not necessarily fine with being alone but when I weigh the above I’m gladly fine with it.

My friends whom are dear to my heart, require a lot of accommodation with time and emotions… so on

Was fine with it. But now I can’t stand the sight of any of them. Not just to not be accommodating to their needs which I’m totally capable of but with “I don’t wanna be around none”

I try to make friends but it never goes anywhere. I try and join all sorts of discord server, but I never seem to be able to make friends no matter how hard I try. I join clubs at school (HS student), and I just try so fucking hard. Often times I feel it's because it's based off of a lack of common ground: a lack of shared interests.

For some reason, I just can't watch movies or TV, nor can I bear most social media (I like reddit because of the anonymity). I like to read, but I only really read nonfiction history. I play bagpipes (I'm on track to being a professional player in a few years actually), but I hate talking about it to seemingly anyone but teachers and judges.

At this point in writing the post I have lost my angle of what I'm trying to say. It was a question of if my inability to enjoy the bread and circuses of modern society has something to do with my loneliness, or if it's something else entirely?

2144,tcwncr,[deleted],"Longish post.. TL;DR at the botom

Hey, I'm a 20 y/o guy, working and not in school, and the friend I'm talking about is another 20 y/o guy not working but in school and he's currently studying abroad in Ireland and we're both from the US. We actually live in the same town now, previously we lived an hour away from each other with his college being about twenty minutes from me, as I moved here due to unrelated reasons.

He's my closest and pretty much my only friend, the only one I talk to about everything. We're friends with benefits (I'm gay, he's bisexual), and I love him dearly. He's been gone since January and I'm missing him so much; we called like once a week in the first month that he left, but it faded off as he got busier, which is understandable but I really do miss him and worry about his mental health as well. From talking to him, it sounds like he isn't doing very well, he told me that he ""lost a friend that he was close to back home"" (it seemed like he meant they are deceased, but I'm really not sure), and he's barely online. He's struggled with body dysmorphia and also has depression (and is on antidepressants.) I am just so utterly worried for him and my check-ups seem so lacking in substance.

He is also not online very much or nearly integrated into technology as I am, and when most people my age as as awfully obsessed with their phones as I am, it can be a struggle to understand him not responding for several hours or leaving me on read because text just doesn't seem as big of a deal to him and I don't think he picks up on common text tones. Good for him, but I just get so anxious (struggling with lifelong anxiety.) Because of this I prefer phone calls over texting with him over anything else, but I don't want to force that either. I'm just so worried about him, and I miss him, and I'm just very lonely. I'm trying to make friends through work but it's just hard especially because I'm in a rough spot.

This is really how our last text conversation looks:

Me: Hey

Him: (2hrs later) Hey man

Me: How are u doing?

Him: I'm okay

Got some late assignments in last night

I've been a whole mess lol

Me: It's definitely understandable

I just want to check in ig

I miss talking

Him: I'll try and find a good time for it

I'm trying to get back in touch w a few people lol

Me: Probably good

... and that's it. I just don't know how to talk to him because I get so sad about missing him. He'll be back in June, but I'm just so stressed out about shit that all I want to do is spend time dicking around with him.

How the hell do I actually talk to him ?? He reassured me just the other day that he's grateful to have me as a friend and THANKED me for how I treat him, but I still doubt myself constantly. Luckily I am seeing a therapist next week, for the first time in quite awhile, but it won't make me stop missing him.

TL;DR I'm really missing a close friend and FWB of mine but struggling to sound genuine when talking to him as I try not to project my sadness/loneliness onto him.

2149,tcx5e2,barry_b_b3ns0n,"It's been so long since I've had any sort of friend that I don't even think I know how to anymore. I do know how to play Minecraft and Terraria though, and Switch games like Pokemon or MK8 or Groove Coaster. I'm also good at making a fool of myself and being a detriment to my team in Valorant, CS:GO, and TF2 . I'd really prefer a casual gaming partner, I don't want to have to deal with anyone other than myself telling me I suck and I should get good. And if you're trash, that's cool too. I don't really give a shit about winning as long as we're having fun.

I've got a shitty pc though (just a school laptop) , so I can't play too much fun stuff. Like don't expect me to hop on Elden Ring or anything, Apex is the most it can handle and that is \*severely\* pushing it, to the point I worry about it.  I'm honestly shocked that it can run Valorant, even if it is at 90% RAM the whole time. But I'll mainly be on pc since the online stuff is free here. If we hit it off though, I might renew my XBL or Nintendo Online subs if you got somethin you're itchin to play on them.

Ideally, I'd love to have 2 or \*maybe\* 3 people about 20-30 years old to start a new minecraft or terraria world with. I feel like those are the best for making friends on. If this sounds like something you're interested in, please comment first instead of pm-ing first; that way if I flake out, you can at least still see each other.

Lastly, please note that this is a test. I have no idea if I'll be able to do this. It may take too much out of me, and I may ghost you. It wouldn't be your fault if it happens, but it definitely could happen.

Edit: Oh, and I guess my gender and age might be important information for some people when deciding, and I could include a brief introduction as well. I'm a 22 y/o guy, currently in a community college for a start towards chemistry degree, unemployed for the moment cuz I got good scholarships, terrified of driving to the point that I can't and that keeps me feeling isolated, trying to learn Japanese, love math, can kinda play the guitar and sister instruments, and.....

How do I stop this?

I feel like I do this because I secretly crave attention, I dunno.. I’m just so sad and lonely within myself that when someone is even remotely nice to me I see the good in them and just idk start to like em a lil.. 

I guess you could say that I’m also desperate to be in a relationship, never been in one or had anything with a male so I try and find love in all the wrong places.. even then I get shut down. 
I guess that’s why I fall in love so quickly, if a guy shows some sort of interest then I just jump so quickly into it and obviously that scares them away, even when I don’t mean to do that. 
I just become overly nice, I don’t even think that I’m doing the absolute most but either way I scare them away. Yet even when they unfriend me I still like them.

I miss having another adult around. I don't necessarily miss my ex but I just really miss knowing I'm part of a family.  I feel like I'm just on my own.

Always waiting for something else.


Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I mean…I loathe myself and am so disappointed in myself for what I *can't* provide for my son – his own bedroom, a two-parent home, a pet. But…sometimes I think that I should just put my focus on the good aspects of our life… Healthcare covered, roof over our heads, a running vehicle… At least he's not growing up in some war-torn land or as a child labourer…

happy when someone texts me.
We texted and face-timed a lot 2 years ago cause we live far away from each other but then stuff happened on here side so the contact broke off. But in those 2 years she did hit me up a few times but only for a day or so cause I think she was just lonely.

2248,td9zzl,vicious_beasts,"So I've never really had close friends/relationships who weren't manipulative or just eventually stopped talking to me. Or just off about communication.

I don't want to go into too much detail but I've had a very traumatic childhood. Things are more okay now and I've moved away from those ppl tho I still struggle with what happened. I have severe anxiety and depression. I was let go from my second ever job for taking mental health leave. I have a bit of a phobia of going outside alone or on the train from being sexually assaulted/harrased/or in that one case at pride regularly assaulted

I've always been alone mostly I've tried making friendships with ppl who seemed healthy for me and shared mutual interest but they never share the same enthusiasm for long

I rarely see my friends or communicate with them...not for lack of trying it just seems like something comes up every time.

I'm actually very successful at ""making friends"" the problem comes with...actually doing anything with them.

After I lost my job I tried looking for friends online for the first time ever at first it was really fun and great. I met 3 people I was super enthusiastic and the enthusiasm seemed mutual at first. But after months of chatting (I found them all around the same time which was last fall) that was really intense at first it all just started to fall off suddenly with one. I'll refer to them as Red.

At first me and red would vidchat pretty consistently and with my anxiety this was a huge step for me as I'm really nervous being on video. 

The chatting of course lost it's intensity but I'm not mad about that as I'm not pressed to vidchat or even talk everyday though I did ask but they were usually busy so eventually I stopped asking....I still want to sometimes but I haven't gotten the courage yet...usually they'd be busy with other friends or family and they say if they weren't busy they'd call.

I eventually asked them what was up and admitted to feeling off and they said they were just busy and we live a bit far and they have car anxiety...seeing as I have anxiety I understand and even offered to take the 2hr train ride to them and they said they can pick me up we arranged for after their family trip...sadly it didn't happen we chatted for a bit after their trip was supposed to happen but they never really said they were back or contacted me...I did contact them once or twice to no response 

I'm going to be closer to their area to visit family of my own after the 23rd and decided to let them know in case we could hangout...they said they'll let me know as they've been busy....I accepted this and thanked them for getting back to me

The other we'll call them Purple a poly couple I had chatted with for the same amount of time no vidchatting but we did send various photos and tried to arrange meeting up and we actually chatted often...sadly we never met up any of the times we planned because either my issues or theirs/partnerd after chatting at one time they kinda stopped chatting all the sudden with me and they eventually messaged back as I had messaged them as we were supposed to meet up yesterday. They got back to me saying they were going thru a lot and would be mia after a breakup and other life crises and didn't know if they'd be back....I told them if they wanted they could vent/talk to me but it's okay to take time.

No response...after all the failed meetups I've been wondering if they were even real tbh...the guy sent me plenty of photos and pictures of themselves that were candid but idk...the idea of possibly never meeting ppl who I thought were my friends breaks my heart esp after I tried so hard to be understanding....

I'm not trying to be impede on their lives nor do I not understand how busy ppl are but...I just was really excited

The third is Green who's...honestly the best as I get to see them and talk but I do feel a bit off about ourct  friendship because of how it started...we're both into kink/bdsm and nature but I'm less experienced in the previous one. We talked about it and they said they were interested in me in that way would be honored to do that with me even mentioning my vaginismus and how they had partners like that etc and I was excited but they seemed to loose interest after I said I was interested in becoming a dominatrix I'm also into submissive stuff but only with ppl I feel comfortable with and I told them that I thought they'd be someone I'm comfortable with and I am for the most part...they even helped me get my  
ID so we could go to classes together...but after thats nothing really happened. We went out for lunch once  they were making up for something they forgot to do for me....and they invited me out to a friend's farm once...that's about it and they kinda only invited me cuz their partner couldn't come

The reason why I think they lost interest is well they told me that when I asked why they haven't been well...initiating anything with me I suppose. They said I was more into domming and this irritates me as...it's very hard for me to open about wanting to be a sub....and I literally said I was interested in them in that way. So I'm not sure why being a Dominatrix is somehow off putting....they said they were getting over a break up and weren't interested in seriously dating which is fine I mostly just wanted ppl to be comfortable with who I could explore with ..and that we never really got to hangout one on one. I've tried having one on one hangouts but it never really happens we either end up focusing on...important stuff. 

It's also tiresome because they try to talk to me about...their sexcapades with their ex and even recently told me how they started dating someone...I don't feel jealous but I do feel slightly disrespected as it just seems like...I'm just...someone who they talk about having sex with or doing all their responsible stuff and while I'm usually very open and love having all sorts of conversation and super appreciate their friendship in this way as I've always wanted friends who could help me it just...feels off at times because I remember all that stuff...and it feels like I got rejected for not wanting to completely be submissive all the time.

I even asked them about the classes and they just said they were busy but if I found some classes they'd go and possibly invite friends...but I thought this was like something between them and me...not that I mind company but they did say we didn't get any real one on one time.

I said okay as I in general want to go to these classes and...my anxiety won't let me on my own but I also feel anxious about going in a group where I only really know one person.

I just want to say beforehand I'm not trying to blame anyone nor do I expect ppl to talk to me all the time or be interested in me. I have plenty of friends that I value despite us usually only chatting once a year. I wish for more but I can't force interest nor do I want to. I'm just...tired of putting huge amounts of energy into ppl to be disappointed.

I just wish...idk that ppl had as much enthusiasm as me or could sustain it as long.

Esp since I just got out of re-entering an abusive friendship cuz I thought the person had changed and a breakup.
 
I just feel alone...I feel like mislead or I was over promised and it sucks cuz it happens a lot. I wish I could not feel this way and just ignore it but

I've had so many ppl offer to take me out or just hangout just to not speak with me anymore...

Everyone talks about how cool or amazing or awesome I am and tbh...it feels fake esp when I don't ever see them really or they rarely IF at all initiate a Convo with me or I'm the one usually trying to make plans. 

I just...feel tired and alone...I finally felt motivation in my life and it just feels drained. I'm an artist and I can't make anything i want because I just...feel empty. It sucks cuz I feel like I'm good at helping others find artistic motivation but not myself

I honestly just don't know what to do...I just don't want to feel lonely anymore

2249,tdabl9,tiredkindofhumor_,"I've always been a very sexual type of person, even though I'm quite undesirable and it often feels like people don't treat me like other girls and I hate that. 
I realized that I am so interested in sex not only because I am very physical, but also because it allows me to get out of the character that has been imposed on me by others and by my own response to this behaviour of them. 
I have had sex with only two guys in the past which left me with a bad memory of the experience. One of them insulted my physical appearance several times, and I agreed to have sex with him a second time anyway. I feel that I do not deserve anything better and that it is worth as long as I can get out of ""me"" for a while or  I can escape that shapeless presence I feel constrained in. Those guys didn't care if they hurt me while doing it (one of them almost bragged about that to me afterwards, and I'm still his friend, even though I don't have sex with him anymore) and maybe it didn't even matter to me. Whenever something bad happens to me my brain remembers all the times people ignored me or how I felt in so many occasions, and I’m just tired of this.
I would appreciate some advice, but please don’t tell me to love myself and similar stuff, because it’s very unuseful to me and that’s the same exact thing that people who treat me like shit say.",2022-03-13 16:19:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645994783,3,/r/lonely/comments/tdabl9/sex/,,0,6,Sex
2250,tdaeim,Advanced-Prompt-5458,"I’m 31 ( F) and I am open to dating and making new friends but I’m beginning to feel that I’m not going to find anyone any time soon. Making friends has always been hard for me. I feel like throughout my life I’m usually the one chasing after people and asking them to make plans or hang out and never the opposite. Ppl are usually “ too busy” or cancel at the last minute to hang out with other ppl. I get some times things come up last minute but if it happens frequently then I feel like it intentional. An example was when I made plan to hang out with my friend to meet up for dinner and to go bar hopping. We made these plans a two weeks in advance.There in the day before I checked in with him and he said that he was in a camping trip with his friends for the whole week. I got annoyed at first but then decided to give him the benefit of doubt because I thought he probably got caught up in the moment and just forgot to tell me. When I asked him later on he told me he didn’t forget he just didn’t feel like telling me he was on a trip with his other friends. I  feel like I’m disposable and ppl only talk to me when they are bored and have no one else to hang out with. But when the people they prefer being around has plans the same time as our plans they are going to pick them over me. 

When it comes to dating, It seems like the people that have  no intention of pursuing me romantically or dating me. They either just want to to have a friends with benefits, use me as a rebound or try to make me a side piece while they date other women. I don't want to be in thoese situations because I feel I deserves way more than that. But whenever I tell people what I want and my intentions, they end up not wanting anything to do with me. I  know I am a great person and try to remain hopeful that I will find friends or find love l but deep down I feel that I never will. I feel the only time men talk to me is when they want want a rebound or an ego boost and only want my company in secret. Online dating is a joke and I think it is extreamly superficial so I don't really use it. Meetups and facebook groups have worked in the past but only for a short period of time. 

People keep telling me to put myself out there and I dont feel like it. I am just tired of opening myself up and getting my hopes up just for people to stomp all over my heart toss me to the side and disappoint me.",2022-03-13 16:23:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601435265,18,/r/lonely/comments/tdaeim/i_feel_like_im_going_to_stay_alone_forever/,,0,4,I feel like I’m going to stay alone forever

My mother died 16yrs ago because of cancer, my father is an asshole, I don't have any other real family (I am related to some, yes, but they don't feel like family, not even like friends), I barely have friends (maybe 2 or 3), I was engaged to be married but he left me because he was unsure, I got rejected by many people, due to their own problems or because they think that it won't fit. My sex life is boring, I don't feel attractive anymore (despite the fact I get a lot of compliments for my body, see profile), even though I might start one of my dream jobs soon and I already put so much determination into it I feel so empty, lonely, also a bit betrayed. I won't reach even one of my dreams if that whole life goes on like right now and I am anxious about that.

I want someone for cuddling, who is there for me whatever happens, who loves me, who fills up the gaps and problems I have and vice versa. I just want true, honest love by someone. But I recently realized that no one ever will give me this.

2308,tdgz4m,JonSouljah,"Six months ago I had the (dubious) privilege of turning 40.  Aside from a handful of (what I view as) insincere/thoughtless birthday wishes via the evil that is Facebook, in transpired to be nothing more than just another Thursday.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of social gatherings and parties, but if I'm invited I tend to make the effort to go and enjoy them as best as I can with complaint.  But turning 40 is one of those milestones that is supposedly meant to be celebrated and for a couple of months leading up to the ruby anniversary of my birth I'd quietly hoped that I would mean enough to someone that a party - or at the least, an invite out for a birthday meal - would be held.  I knew better (or, at the time, I thought I did), and knew it would pass by as just another day - a sure sign that I meant nothing to the friends and family I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

And surprise, surprise, I was right.  It was just another Thursday.  The weekend came and went.  No invitations to dinner.  No surprise party to celebrate me.  Just those aforementioned, insincere Facebook messages, and a deepening belief that I mean nothing to anyone.  A deepening belief that I'm better off without people in my life.

2326,tdivrz,[deleted],"To all my lonely friends, after at least 2 years of battling loneliness, I was not able to find a solution until January 2021. After a little over a year, I am now sharing this with everyone.

Before I begin, here is a short story about my experience with loneliness. I had heartaches, was crying all the time in isolation, and had no meaningful relationships with both friends and family. I was isolated from the world and had no connections with anyone, and I did not see the need to ask anyone for help because no one really wanted to understand.

**How did I get here?**

The solution is a form of self-reflection, or what some people call meditation/mindfulness. Although I heard about meditation and mindfulness prior to curing loneliness, I did not understand what it meant, and I always thought that meditation was for monks balancing on a small rock underneath a waterfall, or sitting atop a cliff for days on end.

I simply thought that meditation was something that people believed in, like for ghosts and spirits and the paranormal; therefore, I scrapped both mindfulness and meditation from my attention until several months after I cured loneliness. That is when I delved deep into trying to understand what I actually did because I had no label for my experience.

Did I actually cure loneliness? And if I did, can I generalize the steps I did to be available to everyone? I simply thought there was no way I cured loneliness and hesitated until today. Now, you do not have to believe me, and I can answer any genuine questions that people have to the best of my ability. However, it does not hurt to try self-reflection when you are already doing so; but this time, the right way. And once you get into the groove, I can 100% assure you that you will not look back.

**Prerequisites**

The only requirement is yourself and your **willingness** to cure loneliness. You do not need anything or anyone but yourself. As for me,  I promised myself that to cure loneliness, anything I can grasp externally from me was not a solution. I was also not on any substance, even to this day.

The optimal way to self-reflect or meditate is to remove as many distractions as possible, such as sitting down in a quiet and undisturbed room. When that is not possible, I have personally self-reflected and meditated while walking. In either case, when you are completely willing to cure loneliness, you would not let your environment affect your progress because it is the most conspicuous thing in your life.

Meditation is the state of being a silent observer of everything; and in this case, it is observing the activity of your thoughts--which requires attention.

**The Solution**

Whenever you **feel** loneliness, simply sit down if possible, or you can continue to do your activity (as long as you are not distracted by hundreds of things). Now you ask yourself these questions in this specific order (yes, the order matters):

1. Where do you feel it in your body, and what thoughts are associated with this feeling? Make these feelings and thoughts as strong as possible.
2. What do you truly want? If everything in the universe is in front of you, what would solve your problem? A hug, a relationship, a meaningful conversation, a friend or a loved one to be right next to you? Whatever it is, just feel the comfort of that wish being granted by that someone or something.
3. Now get more specific. How do you want to be hugged? How do you want to be in a relationship? What do you want to talk about in a conversation? Get in as much detail as possible and simply feel the comfort of that wish.

Now maintain these feelings for as long as you can. If it subsides, that is not a problem - simply wait for the feelings of loneliness to arise again, whenever they want to come, and repeat these steps. At some point, you can skip all these steps and maintain that comfort seamlessly and effortlessly within yourself.

**What does this do to me?**

This reminds your mind and body that there is a feeling greater than loneliness. Through this reminder, you create a longing for bettering yourself. And slowly, you begin to realize the life you are missing, and you aim to get rid of this debilitating problem of loneliness.

This method is for people who have strong emotions and a strong imagination, but are unfortunately directed for ego-satisfying purposes. The questions are a guide to direct the attention away from ego, and to serve a life-changing purpose. If you do not have intense and perpetual feelings of loneliness, there are breathing techniques, yogic postures, and other guided meditations online that serves the same purpose. There are an infinite number of ways to cure loneliness, and this method I introduced is just one of them.

**Will I be the same person after I cure loneliness?**

Yes, but your perspective on life will change. You become more conscious of your choices, and you will know what you need and don't need. Basically, you become more efficient at life. You may lose friends and family, but through your own choice.

**You're a fraud**

Again, I stated in the prerequisite that you must be **willing** to cure loneliness. If you are willing to solve any problem; by virtue, you are willing to find any solution that works. There are many paths to this solution, but I am saving you the time from reinventing the wheel. You also do not have to believe anything I say, because you only know through **personal** experience, not through the experience of others. If you are not willing, and there is no problem, what's the problem then? Your life is well!

The problem here is you are also dealing with depression, or lack of existential completion, and have an overactive identity due to past environmental trauma (3 problems). You **may** also be in survival mode, and your body unconsciously applies past trauma with every situation you encounter, which can be solved through therapy if you cannot do everything alone, or if you are in a hostile environment. However, you can always be your own therapist because essentially the therapist is teaching you how to separate your body from your mind so that you do not have to be hyper-vigilant and rely on adrenaline to live in the world. You can also try **Aum chanting** (a form of Nada Yoga, or sound yoga) to relax and become more joyful.

If you are in depression, the minimum step you must take is to recognize that you are using language as a justification for your actions, which is dangerous as this brings you and other people down with you. You will continue to think you are better until something even greater hits you with truth and makes you bounce back in defense and you justify that you are suicidal, have the worst problems in the world, etc., because it is your last shred of identity. 

This is just a path to suffering, not well-being. If you can choose your life the way you want it to be, would it not be the case that you want the best possible life? If not, then no one is able to help you if you do not want to help yourself. No one is willing to fall down with you unless they are a fool. 

However, if you recognize that life is short on time and you do not want to die miserably, you must be willing to notice that you can identify as everything or nothing, then identity will not be a problem, and name-calling will cease to exist. Once you realize this, you will begin taking steps to try out different identities, but everything is still in boxes. The last step is to then expand your identity to everything or nothing, which cannot be boxed in. However, this problem of identity can also be solved through love, because only through love should your actions arise, otherwise disaster will come.

**Closing thoughts**

You can only solve problems if you view something as a problem. If you don't see a problem, or if your mind keeps focusing on different things, then solve the surface-level problems first because they are directly accessible. Why do you think you can compete in the Olympics when you have not developed the necessary conditions for it? Start with the first step, then you can think about the second.",2022-03-13 22:56:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/tdivrz/permanently_cure_loneliness_without_family/,,0,8,"Permanently Cure Loneliness Without Family, Friends, &amp; Substances"

2336,tdk4ym,Livesandletsgo,"
To my coworkers, peers, parents, and friends I may seem like I have it altogether but truthfully I feel more alone now than I ever have. As soon as I step into my room I have no desire to do anything but sleep or lay on my bed watching day turn to night. I sit there literally staring out the window watching the sun go down. I try to hold back the tears because I am so disappointed I have wasted the little time that I have. 

Then I think - What would I have done anyway? 
Who would I have seen or spent time with? Why does it matter? 

I’ve tried so many things to suppress these feelings and usually life is pretty bearable. I have a history of depression and have dealt with it before. Along with that, I have a degree in Psychology so I do know what needs to be done. I know that there are resources available and I also refuse to go back on antidepressants because of the side effects. I maintain a healthy lifestyle and abstain from alcohol most of the time. I am completely sober from drugs. 

I’m doing everything right but what is the point of being my best self when I have no one to reveal that self to. I love who I have become but I need more than self-love. I want to be loved and I want someone to know that they can be loved by this new version of me.

My alleged friend keeps telling me “it’s okay if I want to say what’s on my mind”, but whenever I do, they get angry at me, tell me to stop, and I end up having to console them and praising them for “doing a good job at trying their best to help”. There’s nobody to talk to anymore. No friends, all enemies around me, it sucks.
I’m getting sick of life, even more than I already am, there’s nobody that really makes an effort to stay with me or respect me, and I just want to get my guitar cable and hang myself at my window so that when my family gets home from the grocery store, they can see me hanging by the window. I’m just a monetary detriment, I waste food and supplies, I’m wasting education and I never get what I like done. I’m alone in my room, I’m too tired of life to turn on the lights despite being scared of the dark, I’ve just finished hitting myself and bruising my body, face and head, and I’ve been crying for what seems to be two hours already. People only want me around if I can be useful. Otherwise, I’m always by myself. At school lunch, during classes, at home, in public, even when there’s a lot of people around me, it’s so lonely I probably don’t exist to anyone.

I want to have friends that actually care about me, i want to have someone who still sticks around me and doesn't leave me in the dust even when theres other friends around to talk to.

I love talking to people and it's honestly so depressing not being able to, and even more depressing to have people leave because of it. I might just leave all my friends and isolate and be lonely on my own, stop annoying other people with it, and just waste my own time instead. I'm so tired of people at this point. I wish I could just dream forever lol I had this lovely dream where I hugged a stranger, and they hugged back, it was honestly lovely.

How am I going to do this alone? How am I going to live each day, alone?

But this is what I chose, the results of my actions. And it was for the best.

Will I ever be loved again? Will I ever get over this? How can I get over it when I still think of it constantly and have imaginary conversations every day?

2384,tdo9ze,VeXedZenith,"I'm usually pretty satisfied with my life, actually. But occasionally I'll spend all day in my room, doing nothing useful. On days like these, I'll spend a little too much time reflecting on my current state. 
 
I have no friends, and I don't really get along with my family. My days consist of sleeping, eating, exercising, studying, and working. I had other hobbies too, but the social aspect of them became too much to bear in the end. In my free time, I like to watch youtubers/streamers. I've been like this since middleschool, I think. Having access to a parasocial medium has fulfilled my social needs enough to avoid feeling like I'm alone.
 
It's interesting. I'm nothing like my family. I think that most people inherit their personalities from the people around them. But I'm nothing like the people I grew up around. The way that I think (and probably the way that I talk, if I ever talked to anyone) is primarily reminiscent of the content creators I'm currently watching or grew up watching. I guess to my brain, those people are my ""tribe"" that my personality has been modeled after. 
 
Sometimes I wonder what kind of dynamics I might bring to a friend group. I get carried away imagining what kind of person I would be, what kind of role I might fill. I think about how fun it could be to be part of a social circle like certain groups of youtubers or streamers. So I attend some kind of social event, only to find that I completely lack the ability to smoothly interject myself into a group dynamic. Not only that, but talking to people so thoroughly exhausts me that I'm completely dissuaded from ever wanting to do it again. So I return to my normal. 
 
While I would probably describe myself as lonely, it's not something that nags at me very much. I generally don't think about it unless it's a day like this. I suppose it would be nice if I could snap my fingers and magically have a friend group that has all the same interests as me, and that I have chemistry with. But the work required to get there is way too much for me to handle, so I'm okay staying the way I am compared to dealing with that.

2391,tdosws,Clol1l1l1,"Most of friends in elementary school were neighbors or one of my older sister's friends. I remember my sister telling me that I shouldn't hang out with her friends-even thought some of them were my age- because they were *her* friends. One of the only girls I hung out with in middle school was ""E"". We knew each other in fifth grade and we were friends in 6th grade. We would've probably been friends longer but I moved the summer after 6th grade. After I moved to a different state it was easy to talk to people at my new school. I talked to the same people in middle school but never hung out with them outside of school. I was so scared of asking my parents to have my friends over because I felt they would ask too many questions. I also felt they would make fun of my friends or my friends would make fun of my house. On the other hand my 3 siblings were all able to make friends and hang out with them. My older sister was shy so it was kind of unexpected that she made friends before I did.

 In 9th grade I started hanging out with a group of boys. We would actually hang out after school without my parents knowing. It was mainly because I had a crush on ""L"" and I knew their friend ""S"". S left the group but I didn't because I still liked L. I should've left because L and the rest of them were assholes. I did some ""dirty"" stuff with L. At the same time I was friends with a group of girls in the club I was in. They told me that L wasn't good for me to hang out with. I left that club(not because of that) and so I stopped talking to those girls. That left me with L and the rest of the boys. I definitely teased a few of those boys. I only got bored messing around because each one had a bland personality. I actually dated one though ""H"" in 10th grade. He might've actually been nice but we broke up. Then his friend ""F"" started liking me. F was a major asshole and I couldn't stand him. F started saying they all hated me and I didn't care. I thought he was just saying that cuz he was an asshole. It turned out to be true though cuz they all started avoiding me. (The problem I had with the boys has bothered for a while.)

I started talking to ""T"" because I knew her since 8th grade and she was always nice. I also talked to ""A"" more because he was funny. The next year I just stopped talking to them. T was in different classes that year. A was in the same class as me but he just stopped talking to me. I feel like I did something because it was all of sudden and we always talked all the time before. I had a small group people I would talking to during 5th and 7th period but covid hit and I stopped talking to them. My last year of high school was spent completely at home.

Now I'm in college and I realized I didn't have the ""fun"" high school experience. I never went to the mall and whatever other places people hung out in high school. Where I live has a bunch of places to go to like the beach. I see people post pictures on instagram and they're all having fun. I think it's really my fault though. I didn't even hang out with nice people in 9th and 10th grade. 11th grade I spent practically alone. In 12th grade I was completely alone.

2412,tdqx5n,MrAnderson19992021,"I just posted in a depression subreddit, and this one was recommended to me.

Where do I start... Warning this might be long.

Right now I'm in a very bad place mentally, first off I hadn't been around people since the pandemic started, because my ill and elderly mother lives with me. I'm also physically disabled so I have avoided physical contact with anyone to protect her. She had stage 3 lung cancer and has several lung diseases, so she is very high risk.

Growing up my uncle was like a father to me, and I pretty much put them equal to my father. Well he is in almost the identical situation as my mother health wise, and early this morning I got a call from his daughter crying hysterically she had to call 911 to take him to the hospital. He had covid about a month ago, but due to his health he isn't recovering well, even after testing negative. Right now he is in the ICU and it isn't looking good. Then after the call, I checked my social media accounts and Reddit permanently suspended my account and I have no idea why. I had my main account set up with subreddits like this, and just typing out my feelings like this is a MAJOR help.
My mental state is in a bad place, I'm doing things irrational things like deleting every single post on my main Reddit page before I give it a few days.

I have nobody to talk to about these things, I don't want to put this on my mother so I pretend I'm okay are her, in reality I'm in crisis mode.
From in December I sunk into a major depression, and went days without food, the past two weeks I started to improve but today set me back. I just need a outlet that I can use to let it out, talk to others with no chance it will get back to her somehow. I'm just in meltdown mode.

She did not want to answer for minutes, and she was very kind, but she said no unfortunately.


When she asked later, if am I okay? I answered totally okay. But it was a lie, like everything else.

Bottom line I really miss him. 
I have all these scratches and scars and a bruise from the last time I saw him. I keep touching them to remind me of him.. a few from little love bites, others not so much. 
 I don’t want them to heal because then it’ll be like his touch &amp; the feeling of him is gone forever. 
I know if it wasn’t for his relapse then he’d be here with me right now. I don’t know this side of him, he’d only told me stories before. I met him sober, driven and goal oriented. That’s what really hurts. We bonded on our recovery and our similar goals for the future. 
 I’m scared of how far he’ll go this time. We weren’t even together for long. I haven’t even known him a year. We just clicked instantly. Every day it felt like we were only getting closer and more passionate. I love him so much. And I know underneath all of this he loves me too. What he’s going through is just a lot stronger than that, I’ve experienced its grip myself. 
I’m scared that he never comes out of it this time. &amp; If he does, what if he’s not the same. It changes you.

2464,te1h19,pranavk28,"I have been staying at my hometown away from any friends just my family for about a little over an year now since covid. I look back at how I was back in college where I still had some passion left for things. I had an actual an interest in coding thinking about how in the future I would be working on some cool things. Cut back to now and I absolutely don't feel passionate about anything. I am lonely trying to message strangers online on subs mean for those purpose but to usually no avail. My daily routine consists of getting up late wasting time on my phone or games everyday telling myself that I would work all day today but it's always the same. By late afternoon I finally feel like doing something and still only do like one thing maybe out of the 10 different things I have pending to do. I am trying to apply for my master's and there are many steps in that. Everytime I think if I just make step this by the deadline I will finish everything else before time but I always end up going until the deadline.

My work is a mess as I work on something that doesn't excite me in the least and often my work is so limited that there is not much happening either. For example I rountine go through a whole week of not doing any significant amount of work and since it's work from home it's basically holiday for me. And I am not even exageratting. Instead even simple tasks I keep postponding and at the end of the day I only worry that what will I say if someone asks what have you been working on currently. The fact that I am paid relatively well making feel even more guilty and a bum. And in spite of all this I still don't finish things like applying for scholarships, loans for my studies, maintaing some certification at work to look good atleast or just studying what I want to do my Master's.

I was working out on and off but now I don't even feel like doing that. I am a complete waste of space and potential. I don't even know how to drive for god's sake. I can't seem to make conversation even remotely any interesting, I have no special talents, I get paid at work to do basicaly nothing and it can only keep going for so long until people at work start expecting more from someone with my duration of experience. I have been in my current project for almost two years and I have barely developed any new skills in coding. I have never had a gf or anything close and at this point I can't even imagine it. All I do is just waste and waste time and then regret later that I'm short on time. I feel empty and do nothing all day but watch YouTube, do text roleplaying on a site or play games or sleep.

I am not even shifting back to work city to not feel alone cause I am trying to save money to afford my Master's which I am not even remotely working hard on. I can think of a more pathetic person than me right now. I have spent half of my 20s and I am prolly worse than how I was in college and feel shit knowing how much wasting away my potential. Needless to say I'm extremely lonely but honestly at this point I'm pretty used to it.",2022-03-14 16:29:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1554588970,6,/r/lonely/comments/te1h19/wasted_potential_feeling_like_a_useless_robot_day/,,0,6,"Wasted potential, feeling like a useless robot day by day"

2471,te2qcz,VenomousBlack,"There are public services for just about every human need. Food, transportation, health, safety, education, entertainment and literally every other human need...       except loneliness...  


All there is to counter loneliness are apps like Tinder. And from an objective standpoint, Tinder is preying on lonely and horny people to pay money for a chance at intimacy. Anybody who has tried Tinder and isn't a 10 out of 10 has probably not had any luck.   


In my opinion there should be a public service just like health of safety, that is meant to help people find good partners. Loneliness is becoming an epidemic at this point in the developed world. It's ridiculous how many great people are in this painful hell.   


When we are growing up we look forward to different things like being able to drive, work, drink and be independent. What if one thing that people would discuss in the schoolyard is when they grow up and go to the partner clinic (or whatever).   


Professional psychologist could work together with people to create long lasting and healthy relationships. I feel like if everyone would/could do this, it wouldn't seem so weird.  


Even though I doubt this will ever happen, something must be done to fix this problem. It's getting out of hand when huge portions of the population say they lack something that is almost a basic human need.

2475,te33ej,concernedceliac_123,"I know that I am good enough academically yet I’m forced to take medication that makes me have side effects so I can not have severe allergic reactions, and I had to take a gap year. Everytime in my life I was always there for my family members and even my friends. When quarantine happened in March of 2020 I had severe flares of my chronic illnesses and I became quickly allergic to foods, fragrances, etc. I was begging for my father to help me not have severe anaphylaxis from my first bad allergic reaction and he just screamed at me and told me what I was experiencing was anxiety and that I was just wanting to have an illness to cover up the fact that I am not able to be independent which is not the case at all . My entire family would spray cleaners, soaps, perfumes, that had ingredients I had issues with before my college exams on purpose. They would treat me like I was a monster when I was only trying to stay afloat in such immense physical pain. It felt like a form of forced self harm knowing that what I had access to medically was just not enough. I bled, my throat swelled, I had hives all over my body and I was just “broken” I had lost my usefulness. I used to frantically put on makeup, drive to school, and be authentic in trying to connect to others and truly be there for them. I am not even just saying this at face value? Like I literally would have other people verify like my sister who I trust, etc that I wasn’t projecting my traumas and that I was truly a friend to these dumbasses. I was so broken when quarantine hit because I basically lost my high school friends because I couldn’t hang out with them. My family treated me like I was a  monster and a burden.  I was the one going through hell. They refused to manage their finances even though my father makes a good amount of money. Everyone was so vicious over money . It’s like arguing with a damn insurance company person trying to argue why what your doing isn’t medically necessary. They were so fucking ignorant of anything biology medical, immunology related things. Like yeah I’m the one going through this hell you bet damn right I’m going to try to mitigate having more repeating traumatic events. And it was the worst pain in my life when my own family just put me in this broken category. Like a spam folder in an email account. I wasn’t even that nasty I was so understanding and admittedly worried and anxious because who wouldn’t be? Like college chem is brutal enough without bitches like using shit or cooking shit that your allergic to in a way that fucks up your entire safe space. And then when you try to alter the air flow or even purchase air purifiers? Good luck with that 🤣. It’s my birthday, I’m 20 and I really wish that I wasn’t. I’m already going through hell with this mess and then my dad doesn’t understand how a GI procedure would be kind of fucking necessary to rule and confirm things I get harassedevery 6 hrs over medical bills I already paid for or for ones he said he would take care of. Which I’m normally pretty diligent with. But fucking hell on my damn birthday? I can’t eat the damn cake yet my mother is insistent on eating cake and ice cream in front of me . I don’t understand why they just can’t be at least neutral and not cause me issues randomly. Believe it or not I’m a fun person. I might have some nerdy special interests in bio, but damn I really wish I could connect with someone and it not have like conditions attached to it. I tried to talking to new people and indulging conversations for the fun of it. Oh you can’t fucking go on a date or fuck me? Bye. It also sucks because I am very attractive objectively, and I fit into all of the wack ass beauty standards. So it’s hard to have relationships with other females because a lot of them get threatened in some capacity or they think that I think I’m better than them or that I wanna take their man. Now it’s better at least not interacting with tons of people in my gap year but fr it used to give me tons of anxiety when I was healthier. Now I just laugh at the ridiculous nature of everything. All I ever wanted was like someone to just be there for me like I was there for them. And this is purely objective here. Everyone just doesn’t put that same effort. Even with family. I feel like everything is conditional which it is. But I just miss having that feeling that your family was interested in having a relationship with you, and just that naive love. It’s really fucking sad especially recently. My 2 Australian shepherds have been hyper but they calm down with SpongeBob playing and I kid you not like I fight tears rewatching it. Because I dealt with a lot of family medical issues and just drama in general when I was young, and I used to just calm down watching SpongeBob and Disney, reassuring myself that they loved me. Which was easier cause I wasn’t aware of their narcissistic behaviors. But damn. I just thought my family would be proud of me truly. Not telling me in unsaid words that I should stop being a burden, die, or that I am a terrible person. I guess I was naive that they could ever actually want to know me as a person. But hey happy birthday to me! Anyone wants to chat feel free to comment or whatever. Wasn’t trying to trauma dump it’s just what happened was really weird and complicated and intertwined with how I feel today on my birthday.💀",2022-03-14 17:39:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1587869199,1,/r/lonely/comments/te33ej/anyone_been_through_these_feelings_how_can_i_stop/,,0,0,Anyone been through these feelings?

It's like even if you do make a friend that's in similar shoes as you, it seems like as soon as they find someone who socializes better than you then you lose them too lol.

I don't know, like, it's like being friends with someone and there's a third person, but that person talks so much that you just sit in the back being talked over and have to raise your voice just to be heard or noticed.

The reason why I've gotten so addicted to videogames throughout my life is because videogame characters are fill in's for me, they're my artificial socializing platform.
Bored, have no one to talk to, talk to the character in your favorite rpg, lonely in the romantical sense?

I knew who the person was because I was worried about them and let my now ex know about this and she assured me that they were just a friend and nothing was going on. She knew I had been cheated on in the past and all I ever asked for was honesty if this king of thing was happening so I don’t get blindsided again. 

When she broke up with me she said it was to live her queer experience and rebuild her relationship with her parents now they understand who she is but now I find out that she broke up with me to get into another monogamous relationship with a straight guy she’d been seeing behind my back for months.

I feel hurt, betrayed, lonely and angry. I feel like an asshole for wanting them to breakup and wanting them to get hurt the way I have been. I now have no one and they have each and all it cost them was my pain and loneliness.

english is not my first language so i aplogize if i have mistakes in writing..i'm a boy and i'm 19 years old..like the title suggests i didn't have friends at all in my entire life..when i was a kid my mum told me the more you study the more you will have friends but it turned out the other way..i busted my ass out trying to get good grades because of what she said and i did succeed..every year i'm at the top of my class but it turns out i became the nerd of my class..everybody always thinks i'm a nerd and nerds are not fun and boring and are always talking about studying but i'm not..i dont talk about studying..i hate studying more than everybody else but i'm just good at it

i tried to make friends but every time i hang out with them i just stare at them without saying nothing because everything i say is boring to them and they don't care about my opinions in anything..but do you know what does hurt me the most..is them trying to make feel that i belong with them..they force themselves to laugh at my jokes because they want me to help them study

when i was 16 years old i found a friend who is just like me..we had everything in common..our interests and our jokes and everything..we were best friends for 2 years and i thought this will always be the case..but he changed and became like everyone else..he changed to the point he makes fun of me just to impress other people who society labels them as cool and fun people..so i cut ties with him

after that my mother noticed all this she said don't worry when you go to college you will meet other kinds of people..people who are like you

it made sense to me because i'm at the top of my class and when i go to college i will meet other people who are at the top of their class.. and i thought they will be just like me

and i did..i graduated from highschool and went to the best college in my country..but nothing has changed..it turns out they were just like the others..i was an outcast among them because i was not funny in their regards..even when i try to comment on something that we share in common like soccer..they will always say shut up what a stupid opinion..and they don't tell you why it's stupid..they don't even think it's stupid but they say it anyway to make their friends laugh..because in our society , cool people are people who make you laugh no matter how

and i don't want to be like that..i don't want to be cool just because i make fun of people..in fact and don't like to make fun of people i hate let alone making fun of people to be cool

so i gave up on making friends..if you see me nowdays you will always see me alone..always on my phone or reading a book..that's my life now..i made peace with being alone..it hurts a little to say it but i think i am destined to be alone for the rest of my life..i lived my life without friends and i will continue living my life withou friends..and that's fine i guess",2022-03-14 19:08:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615068852,1,/r/lonely/comments/te54y3/i_didnt_have_friends_at_all/,,0,1,i didn't have friends at all

2493,te5kt5,Acrobatic-Ad5741,"This week has been super tough. I can’t really share my thoughts or feelings on other social media because ppl will make assumptions and then talk about me later in their friends group. I also don’t want ppl knowing everything but i have no one to talk to. I literally lost everyone this year. To drama. Here’s my truth…

Everyone has a problem with how emotional or vocal I am about my feelings. they think I’m trying to seek attention or live through others. I used to have a best friend of 10yrs and we stopped being friends in January when I decided I was going to cut her n our other mutual friend off. (We we’re like a little group of 3). She made me feel excluded and was talking/ venting to my sister about me constantly. As my sister would also vent and talk about me to them. Rewind to July 2021, me and my sister (21y/o) got into our fight physically fight ever. It was over something petty and dumb that didn’t involve either of us. We ended up working it out around thanksgiving. After the fight tho, my two friends 1 of 10yrs and 1 of 3years started to treat me differently and took her side. I felt it. And I expressed how I felt and then we moved on. But Nothing really changed. I personally don’t care about those friends because I feel like it’s okay to outgrow ppl. And if someone isn’t treating me the way I would like then that is not a relationship for me instead of trying to change anyone. After they made me feel so isolated and as if I wasn’t their cup of tea, creating this perspective of my character… I didn’t want anything to do with them. I sent a text and said I will not be associating with them anymore. Now it’s March 2022, and me and my son’s father who I been with for 7yrs broke up yesterday bc he was sexing and flirting with multiple other girls. I also just got into another physical fight with my sister because I heard her talking about me otp with my ex best friend (which she does often) but today I had enough.

Anyways, now I feel like I can’t vent on other platforms, my focus is all over the place but I have a really good career opportunity coming up for me. I’m uncomfortable at home. I have a 3yr old who’s birthday is next month. I can’t trust anyone. I don’t want friends. I don’t like my hometown. I don’t like my family.
I feel like it’s me that’s out of place. And i always try my best to do for others and always transparent about my feelings.

2508,te77jw,LonelyInLA92,"We work together. She asked what I was eating for dinner. I told her I was grabbing something, probably. She smiled and said, ""I'm just going to eat cheese and crackers for dinner, because I'm a child."" So, I took another shot and said, ""Well, hell, come eat with me then."" So, she came and ate with me. After hanging out and shooting pool with me the night before with some friends. And she says we need to go again soon so I can help her improve (I play in a league and she's a neophyte) and ""crush men and make them cry."" Which is exactly my sense of humor. So, she obviously is comfortable around me in a friendly way.

She's just really friendly. She talks about how she's single all the time, and that she's ""thirsty"". That she hasn't gotten laid in months. These aren't things women say to someone they see as a potential partner. All these things, because she's friend-zoned the hell out of me. She even moved across the table and sat next to me to watch TikTok's (her favorite thing).

But she doesn't seem to even consider us anything other than friends. And we work together. I can't fucking ask her out. We literally work on the same tasks together 3 days a week. If things went poorly, hell if she thinks my sex game was pathetic, then I could never live it down.

I'm just too insecure, and far too worried about my job (which I'm on thin ice at already), to take the risk. So, I sit pining for her. My heart was jumping in my goddamn throat after being so close to her for 2 hours that I couldn't fucking sleep at all last night.

She goes and hangs out after work with me, she asks me things that in my head sound really strange. Like at dinner she said, ""Is it okay to talk about the books I like on a first date? Do men find that weird? Do you wanna hear about them?"" Because she reads weird alien smut books, and of course I'd love to hear anything about her hobbies. She's the most interesting person in the world to me. She asked me about the boring books I read, and I tried to talk about them, but I just feel like I'm boring her.

I just can't fucking do it. I can't ask her out. She's too beautiful. And it's too much of a risk. I'm such a coward. Fuck my life.

Yesterday, I even read the book she was talking about. I'm hopeless.",2022-03-14 20:39:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597706172,9,/r/lonely/comments/te77jw/we_went_and_got_dinner_she_still_doesnt_think_of/,,0,16,We went and got dinner. She still doesn't think of me like that.

I am fascinated by the topic of loneliness and totally agree that loneliness is becoming an epidemic in our world. Recent articles from NPR, Harvard med, and the CDC all show data supporting the notion that loneliness is significantly harming our mental and physical health. Right now, I'm part of a UX team (user experience) at the University of Texas. We're designing an app and the problem we've chosen to combat is the loneliness epidemic. I'm wanting to understand more deeply the reasons behind why people feel lonely. If you're interested, please feel free to take this short 6-question survey to help me and my team understand what exactly lonely people might need from an app. Thank you SO much for your time! Your answers help us help lonely people. :)

2574,teetyy,Roziesoft,"I just want a boy to cuddle with and listen to music with, it would make me so happy. I don't even want friends or anything just one person that I can talk to and that I can rely on. I'm hoping that once I move to my new school I might have a chance at finding someone but it feels so far away and I don't know how long I can hold on. Everyone I've ever tried to make friends with has ended up getting noticeably more distant within a week of meeting them, they all have their excuses but it feels like there's something wrong with me. 

I almost had a boyfriend once, for a couple days I started to actually feel happy and I had motivation, I didn't feel like I was forcing myself to do stuff, I actually wanted to do it. That's all gone now though, it barely even lasted a week before they too decided to break things off. It hurts knowing that it all felt fine when I thought I had that one person. I still remember how good it felt when I held his hand, when he let me snuggle with him at lunch, and when he hugged me when I got upset. I didn't feel like shit, I didn't hate myself, I felt happy and now it's all gone. So now I'm stuck hoping to find something like that again before it's too late and I end up losing what's supposed to be the best years of my life alone and feeling like a failure.",2022-03-15 02:47:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627577503,9,/r/lonely/comments/teetyy/i_need_cuddles/,,0,7,I need cuddles :/

2576,teexar,Random-Person934,"Currently I am in grade 11 high school I used to have many friends back in elementary and middle school though the amount of friends I have now is extremely low and the ones that I do have rarely talk to me or talk to me sparingly. I have one adult friend who is the only friend that I truly trust with things that I would not even dare to tell my mother or father though I only see him once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly believe that it is all a down ward spiral from here I have spent all my years just studying thinking that the more I study the more chances I will get to become rich beyond even my wildest dreams. However, I am beginning to see that social relations and friends are also extremely important in life. To be completely honest I am not sure if I am still capable of making friends I do not even know what the latest trends among my peers are or what the best videogames are since I have mostly just been studying and watching YouTube on things that I don't believe people my age are interested in. There is simply nothing interesting about me besides the fact that I am knowledgeable in a string of uninteresting facts.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I believe that the only way I can stay relevant to myself and ease the pain of loneliness is to just focus on making an insane amount of money after I graduate from university before using that money to pamper myself, my parents and the people who I view as important in my life. Moreover, I also plan to use the money to secure myself by buying necessities such as food, housing, water etc before living a life of utter grandeur by drowning myself in rich people stuff like good food insane gains and the latest technological marvels of that time all in an effort of shielding myself from the creeping realization that I was born alone and I am meant to die alone friendless and probably only having the heart monitor at my deathbed as the only witness to my last words and my existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I have loving parents and one adult friend who I truly treasure but to be completely honest I am beginning to fear the events that will happen to me after my parents pass away from old age and my adult friend leaving me or passing away himself of old age what happens to me who do I talk to who will bother to listen to my grievances without requiring payment while caring about my words at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I think I am the one at fault. I have never been particularly been good at making friends or worse maintaining them which is an issue that  I already see among myself today and probably worse tomorrow. I don't know I just feel like something is wrong about me whenever I look in the mirror I always have an either distant look or an angry look both of which don't really encourage people to approach me in addition to giving them sour opinions of me before I even approach them. Moreover, I  just don't talk well in public every single time I always feel like my voice tone is extremely off in addition to sometimes stuttering and all the most awkward speech screw ups you can imagine from not being able to know the right thing to say at that given moment to completely blanking out and being unable to respond beyond  neutral phrases like ""nice"" or ""good'.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just too far behind and as my own mother will put it there are 2000 people in your school you are in a classroom surrounded by people with friends why are you the only one struggling with this issue to which I now understand that I am indeed at fault. I am simply too behind and too late socializing to me is the exact equivalent of trying to teach a man who has never seen the alphabet till their 60's the alphabet.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides whenever I do approach people I always feel like a creep for some reason I feel like an attention seeking creep due to my awkward attempts at a conversation. I  feel like a creep due to the things that I often observe on the person I am talking to such as their body language and the way they respond back almost all of them just look like they want to get the convo over with so that they wont have to hang out with me 1 second longer even though I have no weird intentions and just genuinely want to talk. I don't think its their fault I believe that there is something truly wrong with me which is why I sometimes choose to stay quiet and pray to everything holy that grants wishes that I become rich in the future so that I can drown out all of these feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I just want to become rich in order to be able to have a purpose in the sense that I can provide for the people I love in addition to drowning myself in the excess that money can bring just so that I can ignore the feeling of not having friends and being truly lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that will say that I am immature I already understand them I'm grade 11 for hecks sake I will have to be Einstein to already be mature at this stage in my life.

Here are your options: you message someone, they don't reply at all.

Or you keep a conversation going but it's only one word responses from them.

Or (so I've heard) you're a woman, in which case men do keep up a conversation, but then all of a sudden become really creepy out of the blue? 

I'm not saying it's impossible. I have met a few very wonderful people! But you gotta keep sifting and sifting until you're pretty much all out of flour. (Or something like that) 

It doesn't bother me too much, I'm quite a happy person who's fine being alone for the most part.

2595,tegt4i,Revolver-Knight,"Unfortunately I feel like shit at the moment 

I turn 19 on Thursday St pattys day 

Its pretty cool considering I’m Irish my dad he’s from Dublin.

He always tells me even god couldn’t make these circumstances happen.

For an Irish man immigrating to America to have his Irish Son on the most Irish Day of the Year.

The reason I’m trying to not feel like shit is that I know I’m lonely I know I don’t really have friends I know I’m prolly not conveniently attractive I know I’m awkward and quiet and I know I’m inexperienced in a lot of things.

My point is I know these things and why should I let them make me feel like shit especially on my birthday!!

But sadly that’s not working out at the moment.

It’s prolly for multiple reasons and one of them was last year

Last year for my birthday my parents got together and they called in a table for birthday dinner, for Themselves, my Sister me and at the time my Girlfriend 

It was euphoric a memory I cherish I really felt happy.


I remember we got there and they didn’t have the table there ready even though we were on time so we had to wait outside with the long line of patrons.

This was an Irish Pub by the way and it was on Patty’s day.

I remember holding Leanne’s hand I could tell her anxiety was flaring up so I wrapped my around her waist respectfully of course and held her close and she laid her head on my shoulder.

I also spoiled her with some souvenirs from the gift shop.


Then when we finally got a table I remember I got like they called it Chippers Special (but it was just fish and chips)

My ex she got a Shepards Pie with mushrooms on the side

I remember this really funny moment where I’d never tried the pie before and my ex was like “Liam you’ve got to try this!” And I was like sure!

So I wiped off my fork and went to go take a piece and she did “ah ah ah!” She grabbed my fork and put it down.

And I was like well how am I supposed to try the pie.

“Open wide” she said

So I awkwardly let her feed me some of the pie.

My mom said my face beat red my dad was laughing his ass off.


Then we both got a chocolate malt with two straws she pulled my shoulder to move my face closer so we could both drink the Malt.

My mom took a picture I never seen the photo and I kinda don’t want too cause if I see it now if  prolly burst into a sobbing mess.


Like I’d say I’m pretty over Leanne now but like I’m not gonna act like I don’t miss my ex or I’m not thankful or cherish the memories we had.

But yeah I’m pretty sure that’s partly why I’m having such a hard time a year later.

Secondly like it’s just been hard to meet new people to continue this quest called life.

Like I’m not in School I’m working and actually working my way up really good for only being there 9 months.

But like I work as much as I can which to be honest is only about 26-35 hours a week.  I have tinder and the likes and I’ve matched once but they never replied back.

Like I’m not butt hurt or anything it’s just I dunno.

I’m trying to go out more like I’ve been trying to go to anywhere more like even stores.

In attempts to improve my social skills but also in my subconscious mind apart of me wants to have a meet cute moment.


Not that I’m anti date apps but I’m worried about being in a situation where it’s a hookup and I’m not really looking for hookups or sex….

Like I’m not asexual  or anything (also power to y’all Asexuals in the world y’all get overlooked)  it’s just more of I’m looking for companionship. Also like I’m a Virgin (I’m not really insecure about that) so if I was put into a sexual situation I prolly wouldn’t know what to do.

Like I remember in school it was just kids in my class in my senior year and they were talking about stripclubs and they decided to ask me about if I would go to one.

And personally I don’t think I would really… like power to the strippers but it’s like I’m looking for connections. Like obviously we all like attractive people I like attractive people I’m a breast man lol. But I want to meet girls that we can love eachother both emotionally and eventually sexually. Then they called me a Simp pretty much and they went back to talking and I went back to reading or whatever I was doing that day.

Also like to be honest I’d prolly just freeze up and be awkward around all these pretty woman.

But for Thursday my plan really is I’m seeing the  new Batman I’m a really big movie buff lol like my favorite part and most important part of a movie to me is it’s story but I love everything that makes a movie come together. I’ve always got lol factoids and shit to tell people 

Like I remember back in November I watched the Matrix with my mom for the first time and it was phenomenal like it’s my kind of movie.

Then the next day I feel like I ruined it for her cause I came to her with like 40 different interpretations and factoids to tell her like I’d say like “I think it’s ingenious how the Wachowski Sisters give some of the machines specifically agent smith more emotion than the humans” and my poor mom she’s just kinda standing there like “Mhm yeah, wow that’s great sweet heart” like trying to be supportive.

I often have like fantasy’s in my head where I have friends and we have a podcast or a let’s play channel similar to like Oney plays or Gamegrumps or something where we just talk shit while playing games.

And I’m not friendless completely like I have people I kinda hang with at work and I have a friend from highschool I kinda hang with.

We don’t get to hang out to much cause he’s usually really busy like in December we went to see Spider-Man after his exams to get him to calm down.

2603,teht2g,matchbox720x,"When I was young I was bullied a lot and for a long time all I ever wanted was friends. I met one friend in HS (7 years ago) and we were like siblings and I thought I would always have them. 

Long story short, due to a lot of past things between us we are basically on a weird friend break atm. 

I made other friends in college who TL;DR: I roomed with them and bullied me out of that dorm. So I live with strangers. 

My one other  close friend, who I met in college, is on a growth journey and I’m proud and happy for them, but I don’t know if I can stick around for it. They are learning to recognize their own biases but they have hurt me and my HS friend before because of it. I  love them but I might have to step back from that friendship I don’t know. 

So I’m back to the loneliness I’ve always felt since middle school. I know people, I’d say in certain circles  I’m semi-popular but the people that like me aren’t my cup of tea and really only wanna talk about themselves. I spend most of my time alone, which is nice but…..at any point in the day I could burst into tears. I just wanna run away or go back in time and try again. It’s so hard, to get up and know that I can’t text the people I use to. I miss them, and I know I deserve better but it hurts. It hurts losing the thing you wished for.

2641,telz3e,motet7228,"I'm 17. I've already finished high school and all I feel is empty. 
I'm extremely introverted and awkward but I've experienced alot of different things but in extremely scarce quantities. 

I've had a girl hug me, not out of kindness but out of affection, the same girl had kissed me. These things had only happened this one time. I've never experienced any real other physical touch or emotional connection with anyone. 

I feel like school was my first and last chance to meet people, I have a job, I work 5 days a week but it feels completely different even trying to just talk to anyone compared to school. 

I'm a minor so it's not like I can go on sites or apps to meet people in a capacity that's greater than friendship but even then I'm unsure of what it feels like to have someone be with me for the sake of being with me. Even with the girl I mentioned earlier I couldn't comprehend that she actually wanted to be with me so I kind of fucked that up.. 

I want to get out of my shell and be sociable, even if only a little. To be completely honest, I've felt completely alone throughout all of school whether I had a girlfriend or was written others in whatever setting. I'm sure others felt this was and still do but I couldn't comprehend that this wasn't something unique to me. 

I convinced myself I tried and tried and tried and had given up with other people, but now I realise that's extremely immature and unsustainable for my mental health. 

It's selfish but I just want someone to understand, a guy, a girl, I don't care who it could be a fucking pigeon, but I just need a real, living thing, to convey that it knows what this limbo feels like. 

Like if a stranger put they're hand on my shoulder in an affectionate way, or spoke to me in a reassuring tone, I would break down and cry on the spot, just something sincere.

2652,tennlr,pepi_67,"I feel as if I’m disgusting to everyone I have known and loved. It sort of makes me want to reconsider the value of me in their hearts. maybe to them, I am not to be hugged, listened to, or anything that is remotely affectionate. maybe they think I’m too repulsive to even attempt to do these things with. I thought it was normal to want to talk about things you’re interested in with your friends and for them to actively participate in your conversations, well it is for everyone else at least. In my case I always try to share what I’m interested in with my friends because it feels nice to talk about stuff you like. Although I definitely enjoy listening and interacting with my friends, I’m not so sure they want to reciprocate the friendship in that way. some background to why I think this: up until 2 years ago I have almost never shared things about myself unless I was asked, my friends however didn’t think this was an issue. I started to share more of myself with them because I do not want to be a shell of a person who is only there to comply and never voice out any thought about anything. The only issue with this development is the repetition of me talking about things i care about to my loved ones then being talked over/interrupted/ignored etc. This pattern makes me feel extremely unwilling to speak to anyone about anything but I ignore it with all my might. It feels so pointless to do this when no one really is showing any sign of genuine interest in what you have to offer, maybe I’m not meant to be listened to and cared for. I hope to be better and I’d hate being stagnant. I talked to my friends about this issue and they were very upset about it, of course I did explain that the things that contributed to my hurt were most likely unintentional on their part, and I genuinely hold no resentment towards them for any of that. I am aware that I was closed off for YEARS and going from silent to slightly more talkative isn’t that much of a difference to them as it is for me. I hope one day someone genuinely expresses interest in what I have to say, someone who wants to hug and hold me. someone who does not see me as repulsive and would shower me with physical affection. I might not be the best person but I know that isn’t a prerequisite to deserving love and affection and interest.

I just didn't want it to because this is the first friendship that I truly didn't want to lose or mess up. So I decided to tell her to try to get these feelings off my chest. I'm glad I did because it makes getting rid of those feelings so much easier. But I feel like I might have ruined the friendship. My reasoning behind telling them is just to get the sick choked up feeling out of my chest. Now that it's gone I feel so much relief but also fear that I may have screwed everything up.

2661,tep9uf,Gondal90,"I am looking for objective/unbiased feedback in an attempt to solve my problem. Feel free to look at my post history if it helps you understand me better. My problem is that throughout my life I have pretty much failed socially. I am 26 and I was not able to get even 1 girlfriend in my life. None of the friends I had ever stayed, they all just faded away. 

It generally seems like I am the one who cares more and has more desire for the relationship. It seems like the other person does not care as much as I do. Now I realize my perception/interpretation of people could be wrong. Perhaps I misinterpret how other people feel? I really don’t know. 

The thing is I did not have a good upbringing. It may sound like an excuse but it’s the truth. I was bullied relentlessly and alienated from my peers in the schools I went to. My parents were just as bad. They didn’t care. They did nothing about the bullying. Heck, they themselves were extremely abusive and neglectful. They never taught me how to behave properly and proper social etiquette/skills. They were unfortunately not the the smartest parents. 

My family was very restrictive. They heavily sheltered me. Because of this I did not develop much social experience/social skills. Now due to the severe bullying, neglect, and abuse I experienced growing up I developed deep rooted feelings of anger, resentment, insecurity, trust issues and poor social skills. I also have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. These things I think caused me to behave aggressively towards certain people which made them dislike me and further isolated me. 

I have attempted to resolve these psychological issues by seeing a Psychologist, multiple therapists, and a Psychiatrist for years. I also have been taking antidepressants daily for years. I have made lots of improvements in controlling anger, insecurity, and developing social skills but these negative feelings are not totally gone. Clearly I am trying hard to improve. 

The psychologist I went to and the therapists say I mostly lack social experience and social skills and I need to keep practicing. I try very hard to control my anger and insecurity but it’s not easy. I just want to be a normal person who succeeds socially and has friends, relationships.",2022-03-15 13:41:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567328286,3,/r/lonely/comments/tep9uf/can_someone_give_me_some_objective_feedback/,,0,2,Can someone give me some objective feedback?

I hate complaining to reddit I feel lonely. I hate complaining to reddit that I miss my ex. And most importantly I hate missing him.

But letting it out to anyone is really my only relief. I don't really have anyone to listen to me except for 4 people I met on reddit as well. So. Yk. 

He was too good at making me ignore how insecure and unstable I felt during the time I was with him. He was too good at making me feel addicted to his affection. He was too good at making me feel loved and wanted.

I don't like painting him as an evil psychopath. But I don't see him as a good person either. Not after he played with my feelings (deliberately or not doesn't matter), not after he tried to rebound with me even when he told his friends that he broke up with me bc he lost interest in dating. Then why? Why did you try to rebound with me? Why did you tell me you'd be happy if we could get back together soon? Well now it makes sense that you told me you wanted to ""see where it goes first"" while showering me with affection.

I know I can't go back to him bc of it. No matter how addicted I feel to his affection. No matter how much I want it all to go back to the way it was. 

I also don't feel like I should find another partner now. Even if I wanted someone to treat me as good as he does. Even if I wanted someone to be sweet to as soon as possible. I'll just hurt myself and other people in the long run. 

But now I just don't know what to do. Because I feel so broken and there isn't anything I can do. And my studies and my irl friends being awful is just really not helping.

2707,teyes9,socklint_,"I’ve never made a post on Reddit before but I needed somewhere to go to vent. I’m 25, I’ve always had a decent amount of friends. I use to always go out, my best friend of 8 years and I were attached at the hip. Within the last 6 months, everything came crashing down around me. My ex came back into my life after breaking up with his girlfriend (he left me for her a year ago). I made all kinds of new friends, rekindled old ones from our previous relationship together, we went to parties together, it was so much fun. I was truly so happy… until last week. I found out through SnapChat that he got back together with his ex. He’s obviously no longer speaking to me and I lost all the great friends I just made. My best friend no longer will speak to me because she’s upset I decided to get back with my ex after telling me a hundred times it was a mistake. I haven’t spoken to her since January. I feel stupid, selfish, and so lonely. I have other friends, sure, but they’re not “friends” if that makes sense. My other 2 best friends live 6 hours away both with husbands and kids so I can’t always vent to them because they’re so busy. The only human interaction I get is when I go home I see my parents (I lost my apartment the beginning of this year so I’m back in my toxic home environment) and when I’m at work. I lay in bed most days missing all that I had just 6 short months ago. I so badly want to apologize to my best friend but I don’t know how to go about it. I don’t want her thinking I’m doing it because I realized I made a mistake. I want her to know that I’m genuinely sorry. The fear of her rejecting my apology is what’s scaring me. I’m also a shy person so it feels like it’s going to be impossible to make new friends if she does.

2711,tez9ol,svetaxx,"I've been having a rough few days. I'm feeling pretty depressed about my life in general and so lonely. I live alone and have been for about 6 months now. It's my first time living alone and I work from home as well. I'm 26 and am just terrified and upset with the direction of my life.

I'm starting a new job next week and will be working in person for half of the week so I have something to look forward to. I have a handful of close friends but a lot of them have a boyfriend and are living with their partners. The others seem to live much fuller lives than me, have more plans, etc.

I do have a boyfriend that I've been with for a little over a year but we've run into some issues and it seems that we are going to be breaking up soon. We just want different things out of life and are both having a really hard time letting go of each other. We've been bickering more too.

My family is not close whatsoever. I don't speak with my father who was abusive my entire life. I do speak with my mom and sister (the two of them don't have a close relationship with one another and my sister doesn't speak much with my father either) but I just don't feel like I have a family honestly.

As I'm realizing my boyfriend and I are close to breaking up, I'm realizing how much companionship and friendship his presence brought me. He really does feel like my best friend and I am very close with his family, who almost make me feel like I have a family of my own. I feel like I'm subconsciously holding onto this relationship for dear life, knowing we might not be the best fit for each other long term, because I'm scared. A good amount of my friends are heading towards marriage or just seem to have a bigger friendship circle or closer relationships with family. I just feel so alone and I'm so scared. I'm not a big drinker but I was considering drinking a drink or two alone tonight because I'm just so sad and need some relief from my feelings. My friends are busy with their own partners, some of them living with them, and the others can be inconsistent at times. I'm getting so down on myself about how sparse my social life has gotten.

I know that I'm only 26, but I feel like time is flying by. I'm worried I won't ever get married or find the love of my life. I'm worried I won't ever have a family of my own. I'm worried I will feel this lonely for the rest of my life. I'm worried I will only fade further from my friends who are entering different phases of life. My biggest fear is never getting married which I know is irrational and not the end of the world. But I don't have enough of a social life to be okay with never being married. I don't have enough family or familial support to never get married. I have a lot of trauma that makes me crave a partnership and close friendships maybe more than the average person. I'm kind of rambling at this point but I'm just so depressed these days and terrified of how much worse it will get when my boyfriend and I go our separate ways.",2022-03-15 20:19:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637197180,3,/r/lonely/comments/tez9ol/so_lonely_lately_and_really_needing_some_support/,,0,1,So lonely lately and really needing some support

Starting to hate people in general and have strong thoughts of just going off somewhere.

I've failed as a mother. I've checked out emotionally, and it feels terrible. The guilt is killing me. I still do what a mother is supposed to do but that's exactly what it is – just going through the required motions. 

I've failed as a girlfriend. Always, except for ONCE in my life…and that turned out with *him* actually being the awful partner… Other than that one relationship, I've failed at all others, and am failing at my current one. 

I've failed as a daughter. My parents failed me too but I still feel guilty that I could never be what they wanted. 

I only let people down. I disappoint people. I let good feelings lapse and then I can't recover the way it once was. Every time. Every relationship. I stop caring and I can't figure out how to start it up again. 

Sometimes I just want to be by myself. Not be accountable to anyone. Not be responsible for anyone's emotions. Not be affected by anyone's view of me. Not have any effect on anyone else's life beyond an interaction in a drive-thru or paying rent to a landlord. Just quick transactions. And I can just eat all day and drink myself to sleep at night. Not have the pressure of trying to be fun or interesting to talk to. Not have the pressure of trying to improve or upkeep my appearance, while knowing I'm unattractive anyways.

2779,tf96nq,vindictiveviper,"Hi y’all, I’m a 22 year old guy (kid at heart lol) just looking to chat away with anyone who is interested!. Of course the irony of it all is that I have been pushing everyone away from my life lately, and nothing ever seems to be working out for me. Being alone hurts so much, it makes me question my existence and everything, it really puts me in a bad head space. I look at everybody else around me, I see the world thriving, people having the best of their lives, partying with friends and hanging out at each other’s place. I really am jealous of them all as I have never had the privilege to experience this all in my teens due to my strict upbringing. So yes, I have been lonely for most of my life, a prisoner of my own room, viewing stories of my friends having fun through a small rectangle screen while torturing myself to depressing thoughts, videos, music, etc. 

I don’t know what more to add, this all makes me look less appealing and so if you would wish  to skip this post and ignore me, you have every right to do so!. Apologies for taking your time to read this lengthy post :( . I wish you all well!

Here’s a wee bit of information about myself (Should you like to talk to me instead): 
- An introverted extrovert (yup, that’s me for sure lol) 
- I would like to know about you (well you can mark me as a listener), I enquire about people I care about almost on a daily basis 
- Religious (if you are too, that’s a bonus!)
- Be prepared for fights lol: NOT physical lmao just your regular messaging disputes or discourse (I feel like this is how relationships are really strengthened to the max, so if you don’t like it don’t bother lol) 
- Trust issues galore 
- I love sports in general, games as well (not overtly a gamer myself but will engage if it need be) and will converse about any matter  

Any gender is fine! Although I must warn females who would wish to talk, that all my previous female best friends have gone out of their way to love me but I’ve forced them all out, one of which is my ex (still wants to marry me off, WELP!), one had her family find out so I had to apologise in great detail while with the other I chose to keep my distance to avoid any potential conflict. For guys, it shouldn’t be much of a problem as I would expect you all to carry around your “no homo” pass for the rest of your lives. 

Lol that being said guys please don’t hit on me 😂 I’m straight!!

2781,tf9bfa,loidhoid,"As the title implies this post is a vent. I live in a family of 4 but feel lonely in my everyday life. My only companion is my dog she truly means the world to me. My family has eased up on their care for her, she requires light hospice care for blindness and diabetes, leaving me to pick up the slack. I do not mind but it is getting old. That dog is truly my best friend. I used to hang around unsavory type characters but no longer. I distanced myself from my old friends and I do distance schooling, partly by choice partly not. My friend list is very small, I would go as far as to say that is near nonexistent. My last outing with a friend was actually on my birthday 3 months ago. I had prioritized meeting with my friend over meeting with my family on my true birthday; maybe for truly reasonable reasons or because of the status of our relationship but I had to choose between going to dinner with my friend or with my family. I would consider my current family environment as toxic. My mom is selfish and lazy. My dad isn't perfect. He complains about substance abuse but succumbs to the pressures of beer and dip every day and night.  My brother is one of the unsavory types as mentioned before, albeit slightly less so but that could just be my relationship bias interfering. My dad is awesome. We have our issues but my dad has worked so much for my family. I mainly hang out in my room because I cannot stand to be around my family members, a functioning part of the dysfunction. It is not to hide away on purpose, maybe so. I have a short patience with family regarding the smallest issues which is a part of the reason why i hide away in my room. I have another brother in the army. He is awesome. I have no problems with him over the years and we have a great relationship. Ever since he left things have changed in my family. My mom used him to run errands, evidence of her laziness, but now that he is gone that option is no longer available. Things have taken a toll but that is too much to get into here. I want to move out. I want to escape. It is almost time for me to move out. I am finishing my AS degree and transferring to finish my BS so i will move out when i switch universities. That is not for another year or half. I am trying to manage. Moving out will be much easier after I have an AS than if i move out before. I will be able to use my degree, in accounting and finance, to get a job. I am 23. I am basically a hermit. I like it but I want to be a hermit with another person or with a network of friends. I have never been adept at making friends, even online. I feel trapped at home.

I have zero friends currently and honestly I don't think I've ever had a genuine friendship. I've never been one to express my feelings easily and open up including to my family and my family are probably the most emotionally unavailable people you'll ever meet. I've gone to them for help and it's concern for a day or two and then immediately brushed off. I get anxious I struggle socially but when I know it's bad I try and get help as best as I can. But no one understands me and no one takes the initiative to try to understand me either. 

I'm not exactly posting this to find someone or even have a conversion because again I struggle socially it's so hard to hold a conversion I always feel like I'm saying something wrong. I kinda just want to put this out there into the world where someone could possibly see just so I have some sort of presence in the world.

We were talking/goofing around for 3 hours or so and one then added me to their friends list and I even kept chatting with them today, but then randomly they removed me from friends list and it actually hurt me so much like a very unhealthy amount completely ruined my mood and whole day. 

Before someone tells me to just go outside and actually talk to people, it’s not like this is the first time I have experienced something like this. Even when I tried to make friends at work/college or anything it always ends the same way, a very one sided conversation and pretty much us never talking unless I am the one initiating conversation and trying to continue it by changing subjects and whatnot.

2837,tfhktg,chesil1,"I have many friends in school and I treat them like close friends, but over all these years I've never made a friend over a longer period of time. I act happy around them and talked about many things and hung out a lot with them, but at the end it always ends up with me not feeling... almost like satisfied being with them.

Maybe I should also explsin how I make my friends: 
Usually I talk to a person I sit next to or I like, I hang out with them and get into their friend group. Mostly when I am comortable in that group (which is usually a small group of 2-4 people btw)
I get a lonely person who hangs around me and get them into the friend group as well.
And they usually get good very fast.
But after a few month or years I just... don't feel like they care if I am there or not. 
And when I talk about it with them, they tell me that they'd love to be friends with me and would do anything to keep me around. But when I drift off they never even seem to notice. 
I know it sounds like I just block them out and tell myself that they dont care, but they just dont really talk to me if I don't talk to them and likewise chatting. 
So this is my point, i guess:

Whenever I have friends, I put so much effort into a good friendship and as soon as I stop they, they stop being a close friend. 

But it's even harder for me to get an online friend, it just never works and I don't know how to find someone in the first place

They seem to have better friends already
 and those I bring into the group enjoy it there without me too. And I'm happy for them, I just can't connect the same way.

I don't know if it matters, but: I also never been in love and I'm nit sure if I even love my family. I don't mind dying or death in general and it doesn't make me sag when someone or something dies, including pets.
Nor do I mind these problems enough to get a therapist to talk about it. I once had one and I learned, that I can't talk sbout my problems in person, I just tald her that I'm fine and so we never actually talked. 
I have heavy anxiety as well and sometimes I wonder if I am depressed.

I am pretty sure we ALL talk to ourselves alot as that's a common way to comfort ourselves when we don't have anyone else to rely on close by .

Well then WHY is it that i just refrain from talking to others as i feel like a burden on them ?

I recently turned 18 and currently live with my family - an older brother and parents . 

Me interacting with them , in a healthy manner // where we don't end up telling each other to die or hit each other etc // is a rare occasion. 

I crave normalcy and warmth almost everyday and feel pathetic for feeling this way since i believe i am the one who ruins the happy atmosphere in our household as well .

I tried to not be a nuisance by isolating myself but that also seems to hurt them .
When we do talk , we argue and that spirals me down to panic attacks and depressive episodes and it must have some impact on them as well since i KNOW that the words i use during those times hurt and cut deep .

I always feel guilty afterwards but you can't really take back what you said AND undo the effect it had on others yknow ?

I feel judged and disgusted whenever I ""open up"" as it feels like i am ""trauma dumping"" on others .

I have a habit of talking about everything once i am pushed enough , in a jumbled and confusing manner .

Lmao i remember apologizing to my old therapist many times since i just kept on venting/ranting about things nonstop. Sometimes having to take deep breaths in between .

I have a friend but i feel guilty whenever I tell them about what I feel since their life and thinking seems to be the opposite of mine . 
Dragging them down and making them concerned seems selfish and pathetic .

Similarly with my family 
I just -
Try so hard to not talk about certain things that can make me burst .
I just try so hard to be normal.
Its draining .

I always feel extremely tired after talking to almost anyone even if the conversation was a small talk that lasted for like 5 minutes as my brain just constantly tells me to screw shit up 

Create ""drama"" 
Talk about feelings or certain incidents which i KNOW is a conversation which will hurt everyone and heal nothing

These days my plushie has kind of become my confidant since i stopped going for therapy as i am stupid and broke

I cry while hugging him and rant to him about everything  and anything and i probably look like a maniac while doing so .
I wish I had a pet .
That would be nice ?

Something/someone warm to hug .
That loves you unconditionally.
That trusts and relies on you and doesn't criticize you constantly .

Maybe one day i will be able to find that and open up without crying like a baby or screaming .

Maybe ?

For some reason, virginity at this age is viewed as a red flag.

In a way, I don't feel as motivated to lose my virginity. This is strange considering how arousing the idea of sex is and that I masturbate on the daily. 

I sometimes wonder that for the times I was close to potentially losing my virginity, I was one step away (and didn't know I was supposed to go that extra step) or screwed it up in the dumbest way possible but didn't realize until it was too late. 

So I simply concluded that this is never going to happen. Then again, that's what I thought when I was 16 and with getting a girlfriend. She actually threw herself at me. I was familiar with her, but I didn't even know her name until the day after. It all happened so fast.

Im now in college and I just cant relate to anyone there, they all like anime or k-pop, most of them are gay, bi or trans so theres nothing we have in common really other than our course but i know the second i finish in july im gonna be totally alone again because i see everyone there as acquittances and not as friends.    


Online is a whole different story, again i always had that one person I could play games with or so but I havent had that in a while I can search for people join discord communities, browse through the making friends sub-reddits but you just get ignored by anyone u messaged or ghosted soon after talking. I always get told ""theres gonna be someone out there you can click with"" but it just feels impossible. Ive just been so alone for so long, being fucked over by anyone new I meet, no one puts in the same effort as me (required amount that a friendship should have) and just feeling like im the only person in the world that has these interests. Im just fed up at this point I hate being alone all the time  but I also think its easier being alone just caz you dont have to put up with all the bullshit people have to offer sometimes.

I feel so out-of-touch with my peers because of my lack of ""normal"" life experiences. I'll list some things off that I've never done.

1. I've never been to a friend's birthday party before and have only ever been to a neighbor's party when I was 7.
2. I never hung out outside of school with friends until I was 15.
3. I've never been to the beach with friends before and have never worn a bikini (kind of random but just highlighting my lack of experience).
4. I don't use any social media because I don't want to waste time on it and I also don't have friends to post with. People tend to view this as a red flag and don't want to talk to me anymore after realizing this fact.
5. I've never been in a relationship either. This is actually still relatively normal for someone of my age, but just another thing to add to my list of things I've never done.

I groom myself and dress pretty well so people would assume I probably do have friends and a decent social life, but in reality I always feel lonely and have no friends at all.",2022-03-16 18:54:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647455326,27,/r/lonely/comments/tfpddv/anyone_never_experience_things_everyone_else_went/,,0,3,Anyone Never Experience Things Everyone Else Went Through as a Child?

She deserves to be happy and with someone that’ll treat her right. But the regret and what it could’ve been is killing me. She’s moved on and I’m here to suffer. I deserve it 100% but this shit is unbearable. 

I know I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life. Im 29 and things aren’t in my favor. This is like a prison sentence but living in a free world. Im starting to accept this life sentence because of the hurt and the pain I caused her. But I just don’t know if I can put up with it. 

Gotta keep on trucking and hope for the best.

2900,tfsbjq,Tiger_237,"On Monday I started my third week at my [first] job but I don't know if I will make it to next month because I forget everything I've been taught and am too slow for the position. Seems like the reason I've made it this far is because my immediate boss and mentor pities me and doesn't report all these slip-ups I have made, I can't stand myself any longer, I have a boiling hatred for the figure I see whenever I stand by the mirror - I'd strangle it with my hands if I could or had the guts to. I'm useless, no, I'm beyond useless. Not even a useful idiot. I can't even count fucking boxes for crying out loud! I'm a disappointment and failure by any metric, had everything handed to me in a silver plate and O still fuck up. My mind is always up in the clouds, living fantasies and imagining scenarios given my poor performance at work and in my personal life. I want to silence them, I want to bury these images and sounds but I simply can't! I try and try just to fail. My boss thinks I get angry at him after he calls out what I am doing wrong but that isn't the case, I keep quiet after being berated because I want people to know I understand the situation and my wrongdoing - but apparently that's having a ""disgusting character"".

This loneliness of mine is destroying my psyche bit by bit, I spend hours talking to myself because there's no one to text or call. I'm tired of being forgotten, of simply being *there*. Going back home to my bed and computer isn't healthy but what else can I do? I've lost all interest in the hobbies I used to enjoy, I'm terrified of going outside and talking to people in order to make friends because I *know* my ineptitude and awkwardness will inevitably push them away until they are no longer around me, if I open to them I will get hurt no matter what, as has happened in the past. What can I do? Is there any hope? Should I even bother at this point?

I don't know what to do, I've struggled with dissociative disorders, generalised anxiety and depression for over four years but neither therapy or medication has helped me. I don't tell my boss because I don't want to be treated differently to others or be straight up fired for being a burdensome individual for the company.

Some time ago I was diagnosed with cancer, which was not the biggest issue. The cancer was curable, that's why I'm here, but the price I had to pay for it was enormous. I couldn't really go out, because of my poor immune system (caused by cancer treatment) so I didn't have any friends, everyone stopped giving a shit about me as soon as they found out about the diagnosis. I was fine with that, I found myself a passion that I wanted to turn into a job, but after 2 years I lost the joy and fun that I was getting from it. Currently, I have no friends, I don't know how to make any, and I also don't have anything that I like to do in life. The truth is that I was lonely from the start of the treatment, but I just didn't realize it or didn't care about it because I had something I liked doing in life, but now that I lost it, I have nothing. Also, I graduated, and I'm in a new school for a couple of months now, and after this time I can see that even though I'm trying my best I'm being an outcast. I mean, everyone acts like they like me in school but no one wants to spend time with me after school, they are not reaching out to me + they are ignoring/finding excuses if I am the one reaching out.

TW: Suicide

At the beginning of the year a friendship that meant a lot to me ended in a disastrous manner. I'm still hurt and confused over what really happened, and I'm afraid the truth will never come out. I do my best to try and move on, but it looks like it is taking longer than I anticipated. The friendship had turned romantic a couple of months prior, but due to the pandemic and living in different countries we were unable to meet and make anything official. Still, I felt like once we'd meet, we'd start a relationship. We had been planning the meetup already and the things we'd do.

I know I messed up at times and I do have a part in the relationship falling apart, but we're all human and make mistakes. I could have forgiven for his mistakes, if he would have apologized, but he didn't. It felt like he turned everything around and blamed me. People who I told about the situation stood by me and told me his behavior wasn't right, and one even said he was gaslighting me. I still tried fixing it. This whole thing took a toll on my mental health and I got drunk twice and made attempts on my life. 

A month later I had to put my cat to sleep. Almost 2 weeks ago I received the ashes and the grief that I thought I was over came right back. I have these random feelings everyday of the cat still being in the house, but she's not. I have split second thoughts of feeding, brushing and petting the cat, but I can't. She was sick and it would have been cruel to keep her alive. I don't regret my decision, but I miss her so much. I got her when I moved into my first apartment at 18 years old, and she was already an old lady back then, but she was always so healthy and active. Not having her around in the house just feels so unreal. The house just feels empty.

And of course, since misery comes in threes... I was supposed to go to a concert with another friend, but he decided that he didn't feel like going anymore. This concert was something I was really looking forward to, along with meeting my other friend, and now neither one of them is happening. I feel betrayed by my friend, since apparently he's not that into the band anymore, but didn't feel like telling me when the tickets were on sale... He also previously said that another friend of his would be coming with us, made it seem like he had a ticket also, but later said that friend never intended to come. My friend had some other reasons/excuses as to why he doesn't want to go, but he could have messaged me and talked about it.  


I feel like shit. Two of my closest friends seem to have lied to me and I've lost my cat. I don't have much left. I feel so alone. I want to wake up from this nightmare. I thought that this year could have been good, I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but now I feel like the rug has been pulled from underneath me, thrice in a row. I can't think of anything other than alcohol to help me cope with all of this.",2022-03-16 22:44:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612374351,2,/r/lonely/comments/tfvbob/betrayed_and_alone/,,0,0,Betrayed and alone

I was recently ghosted by someone I was seeing as well and that really bothered me. They couldn't just tell me they weren't interested anymore.. Even when I asked for them to at least tell me.

2946,tfy9zv,kywas_,"hi everyone. im 23 years old. until now, i feel like ive always have to beg people to go “somewhere” or to “do something”. now most of the time i wait for invitations and i dont like making them because i always get rejected, i always say yes (or most of the time) i always try to make the time and make other people feel special and appreciated.

the thing is my boyfriend is playing a showcase tomorrow. two friends told me they wanted to hang out with me and i said i had this event and it would be super nice for them to come with me, they said yes 2 weeks ago.

i talk to them again today to see what was the plan for tomorrow since they werent saying anything… one of them said “i forgot:-(((“ like… is that how relevant am i for you? and added she didnt have any money since she spent the whole week going out. the other one said she has a test on friday… and then added she might have covid… i dont know if this things are true because i feel so let down.. like why i always feel like im not that important to anyone.. its always “i forgot” “i cant” do they really can’t? or they just dont want to..

ive come to the conclusion that in some way im forced to be more independent emotionally and physically, maybe i do want to relay in people, but at the end i just prefer to assume that im such an introvert because i have no other choice.

ive always been scared of celebrating my birthday, people always come with weird excuses last minute and its so sad to just not do anything for your birthday because you cant do much, because people doesnt want to be there or you are not that important for them. 

i know i have my boyfriend and family, but sometimes i wished having one or two really close friends to just have each others back.

i had a friend for a while, but then he got a gf and he just stopped talking that much to me and became more like and interested thing? he spoke to me to drive him somewhere far away.. as a good friend i wanted to help him thinking maybe he would make the favor back.. but the minute i said i wanted to invite him to this event he didnt replay anymore… later i also said the situation with the first two friends and no replay neither…

in some way i feel so lonely, not because there’s no people, there is some of them, but they always make me feel in the shadows like im not even important to them, im not that interesting to talk or to bond to, like it doesnt matter if im there or not it would be the same.. ive noticed that when people tell me stories and i say like.. i was there….. it’s so sad and im done begging i just prefer being alone but it feels worst being alone because it wasnt your choice..",2022-03-17 01:10:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617983854,6,/r/lonely/comments/tfy9zv/how_am_i_supposed_to_celebrate_my_birthday/,,0,2,how am i supposed to celebrate my birthday…

I’ve been feeling so disconnected from everyone for awhile now. Like an npc in a video game or side character in a tv show kind of disconnected if that makes sense. Like I am there to teach everyone else a lesson on how to be a better person or move on from some kind of trauma so they can move on from me and find their real friends. Like I’m just temporary, a tutorial on how to make friends that you can just forget about as soon as your done with it. 
Maybe it is my self isolating tendencies that have done this to me but I really wish that for once someone noticed when something was wrong with me and actually asked if I was ok. I really wish people asked me questions about my life and my thoughts instead of it feeling like I always have to force them to listen to me. It’s not like my friends are mean when I talk about my life but it feels like I always have to bring it up myself because no one will ask. 
People seem to always end up leaving just as I feel that I can trust them. Just when I feel that I can tell them when something happens to me they always seem to move away, switch schools, or start making new better friends. 
I don’t want to be that person who sits sad in the corner loudly sighing until someone asks what’s wrong but when I’m exhausted at the end of the day and can hardly muster the energy to speak it would be nice if someone checked in on me. Just genuinely asked if something is wrong maybe even ask if there is something they can do to help. Or when I say I’m listening to music or watching a new tv show someone asking me what I’m watching/listening, maybe even checking out whatever I said I liked to see what I’m talking about.

I get that I tend to go above and beyond for my friends in what I will do for them and expecting them to do the same for me is ridiculous. A good portion of them don’t have access to the resources I do which is why I offer the help to them but it would be nice if someone could offer some time for me. Just some time to listen to what I like and ask what I’m planning to do today and not just because I asked about their day. 
I just don’t want to feel so alone all the time. After all I know so many people at this point that I should properly click with one of them. Maybe it’s my fault for not reaching out to them to ask for help. It sometimes feels like if I can notice when something is wrong with them that one of them might notice when I’m struggling.

But after getting emotionally hurt by someone, I just feel stupid. This feeling of loneliness I never had, is suddenly taking over. But the worst part is that I’ve now become reluctant to meet people and make new friends.

So yeah, got emotionally hurt, somehow triggered my loneliness, now I’m reluctant to meet people, but I’m lonely. Totally the worst, isn’t it.

I just hate this weird feeling. I still like being alone, but I feel lonely. Maybe it’s that I’ve become too self conscious and don’t like “looking” lonely to other people? I just don’t know.

Sorry if what I wrote doesn’t really make sense, but I think I’m having a hard time emotionally. I know the only way to solve this is to not feel self conscious and overcome this by actively meeting people, but easier said than done.

2993,tg43ad,The_A_Man626,"You ever feel ignored? Like the third wheel of every situation? Always picked last for sports? Yeah that’s me. I never fit in. I want a real group of friends. But I’m afraid that will never happen. I have two close friends who are in a separate friend group that I’m not in (I don’t get along with their friends). Us three have a separate group chat for memes and discussion etc. Occasionally my two friends will rant on and on about their other group chat with their friends. Another time one of my friends will ask my other friend if he wants to do something clearly implying that I’m not invited. When confronted about it he made up a lie that I’m supposed to be included, but it doesn’t feel that way. 

On another note, I have a group of people that I know (I don’t know if I’d call them real friends) who consist of my two neighbors who I see as brothers and people I met through them. This group kind of took me in when I was lonely in highschool, but they also tried to get me to try using drugs which I reluctantly agreed to. Now to start with, these neighbors and I used to hang out all the time since we were little. But things started to change when I would hang out with them and they would invite another friend over who I didn’t know. These individuals would continually tease and bully me and my neighbors didn’t do anything about it; they just let it happen. Fast forward to today, we’re all fresh in college and I still feel that I’m being mistreated by them all. I’m the butt end of every joke, I am constantly harassed about my weight and how I have never had s*x or even had a girlfriend. 

I see everyone on social media living life to the fullest and having the time of their lives. I want that. I want to enjoy my spring break partying and living large. Instead I’m stuck behind a phone, working out, or playing video games like a bum. I just want to truly be apart of something. I never fit in to any real specific group.

2999,tg4qro,tantrumdisco,"before i start, yes i am aware that to solve this problem i should just speak up for myself and step out of my comfort zone and etc etc. but it really isnt that easy for me right now as im also struggling with other aspects of my life, especially social anxiety. so i just needed a place to vent without people telling me to just approach other students and talk to them. because i have done that, but it never goes anywhere else.

so im a first year student and i struggle to make friends in college. my anxiousness is so bad and i always feel uncomfortable in a room full of others. i cant even contribute in tutorials or discussion, so people give me odd looks. the people i do want to talk to, and who i think are interesting for me to wish to be friends with are out of my league. i havent done much with my life - it is pretty boring considering i was raised as a very obedient and sheltered kid. so the people who i want to be friends with think im weird, and its true because i have no experience doing the things they do or having enough topics to talk about. so i always feel two steps behind everyone. im so self conscious of myself, my appearance, personality, experiences to reach out to anyone. even though i partly blame my parents for being way too strict on me, in the end i just feel like an idiot because they are not really the ones who gave me social anxiety and made me so boring. 

my close friend who i used to talk to everyday has stopped putting in effort to talk to me. its very hurtful because now i literally dont talk to anyone anymore. i dont have any family members im too close with, no internet friends or relatives i like. my friend wont text me if i dont text her first, and our conversations have gotten shorter and shorter. so this contributes even more to my feeling of alienation and social ineptness.",2022-03-17 07:39:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632409526,2,/r/lonely/comments/tg4qro/extreme_anxiety_and_loneliness_in_college/,,0,2,extreme anxiety and loneliness in college

3001,tg4xi6,Emo-emu21,"I don’t really know how to start this, but I’ve felt a really deep sense of loneliness, just really not feeling super close to people for a very long time. To anyone who went to school with me until probably my senior year of college, it would appear as though people liked spending time with me, and I them. But I have truly not felt as though the effort or concern for the friendship has quite been reciprocated, and I don’t think it honestly matters if I’m not doing well, at least according to my old friends. Last year, I went through a lot of shit that kept me contemplating suicide almost daily, and I had pushed a lot of anyone I had considered close to away on accident but was comfortable in isolating and not talking to anyone later, so I kept it up in hopes of 2 things: a) for them to reach out to ME first, b) to notice my drastic change in behavior from goofy/chill/outgoing to very irritable/withdrawn/just not the same due to circumstances at the time that had caused me to spiral like I had never coped with before.

What I found is that I wasn’t contacted for a month by anyone (excluding for school/work) except for one friend, who has ulterior motives of being more than friends. And I probably wouldn’t have been contacted at all had I not reached out to people first.

I think a lack of uncertainty for me about what constitutes a normal, non-emotionally and verbally abusive/manipulative family as well as not spending time with kids my age often (controlling family liked to limit my recess and I was gone every summer until the age of 20, had to be home right after school, etc so it felt incredibly hard to form connections), and growing up with the mindset of depending on people being perceived as weak definitely contributed to my putting up a strong front and not really talking about the extent of my depression. Maybe bc I don’t like discussing a lot of my problems openly for fear of judgment or vulnerability being used against me, as had happened an ungodly number of times growing up, but when I have brought up issues, it seemed like I received an “oh that sucks” or “but didn’t you grow up rich and travel every summer” “why are u sad if you have everything” or a sense of apathy/dismissal and a continuation with them using me as their therapist with no reciprocity.

She’s always spoke kindly to me when she’s had too, I just like that she seems sweet. A year or two ago, I stupidly got brave and desperately asked a different girl if she had a date for Valentine’s Day. I just ran up and acted thirsty and she told me she had a boyfriend. I was crushed but I played it off and I got over it. My life’s a joke, I went to the girl I previously mentioned and did the same, her eyes lit up and I could see her smile behind her mask. I ran the same dialogue with a friend I knew had a boyfriend, said I was doing a bit. I was just trying to lighten up. Since then, I’ve tried several times to flirt with the girl that this post is about, sometimes she’s sweet and dismissive like she thinks I’m just joking around. I’d ask her what she was doing after work on New Years, her face would light up and she’d lean in and I’d have nothing backed up to say, I’m just trying to show that she has my attention by trying to flirt with her, not trying to run game on her because I actually like her. I’d wish her a happy Valentine’s Day a year or two after the fact. She responds likewise. I just feel desperate in the situation. I just want the company and companionship that comes with a relationship but I feel like, with this young woman,  I come off as disingenuous and I’m afraid to push the issue because I’m being extra careful.

I guess I came on here to see if there was anyone that I connected with or just to feel less lonely in this huge world. Any tips on how to feel motivated, and how to feel less lonely?

There was no place in my heart before so I made one but it remained empty

Other guys are very shallow in emotions and have egos but they are loved, they have friends, 

I very deeply understand someone's emotions, I help everyone still I have not a single friend
I help trees, animals, people in need but
I am always alone

I hate sundays, I hate festivals
Peoples are happy in their life, they get gifts many times
They get their birthday celebrated great
They create special dishes and enjoy

I am always alone in festivals
I don't eat anything special anyday
Even I stay on empty stomach sometimes

No one even remembers my birthday, the day comes and it goes and another year to wait for another alone birthday.
At end of the day I feel that everyone has someone who can understand them, 
I don't have met any single person in my lifetime to 
Who can understand me and I don't think that I will even find any

I am very badly broken by this now.

I just feel that my mental level is very high so I fear that and I will not find anyone who will understand me and will be of my mental level

3099,tgky85,RedDragon97987,"23 m, I’m fucking tired. I’m not ugly and i have no self esteem issues and I’m definitely not insecure. I’d cut someone off in a whim if they piss me off. I’d also consider myself pretty damn good looking &amp; I’m definitely not a narcissist. I just graduated college and at this stage you’re supposed to have a lot of friends right, a girlfriend, people who you can trust? Ha. I lost everything. I have no friends, no one to talk to, I’m lonely as fuck, and it’s been over 2 years since my last relationship. I just feel so angry all the damn time. I wake up and check my phone and see 0 notifications every morning and it’s so depressing. No one checks up on me, no one says a word to hang out, I always have to reach out and when it’s convenient my so called “friends” will invite me. I’m so fucking done with this shit. I literally just need a few people in my life. A girl, and a best friend to talk to or hangout with, and I somehow I cannot get either.

Now that I graduated, I’m stuck at home with my parents and I’m absolutely miserable here. I make my own money, i pay for all my stuff, but yet i still just hear just negativity all the time at home, there’s never any optimism and I swear to god it’s my dads life goal to shut me down. I’m not a dumbass, but my own fucking parents still think I am even though I make more then double then the average person and don’t even spend stupidly. It’s draining, and I have less and less energy everyday.

Then there’s the issue of I CANNOT for the love of god Find someone worth dating. 
I’ve been on dating apps for months now, I’ve been on a grand total of 5 dates. On top of that, being a fucking Indian person doesn’t help me at all. I never match with any other race other then my own and when i do nothing leads to anything, I never got laid in any one of them.. I know people significantly uglier then me with a much drier personality dating the girls i wanna be with and honestly my mindset going into these dates isn’t to get laid either. I’m trying to build a connection, but either the girls are unresponsive, using the app as validation, ghost me, or just flat out under my standards. When i match with a 10, there’s a 99% chance they’re out of state. This might be partially because I just won’t settle for anything less then what I deserve. My ex devastated my heart when she broke up with me, I never understood why when I made her my world, but I don’t think anyone is out there to do that for me. 

I’m not looking for pity, and honestly maybe I just needed to vent. But it’s so frustrating. I go day by day and keep my head up strong, but night by night, I go to bed in so much pain. I’m sick of being lonely, idk what I did to deserve this. I’m not a bad person, and I genuinely care for other people, but it just seems like every time I try it’s always one way",2022-03-17 21:34:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634968295,1,/r/lonely/comments/tgky85/im_sick_of_this_shit/,,0,3,I’m sick of this shit

3112,tgm4j6,Sarah6893,"I have never found way too easy to make friends. In the early year of elementary, I barley had any friends. I guess I had some though I never really took much time into it if you know what I mean. Like in third grade, I started being friends with the “popular girls”. Since I didn’t really know how to be a friend, they kinda brainwashed me to become some bad person, so I become one. I always knew it was wrongs and I never really felt accepted there. I barley spoke and I could only speak a certain times or else I’ll be judged since I was lower in there rank. 

However, once 4th grade rules, things for really good. I had my actual first ever group. We were few though as the years went by, we grew stronger and bigger. I always never put too much effort into it though. I just talked to them at school and that was it. I guess some of us didn’t become as strong. I really only was strong with two. 

Once I got in high school, I was expecting to make many new friends; to start a new path. Though it was quite the opposite. I sit alone everyday at the same day next the wall. The funny thing is that wear I am is right next to wear one of my friends from 4th grade sits. She barley acknowledges me. She hags out with the other kids from our old school but now me, even though I was closest person she know there really. I guess it was my fault at some since I wasn’t the best friend at first, though I have change to a much better person.

I have made few friends. One from my English who is very sociable and one from my biology is more shy. I always wanted to grow a stronger relationship with them. They even hang out with each other so it seems perfect. I just can’t get the pieces together. I know for this I have stand up, I have to look up and move on this path. It’s just so hard because I’m always waiting for someone to lift me up.

In October it started to go off the rails when things were serious and I needed more markers of commitment. My neighbors moved for various reasons and don’t have time for me. All my classes are online. My dog park friends have drama. I have more responsibility since I was hired by the place I volunteer and mostly work alone while the nice older people get to do the same teamwork and I have to drive around picking up orders.

For a few months I had it all, and post-BU I lost everything else that was supposed to help me be okay without him. We had issues 2 months ago and have been officially broken up for 1 month but before all that we had plans for today (St. Patrick’s day, I know no big deal but I remember looking forward to it.) I saw people partying downtown and I just can’t go, can’t run into him, and I’m home alone.

3132,tgnylv,ladylavenderrrr,"So, I try to make friends usually anywhere I go. Shopping, out to bars or to eat, my school (community College), and just generally anywhere. And maybe not even friends per se, but just ppl to talk to/relate to. It's so hard. I'm a naturally lonely person who craves human interaction and when I don't get it regularly, I become depressed and desperate for some sort of connection. Even if it's a small convo with the cashier at the gas station. But as soon as I get my ""fix"" aka small convos with random strangers, I become sad and lonely again. I just want friends, and people who like me and are interested in my hobbies and care about the things I say. Again, it's hard and it's starting to seem impossible. No one wants to talk.

I'm single, and have been for a while. My last relationship was severely toxic and unhealthy and I'm still trying to heal from that honestly. But that doesn't mean I don't want romance or the feeling that someone fucking likes me. I'm attractive, intelligent, and I feel like I have cool interests and I'm actually interested in all sorts of different things. I like to talk about books, films, photography, history, psychology, philosophy, politics, debate on topics like religion and other controversial things. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. I don't wanna talk about who someone's recently watched on tiktok bc I don't fucking care about that stupid shit. I wanna talk about real shit. I wanna hear about people's passions, their dreams and fears. I'm sick of small talk and people who only wanna talk about celebrities and tiktok and other social media. I don't even have social media (besides this) anymore bc it started feeling fake and I wanna pay attention to more important shit.

Also, forget dating lmao. Everyone on tinder or other dating apps are ugly, fake or lame looking. I'm judgemental I guess but I'm not lowering my standards for anyone anymore and idc if that makes me sound narcissistic. I know what I want and what I deserve. People who act interested in me for one or two days quickly stop replying and seem to lose interest immediately and I know how to hold a convo very well.

I don’t know what I did to deserve this. I’m so sad, all I want is to feel normal again. The weather is nice, and I need to go back to work, and I took advantage of that when I wasn’t sick and I would do anything to go back to that now.

I remember yelling and screaming and arguing over everything. Like, I mean going to sleep crying 5 nights out of seven. The thing is I never spoke up about all the chaos, because I didn't know it was bad. I was also falsely medicated with heavy doses of Vyvanse and Risperdall (or Risperdone idk).

Anyways, that's kinda like the backstory for this. Growing up I never really had friends, and so they meant a lot to me. The less you have, the more they mean. In 4th grade I made a friend in this girl who I found the prettiest and kindest creature I've ever met, Bella. Me and Bella grew very close, I asked her out several times, as dumb kids don't know when to stop, to which she politely said no every time, but she was still the same person afterwards. In 5th Grade, me and Bella were going good, then one day I ask this dude, Mason, where she was. He said ""Didn't you hear, Bella got home schooled.""

I had lost the only thing that mattered. Following this, I didn't realize it until now, but I became a womanizer, I developed a fear of abandonment, and I've trashed 4 really good and positive relationships, because of said fear.

I beat myself up about it nearly every day. Am I being petty, or do I just have a strong sense of sentiment?

3192,tgv7du,Folk_Herro,"Hey everyone, I hope you're having a good day/night wherever you are. I'm writing this because honestly, I feel entirely undesirable. I'm 25 and I've done about every self-care method to-date. From therapy, to changing my wardrobe, to losing weight, to using a new skin care routine (I love it) to focusing on my career (made huge strides in the past 8 months), taken myself out on dates, almost anything I can think of that makes me feel good and I still feel terrible. I go out a lot (often by myself) and I know I'm not a very approachable person and my anxiety over the pandemic has only gotten worse. But I still try because I don't want to be alone anymore. I'm tired of crying every night only to wake and smile to the world for 16 hours like I'm okay when I'm not. I don't think ugly or anything either. There are things I hate about myself (I hate my smile A LOT) but I've come to accept them. I feel like as a person, I'm in a better spot now then I was 2 years ago this time when I tried to harm myself and end everything.


But no matter what I do, no matter what advice I take, no one has ever wanted to be with me. I asked my crush and she only sees me like a friend. She is truly a great person and I want her in my life in fashion but why is it that no one has ever wanted me? I try not be ego centric and think someone has to love me because I understand it doesn't work like that. Everyone has preferences and the right to be with someone who fulfills but I can't help but wonder why has no one looked at me in that way? I can't help but wonder I'm missing to never have one person in 25 years say ""I want to be with you"" and actually mean it. The women I've dated have never once told me that there's something wrong with me as a person or how I look. My friends are always surprised when they learn I'm still single in my life updates, coworker can't believe it, girls I do meet with are always surprise and sometimes turned off by this and hurts so much. I can't control how someone feels nor do I want to. But there has to be something I'm missing, there has to. I just don't know what it is and I'm obsessed with it. I know its unhealthy, but I desperately want to be loved. It's the only thing I've ever desired, more than my own career. I really don't know what to do to improve my chances. I don't truly see the great guy people see when at the end of the day, I'm alone again. 


I'm sorry if it's a long read, I really am. I just had to vent a lil and i plan to go back to therapy after another failed attempt. I'm just very lost and my cries for help often go unnoticed.

3194,tgvhg7,Throwawaylonely40,"Figured I’d share my 40 years of dating experience here. Basically I don’t have any.

I’ve barely asked many girls out really, but those I’d did ask rejected me pretty hard and certainly weren’t flattered to be asked. In fact I’ve gad to apologise every time for even asking.

One girl hugged me once but she was just being nice and wasn’t interested in romance. I think my sole “romantic” experience is a girl being dared to kiss the next random person who came through a door and that person was me. It was only on the cheek but she was semi attractive at least. That was 20 years ago. However, to me romance is a two-way thing really, so basically I’ve never experienced anything, not even holding hands. Girls will sometimes talk to me at least, but I’m only ever potential friendship material at best and there’s never the slightest bit of romance.

My failures always bothered  me slightly but I kind of believed the bullshit that I’d find someone eventually. It then became obvious that was never going to happen so I put more effort into seeking a partner, only for dating apps etc to increase my sense of rejection much more so (they messed  with my mind so much at one point). Anyway it seems to get to me more and more as time goes by, so if you’re wondering if it gets any easier, then the answer is probably no. I talk to other people who are single and they talk of having fun dating, memories etc and I simply have that part if my life completely missing and of course I find the process of attempting to find a partner so much work and basically torture. It causes me pain physically at this point, but then so does loneliness and not trying. I suppose at least I haven’t resorted to drugs or alcohol yet, they’re not really my thing and I think a suicide attempt would be more likely if my life gets any worse or if I get too many more bad rejections (I’m not at that stage yet thankfully, but I can definitely now understand the type of depression and loneliness that gets people towards that point).

I’ve had the experience of seeing former friends on social media first with partners, then getting married then having kids. I stopped looking at that kind of thing almost a decade ago but of course it hurts and even now I’m still stuck seeking my first kiss as if I’m basically still a young teen. I was drifting away from friends anyhow, but just seeing them go through life while mine basically hasn’t even started yet has meant I needed to disconnect from them completely.

I’ve never shared my story before, I don’t even know why I’m posting it really and I’m not sure most people would believe it TBH. I’m not even fat or ugly or hugely socially awkward. I don’t look great from certain angles I guess, but I’m a 5 out of 10 looks wise and my body must be a 6.

I’d just like to experience love once before I die basically. In fact right now I’d just like to experience asking a girl out on a date (or her asking me), and both of us at least enjoying each other’s company in a somewhat romantic sense.",2022-03-18 07:02:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647582213,11,/r/lonely/comments/tgvhg7/40m_never_been_in_a_relationship_or_on_a_date_or/,,0,5,40/m never been in a relationship or on a date or even kissed.

3197,tgw1e1,DeerStalkr13pt2,"Warning-This is a medium length post

I am going to start this out by saying this: It's been a long time coming. My mom and Dad divorced when I was 6. I'm fourteen now, and will be 15 soon. I lived with my Mom until I was 12, because of my actions, I had to move to my Dads. I've since cleared up my act.

About a month ago, my mom called me and told me that she was moving. The reasons were:

\--She had no family

\--She kept getting back and breaking up with an abusive boyfriend (The last straw was when he got convicted of defrauding medicare)

\--And she was under a lot of stress.

And so, she moved from Texas to Arizona. She left me, and my sister joined her. I'm living with my Dad and my step-mom.  I felt lonely, since I don't really have the most...open relationship with my father. I've been studying and building model kits to keep my mind off of things. (I have quizzes almost every other day, so I study a lot. AP human geo is a fun, but hard I am not going to lie.)

You may be thinking ""OP, why don't you call your mom and talk to her?"" I have no phone, my Dad won't buy me one, and I can't really talk openly about the things I feel, since my dad is kind of...nosey, and if his ego is hurt, he gets really mad.

Recently, my Mom has been kinda pressuring me to live in Arizona with her, and it makes me mad. I have family here, in Texas! I can't just leave them! I also don't want to leave my Dad, as while he is overbearing, I feel like he would be angry at me, I feel like he'd be hurt, my grandma would be hurt, heck, my Great-Grandma Ruby would be hurt as well. 

I don't know what to do, I love my mom, and I love my Dad as well. I don't like how my Mom just up and moved without giving me much notice (I had a weekend with her before she left, which she left the day before Valentines Day.) What do y'all think I should do?

I'm useless in that regard - here's to hoping the online course I've started helps me in that regard.

But at the same time I feel so puny and unwanted. Twice I worked up the courage to start talking to someone online that I wanted to go on a date with, and twice I've just been ghosted.

3213,tgy65d,Pleasant_Day6857,"Never really intended to post this but it’s just something I wrote because I struggle to explain how I feel. This was intended to be just for me so if it’s extremely vague there’s a purpose behind it. I Don’t expect anyone to read this and excuse the grammatical issues as I did not care enough to fix them.

The following can be added to the beginning of the sentence to make sense. I/ im/ you/ your
- feel empty/ sad/ mad/ pointless
- Can’t look at you anymore/ just a shell of your old self/ feel like ever since a certain event things haven’t been the same, don’t act the same
- No allowed to hold you/ touch you/ even look at you anymore, without you pulling away, telling me to move, “don’t look at me”
- Feels like you learned to live life without me. That’s fine just stings a little 
- Ask “can I get attention” like I haven’t been waiting an entire fuckin year just to hold you, caress you, comfort you
- Tells me to go play my games like if that’s not what I’ve been doing for the past damn year, tired of games, tired of wasting precious time now that I’m here
- You keep your distance until you want something 
- Disappointed your able to call random friends or family but took you at least 3 months just to shoot me a plain txt. Even then I’m the one that started the convo
- Really waited an entire year/ paid over 3000 in expenses/ couldn’t wait to get home just to feel ignored, useless, pointless 
- Ironically enough the one most excited to see me was my little sister who I’ve been ignoring all this time
- don’t know what to do with myself… dedicated all this time and recourses to come home and now that I’m here it feels like my life is a lie. If I can’t be happy where I thought was my happy place then what is my happy place? What is my purpose if I’m not needed here… 
- Not happy but I don’t want to let go of precious memories…maybe there’s a solution to this feeling…maybe not

Inner thoughts 

Damn… really couldn’t wait to get home just to want to go back to work… only time I actually feel like I have a purpose, where people rely on me, believe in me, support me. But work isn’t the happiness I want to have… I miss the old ways of being happy, relationships, friendships, bonds. Maybe I’m not cut out for this stuff. Should I just forget these past couple years. Remembering hurts, wishing for things to go back hurts, I don’t really wanna hurt anymore… no one to talk to, no one who cares to listen, funny thing: my sister saw I was sad and after attempting to open up to someone she really cut me off multiple times just to literally use what I just told her to make fun of me. Ouch but what did I expect? Drop my guard for a sec and it immediately bites me in the back… crazy. This family is being torn apart from the inside slowly gutting itself. Think I’d rather be by myself… but the loneliness is enough to drive me to my breaking point. I really played myself with this one. Grunt life don’t sound too bad anymore, keeps me busy, gives me a purpose that will hopefully result in death, all in all a good trade. Useless, pointless life given a greater cause… could I be overreacting? What even is a proper response to all of this? My best guess to react is looking at other people in this situation…hmm… suicide don’t sound half bad. If it’s selfish to leave the ones that love you then why does it feel like I’m never loved until I’m gone… the ones to claim they love you are the first to leave you… leave you to fight this desperation alone… then the sadness kicks in, the feeling of emptiness and purposeless emotion that can all be ended in a instant. I want to say I’ve always had a positive outlook on life but sometimes it’s hard to keep my head held high when I put everything in my life into consideration. My dad who I loved unconditionally since childhood never really accepted me because he believed my mom cheated on him and I was never his son, this lead to me always being the odd one out in the family. Always getting beaten… bullied by my own father and I remained positive because my mo… my mom didn’t love me either… tough luck. She believed I was a mistake and that I should’ve died during childbirth. Funny enough they both set their differences aside just to harass me at a young age. It’s honestly crazy what hating a common enemy can due to reunite an unkindled flame. I like to think that I’m way past these experiences and have grown to forgive them but if that’s true then why does it still hurt? Another funny story: after my dad came home one night and finished beating the shit outta me because why not? I went to my room to cry and my sister who was sleeping got tired of my whining so she has the wonderful idea of shutting me up by suffocating me with a damn pillow… I don’t really think I have PTSD or depression but I still wake up sometimes with the feeling of being suffocated… is that normal? Maybe my idea of a loving family has been tainted by cartoons and fiction and that this is really what a family is… maybe this is how they express themselves and I’m the odd one. Idk… maybe a family like the ones on tv just isn’t meant for me. I’m tired of this empty feeling… I made plans to hang out with friends before I got back home. Everything seemed perfectly planned out but then I traveled 3000 miles just to be told they had other plans… slowly but surely all this planning went to waste… and tomorrow morning I’ll have to push through the day and pretend like everything is ok…again…and again… and again… but I’m never really ok… is that ok?",2022-03-18 10:21:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647597851,2,/r/lonely/comments/tgy65d/late_night_thoughts/,,0,2,Late night thoughts

3217,tgyy7y,Sevvv-_-,"I have a crush on a girl (thought i was over her). Long story short.. i saw her new post on instagram with her first boyfriend. They were kissing on a motorcycle. As soon as i saw that post i wanted to cry. It made me feel so bad about myself. The worst thing is im currently mentaly pretty unstable (due to stuff that happened in the last few years) and seeing that post about her destroyed me.

Just wanted to say this because its on my mind since i saw it.

I hate myself so much for beeing shy and introverted it makes me feel sick. How the hell should i get someone when im always so quiet.

The only ""good"" part is, (about my current state) ive started working on myself and im trying to get a better version of myself. 

Im constantly in a fear of never getting a girlfriend too. Yes, i know beeing too forward about this isnt going to get me anywhere. Im waiting for that one day but the point is not everyone in this life gets a partner. Always seeing posts like ""dont worry youll find someone one day"" isnt really helping.

Sorry if its bad written. English is not my first language. This post is a pretty big mess. Im not sure what my goal was with this i just wanted to write what was on my mind (because im obviously in a bad mood rn). 
I hope it was somewhat understandable what i was trying to say.

Thanks for the people reading this until the end. Have a nice day. :D &lt;3

I have some few friends, i would say like... three. But i love them! They're just like me, 19-20 years old, virgins, gamers and that stuff. And just recently, after we finished high school, we started hanging out. Just to be clear, it's been almost 2 years since it ended, and we've been hanging out for like... 5 months i believe? Or maybe 6... well, it's recent.

What i wanted to say is that we're not hanging out for like some weeks. I thought like:

""Okay, they have their lives and i have mine."" 

And i decided to hang out... alone. And it was cool, i bought a Coke, some snacks, grab a book and sitted in a bench on the park.   
At first i was scared because anxiety... and i'm still a bit ashamed... but i'm happy that i can have fun and enjoy even being alone. 

But there's a feeling, which i don't know how to explain, that bothers me a lot. I would say it's like... something's missing, you know? And i kinda know what it's missing, but i know it's complicated and it's not like:  

""Okay i'm feeling sad, i'll go to the shop and buy a girlfriend.""   
I don't exactly know what i can do, but i know that relationships don't start like this, at least not with me. 

I rarely talk to girls, but i know it's not hard. I don't want to talk to someone just because i want to feel less lonely, feels like i'm using someone else as a shield to something i can't face, and it will end with me and someone's else hurted. But at the same time, something's says i still need someone.

And i tried, i need to say. I never cared about social media or stuff like that, but i decided to maintain my Instagram at least. And of course, i tried to get some dates. A total failure.  
One of the girls that i tried to date ghosted me for like 2 weeks, and yesterday she sent me a pic with another guy.  
Another girl accepted, but ghosted me after accepting... which i don't really understand.

I'm not here to say ""Womans are monsters"" or complain about being rejected, i'm actually pretty much used to be rejected. So, if you're a woman, and you're reading it, i'm not here to spread hate to a gender.

I'm 21 now and i never managed to get a girlfriend in these past years. I know that being nice to someone isn't enough for them to like you, you obviously need some skill, personality, talent etc. Nobody will like you the way you want them to like you, just because you take care of them, you basically need more things above the baseline. 

Now, this little practice of mine which i mentioned in the first paragraph has now became a big problem for me. The fact is that i get ignored in group discussions various times, girls often say that I'm creepy and weird. I now basically started observing everyone around me. First it was just my classmates, but now everyone around me. I think that Because of so many failures and rejections my mind unconsciously started to show pity to people when they fail on something. I literally vowed myself I'll never ignore anyone who'll ask me for help. And because of this vow, whenever I see any beggar asking me for food i try to give them something and i genuinely feel good, and whenever for some reason I didn't help them, i get frustrated too much that many times i get headache because of this thinking they are like me, lonely.

Whenever my friends judge girls from a distance and say that she looks bad, i seriously feel bad for them. But recently i got tired of this, and cry because of this and say to myself that i shouldn't care about anyone who doesn't even look at me.. but it doesn't work.

Does anyone of think that being lonely makes us susceptible to think about other people. If it is, then is it a gift or a curse for people like us?

3261,th6nv8,ChanceAd6569,"It's always the people who have been married since they were 20 that tell you that you don't need a partner. These people will lie to you, and tell you that ""being single is better than being with the wrong person"". 

As a person who used to be married to the ""wrong"" person: Being in a shit marriage is better than being single, alone, and depressed.  

I have been depressed ALL of my life, and the ONLY time I was stable and happy enough to finally get off of anti-depressants was when I was married. 

The marriage was far from perfect, and it was clear by the 1-year mark we shouldn't have gotten married, but for most of it I was happy and so was he.  

Things that happen in even shitty marriages:  

- You always have someone to go on random adventures with. Once, I woke my ex up at 12AM to drive 2 hours to one of the best 24-hr donut shops in the country. Then, because we were both on a diet, we split one giant donut between the both of us, and watched netflix in the car before returning home. This was a Tuesday.    

- You gain valuable life skills. Your spouse goes to work or school at a specific time, comes home at a specific time, and that forces you to maintain some kind of order in your life. You are forced to organize, because you're balancing your schedule with theirs. This is a life skill that every depressed person needs, but it is hard to cultivate if you are completely alone in life. I also learned how to do laundry correctly, because while I never cared about fucking up my own clothes, I did care about his, and the result was me actually enjoying doing laundry and being privy to how to clean clothing correctly.  

- You have someone to back you up, at any time. There were so many instances where my exhusband would stand up for me if I was being mistreated. I used to be very sick, and he'd always have to advocate for me at hospitals and dr's offices. He wasn't always there for me emotionally, but if someone tried to harm me he would spring into action.  

- You make friends easier. As a woman, it's just easier to make friends if you're married. My circle of friends grew tenfold the moment I said ""I do"". Married women, and men, often have a bond that closer than singles because your life isn't shifting as much. Married people have set schedules, and meeting for brunch every second tuedsay is just harder to execute with single friends.   

There's more but I just wanted to vent about this. My marriage was terrible...but it was still better than being lonely, single, and depressed like ive been my entire life, because of the reasons above and more.",2022-03-18 17:08:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645151364,42,/r/lonely/comments/th6nv8/being_single_is_better_than_being_with_the_wrong/,,1,18,"""being single is better than being with the wrong person"" Bullshit."

3263,th7r64,autismopedia,"I am 19. It seems that it's common to not have formed meaningful relationships at this age. We change, not only because of the time that passes by, and it takes *a lot* of time to understand a single person and make a connection. That's a whole damn world within them to get to know.

But I want to start somewhere. It hurts that I can't even talk to my family. I live with only my sister, our parents live near too, but they have no idea who I am. I only answer yes or no questions and don't speak more. That's how I've always been. Lately, my need to socialise made me open up more. When I start sharing about myself or excessively talking about things I'm passionate about, I get punched in the face by their disinterest.

I have always been that weird, isolated kid that everyone knew something was wrong with and stayed away from or bullied and assaulted.

(TW - sexual abuse)
I was brutally raped and abused since I was 4 until I was 13. It happened several hundreds of times. Dealing with that, developing depression and being autistic turned me into a person that simply nods her head and runs away from any conversation that seem more complicated than that. But I have a lot to say. And I have a lot of love and warmth inside of me that I want to share.

Even trying to meet online friends is too difficult and overwhelming. After only a few messages exchanged, my mind goes into ""RUN!!!!"" mode. I can't continue and it makes me physically unwell how difficult socialising is. Especially when I am filled with fear from unhealed trauma and anxiety from inexperience. I almost never talked to people. I almost never had full conversations. Don't get me wrong, I embrace my autism and love many things about it, but it sure makes it way more confusing and complicated.

Being around people terrifies me, but I want to have at least one person I am close with. I want to have someone tell me about their day or something they're interested in. I just want to sit relaxed, with no tension in my mind and body that's always present, look at them and admire how beautiful one's mind can be. I love people. But it's so damn difficult, and I can't help but feel frustrated and helpless.

TL;DR: I am unable to socialise and I can't talk to people as it's confusing and overwhelming, but have the need to do so. That's literally it, lol.",2022-03-18 17:28:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647526135,9,/r/lonely/comments/th7r64/my_autism_cptsd_and_lack_of_experience_in/,,0,5,"My autism, C-PTSD and lack of experience in interacting with people make it nearly impossible to hold a conversation.

Having fun, having drinks, playing with colors with their friends but I was at home. I did not get a pinch of color applied to my face. I spent the whole day scrolling through IG and seeing how people had fun and then ultimately breaking down in the evening.
I don't have any friends to celebrate with. I've been single from past 4 years and since breakup I've lost the ability to form emotional connections.
I'm a natural extrovert but pandemic has turned me into a reserved introvert. I used to have friends but since I have strict rules and won't let anyone be unfaithful and disrespectful to me, I drew the boundary and removed them from my life. It feels like a bad decision whenever I feel low.
I've tried to build my socialization skills by talking to people but the moment I feel they aren't interested, I take a step back because I don't wanna come off as clingy.
Maybe I think I should uninstall IG to fix this issue. That way I'll feel less lonely.

3284,theckh,True_Raccoon1403,"I’m 24, I work full time and live with my boyfriend and cat in a rental apartment. My cat is my best friend. I have basically 2 or 3 friends that I don’t see or talk to regularly.

I have had the shittiest week when it comes down to feeling alone. Because covid is getting better, my work wants us to come to the office more often. I went twice this week and it was awful. I don’t have any work friends even though there are 750 people at my office. There were only a two people from my team each day and on day 1, one of them went out for lunch with another team and I wasn’t aware that the other one was at the office. I was basically panicking about having lunch alone. 

The other day, they were organizing a fun-after-work activity for my department. They were making an email to everyone about it and asked if the text was inviting enough. Next thing, I could hear them say that they just sent it to everyone. I looked at my e-mail, but I didn’t receive it. At the end of the day I was asked if I was joining and I said that I didn’t get the e-mail. They forgot to add me to the list (and also like 3 other people of my department of 40 people). I don’t know what’s worse: not being invited or forgotten. I did sign up for it but honestly I don’t really want to go but feel pushed to ‘put myself out there’. 

Next thing some people were having drinks after work. They were just leaving and yelled at my team mate to join them. I was ignored. My team mate asked me to join, but I felt like a burden and said no. 

I also had a meeting at work with someone who I only had seen online. It’s always different seeing people for the first time in real life, so I walked to her floor and looked around. I saw someone who looked like her, but I was ‘t sure so I kept walking across her floor and at the end I turned around and walked back towards the girl I first saw. She had stood up from her desk and walked in my direction. I walked towards her. When we were getting closer I gave a slight wave but she just walked past me. She didn’t even look at me. She joined a group of her colleagues and I was too afraid to walk up to her. I lingered at the floor, waiting for her to go back to her desk but she didn’t. Eventually I just walked back to my floor. She later messaged me that she totally lost track of time. I felt awful once again.

Then Friday, today, I could work from home. I had done a lot of work at the office and was basically done so I worked a few hours in the morning and watched Disney movies for the rest of the day. I cooked a meal for my boyfriend and I and we ate while watching tv. My boyfriend almost always goes to friends in the evening. He knows it bothers me that we almost never spend evenings together and that he only comes home for dinner or to sleep. Being lonely is something embarrassing to me and I don’t talk to him about it. I had the worst week ever so I wasn’t feeling my best anyways, on top of that I was bored out of my mind because I watched movies all day. I wanted to have a good night together. He’s tight on money so we couldn’t really go anywhere or I had to pay for us both and didn’t feel like doing that. I know he’s planning on leaving that night when he starts offering me tea after dinner. And today he did that as well. I went to bed early, he knew I wasn’t feeling good. We had a short conversation in the bedroom about how I didn’t plan anything so he would just go. It feels like forcing him to stay with me if I say no. I don’t want to force him or anybody to be with me. I already felt disgusting today, I felt fat and unattractive, alone, lonely and bored. And when I heard his car leaving I just cried. 

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my own company and my favorite hobbies I can do by myself. But this silence is too much. I’m really trying at work, but it hurts so much.",2022-03-18 20:28:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612768733,14,/r/lonely/comments/theckh/another_friday_night_spent_alone/,,0,4,Another Friday night spent alone

3291,thevhm,[deleted],"I'm 30 years old. I've never been in a relationship. I've had sex twice in the past 9 years. I haven't kissed a girl for 18 months. In 2022 I've hung out with just one of my friends (once). I started a new job at the end of November, and I haven't had a hug with any of my colleagues (I met all my friends at my previous place of work, and we would hug every single day, but my hopes to continue that workplace closeness seem to have been misplaced). Speaking of work: I haven't spoken to a single person who isn't in a long-term relationship. I was supposed to go on a date tomorrow - the girl cancelled on my earlier today. A couple of weeks ago another girl cancelled on me at the last minute, and now they're ghosting me. I've lost track of how many girls have ghosted me over the past 5 years, but it's in the dozens. I've been on a 2nd date just once.

I have Asperger's (the formal diagnosis is ASD, but I absolutely hate that categorisation), which is a double whammy of shit. Firstly, I think it's a huge contributing factor to why my love/sex life is so non-existent. Second, it makes the loneliness even harder to deal with, because I crave physical touch and deep human connections.

I just finished a second stint of CBT, and it did absolutely nothing for me. In fact, I don't think we even addressed any of the issues I wanted to address. The only positive is that I have a GP appointment on Monday, although I'm worried they're going to palm me off and not prescribe anti-depressants or recommend me for counselling.

I guess I'm posting here as I just wanted to get all of this off my chest, and I don't want to be a burden on my friends, but I hate myself for being a whining piece of shit.",2022-03-18 20:52:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/thevhm/never_felt_so_lonely/,,0,3,Never Felt So Lonely

I figure I just stay home alone and play music or work on art , and I’m not getting out on dates so I might as well have fun and be drunk.

However , I’ve been noticing I just crave it all the time now.

At work, there’s a woman (22F) who also drinks and we go to the back and sneak drinks. I feel I kinda do it to have some connection, and sometimes she gets a bit close , but I feel we are encouraging eachothers bad habits.

Having said that, it's been a huge issue for me. I just can't see myself living like this any longer. You either accept this role where you become numb to watching everyone live their lives and move on without you in it or it just becomes something that makes clinical depression and loneliness 100x harder to deal with.

I lost both of my best friends today.
One of them got triggered because I brushed against them (they don't have a touch phobia I am aware of) and they got really upset and of course, I apologized because I felt bad. They went on to ignore me for the rest of the day untill finally they texted me saying they needed space.
I'm totally fine with someone needing space and I totally respect it. The only problem with this is however that the last two friends they told they needed space to, we're ignored for years and my ex friend kinda ruined their lives by whiplashing them back and forth with texts and canceled invites. So I'm assuming this means I no longer have this person as a friend.

The other person talked shit about me to someone else and I overheard. It wasn't mistakes le because there is only one person with my full name and that is me. They talked shit for about an hour and I just sat there listening. This person is a pathological liar and so I don't really trust them/want to be around them anymore

My parents don't know that I still struggle with it and think that my SH story is over, also they tend to prioritize my sibling's mental health than mine. I feel desperate.

She said she really liked spending time with me. I really liked her a whole lot and only liked her more and more. I never got the courage to kiss her, just a few hugs. She invited me to the beach at night to just sit and I almost fell in love. I thought she was perfect for me. Right after what I thought was a super romantic date she started blowing me off and saying she would *definitely* let me know the first chance she gets to hang out again. She never did though and is instead dating someone else. I was basically fully used to being completely alone until she gave me some hope of being in a relationship, but she just ripped it away and strung me along. I really though I finally found a girl that actually cared about me but nope. I'm 27 and feel so ashamed and pathetic. I can't figure out what's wrong with me.

3335,thkqa0,Moist-Cut3459,"Okay so this is basically just a random 18 yr old girl ranting (Tw: I talk about depression, BPD, antidepressants and suicide): 

Backstory: All my life I really loved people I always wanted to give everyone everything. I just loved being surrounded by people.

 I had a group of friends we were 7 girls. We met when we were in grade 9. 

When I was in tenth grade, a problem happened with my group of friends and I ended up losing my circle of friends. Which really affected my mental health (that was already bad btw) even more and I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with Borderline personality disorder (bpd) and gave me some antidepressants. 

 Then covid happened and I just ended up depressed even more and socially awkward. 

 I ended up not getting my refills during covid cuz my mom was scared of going to the hospital (covid was still a big deal) and she didn’t think it was that big of a deal and assumed im fine, well spoilers alert stoping antidepressants out of no where fucks the shit out of you.

 I lost a big part of myself. If I could go back and not take them, I would.

I lost it. I acted on impulse and my bpd got so freaking worse and I just became so vulnerable, hurt and my self esteem hit the floor. I was suicidal and tried suicide 8 times yet im literally still here. 

 I met a group of friends online through a female relative of mine, and we would be on call 24/7. It was me, her, 2 of her other female friends along with 2 other guys. 

Me and one of the guys, lets call him A, actually because close friends. 

The other guy, lets call him B, was good looking but so freaking toxic. We started sexting and because I was so vulnerable I actually never said no to him. I created such a huge emotional bond to him and until now even through all the shit he put me through ( which btw was a lot im not exaggerating) im still attached to him and would literally crave his attention and i’d do anything for it. 

I tried therapy and literally nothing helps. I lost contact with him for like a year but we ended up connecting again early 2022 and even though he changed as a person I still am very very attached to him. He actually admitted that he was tempted to manipulate me but he felt sorry for me cuz of how vulnerable I was and he knew I couldn’t take it.

We never were a thing and I dont wanna be a thing but I really dont know why im this attached. 

Anyways, I try to not do as much and move on, I like to think I did improve.

Now, about 3 years later and after reconnecting with my old friends and moving on from our issues, I still feel lonely af. Our relationship isn’t the same and I just feel like an outcast. 

 I just want to have this one person who would be awake at 3am and we’d talk about life and stuff. Meaningful stuff that actually makes you feel connected to that person. Imma huge sucker for deep convos and I’d do anything for them. 

anyways its 4:36 am rn and im not sleepy but I hopefully will be, so yeah, thanks for reading &lt;3",2022-03-19 01:45:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643980695,2,/r/lonely/comments/thkqa0/my_loneliness/,,0,2,My loneliness
3336,thkrq2,Separate-Kick,"I just feel as though the last 10 years of my life has been spent almost completely alone. I have social skills. I have really good friends. I work really hard and I know my value. that all almost makes it harder to be so alone all the time. I have never dated anybody. I fall asleep and wake up alone. I go to classes and I go to work alone. I eat my meals alone. I do my school work alone. I go for a run and I strength train alone. 

sometimes I make a plan and I schedule my whole week around it. Then the people that I planned it with cancel last minute. It’s not the end of the world and I don’t blame them, but to me that plan meant a lot. I don’t know what it is about me. I know that I prioritize skills and activities that require dedication and practice, hence a lot of my responsibilities need to be completed alone. but I know I am kind. I know I am easy to be around. Why is it so hard for me to spend actual time around people?

I came upon a post about how some of us including me easily catch feelings due to like wanting to fill in the void of being lonely and such because i have felt the same way. I have noticed that some people say that if a girl or a guy take interest into you and talk then that's what the crush develops. However, I feel like that's exactly what a crush should be like, no? Someone that seems to have interest in you and that you have gained interest in. Like a crush isn't something where both parties are 100% into each other. You still need to find more out about each other and that's what dating is for.

3366,thoiy7,ThrowingAwayTheMovie,"Hey Lonely,

I used a throwaway account because I do not want these feelings to be associated with my person. It is something I feel inadequate about.

My life story, I think, is a little on the unique part. I've been born and raised in a middle eastern country to a middle class family. I was bullied growing up, and had mostly made friends with other outcasts. I was, and has always been, a massive nerd. I did not take care of my appearance or health. After I finished uni, I decided to change, and so I did. I lost a lot of weight, got fit, started taking dancing lessons, going out, expanding my friend group and so on. I dated, had flings, etc.

But throughout that, I felt there was something missing. Like there is this promised or desired life that I wanted, that was just beyond my reach. I went through a lot of growth during that time. I made mistakes, learned from them, and realized that I didn't want to live in the middle east anymore.

I moved to Europe in my late 20s, where I became depressed for about a year into my studies there. I eventually got my shit together due to help from friends I made there. I had a few hookups there but nothing serious. After a few years, I immigrated to Canada.

I was broke with degree and work experience that was worthless there. So I struggled, working min-wage and retraining on the side. Now, I am 33, with a new career with a lot of promise. I'm settled, I've made it.

And throughout this? I've managed to maintain my growth as a person. I'm really proud of myself. I can tell my kids (if I ever have any) that I came to this country with $200 to my name and a dream.

But here is the thing, I'm afraid this day, will never come.

I have friends all over the world. Dear friends, close friends. Friends who would cross the ocean for me. I'm intelligent, driven, with various interests. I take care of my body and my mind. I'm multilingual, and can hold myself in many situations.

Then, why do I struggle so much with romance?

Why do I now feel awkward and fearful? When I wasn't before? Why do I lack the confidence? And even when I shoot my shot? Why am I missing a lot?

I don't know. Maybe I'm not sexual enough? Maybe I'm gunning too high?

I wish there was a guide for this part of life.

The part that is really getting to me now is my age. I'm 33, not young, not old. I can handle making mistakes when I'm young. But now, I fear that a day will come when I will not have any more chances. I'll be ""left over"". Too old to be desirable. This is probably irrational, but I can't help but feel it.

But I always tend to come back to the idea that I think I check all the boxes that society told me to check, yet I'm not getting my dues. What a toxic way to think, but can we really deny that the world doesn't tell us just that? Take care of yourself, be interesting, etc. You'll get it. I \*Like\* myself as a person. I'm proud of myself! I'm done with that cliche piece of advice. What's next?

Of course, my rational mind knows the solution: I need to get myself out there. But many of us would probably relate to the fact that that is easier said than done. Between work and gym, there is limited time to socialize per week.

Sorry if this took long. There is much on my mind that I wanted to get off.

I guess, I'd like to hear from others who are in a good position in their life, yet are still feeling romantically unfulfilled. What's your experience like? What have you found that can help? Anyone has any advice?",2022-03-19 05:33:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647666760,8,/r/lonely/comments/thoiy7/i_33m_am_moderately_attractive_successful_and/,,0,0,"I (33m) am moderately attractive, successful, and interesting.

Still no progress, same thing as always when i try. Talked with one girl i was chatting with for about a month and tried asking her out to either dinner or to hangout. She said she was down and said next monday and fortunately i was off that day. I message her telling her i was ready and that we can meet up soon. She ghosts me the entire day and says late at night that she got a better date after she got off work, then never texted me again. That shit really threw me out of my chair and i just felt helpless and defeated. When can i just have someone who won't ditch me when a date is scheduled?

3375,thp7b7,TNow_25,"My girlfriend has been cheating on me a few times the last few months. She broke up with me 3 days ago saying she needed space and that she and I needed to focus on ourselves. She's my entire world and I can't live without her. She makes me the happiest I've ever been. Yes it's wrong to have her as my only source of happiness but I just wanted to make things right with her and to help her in her struggles and for her to help me in my struggles. I helped her out of an extremely abusive relationship and we'd been together 1 year 6 months and 5 days with a month of speaking before that. I don't know what to do. I've been to a therapy session and have had the police called on me multiple times because I would be crying in my uni accommodation saying I wanted to kill myself and throwing objects around. I haven't self harmed because I'm too afraid of pain and haven't killed myself even though I have stood on a bridge once, again because I'm too afraid of pain. I have thoughts of killing myself every day almost constantly and have thoughts of injuring myself less so but still at least a few times a day. I don't know what to do and I've written so many paragraphs to put on here but posted none because of fears nobody will care so what's the point in even posting. I've forced myself to post this one. 
I have no friends and my girlfriend was my best friend in the whole world who I could be around for hours upon hours and not get bored or tired or anything. I would happily do things for her like get her snacks and drinks and the likes. I just don't know what to do and all I can do is be angry and want to kill myself and just keep thinking I've lost my best friend and soulmate. 
All I wanted was to make her happy and for her to help me and me to help her and all she wants is time away from me. I want her so badly I just can't deal without her. I don't know what to do nothing is helping I have no hobbies or friends and being on the phone to mental health teams and saying the same shit every time with nothing happening other than ""well if you feel like this again call us before it gets worse"". My mum doesn't care she's ""giving me space"" to cry and get over it but I'm never going to get over it I want to die all the time so badly just to not exist or think and everything will be over and I won't bother my girlfriend anymore.

3377,thpjj3,Clol1l1l1,"So I watched ""The Edge of Seventeen"" for the third time. I've always related to Nadine but the third time I watched it I realized how this is a problem. So I heard a lot of people say they hated Nadine's character because she thought she was the only one with problems and that she was annoying. I feel like this is how people see me. The way Nadine sees herself is also the way I see myself. Nadine says in the movie how she feels unlucky and how she hates how she talks and acts. I feel the same way most of the time. I just feel like everything about myself is repulsive and annoying. I don't think anyone actually wants to be near me. I feel like all my past friends hung out with me out of pity or to use me. I don't have friends irl and I don't always get along with my family. I just feel so alone sometimes and like I'm stuck in the same place. I spend every day in my room doing pretty much nothing. I don't do good in school. Time feels so still. It feels like I'll be in my room for long and I'm just going to spend the rest of my life there. I'll get this feeling that nothing exists outside of room and the night will never end. I just keep on going and I don't give much thought into anything I do.

Like it’s just depressing seeing all the happy couples and friend groups having a grand ole time 

Then like I’m just kinda sitting in the food court and watching and sighing.

Like it just makes me feel really envious and really intensely amplified the feelings of loneliness and it gave that nasty voice in my head more fuel.


My birthday was ok 

Umm well to start with my divorced parents got into a fight so that was fun.

Luckily it wasn’t like drawn out or too bad it was more of my dad pissed off my mom (either purposely or accidentally) and then my mom berating his phone then he pretty much ignored her so she was in a pissy mood for couple of hours.

But out of the darkness comes light as me the fresh 19 year old and my mom and sister played Mario kart and jeopardy for a few hours.


Then came the highlight of the Day I went to go see The Batman .


So before  I gush about the Batman there are NO spoilers and let me give you a lil insight on how I see myself 

I wouldn’t consider myself a comic book fan in the same vain as I wouldn’t consider myself an Anime Fan.

I like specific characters and Shows. And those are the ones I follow.

So like the comic book characters I love and I follow (some more than others) are 

Batman 

Spider-Man

The Question 

Deadpool

And 

Hell boy.


And for anime the shows I love are 


Lupin the Third 

Pokémon 

Digi mon 

Fairy Tail

Dragon Ball 

and 

Black Butler


So I wouldn’t consider myself a fan of either medium but I love specific series from these mediums.


So my point for that lil thing is that my knowledge of Batman stems from only the Story Lines I’ve read, the games I’ve played, the movies and shows I’ve watched and the lil factoids I know.


So time to Gush about The Batman!


Personally I found the best part for me of the Batman was The Riddler as a villain 

In all the incarnations of the riddler I’ve seen he’s never seemed to really be out to kill somebody more than he is just more so out to have his ego scratched wanting to show how smart he is to Gotham and proving he is smarter than the worlds greatest detective 

I love how in this movie they turned him into this deranged serial killer who thinks he is this Martyr.

The Character is portrayed with just so much realism from his costume, to how plans and speaks and spreads his message and goals.

It gives me hope that Matt Reeves if he gets the green light to make another Batman Film what other villains he and the writers would be able to give this treatment to.

Like I love Murphy’s portrayal of The Scare Crow but it doesn’t ever feel like truely scare crow to me, I’d love to see a new scarecrow with bigger plans a badass costume his goals and actions giving the Audience a sense of Moral Ambiguity. They could even bring back Murphy for the role. Maybe Mr Freeze or Hush as a secondary villain.


Also a 3hr film length I was a lil worried about but for the information and the scope the movie covers it’s a required amount of time and honestly I didn’t feel like a 3 hr movies there is barely a dull moment.

Also I really liked this version of The Penguin I’m very used to either Danny Devito or a Cockney English guy.



But after the movie I visited my dad we chatted he gave me a card we watched tv for a bit unfortunately he wasn’t feeling well so he couldn’t be in person for the cake ceremony 


Then I got home had some pizza for dinner had some really good cake

Then I ordered my sister her birthday gift cause her birthday is in a few days 

Then I went to bed went through another day and here I am.

3392,thro2f,CookiesatClarks,"I can't take this anymore. It is literally, LITERALLY mathematically impossible for it to be this hard to form a stable group of likeminded individuals in our lives. 9 billion humans on the planet, with 65.6% of them having a direct capability of connecting to each other via internet. Studies show 33% of adults world wide are lonely. So not taking into account any extenuating circumstances that is around 33% of immediately reachable humans are lonely. That is around 2 billion 97 million. Yet I'm supposed to believe that there are virtually zero websites to meet people for platonic relations in my area? Like seriously, Tinder has over 75 million monthly users and 65 BILLION matches. I understand sex is a human need, but so is platonic socializing! Think about it. it is a capitalistically implausibility, not a single successful friend site? 75 million users monthly for a hook up site and I cant find 1 single person to show up for my event on meetup.com, only 4 user in my entire state on FriendMatch. I google 'make friends on Tinder' and the first result is people bitching about the concept. 75 million people want to hookup or date and 0 of them want friendship? I refuse to believe this, because it is impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to live like this, I've tried just about everything to find someone, anyone, who I can connect with. The only people in my life who even vaguely understand my passions are the teachers and therapists who I have payed to be there. There has to be some way to for lonely people with similar interests to meet. There are 271k 'Lonely Hearts' on this sub reddit, but this is merely a conjugation. There must to be way of uniting these 271k, these 33%, making some kind of app or site, not based around sex or romance or any other intricacies of modern society, where one can connect with their fellow man, simply because they need platonic human understanding. I want it, and if you are lonely enough to be on the r/lonely subreddit, than you likely do to.

After I became 21 years old, I basically had 0 friends.  And my last friendship with 2 males was that they used for money to buy weed, so I broke it. I  didn't smoke weed or drank for the last 5+ years.

During my life when I was younger I had friends, but when I was 13 years old I kinda of stopped growing so to speak. I am 170cm (5''6') and non athletic. I am not fat  at all and I have rather prettier face. Girls complemented me during my teen years telling me I was pretty and gave me *the look* some times. But I was bullied at school in front of them, so I couldn't really ask any of them out.

Every time I try to form a relationship with a man at least (I am not gay) It always feels like, they don't want to be seen with someone as small me.

3428,thy4gl,BrokenWayne,"Loneliness is like quicksand. The more Lonelier you feel, The more desparate you get. It's a vicious cycle. It's very difficult to get out of this.

People sense this desparation, especially women. Women hate desperate men.

Lonliness is like an endless pit. It's easy to succumb and really really difficult to get out. The more you struggle, the more you succumb.

Loneliness can be conquered, it's the state of mind you need to work on. Work in silence. Work on your personality, your financial situation, your body, your health. At the end of the day, these are the things that matter.

Only thing you need to keep in mind is:

                              DO NOT GIVE UP

Fight for where you belong, where you deserve to be. Never ever feel weak or be overwhelmed by the situation.

                          YOU ARE NOT WEAK

People are fickle, at the end of the day everyone's alone. But it's the mindset that defines you.

3429,thyc3s,JACCO2008,"TLDR- I got rejected by a girl I liked and it made me realize how genuinely alone I am in life because I have no one to talk to about it. 

About a month ago I got an ""it's not you, it's me"" text from a girl I really liked. This isnt a horribly uncommon experience except in this instance. I was really into her before even going out. She said on our date that she wanted to go on a second one and that she liked my ""energy"". She was slow but reciprocal on texts, and seemed engaged. Everything was looking up as far as I could tell and I thought maybe I might have found someone who was actually interested in me for once. 

Anyway, I got that text at 6AM when I was on my way to work and it killed my day. I replied back to her just saying I was sorry to hear that, but I understand, I hope she can find what she's looking for, reach out in the future if she wants to try again, etc and I figured that was that. The weird part was that she texted me back like 12 hours later saying thanks for understanding, she will reach back out when she's ready, thinks I am a great person, etc. I wasn't expecting or hoping for a reply. I mainly said that as a parting pleasantry so that just made it all worse because even though I don't expect her to, it gave me a tiny unrealistic glimmer of hope for the future and that hurts a lot. It hurts so much that it's been bothering me for a month.

Now, all that said, the reason I'm putting this in lonely vs dating is because I've never felt more alone. I've always been something of a loner and haven't really ever been popular enough for people to reach out to me first, but I never realized how truly alone I really am until this. This rejection hurt me really bad for some reason, way more than the others over the years, and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

I can't talk to my friends about it (they know the girl and interact with her occasionally) because I don't want them to feel like I am complaining and feeling sorry for myself and just say ""oh great, this again"". 

I can't talk to my family because they get all weird about my dating life and make it hard to be honest with them. 

I can't talk to my coworkers because I have a very professional and stoic reputation that I don't want to ruin. 

I can't talk to a significant other because, well, it's been 5 years since I've had one. 

The only person I can really talk to is my therapist, but she's $100 a session which means I only see her every 3-4 weeks for 50 minutes, so I don't really count her. 

So here I am. Hurting very badly emotionally over something stupid and illogical that really shouldn't be hurting me, and I have no one to talk to or help me work through it. 

I feel like my life is sort of a ""food desert"" where there is plenty to eat, but none of it is nutritious. Even though I have people around me, I'm still very much alone.",2022-03-19 16:03:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1446695024,2,/r/lonely/comments/thyc3s/i_am_hurting_and_i_have_no_one_to_talk_to/,,0,5,"I am hurting, and I have no one to talk to"

But last weekend I went to a friends party and out of nowhere hooked up with a girl I know and ever since I haven’t been myself I’ve noticed just how lonely and empty I feel I haven’t had this feeling in years and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel like going to work, playing video games or even getting out of bed. I’ve had depression in the past but got better after 4 years. 

After that weekend I did try to do things to get my spirits up and just feel better, I even quit smoking and have been going well with that but even then nothing I did seemed to help.

I just hate this empty feeling I can’t sleep anymore and find myself overthinking things like if I’ll ever not feel alone again. I went out tonight and mentioned this to my best friend and he just laughed it off saying that’s “rough” and that’s just made me feel even worse.

3465,ti2gme,throw-away-518,"Hi all! Venting here, as I feel alone with my thoughts and was just wondering if anyone else can relate.

Does it bother anyone else when someone who's a lot more social than you complains to you that THEY have ""no friends""?

I feel that it's VERY insensitive when someone does this. I don't have that many friends, but I'd never go around telling people that I have ""no friends"", because that would be VERY insensitive to people who actually have zero friends. I'm fully aware that many people in this subreddit have it far worse than I do. I sympathize with you all, and please know you're not alone.

In my life, the only people I can comfortably text right now are: Parents, brother, boyfriend, boyfriend's mom, one cousin, three friends, one acquaintance. I'm FULLY aware that many people have it way worse than I do, and I'm so sorry if any of this is triggering.

Two of these friends are childhood friends who are away at college, who I text rarely and see once every 2-3 months or so. The other friend lives a few minutes from me and I see her about 1-3 times a month. I also have one work acquaintance who I sometimes talk with on snapchat, but that's it. There's nobody else besides family who I regularly communicate with. I'm not in any group chats, and can easily go several days to a week without messaging a single person besides my parents/brother and boyfriend.

Any other friend/acquaintance I had in the past, I've completely lost touch with. I simply don't have the social skills and capability to keep in touch with people beyond the situation I met them in. This is meaning that if I met someone in a class, I'd permanently lose touch with them pretty soon after the class ends.

An example of this: In the past, I had a friend who I was on a sports team with in high school. We're neighbors, and used to meet up to go for walks outside of practice. We both initiated these walks equally. After the season ended, it very quickly turned into just me initiating them, and it slowly fizzled out completely. The ""friendship"" is now limited to just waving to each other as we pass by in the neighborhood, that's literally it. I was on this sports team for four years, and nowadays I don't talk to a SINGLE person I was a part of the team with.

I can't even comprehend how people can keep in touch with friends several months to several years after the fact, I just can't do it. It always becomes one sided with me literally keeping the friendship alive on life support, then it inevitably fizzles out, EVERY single time. I simply don't have the capability of keeping in touch with people. I'm not nearly likable or social enough.

The main reason I'm making this post is because of my boyfriend. He always tells me that he ""doesn't have many friends"" and is ""socially awkward"". That is the complete OPPOSITE of the truth. I get triggered when he says this, it feels very insensitive to me. He hangs out with these two guys about 5x a week, and has SEVERAL other close friends and acquaintances who he sees less frequently. I estimate that he has about 30-40 friends/acquaintances that he can comfortably text at any time, and about 10-15 people he can comfortably ask to hang out with one on one with.

He can literally go two years without speaking to and old friend, then talk to them again like no time has passed at all. If I went two years without contacting someone then reached out to them again, they'd very likely respond with something along the lines of ""who the f\*ck are you"". My boyfriend is just a lot more likable than I am, he's very charming and people simply want to be in his company.

He even has female friends who he hangs out and zoom calls one on one with, and tells them about his relationship with me. I've NEVER has opposite gender friends, and don't ever see it happening. He always tells me that he has ""only two friends"", when in reality he has several more. He says he only has two because these are the guys he sees several times a week. All of his other friends he sees a lot less frequently, I'm guessing about 3-5x a year. He's seriously such a social butterfly, and I get extremely frustrated when he complains to me about having ""not many friends"". I wouldn't be as bothered if he simply admitted that he's a very social guy.

I'm not even fully sure of the purpose of this post, I just feel really alone in all of this and I'm curious if anyone else can relate to any of it.

I am guessing it is because of low self-esteem and not having a SO but, based from what ive learned, most of my mental health issues come from a significant lack of any kind of love/affection in my life. So i am currently trying to get a SO but i am not attractive...

The thing is, i mostly have female friends and they all agree im an 8/10 and that i would be an awesome bf because of my very caring nature, my jokes, personnality, etc.

So im just lost, if my friends (which are all pretty different and all have different tastes in guys) think i look good, then why am i not attractive to anyone else ?

I've been on dating apps for a couple of months now and well...its not working lmao i keep getting short, cold responses or they just ghost me :/

Now i've been thinking of going out in bars but i've never been interested in those sorts of things and i dont know what to expect inside of bars...

Maybe my anxiety is just being a bitch and im just not seeing the signs that other people think im attractive...

3472,ti34r2,BTNboy2090,"(M/27) I today realised that I am lonely even having family and friends I still feel alone.
 I would say I’m generally a good person, I’m kind empathetic and will always accept people for who they are but i feel in this world it’s not reciprocated.
I’ve had a hard 3 years with me caring for my Nan who has dementia and my mum suffering from COPD and being in and out of hospital, these two women raised me and now I feel like I’m loosing them, maybe even lost them already. On top of this o my ex left me over a year ago and I still have strong feelings for her but she has blocked me on everything which makes me realise that she thinks I’m the problem or she has peace when I’m not around.
For some background info we were together for 6 years and she was with me through everything but the last two years I became more dependent on smoking weed to bury my problems. My mental health was non existent and I made mistakes, but now I’m a different person as I’ve been through therapy and still continue to have sessions weekly, I haven’t smoked weed for a year and a bit, before this I had smoked solidly for 10 years.
Every time I think about her I blame myself for loosing her…

I’m glad there is a community I can voice my concerns on as I know I’m not completely alone.

3475,ti3mxn,Dramatic_Mulberry157,"**TLDR: I send people my picture and get blocked or ghosted immediately after and its starting to really hurt.**

It's not like I had very much self esteem to begin with. I've struggled with that all my life. But i've been trying the online dating route to meet women (or men, really) since its harder for me to go places like bars and clubs where ppl normally meet (i have a significant mobility impairment). I'll start talking with someone, the conversation will click pretty well, then they ask the dreaded question: let's exchange pics. Well, at that point i figure ""i might as well try"" even though i have a pretty good idea of the outcome after so many tries:

They block me. Or just stop talking to me. Every time.

Every. Fucking. Time.

I would kill to hear a ""oh you're cute"" or even ""you're handsome"" (which feels more like something a mom would say then a romantic interest) but nope. Only a deafening, agonizing silence.

As for the sites/apps where your pic is the first thing they see, i never get any matches or likes or messages to begin with and all mine go unanswered.

In the case of me sending the pics upon their request, it clearly isn't a personality issue, since we'll have been talking quite well up to that point. It's all the face.

Are so many people really that shallow? If so, what hope is there for a hideous beast clearly barely resembling a human, like me? Or am I just objectively unattractive and unappealing to anyone? I want to keep trying because that's just my natural spirit and attitude about challenges, but this is really starting to hurt. Its almost a tangible physical sensation now, the rejections. I find myself feeling worse about myself with each failed attempt. And of course, when your confidence is gone you're even LESS appealing to anyone, especially women. So I'm just digging myself a hole by trying this method but idk what else to do to try and rectify my loneliness and isolated feeling. In person isn't much better, since i have visibly low confidence, am apparently quite unattractive, and disabled (yes i feel like that makes a difference to people. in fact i know it does, from experience).

Fuck me, I don't even have any platonic friends. I have three people who would say they are, but we never hardly talk let alone go do stuff, so its like they arent even in my life anyway.

How does a person deal with this? It makes me so sad, and i don't want to get into the self-pity mindset since that's also toxic, but i feel like im getting there whether i want to or not.

3490,ti6h0p,kimberleyonreddit,"I’m 25F. No family. No close friends. No partner. I live alone in the city.

I grew up in a house without affection, was abused from the age of 6 for 5 years daily. I’ve never heard a parent tell me they loved me.

I started having boyfriends at the age of 13 because I craved affection and attention. I would become obsessed with them, I’d be treated badly and just accept it so I didn’t lose them.

From the age of 19-22 I was in abusive relationship with a guy who hit me, blackmailed me, humiliated me, cheated on me. Eventually he left me for another women, he’s still with her now. I became homeless and had to live in a shelter.

Every single relationship I have, friendship or intimate, I destroy it. I love so deeply. So fucking deeply. I just want to be held. I want to be cared for. I want somebody to ask me how my day was and stroke my hair. Whenever I meet a guy who would do that, I’m repulsed. I have to leave immediately. 

If I’m with a guy who barely cares, sees other girls, puts me down. Then I cling to him and become jealous, obsessive and paranoid. 

It feels like I’m going to be on my own for the rest of my life. I know I’m still young but these cycles of behaviours never seem to change. I’ve been in therapy for years, tried different types of therapy. Nothing seems to change me.

She also seems to be hiding things from me on social media about her personal life (like instagram and discord). I really dk whats going on with her but whenever we talk nowadays, its just her making random jokes about me (which are pretty lame ngl) and its just so strange to see her acting like this cus she wasnt like this 2 weeks ago.

Our friendship has lots of ups and downs and something major happened to me back in November which got me super depressed but she apologised to me and we were actually doing really great till 2 weeks ago and noe im just so fucking confused. 

Maybe she found friends who are better than me and thats why she's leaving me out. Or she's secretly talking to our current friends elsewhere without me taking part in.

Its just so shitty to feel like im not trustworthy and interesting enough for her anymore. And i guess its partly my fault cus i suck at socialising with people and i always feel awkward during conversations and then feeling so bad at myself that i have to leave social media for a few days.

3507,ti84vk,unknown_lady_1105,"I have been in student government since 7th grade. I'm not really the expected outspoken leader, I'm the type who gets the right job done. And this year I've realized that I've been using it to distract myself from loneliness. I'm an only child, and I've never been a part of any friend group. Most of the time I'm the plus one, or the person they call when there's an extra slot. I've always known that, but never really gave it much thought. I'm  an only child, and very used to being on my own.



This pandemic, I noticed myself getting lonely more often. I'd cry at random times, and stare at the darkness for hours. Sometimes I think, if I die right now, will any one of my 'friends' notice... then I remember, I don't really have any.


I'm always the last choice, the last one called, the forgettable one, the always there when you need her but we don't want her now. Lately I thought that maybe the reason why I stayed in student government for so long (this is my 6th year) is because I've got nothing else to do. And if I let go of this, I'm letting go of the work keeping me sane. Eventhough at times, this jop sucks the dear life out of me, I'm thankfull it somehow gave my high school life a purpose, cause God knows I wouldn't find that purpose with friends.



Edit: thank you to those wanting to chat and talk, but I really just wanted to let it all out. It is a comfort to know that mere strangers want to be there for you and comfort you at your lowest, so I am very very grateful and thankful. Hope you have a nice day.❤",2022-03-19 23:45:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638501779,2,/r/lonely/comments/ti84vk/an_unhealthy_way_of_coping_with_my_loneliness/,,0,2,an unhealthy way of coping with my loneliness
3508,ti88kh,Hello-Ad12537,"I (14) have no friends or hobbies so my time is spent at home all the time. My aunt and me only see each other a couple times a year but we are still pretty close. We’ve FaceTimed a lot within the past 2 years but I can tell she doesn’t want to speak to me anymore. 

I’ll admit I do call her nearly every night. But she’s unemployed anyway and doesn’t leave the house much either so it probably has something to do with me. I feel like my family hate being around me a lot of the time. When I’m downstairs I can feel the weird atmosphere like I should just leave them to hang out. And when they try to joke I sometimes take it personally so it’s awkward a lot the time when I talk to my family. 

It’s pretty depressing that even my family are tired of me. They have been for a while tbh. Now I’ll probably spend more time rotting in my room because they’ve made it clear they don’t want me near them anymore. They pretty much came to the conclusion that I’m autistic as well as my teacher and since then they’ve been acting weird around me. I’m not autistic I’m just an introvert but it makes no difference to them. Luckily for me they haven’t actually spoken to a professional about this and it’s just been swept away so they’ve forgotten about it. But now they think I’m autistic and act strange to me even though I’ve told my mum I’m just an introvert.

3519,ti9i2l,Flyaway_5,"Most people are happy go lucky and ""go with the flow."" But with me, I'm different. I have never been in relationship or been kissed, but I have been in love many times. And when l was in love, I felt those emotions so deeply and so much intensity, even though those people didn't know about it, I just created this imaginary relationship inside my head. 

If someone does something wrong to me that I didn't like, I hold grudges for a really long time, like for years, and I act like it's the end of the world. It's hard for me to move on. If I was friends with someone then they don't want to be friends anymore and stopped talking to me, I would still think about them and be saddened by it, like it's the end of the world. I let myself get down and miserable and upset over the most simple things that aren't even that important, things that most people wouldn't even give a second thought to and wouldn't be bothered by it.

I tend to get mentally stuck on minor things that have happened to me in the past and I think long and hard about them, and I romanticize it more than there actually is. People have been nice to me in the past, and I jumped into conclusions and thought they automatically were in love with me just because they were nice to me. Because of my own thinking, this turned into obsessions I have had about women old enough to be my grandmother, and I am a woman, too. I seem to be so bored by life and trouble being motivated by most things, so I've filled my life with these obsessions and amazing women to focus on. I don't want know what void this being in love/obsessions are filling. I tend to process feelings very deeply and I get so emotional over the most little things. 

I also remember things that most people don't. I've brought this up and they would say, ""I don't remember that at all.""

I sleep in the car now because it’s too cold to sleep on the porch. I have days where I feel semi-OK and I can be a mother  weeks where I isolate myself and barely speak to my kids.

3521,ti9u3o,cadille3,"Hello, I would first like to start by saying I am so glad there is a group of people on here that I can relate to. It really helps me through these hard times. I constantly feel like the one left out and the last choice. To give a preface I suffer from severe anxiety and any type of social situation can easily overstimulate and overwhelm me. I am also a freshman in college so the friends I hang out with are fairly new and I have not fully broken out of my shell (as someone who suffers from extreme anxiety, this is something very difficult for me.). Nevertheless, I still feel fairly close to these people and consider them close friends- I just haven't reached the point of full comfort. Okay now onto the way that I am feeling. So the group that I mainly hang out with is five people including me. They also love to party, get drunk, and dance. Another thing is that they are all part of a culture that I am not a part of so I can not relate to the things they relate to (I have no idea if that makes sense lol but I hope that is the right way to say it, I am not the best at writing). They also all speak a Spanish which I can not speak. I can handle these differences sometimes but it is hard to relate and to hang out with a group of people who enjoy the things that you enjoy the least the most. I do enjoy the partying some of the time. Many of the time I find myself leaving to go to a bedroom or to bee alone in there social situations because everyone divides into pairs. I leave and nobody notices. when we are dancing everyone is in pairs no matter what style of dancing it is (it doesn't help that I am a terrible dancer lolol). I usually am planning a way to leave the whole time and get so happy when I can just be alone without worrying about anyone leaving me out. Even in a group where there is inly four people including me, they gravitate into a group of three and speak Spanish. I know they are not talking bad about me or hate me, they just forget I'm there I guess lol. This is also not a situation where I invite myself, I am invited to these situations they just often don't pay much attention to me. I believe I am a part of this friendship group but am constantly asked ""are you coming"" to plans that were never communicated to me and often left out of the loop. its kind of sad because these people are really my only friends and I feel as if when they are in the group I might as well not be there. I feel as if I am invisible and when I talk no one hears. I feel as if I could ghost them and wouldn't hear from them for days. I always tell myself that this is in my head and I am isolating myself but when I am in the situation, it's fairly obvious that I just can not fully relate to these people. I wish I could more thoroughly explain the situation and emotions I am experiencing but I am terrible at communicating through writing and I feel it would turn into word salad if I tried to do that haha.",2022-03-20 01:15:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567261309,8,/r/lonely/comments/ti9u3o/always_feeling_like_the_last_choice/,,0,1,Always feeling like the last choice

3527,tian26,pockets2tight,"For me it was the weekend after the Fourth of July. One day I actually had a nice time with someone, the last time I was excited for something, the last time I didn’t dread the weekend. The last time I’d had a weekend with a healthy amount of socialization.

Since then, and prior to, the majority of weekends were spent in solitude. Unhealthy for the mind, I became increasingly incapable of escaping my solitude. Year after year I felt my brain rotting away due to the deprivation of such basic biological needs - communication, touch, hope. But it never came.

The times it did were simply a passing fog, once lifted, the reality of my life, and my future once again as glaring as ever. Week after week I’d hope to have plans, to escape the coffin of my residence. And week after week, I’d be disappointed. My mind became less human as time progressed and eventually the idea of having a normal life, those experiences became foreign to me, to the extent that they became unfathomable.

I’d pass people on the street, in the store, at work, genuinely confused how they were able to navigate their life to a place of general normalcy. No, their lives certainly were not perfect. But they were not rotting away each weekend, alienated, alone, bereft, and clueless as to how to function normally in society.

And here I am, over three decades into life, alone on a Saturday night because I was unable to grasp the innate intuitions of how to live. Sexless, no touch less, I have spoken 4 words to a human today. Medium iced caramel latte.

I love these people, I really, truly do. In fact, they mean the world to me. 

I just wish I was somebody’s favorite, whether that’s being a partner or just being someone’s best friend. The friend group I spend time with are all couples and I’m the only perpetually single one. In my two decades of being alive I’ve never been in a relationship and have had no *lifelong* friends, nor any best friends currently. 

These friends I have now have known each other for a long time and care deeply for one another and I can tell. They hype each other up; between every joke or tease, they genuinely compliment each other and tell each other “I love you”. I can tell they’re all each other’s favorites, where I doubt I would even be considered. 

I heard this all again, except not once was I “hyped up”. I spent more time observing than I did having conversations, but I was already in my own head at that point.

I just want a friend to hug me and tell me how much they care. I want to hold someone’s hand and comfort them. I want the love and care I have for others to be more reciprocal. 

I don’t blame them. I’m not angry. I’m just seeing that, even as my mental health waxes and wanes; even though I have my good days, I will likely feel even worse down the line if things don’t change or improve. I can’t see myself living best-friendless or partnerless into my 30’s or even 5 years from now.

They said it was my fault because I didn't say that I wanted to go, even though I didn't even know it was happening. This isn't the first time it's happened either. They've done this before and I've been stuck at home crying because I feel like they don't really want me around. A couple weeks ago I found out that they had an entirely separate groupchat without me and I basically had to beg to be added to it. These people have been my friends for years and I don't really know what to do. People, including family, always say ""Find new friends"" but I feel like they have no idea how hard that is. I don't know how. I met these guys on accident and we all just stuck together. I have no idea how to start up a conversation with someone and ask them to become friends.

3540,tic816,novus-usor,"Intro:
I am a 23 year old guy who has always been awkward and insecure. I always looked young for my age (l look 14 now) and that has always made me feel like an outcast and less of a man. 

Past:
On top of that when I was younger, I had a series of surgeries on my leg from age 13 to 18 due to an accident I had as a baby that injured my growth plate on my femur. I was in crutches for months at a time and I missed a lot growing up because of it. I never went out with friends or had a romantic relationships with anyone during High School. i didnt got to school events including prom. I even got super skinny because I did not eat at lunch because I was too embarrassed to ask for help with my food tray when I was in crutches. In school, I felt like I was invisible to girls let alone girls I had a crush on. In college, I thought things were going to change. But a lot of it remained the same. I felt like I didn’t belong, I looked like a skinny middle schooler surrounded by adults. I was/am so socially underdeveloped that is a miracle I was able to graduate and get a job. 

Presentish:
I never tried asking a girl out because I feel embarrass, I can not see myself asking a woman out looking like a kid myself. Oh and the cherry on top is that I am 5’6”. I am Mexican, so my family is short. I feel disgusting. But i feel guilty complaining about my life because through out all of this I am lucky enough to have a supportive and loving family. My parents are the best parents any kid can ask for. I also have a great first job coming of college which I feel extremely lucky to have considering how tough the pandemic has been to some people. I feel like I should be thankful for all this and accept that not everyone gets everything. But It still hurts to feel lonely and undesirable romantically.",2022-03-20 03:32:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1567755312,3,/r/lonely/comments/tic816/good_job_loving_parents_but_feel_lonely_and/,,0,1,"Good job, loving parents, but feel lonely and pathetic"

3549,ticvqt,Sonic_Intervention,"Part of me is like, why do I all of a sudden feel so lonely, and emotional?  Another part of me knows exactly why, but is still not happy about it and has no idea what to do about it.

So I'm gonna vent here a little, if that's OK.  I hope some of you can relate, respond, or maybe get something that can help out of this mess I am about to type. 

So My birthday is tomorrow.  Another year older, and as is the case it has me reminiscing and not such a good idea.  One year ago I left a relationship with my child's mom, a ten year relationship.  I was a hard drug user for years, and have been clean from the drugs and drink for three years last december.  She picked up the pipe last year around this time, and was like ""Nope I dont want rehab, I don't want help, I just want to smoke crack and disappear overnight this is fine I can't see why you have a problem with this.""  So I left.

So now with this new lifestyle I do not only not really know how to go about making new friends, but need to be careful, because I will naturally go right tio the fuckups, and that is a legit danger if I allow myself to be bullshitted.  Ad my partner of ten years, well I dont know what the fuck is going on with her.  And usually I am mostly ok with that.  But obviously I still have some feelings in that regard and they are hitting me hard right niow.  I have a six year old daughter I rarely see, like zero friends to actually hang out with.  Ive gotten so lonely...well shit that im here on Reddit ranting about it.  Lol.

I just isolate and play guitar and study music theory.  Sometimes I go hit the streets and play, or go to the parks and play, that will be better as spring comes.

But tomorrows my birthday, the people I really love are far from me phyisically and spiritually, and I'm just hurting right now.  The last thing I want is to spend the night in my room crying but that's what is going on.",2022-03-20 04:11:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616018794,0,/r/lonely/comments/ticvqt/feeling_like_its_hitting_me_pretty_hard_right_now/,,0,2,Feeling like it's hitting me pretty hard right now

3555,tidhhc,artooD2,"I (37f) love live music.  It’s one of my favorite things about life. The bad news is when the concerts come to play in the Midwest it requires a lot of effort to attend. Travel alone is at least a two to six hour drive one way.  Most women my age are knee deep in marriages and children.  Not only are we battling ticket costs, there’s transportation, lodging and the time commitment.  

Tonight was officially the third concert I attended solo. It was Elton John in Fargo. 

And for some reason the atmosphere just simply hit differently — I look around and I see couples, or groups of girlfriends in matching pink boas, or families… and it really made me feel like I was on this isolated island.  It was almost unbearable. 
 
I left the concert a little early and returned to my Airbnb… I don’t have the energy to brave downtown bar life on my own.  I feel like I’m spiraling down (I feel lonely, which makes me retract from being in public, which makes me even more lonely)

So I decided to download every single kind of app meant to make friends, relationships, whatever. That bring us to today. In the span of those two years of me desperately trying to find any kind of connection im still here. Alone with nobody and nothing.

Nothing has changed even though I worked so hard for a change. Everytime id get something going, they’d eventually end up leaving and never speak to me again, even after I say “Hey hope you’re doing well”. Nothing.

I think I was better off not trying at all. Had a mental breakdown today thinking about all this, and I started thinking. Maybe im just better off alone. 

I guess im meant to be alone, and to sit here and stare blankly at a wall while listening to Alice in Chains. Maybe this is the best thing for me. Because trying to make friends or anything like that has hurt me so much more than being alone for these past years.

3619,tiof0z,wawahage,"Being lonely and without friends sucks, but what is worse for me is that I am embarrassed by it, ashamed of it. Like there is something really wrong with me because of it.

I pretend everything is OK in front of my family (what's left of it) and coworkers. Nobody knows I'm lonely and therefore occasionally depressed. I'll lie that I went somewhere and did something with someone just so nobody knows I'm alone on my birthday, or that I did nothing during summer vacation. I once (20 years ago...Jesus does time fly) went out to read a book at a bus station from 9PM to 2AM on my birthday just so I could come home from my ""birthday celebration"". Even had cops ID me, lol.

What I wish for the most is to not have that pathetic feeling when I'm alone somewhere. Remove that, if I could go anywhere, and feel free alone - movies, theatre, events...and not give a damn what it may look to other people, I think I'd be happy. Instead I keep thinking damn I'm here alone, everyone must think I'm really pathetic and I get anxiety. So I haven't really been anywhere for a really long time. That's the saddest part, and I know most probably don't - I certainly do not give a damn when I see someone alone somewhere.

3632,tiqt28,0pinion8d_ZA," It's been so long since I tried to open up and speak about how lonely I am that I can't even think of more to say. I have ASD, I lack self confidence and I have become used to being pushed down and suppressed my whole life. So much so, that when I read *""****Markdown Mode***"" in bright red letters in the right hand corner of this editing box, my first thought was that it is some form of notice directed at me to indicate that my post would automatically be marked down / lowered / suppressed in the group. 

My second thought was that others, after reading my first thought, would likely skip to the next person's post, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The worst part of this thought train is that I actually know what markdown means because I used to be a developer. Which makes my first thought seem even more ridiculous.  

My fourth thought is I should probably look and see if there is self-loathing or depression reddit because I probably wouldn't be lonely if I liked myself. Perhaps the difference between solitude and loneliness is whether or not we enjoy the company of the person we are being forced to spend time with when we're alone. And in that case, which came first, the self loathing or the loneliness. Do I hate myself because I don't fit in, or do I not fin in because I hate myself. 

My last thought is that I've overshared.  Which I tend to do. It pains me to see how many members this group has. Ironically loneliness seems to be a shared poverty that we can all afford to end but seldom do. If you are still reading and my thoughts and I haven't already driven you away, thank you.

I know a lot of really lovely people. Lots of great acquaintances and (very) casual friendships. Somehow getting to the point of hanging out regularly (and I don't mean super often like once every 2-3 weeks even, with texting in between) has proven next to impossible.

The few deeper friendships I have are either long distance or crazy busy so I don't get to see them for months at a time.

I desperately need more regular in-person social interaction.

I've tried dating apps too, just to meet people...though I reject the idea that adults can only get deeper connection through a romantic and/or sexual relationship. Even then, I'll match with people and talk...they eventually ghost me every time.

I'm at a loss here. Advice appreciated.

3650,titokt,Arkaydian,"My next therapy appointment is a few ways ahead and I’m being crushed by the weight of my distressing thoughts so here I am to vent.

As a child, I often exhibited signs of having “imaginary friends.” Long story short; the beings I talk to that have no physical bodies are actually the spirits of the other side.

Sadly, as years went by, I have never had any genuine physical friends or any real connections to physical family members. This is unfortunately due to just not having the right people fall in line as by my fate up until now.

The people on the other side were (and still are) much more accessible than physical people. When I was casted into the mental health care system as a teenager, I couldn’t talk about a lot of my trauma because physical people (my family) stressed me out way more than spirits (the voices in my head) did.

My father was abusive, and the rest were indifferent. Amongst other things, any remarks each family member perceived as offensive would warrant an extreme emotional response.

Outside of family, sadly, anyone I meet just doesn’t want a deeper relationship with me. Whether it be me outgoing to them or them coming up to me, it just doesn’t happen.

I don’t even bring up my spiritual prowess. Just who I am hasn’t met the right people yet.

In short, it is unfortunate how this just happens; society collectively leaves people like me alone not on purpose, but by random chance.

Outside of my spiritual capabilities (physical, mental, emotional; excluding spirit), how many of you would say the same about just having bad luck of not finding the right people in your life?

3652,tiu2vo,[deleted],"Yes. As much as I desire a companionship or friendship more than anything else on this planet , more than all the money in the world, I also recognize that people have this amazing power to fucking destroy you, because they only see and manipulate you in the form they choose, no matter how far they are off to your true nature and who you really are. And frankly I'm over it. People aren't people anymore. We are robots who judge each other , put each other down, step on all the other heads of others we don't care about , as long as I keep my head the to sky,I cannot see who I am crushing below me. Tying happiness together with the friendly company of others to acknowledge your existence , to feel alive , loved , and that you are a living a normal life like everyone else is a recipe for disaster. I am alone, and maybe it's better that way. Because other people love to draw you in, you give them your utmost effort to add substance to your life by doing the same for theirs , then they deploy the fact they are a fake fucking snake who already predetermined you are a disposable fucking nothing to them like the others they deflated of life and discarded. 

 I struggle between having hope, being ""okay with myself"" , coping with life, not living it , hating myself, hating my life , wondering why I am not good enough , then fakely accepting that I'm cool with everything. 

Even though I know people can rip me in half with their words , I still desire to meet one , singular person, who I can get lost in enjoying life with.

3670,tivtcr,alvida-tanhai,"For some time I have been looking at the posts of this subreddit. And after having build some courage I want to tell my story, which I have never told to anyone.

I never had any friends in my life, in school I was always alone, I never had any memorable moment of school. I have always been nice to everybody, not for sake of getting anything in return, but doing good for the sake of goodness.

Some peers I talked in school always came to me when their friends left them or they had a break-up or some other emotional problems. I always helped them, but in the end they all leave when their problem is solved by me, when I help them in solving their problems by listening to their problems, giving advice and so on. 

They never tried to start a conversation with me, it was always me who would check up on them, asking them how are you doing and so on. 

I always wished them on their birthday but they never wished me or even care to ask me when is my birthday. Even when in school they acted like I did not exist, never said hello to me, but would immediately come when they needed help.

They would always say that I'm a great person, a person who understands, a person who cares(I'm not boasting about myself). But would never even care to ask me how I'm doing.

I always wondered if they meant what they said, why treat me like a nobody or a ghost or a forgotten one or somebody who is left out.

Because of such experience I have given up on the whole concept of friendship. 

I will always try my best to help people who are going through difficult times because no matter what pains I go through, it is the kindness and sacrifice of unknown people who have made the world a better place.

Have you gone through the same experience like mine ?

I personally find going for walks around the neighborhood pretty good too, give people a bit of a wave and a ""hello"". I'm finding skipping really decent as well just for clearing the head with some cardio.

Have been getting a bit into gardening too and just trying to get more sunlight. 

It sounds really lame but I find gratitude journaling in the morning pretty good too. I have a lot going wrong in my life (loss of friendships and health issues) but I'm holding onto that potential of good things coming my way. 

Just thought I'd post to say you're not alone, keep on fighting and I genuinely hope you're able to squeeze a bit more good out of your days in whichever thing you find helps :) 

I find having some ""next steps"" goals to be good too - mine are currently to try and step out of my comfort zone and join a few local clubs of some kind.

Seeing all those people that have friends and family laughing together would make me feel sick because I envy it.

I don't want to live in my house forever but I also can't enjoy being outside of my home alone. I've been trying so hard to make friends, make dates, and everything falls flat every time.

3689,tiy788,probabsgonnad8,"hey,

I want to talk about something that has been bothering me lately. I didn't know who to write to and I decided to share myself here with strangers. I am a second year university student studying outside of the country where I was born. I spent my first year having people around me. I took a break from school for a year due to some psychological reasons and came back this year. I'm in the second semester of my sophomore year and it's not like how I left. There is no communication between me and my friends who had contacted me several times on when I was coming back to uni, while I was away. None  talk with me anymore, the only communication we have is waving. I went out to dinner with a friend I was very close to before. She brought up about our mutual friends and there were some conversations that could be called gossip. When I came to school the next day, I realized that she told our mutual friends about everything we talked that day. I didn't like this situation and I put some distance between me and her. I think she must have told our mutual friends other things about me that my communication with them was suddenly cut off. I moved to an apartment alone this year because of my psychological conditions that required me to take a break from school. I was getting on well with my next door neighbor until my lovely neighbor moved. Since my assignments are crazy, I am often busy to go out. but some days when I want to go out, want to share something with someone, I realize how lonely I am. At the beginning of this year, I tried very hard to socialize. I did whatever I could. Unfortunately, I didn't want to continue some of the friendships because some people's behavior towards me was just for benefit. It's starting to get on my nerves now that I'm the first person to approach people. I started to think that I am so ugly that people want to avoid me. I have enough friends in my own country. I even have relationship that's been going on around two years (of course, my studies abroad put some distance between me and my partner, we are doing well enough). I am very lonely in where I am right now. My loneliness used to make me happy, when someone looked at me, it would seem like a compliment, but now the way people look at me makes me nervous. In this country, I met someone from my mother country. It made my outings less lonely. but hanging out with him caused my ex-friends who waved at me to not even make eye contact with me anymore. On top of that, this friend of mine started to constantly criticize something about my appearance. I don't know what happened. I was happy with myself and someone else's thought started to affect me. I feel bad. When I shared this with my family, they showed concern, but they also said it was very normal. I don't have a problem with not being able to talk to people. My only problem is getting tired of trying to talk. I wish there was someone here that would comfort me when I feel bad. I tried to socialize but my efforts make me feel like I am trying so hard that's why people are distancing them from me. I tried to do nothing and left things to be, still nothing happened. I don't want to talk to my friends from my own country and share my troubles. I've tried. but when I tried, they also started talking among themselves about me. It makes me paranoid when people talk about me all the time behind my back. however, I will always be talked about. I wish they would say something to my face instead of talking behind my back. I'm even fine with arguments, I am just so sick of people talking behind my back as if I did something wrong. I opened this account because I needed a place to share my thoughts. I just need someone to listen to me on this, I guess. Idk. After I emptied my head on here, this writing started to make no sense to me.",2022-03-20 23:45:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1647818292,2,/r/lonely/comments/tiy788/a_lonely_college_persons_vent/,,0,0,a lonely college person's vent
3690,tiyd9d,Various_Classroom_50,"I am 20 and have been doing community college/ work ever since highschool ended. 

I was never really satisfied with my highschool expirience but atleast by the end of it I had found a group of young men like minded to me that were focused on their goals and careers. Some of them I’d known since primary school. All of them were great to drink with and considered them brothers. 

Highschool ended and almost everyone left for university or technical school or millitary and the partying in our hometown flickered out. I’ve had no one these last two years I could hangout with regularly except my girlfriend and longtime bestfriend. It was already lonely that my boys were gone but this last week she unexpectedly told me our relationship isn’t enough and that she wants to be alone for awhile. Fine. Now what?

I have no close friends. No best friends. No one to hangout it with. They’re all gone. I’m realizing now that I don’t know what to do with myself. The only people I talk to now are my coworkers. Most of them are much older than me or young women with busy lives. Not really anyone I see any potential friendships or relationships with. Just work talk at the work place. I go home and I don’t even feel like playing videogames anymore. Because it feels so lonely and pointless. 

I just lay in my bed and wait until it’s time to go to sleep.
And then when I wake up I lay in my bed and wait until It’s time to go to work.

He didn't leave her, she left him.  So she moved to another state halfway  across the country where she met my dad.

Then I became her child, her husband, her whole world, her everything. Because it  seems, that ever since I came into being, her whole world seemed to have stopped.

She never married again or dated anyone else after that business marriage with her ex husband and my dad.

She became my mom and my dad. She is the only person I ever truly have, and I am  the only person she has. She never saw her family again and never brought them to come here. She started a new life so that  I would have a better life and the opportunity she never had.

The friends help a lot, like just one interaction can make the day go by faster, it makes classes so much easier and everything becomes easier to just ignore, but on the days I don't interact with them, I feel dead inside, the days just drag on like trying to sand a finger down to the bone manually, and previously was one of the (very) many I have so many random scars on my left arm and by proxy also one of the reasons I wear long-sleeved shirts and sweaters in every condition of weather. But I haven't done anything to myself physically harmful like that since then so I'm hoping that's at least getting better. But anyways, like I said I am incredibly clingy and also very insecure about it because I don't want to be a burden to people and all that. I tried to think of the cause of the whole situation and the only thing I can think of is the 3 years after my dad died were just nothingness and only about 4 years ago did it happen do its still a bit painful but that whole period of nothingness where I basically unlearned anything I'd ever learned about social life, and having a healthy relationship, meanwhile having my mom verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusing me from the side didn't help either and only recently was I pulled out from it and then promptly thrown back into the void of nothing, I'm referring to the friends I previously had and felt like my life was complete with them, and then promptly lost them. But I got pulled out again by the friends who stayed and the new friends who I made. But I keep having my own image in the back of my head, taunting me, showing me every little thing wrong with my appearance, me being overweight, not showering enough, my smell, my hands being all fat n shit, feeling like I have sausages for fingers, what i think people think about how I look, etc etc. And I just kinda sit there and nod like "" yes this is a good point I am a fat piece of shit"" and in real life I'm just sitting there and just hhheeeh-ing in the most strainful way possible. And don't say professional help they haven't done shit for me and I don't trust them anymore. It stopped working after the 2nd year. Like its been 4 years since my dad died and I was like 11 at the time so it hit hard but I don even kno anymore like aaAAAAAAAAAA yknow? Like I just wanna hold someone or something, like I'm massive, a behemoth if you will, I'm like 6ft 2 ish so that doesn't really help with the anxieties and I get all scared n shit because im like "" am I blocking this person's view? "" n shit. But I just wanna hold someone and just be happy and that's way too much for me to ask for right now so it's kinda eh I just,, lon e l y²",2022-03-21 03:52:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628563273,1,/r/lonely/comments/tj2ukj/how_do_i_not_feel_lonely_a_bit_of_a_rant_about/,,0,0,"How do I not feel lonely ( a bit of a rant about everything) (TW: Suicide ment.

He has his worries and I wish to support but my performance hasn’t been amazing. While I get it that the years in 2018 to current has been riddled with pandemic and economy issues, but I don’t see much worth.

I have a loving family and all. I get it I may sound entitled, but nonetheless, empty and miserable. Both personal and my career. 

I don’t know. I can’t speak to anyone. I have to maintain my image with the public as the representation of myself also affects the company. Yes I could talk to my brother, but sometimes you know, outside perspective can be refreshing.

For starters, I'm a 24 year old male that has never had sex, and I've only ever been in 2 ACTUAL relationships in my life. And here's the thing, I get why I haven't had more partners like I am overweight  and I get nervous talking to women. Plus the slew of disabilities I have don't help. All I do is sit online and get jealous of people in happy relationships. Tbh I feel like if I was more confident I'd have better chances with women, because sure I'm overweight but I don't think I'm bad looking because it's not out of control, it's just hard because I feel like if I say the wrong thing everything will fall apart. It doesn't help I'm also terrified of actually getting down to doing the deed for similar reasons.

I've put in an incredible amount of effort to trying to not need a partner but all I do is long for someone to hold me, someone to talk to, just someone, anyone to love me.

I’m bitter, twisted and useless to the world. I’m a portrait of a hopeless individual, another face lost in a crowd of obscurity. I suffer from my earnest, to want what I can’t have.

3791,tjarh7,pandorasbox_15,"&amp;#x200B;

I've had four close friends till now. One I've fallen out with. Like I feel like our friendship is threadbare. One is in a different country. The other two are roommates, so well they literally hangout 24 X 7.

I feel like having few close friends makes me dependent and lonely sometimes. I recently decided to go on a short trip and I realized didn't have someone to go with. And this wasn't the first time either. Many a time I've just stayed home or waited until my two friends were free to meet so I could actually have a social life. My friends have different interests from me so that made it harder as well. I did try going for social swap events where I meet new people but after the event, the connection just fizzled out and they didn't seem interested to hang out or meet really.  


I normally just take a deep breath and deal with it, but today it was hard. It was like this hollow feeling that was hard to shake out and so I decided to write about it. 

I guess I could still do the trip solo but I feel a little nervous. Should I just do it anyway?",2022-03-21 12:32:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617950168,2,/r/lonely/comments/tjarh7/i_feel_so_helpless_sometimes_and_lonely/,,0,2,I feel so helpless sometimes and lonely.

3796,tjbj65,GeneralMudkip101,"I'm not sure if it's just me or not. But being alone and single gives me the freedom to do what I want, not having a partner who wants constant attention and wanting to pull me away from the things I enjoy and telling me those things are bad for me and I should focus on them more.
I understand a relationship goes both ways, but sometimes I enjoy my ""me"" time, doing the things that make me happy. Same things goes for them, if they are doing something they enjoy I won't pull them out of it just so they can do what I want.
Most of the time I'd be enjoying my time spent with them, and others I'd rather sit alone doing my own thing.

On the other hand, I miss having that type of connection with someone, enjoying the time together and making memories that will last a life time. Sometimes even joining in on each other's hobbies and likes and having fun. I also having that someone to talk to about anything and they listen to me and vice versa.
It's also the physical connection I miss. Wrapping my arms around someone at night. The hand holding and cuddling during a movie. Even those more intimate moments and passionate nights. 

I want that someone who will just love me for me, and accept that I'm weird and odd. Someone who is ok with all my faults and is willing to help me fix them instead of seeing the things that I enjoy as the problem.

But I'm scared. Not wanting to mess up my next relationship if I ever have one again. Getting to the point where I'll like someone but begin to over think everything, seeing nothing but flaws in the imaginary relationship because of me. Maybe I'm not supposed to be in a relationship, but just sitting on the side lines alone. And it scares me that I'm ok with that, ok with being alone. Ether way i'd be happy with the outcome. 

Together forever, or forever alone.

3805,tjcxfm,iiPuffy,"I just want someone to care about me and make me a priority for once...instead of me fighting for a place in thier lives and leaving myself avaliable. People claim they care or like me but thier actions never match thier words. They say they want to be more, but only really like the idea of being chased. They say they are my friend, but only message me when everyone else is gone. They say they care but when I reach out in my vulnerable times, they aren't there or they disappear and it makes me feel like there is no 'comfort zone' with them. 

 Sometimes I feel so lonely, but I know alot of this is usually just me over thinking and causing my own down fall. However when I feel like hardly anyone is there, I just have a habit of closing myself off to the world.  

Anyone else get like this? I feel like I'm on a loop. One moment I'm fine, the next I feel unimportant and I just want someone to make me feel important and moments later I'm super independent and don't care If I have others in my life or not.

3816,tjedfr,samirhadi,"Many of you struggle with getting out of bed and I am gonna share with you some tips to get out of bed more easily.

Tip #1 is an alarm clock app that either requires you to scan a code for the alarm clock to turn off or you need to complete a small task to shut it off like math equations or burpees or something. These apss can be great but weren't enough for me to get up. Should be finde for most people though.

The second tip is to drink a lot of water when you are going to sleep (1 liter or so) then you'll wake up in the middle of the night because you have to go to the toilet. Then after going to the bathroom, drink water again so you have to get up in a couple of hours again. When  you are already standing upright, you'll have more willpower to not get into bed again.

Due to my upbringing and crappy choices in life I'm now confined to my situation for the rest of my life and there is nothing I can do about it. I cant fix my issue and it is permanent and quite frankly the only thing I'll have is myself and this loneliness. Not just that but also being shamed and ridiculed for it, I find it hard to see what's the point of doing all of this if it's all for nothing. Especially in this world that seems to be arising where everyone must be perfect and meet certain expectations. There's so much incentive to give up but also I am too much of a coward to actually do any kind of action. Everyday I get to see the things I'll never be able to experience while also witnessing others taking it for granted. I cant break down or show weakness to the people around me because I have to care for them. I have to put up a fake smile like everything's gonna be okay and that I know what I'm doing when I don't. At 20 years old and seeing this world and experiencing it, I really just want nothing to do with it anymore but yet I still tolerate it somehow.

There is a concept in programming called rubber-ducking. If you have a problem in your code, you can't find the answer, it's easier to debug if you explain it to someone or something so you explain it a rubber duck sitting on your desk as if it was your colleague or Siri, or Alexa, or Cortana. But unlike the voice assistants, the rubber duck won't get your out of focus by doing a search to the internet with your inquiry.

A therapist is a person you pay to hear your problems because no one else will (for free). I don't think I can afford it at the moment and a therapist is still an autonomous entity, unlike the voice assistant, the therapist will look for your inquiry in their own internal database of knowledge, this might or might not interfere with the process of debugging, since every body has its own particular set of circumstances and its not all a one-size-fits-all.

I went to do some shopping yesterday, got my hair cut. I wanted to go to a manga and comics store nearby but it had bad reviews on Google so I didn't.

Look how beautiful it is outside today but I have no where to go and nothing waiting out there for me. I'm building a small web app from the ground today, I was procrastinating doing such a project for weeks and got so disappointed because I was getting nothing done, but now I'm doing and close to completion and I don't feel any accomplishment, and I don't know where to go from there because I never get this far enough into personal projects lol.

I thought about ingesting some kratom but I have sleep problems when I do and have work tomorrow. I'm still not ready to ingest syrian rue and acacia bark powder and don't know when I will be, but tomorrow is work day so I can't.

The nagging feeling of time wasted that refuses to go away. Get used to the impotence of just writing words to the digital void that never answers the way you want. From 2004 up to now, people repeat the same words they read in media, thus no matter who or how you ask you know word for word the answer you are going to get. People === Google.

There are some people who are just algorithms now.

3882,tjowp5,NotReallyAlone,"Recently I decided to quit drinking and get back in to a healthier lifestyle, and for me that mostly means eating well and lifting weights. Before this, I was drinking heavily, and I would always tell myself I did it simply because I enjoyed it, nothing more. But now, without it, the feelings come flooding back, particularly loneliness and discontent, and not just the romantic kind, more the emotionally disconnected and isolated kind. I had been using alcohol to numb myself, and it worked amazingly well. I didn't need to feel the pain as strongly, and I could disappear off in to my own world of my interests, sipping on whatever alcohol I wanted for that numbness and for kicks. The painful feelings disappeared (this is not an advert for alcohol, please don't take it as such).

I guess I'm writing this as both a warning for those who (may) use alcohol to numb feelings, and to ask how I can cope with these very strong, raw emotions. I've cried for the first time in a long time, but I will not use alcohol to cope anymore, it's no good, but without it I feel the full force of my longing for companionship and emotional connection. I'm seeing a friend tomorrow, I hope, for the first time in a while. Perhaps I'll ask if I can hug him, and if we can just talk. What I need is people I connect with, and alcohol is a false friend. People are so important and I can't ignore these feelings anymore, I need to be proactive and brave. I guess I answered my own question here, but I'd love to hear your thoughts, my fellow brave lonely people.",2022-03-21 23:16:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643841834,5,/r/lonely/comments/tjowp5/the_realisation_that_i_numbed_myself_with_alcohol/,,0,17,The realisation that I numbed myself with alcohol

3900,tjr13k,anomolygirl,"So I am currently a junior in college. I have struggled to make lasting friendships ever since coming back from quarantine. We were sent home for covid after a couple weeks in the second semester of freshman year. This post isn’t about covid but I do want to mention that I feel like it could be a huge factor. 

Some background on me! 
If you were to ask anyone who knows me from my hometown or high school, they would say I am OVERLY social. I grew up being friends with everyone and anyone. My parents always told me “I could talk to a brick wall”. I have never not once had an issue making friends before college. In highschool, I had many friends as well as a group of closer best friends (who are still my best friends). 
I have traveled alone across the country for summer camps and always instantly created a great group of friends. 
I went to highschool in the nearby city without any of my hometown friends and built a new base of lasting relationships. 
My family never saw me being lonely as a potential issue when sending me off to college and neither did I! I never even thought it would be possible to be lonely at university with thousands of people to meet and connect with. But here I am writing this. 

(For context: I have a group of 5 amazing, lifelong friends. We go to different universities OTHER than one of my friends who is actually my roommate and the only person here who I feel completely at home with.) 


I am extremely extroverted and this loneliness has consumed me. I have an amazing family and a secure friend group from my hometown. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing I have a really special friend group that will never break. They also come and visit at least once a semester which is when I forget about all that pesky loneliness. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel stuck and scared for the future. Is this the new me? Timid and antisocial? lonely and hopeless? I sure hope not!! is this normal? I am thankful for what I have but just can’t seem to do the whole college friends thing right. 

Let me know what yall think!",2022-03-22 01:02:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644266531,4,/r/lonely/comments/tjr13k/long_term_college_loneliness/,,0,2,Long term College loneliness

Whether it's responding to last-minute work requests, being the family member to solve logistical or financial problems, or being the friend that listens to their problems.

I have no problem with this, acknowledging and observing that I also need to be careful to avoid becoming a ""caregiver"" dependent-type.

A constant stream of requests and people only reaching out to me when they need something, and I am just expected to keep being there for everyone.

lonely is when you don’t eat lunch and bury you head in your phone so you don’t have to face the fact that everyone is staring at you because you’re at a lunch table all by yourself. 

lonely is when you go to lunch and sit down and at table and everyone gets up any walks away leaving you there by yourself embarrassed and alone.

lonely is when the teacher says to the class “you can pick your partner for this project or assignment” and everyone pairs up with their friends while you left standing all alone while everyone is watch you awkwardly. 

lonely is when the teacher says the class can “pick your partner” and you immediately go up to the teacher because you know no one will pair up with you. 

lonely is when the teacher says the class can “pick you partner” and you wait for someone to pair up with you and no one does so the teacher makes someone be your partner. 

lonely is when the gym teacher has us walking around in circles the entire gym period and everyone is laughing along with their friends while you’re walking by yourself. 

lonely is when you hide out in the bathroom in order to avoid going to lunch so you won’t be laughed at and ridiculed. 

lonely is when someone only talks to you momentarily while their friends is off doing something and the second their friends come back they walk away mid conversation and act as if they were never talking to you. 

lonely is when people come up to me and ask me to do their homework knowing i’m the smartest one in class and buddying up to me and acting like their my friend off the basis that i can get them a free a on an assignment without them doing anything, then acting like i never existed after it’s over and done with.

lonely is when you avoid eating in lunch by sitting in the hallway or by taking up the time to eat to get caught up on your homework assignments because you have a fear of eating in front of people due to being subject to sitting at a lunch table by yourself even though there’s hundreds of kids in the lunchroom. 

lonely is when you’ve developed a crippling fear of eating in front on people because you feel insecure that your sitting alone at a lunch took table.

lonely is sitting at a lunch table by yourself while everyone else is sitting at every other table around you laughing and chatting with their friends and looking over at you knowing you have no one to talk to and then laughing and chatting on like you don’t even exist.

lonely is when you’d rather unexist from earth so everyone would feel better without your presence knowing you’re gone.

lonely is when you feel bad for existing.

Then I don't get anything done. No homework. No literature books I had to read (i have to return it today lol). Only thing I get done is stuff in genshin impact. After that I just browse the internet, though I am genuinely trying to break my youtube ""addiction"" (I use it too much).

3952,tjwayw,[deleted],"This is going to sound really strange, and you might think I need serious therapy after reading this, but I want to get this off my chest. 

Okay so a few months ago I started watching this guy on tiktok who does ‘comfort character’ skits. It gave me the idea.. I created an imaginary person (a guy around my age to be exact) in my mind so I can talk to him. He replies with what I would want a friend to say to me. So I’d tell him something, and then I think of what I’d want someone to respond with, and that response is what he says to me. 

He shows up whenever I think about him, and will help me get out of bed do work go to bed etc. I usually complain about my day to him, vent or talk about guys I like in school. The things he says most often is “how’s it going” “It’s okay” and “you’re doing great”. Sometimes “i love you” (there’s no actual love involved, I just like hearing that being said to me). I daydream a lot, so he ends up being in whatever scenarios I’m daydreaming about. It’s basically just me giving myself advice except my inner voice becomes a guy’s voice. And we have conversations. I can also partly visualize him. He is tall and has dark hair but no specific face because that’d be creepy. 

I’ve actually imagined this ‘person’ being close to me giving me hugs. It’s like having a close friend/bf who literally knows everything about you and will only support you. He doesn’t have much of a personality, but he is there regularly and a lot of the time whenever I’m alone. However, i know I shouldn’t expect anyone irl to be like him. I enjoy having him to talk to.. I’m concerned this might be a problem so I’ll discuss it with my therapist. Maybe it’s normal for a kid but I’m an adult. But I’m going to keep him around until I go to therapy… I discussed it with him (lol) and honestly I’ve gotten a lot better at positive self talk and tackling problems. It also helps me feel better quicker. I’m very socially awkward and have social anxiety so it might be worsening that.

A few recent examples:
My sister currently lives with my mother, she suffers from depression/anxiety because of the toxic environment there. I have invited her over many times and force her to go out with me. It’s getting more difficult to even get a reply out of her, or for her to answer my calls. I invite her over for dinner just to get out of the house and she doesn’t even reply? I’m getting sick of having to try so hard every time I want to see her. 
My mum only calls me once very few months if she wants something or to tell me what I’m doing wrong in life. 
My uncle from my dads side is here from Japan and instead of texting me to catch up he texts my boyfriend??
My other sister I also feel like I force to hang out with me. She does admit she just forgets to reply most the time. 
They are the only family I have left but I feel so disconnected even though I’ve tried so hard. Is it me? Am I the problem? 

Also just had a baby 6 months ago and wanted more then anything for them to be a part of her life. When I was pregnant they acted so excited but haven’t ever asked to see her. Again only if I drive to them with her at a time that suits them and even then I have to force them downstairs to actually spend time with us.

3967,tjyvmo,thelifeofrafa,"**Being a socially awkward person sucks so much, I always feel anxious being near girls all the time. I'm a 22M and I always felt unwanted so I never shoot my shot with any girl since I feel like I'll waste my time, I also work in retail so I see a lot of women come through our store and of course it's part of my job to be friendly but honestly I feel dead inside when talking to most of the customers. Even right now being 2am for me, I feel dead inside not being able to express myself the way I want to. I’ve been reading and watching Seinen (romantic) anime and manga and I’ve realized how much of a hopeless romantic I am, trying to find someone but that someone will never come. It’s nights like this where I start thinking what I’m doing wrong with my life, what I can improve, what I could do better to be more attractive, or at least approachable. There has been days when I’m out with my friends and they always express how they met their women and I’m there wondering why that hasn’t happened to me yet, of course I ask them how they did it but they always say “just be yourself” but I am myself when I’m around women so I know I must be doing something wrong. I know I’m not that bad looking but somedays I think I am. Seeing my friends with their woman still gives me hope that I’ll find someone but somedays I’m hopeless. I don’t even know why I keep trying, maybe I’m meant to be single all my life? I don’t know, it confuses me each day.

But that isn’t true and actually being online all the time I’m pretty sure is affecting me I need to focus on myself sometimes

I absolutely love any sort of hugs or cuddles or anything of that nature (provided that it isn’t sexual) and feel completely empty and starved inside if I even go a day without it. I haven’t had any since the 31st of October. I just really need someone that I can hug, someone that I can hold in my arms (and be held in hers), someone who i can lay down next to and have my arm around, someone to share a blanket with as she rests her head against my chest, someone who I can cuddle with like I’m a giant baby (and the other way around, too)…

I have had a huge crush on a particular girl for 6 years. Needless to say, she does not like me back, likely because when we were in 9th grade, I got really jealous and needy and I ended up destroying our friendship. We have become close friends again but she has said she’s not interested in having a relationship with me… ever.

I don’t have many requirements for a relationship other than I need a Christian relationship, it needs to be centered around Jesus. I also would need her to be okay with me having depression and anxiety issues since I can’t just make them go away.

I wish I would already know you so i could ask you to go out rn and drink some coffee but there is just no such person in my life rn that would go do that with me. Imagine how cool that would be, carefree students sitting in the sun, talking about anything, the smell of coffee and fresh breeze of spring.

The sun‘s going down already and I can‘t wait, because atleast I won‘t feel that terrible being inside while it‘s dark outside. 

I wish I could just put my phone away and find joy in other things, but it‘s like my phone is the only source of happiness I have right now, it‘s the only way I can somehow communicate with other human beings, and the notifications grand me atleast a tiny bit of happy hormones so that‘s great.

4027,tk7qpy,VenomousBlack,"Love.  
We all want love and sometimes we get to taste it as it passes us by. Love is beautiful, and something isn't beautiful because it lasts. Just like a sunset, it happens only then and only now. It doesn't last forever but we hold onto it as it's warm rays touch our skin and our hearts. Once the light has passed we are left with a memory of a brighter time in our life. In the darkness we can use this old love to make the dark seem less lonely.  


Once we have lost this love we will feel loss but also happiness that we had the fortune and luck to feel this wonderful emotion. Bittersweet love is when we feel love for something that once was, could have been or never will be.  


Bittersweet Love.  


Have you ever loved someone without them knowing? Do you remember someone from your past that you loved?

4042,tkalcj,[deleted],"So this might be a long one. I never really had any friends for most of my childhood(I’m still it 18 yet but close), this was because I had to move around a lot with my parents and brother, as soon as I got comfortable somewhere…Bam! We loved someplace else, at a certain point I gave up and decided this is how it will be for me forever. However the last stint I had was in Eastern Europe and it was longer than any other, 5 and a half years, my first year there I struggled a lot because of slight culture gap because it was close to Central Asia rather than proper Eastern Europe so it didn’t make a difference that I was Russian. There was also a slight language barrier but nothing noticeable as they still spoke Russian quite a bit and I understood them. I was bullied and beaten mercilessly the first year until I found the courage and took on six guys at once and even while bleeding I finally triumphed over them and felt like a god. My second year I was still an outcast but people got comfortable with my presence and accepted me as not a foreign object. By the time the second year there was ending a boy from Asia came, his first day there he was very quite and reserved like I was all the time, soon after that I felt bad for him and helped him get settled there to a suitable degree, it soon became obvious that we had similar interest. He became my best and only friend as the rest were mere acquaintances. The same year a girl from Central Asia also came and she becomes more relevant next year. Skip to next year which was my favourite. This year we were placed in the best campus, it was really great and I generally enjoyed that year very much, it was extremely eventful, I won’t go into much detail as that would take a long time. This is where it gets progressively bad for me. Both the joy and girl move to another country. He goes to a boarding school and she goes to somewhere in south east Asia.The next year was pretty depressing as once again I had become lonely and barely talked, I was of course extreme comfortable with my old acquaintances form the past 4 years so I felt fine in that sense. Before that year ended a little virus came and ruined everyone’s lives(you may have heard of it). After the virus my parents didn’t send me and my bother to school as while the government didn’t have any restrictions the pandemic was still raging and little was known about it which made everyone more paranoid. For 2 years I didn’t go to school, I only started recently. My mind was going insane during the pandemic which is another long and psychedelic journey(I wasn’t taking drugs just that I went partially insane). After it was over me and my family moved to England where I was actually born but they took me back as soon as that happened(to Russia). Now that I’m here a few months back I somehow got all the communication mediums to talk to the old group and we did, for months it was extremely great. But then they expelled me for inexplicable reasons and I felt betrayed. I thought that they might have changed because it’s been more than 2 years. But I was wrong, they repeated what the events were really like and they never liked me all along. They thought I was the worst for trying to be their friend because even an introvert needs some interaction. It seemed that I looked at the part with a rose tinted view. All of this is still pretty fresh and somewhat traumatic. I will probably never trust anyone again. I had to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading guys. Also I was born in London to be precise(you probably won’t care but it felt incomplete).",2022-03-22 19:12:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/tkalcj/my_story/,,0,5,My Story.

4091,tki5f1,nupower,"just a short story of my loneliest period yet. 

before this happened I was very joyous and playful with my friends. around 21 I was just popular and just living and enjoying life but like all good things things came to a end and also with people being involved a lot of jealous and envy is what messed up a lot of friendships that I’ve had with others. 

every friend I’ve had it’s always been a one sided understanding I never really felt like friends with anyone at all when I come to think of it. 

but anyways, after I heard about certain people talking behind my back as well as a mixture of a stressful mom hounding you and always over romanticizing everything I couldn’t help but to be in a shell where I can just be my friend and go missing from everyone. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling as I went a year with little to no contact with anyone that I’ve know. 

and now I am in a predicament that has caused even more people no to like me with probable cause. 

recently my mom kicked me out around this same time last year for smoking in my house. I knew it was wrong but the thing that made matters worse is when she broke my room door open and we ended up fighting. to make a long story short I ended up moving out of my house for 8 months living out of a suitcase with my uncle. 

my uncle was cool he was just too noisy and indirect when speaking which amused a lot of issues with him as well. can you imagine someone saying it’s okay for you to stay with them just to talk behind their back and act weird the whole time. no to mention his family was also there so it just made things a bit sketch when it came to them accepting that I was going to be there. 

while living there, I was dating a girl who was not a good choice at all, as much as she tried to be me and her being together wasn’t healthy at all. plus she was doing sketch shit on the side as well. 

and now I’m back home with a family who doesn’t want me here and would honestly like for me to leave.",2022-03-23 01:03:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1590296622,1,/r/lonely/comments/tki5f1/does_anyone_have_a_success_lonely_story/,,0,1,does anyone have a success “lonely” story?

I'm not alone but I feel lonely. 

I'm geographically away from most of them and we are rarely together. 

I spend most of my time alone and really without anything meaningful to do. And even though I want to stop this cycle it seems like it just keeps going. I go to sleep after 4AM and wake up really late.

The people I talk with, like university classmates, are just there for a few hours and are not really ""friends"". They don't really make an effort to be with me. 

All this makes me go into a sort of depressive state that comes and goes and makes me not take care of myself. I haven't been healthy for the past few months.

I feel even more lonely since I broke up a relationship a few months ago that used to make most of the loneliness go away. And in between all this, I moved to another country, all alone, for 6 months (I'm back now), which didn't help at all.

My mind: great, so we will use that to trick others into loving us and we'll get all that stuff.

My mind: you are incapable of feeling any attraction towards someone else that isn't for your own interior motives.

Me: what the hell does that mean?

My mind: you won't ever fully love them, you will trick both of you that you love each other and *when* you break up you will be more scared to be alone than to have lost that person as a partner.

Me: pretty sure everything you're describing is how a basic relationship works I don't know why you feel so inclined to throw all this trickery nonsense in.

I bent over the bathroom  and tried to vomit but nothing came out. My entire body was shaking, and I barely ate. I would maybe eat a half bowl of oatmeal a day. Certain thoughts would trigger an intense feeling of panic. I further isolated myself, as being around people would trigger some type of panic attack.

4146,tkokog,pistaninja46,"So I’m wondering, with everything going on; global pandemic, inflation, war and corruption; how do you still have faith in humanity? 
Slowly slowly I feel myself slipping down a rabbit hold of getting annoyed with every interaction or getting angry to see the lack of empathy for those around us. More and more I find myself wanting to isolate for fear of being disappointed or because people are selfish and don’t care. 
If I continue this way I might just end up being alone with no human interaction. (Not that I’m not practically there)

People my age are doing so much better than me, even having relationships. I'm 20, single, and wish I could get on antidepressants already without waiting for months.

I recently had a conversation with a random guy on Discord, they mention how crying is natural and would happily lean on a girl's shoulder to cry on. I don't feel the same way. I don't feel comfortable with intimate touches, and I lost the ability to cry so.

Another thing that bothered me a lot and lead me into this mess was that I kept dreaming about that ex best friend of mine. We used to be friends since childhood and it was fun to hear her random facts and insights. Why couldn't I stop dreaming of her? Why does she still appear in my dreams where I'd usually hang out with her?

She's not dead, she just ghosted me half a year ago because I was being an awful friend. (Don't pity me.)

I don't have anyone anymore and nothing will ever match the friendship I had with her. Can't cry anymore. I can't succeed.

She would always go out with friends and make plans with everyone but acted like I was nothing but a chore... I was kind and sweet, I wrote music and poetry, I praised her actions and told her how proud I was of her ambitions and talents... I don't see what more I could be, but I tried anyways... We had a child together, and my son is my best of all best friends and the only friend I have... The problem is that I only feel alive when I have him and I only get him on weekends... When he's gone, I work and sleep then wakeup to work and sleep again, counting the hours until I see his little smile... The loneliness is bleeding into every aspect of my life... I fall in love with any woman who shows me even a remote semblance of kindness and interest... Then they tell me not long after that they just met someone else and ""We just clicked, I'm so sorry if I hurt you"" It's so bad that my notifications wake me up from a dead sleep because I'm surprised my phone's making any sound at all... I get so excited just to have contact with ANYONE to talk about my ideas and thoughts, but it's never enough to keep anyone's attention... I'm a tattoo artist, I play 6 different instruments, I am an encyclopedia of knowledge, I'm successful in my career, and I have my own house and car that I own and I'm only 26... You'd THINK that all of those things would scream interesting but it's just not enough... Maybe it's my appearance?  Maybe I'm just so overjoyed at the thought of someone giving me attention that I become overwhelming? I don't know... But it's... It's making my eyes rain a lot... I feel like a side character in my own life.... Some of my FAMILY doesn't even know I have a one year old son... If you made it this far, hats off to you...

4225,tla20a,OGCigarettePeddler,"I knew this person for 4 years. We did 2 months long internship together and bonded like we had known each other for ages. We'd be together all the time. We'd hangout after office. They'd even spend their weekends with me. Eventually, after 2 years of knowing each other, on my birthday, they told me they loved me. I had feelings for them as well, but I did not want to ruin the bond that we shared. So, I didn't say it back at that moment, or perhaps I was taken aback by the suddenness. A couple of days later, they were very vulnerable and we were just listening to music in my room. I looked at them and it dawned upon me that I have never loved anyone the way I love this person sitting next to me right now. That is when I told them I loved them back.

2 years later. Things were going very good. They lived 10 mins away from me. They'd be at my place almost all the time. We were practically living together. Life was amazing. One morning, I sensed something was wrong. I asked them, they denied and said everything was okay and left my place. Usually, they'd text me as soon as they reached their place, letting me know that they're home. That day, I did not get any texts. So, naturally, I texted them to ask. That's when they broke up with me saying ""Don't expect anything from me. You're on your own. You ain't got shit on my conscious. Try what you want, say what you want, I don't give a f*ck."" And I was blocked. The very next day, they started seeing one of our mutual friend's cousin.

One day you care so much. The next day you don't give a f*ck. How do people change like that? If they had stopped loving me, if there was someone else, they could have told me. We were friends before everything. They could have told me and we could have ended things mutually and on a friendlier note. Why did they have to end things so badly? I begged them. I begged them to tell me what's wrong. And I regret nothing more than that. For months, I lost all sense of myself. I didn't sleep for 3-4 days at a stretch. I wasn't able to eat. I just lay in the bed and cried, when I was not sitting in the corner of my room and crying.

9 months have passed. 9 painful months. 9 miserable months. 9 months of me painting a smile on my face in front of my family and friends. But it still hurts. It pierces my heart everyday. Probably, I lament the lost friendship more than anything. Perhaps, if I hadn't told them I loved them back, things would have been different.",2022-03-23 19:41:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1638165974,11,/r/lonely/comments/tla20a/my_best_friend_is_the_reason_i_cannot_ever/,,0,0,My best friend is the reason I cannot ever believe in love.

I didn’t want to go home just yet as the day was still quite young, so I decided to ask a few friends if they wanted to go out and eat. I knew they were free— that’s why I asked them in the first place. I asked three separate friends and they all ended up declining on the invite LOL. Hey, at least I tried, right? But I’m not even going to lie, I felt so down afterwards. I ended up going to Chipotle and eating by myself, even though I was really craving for some kbbq since I hadn’t eaten it in a long time. Kbbq is better enjoyed when you’re having it with others, and so I didn’t even bother eating there by myself. I drove home afterwards feeling just… down. I haven’t had much social interaction lately with my friends and it honestly feels like I’m losing them one by one. Sometimes I’ll browse social media during my free time and I will often come across so many others out and about, having a good time with their friends. I get so jealous and end up trying to distract myself with something else.

My solitude made me my own best friend and this  fact made my expectations higher. Too high to be fair or achievable. Too high to be compatible with what i can offer.

I’m 14 gonna be 15 in a couple months. I have no friends. No social life. I’m homeschooled because I hated being alone in school and watching other people have friends and I also got bullied for a bit there. People just hated me for no reason and they had their friends groups. Now month 4 of being homeschooled and I’m seeing a bunch of tiktoks about how summer is coming and friend groups are excited to hang out. I decided to check out some popular kids from my school on tiktok and they were posting about how excited they are to hang out in big friend groups in summer. 

This is so unfair. What did I do to deserve to be such an outcast? I’ve been chronically depressed these past couple years and thought about taking my life but it’s getting harder to keep going. I could scream when I see all the kids my age hanging out. The only time I leave my house is to hand in my work at the school once a week and I hate doing it. I feel like my teenage years are being trashed by myself. The thing is I can’t make friends because in my town people are so cold and rude. It’s shitty seaside town that I hate being in. This is so unfair that I can’t even have one friend to hang out with in summer. All I do is eat to make up for having such a shit life but that makes me more depressed.

4273,tlthhr,retrodruggie,"I'll start this off by saying that I'm a freshman in college with only a month left. At the beginning of my first semester of college, during orientation, I met a boy who I instantly clicked with. We ate dinner together all the time with a group of new friends we had all met within the first week. After my first month of college, I and he were dating and very close. He was the only person I felt like I could connect with on campus. We ended up breaking up a little over a month of college and it was difficult at first because I felt lonely. His reasoning was because ""he needed to work on himself."" I became detached from the friendgroup because he was apart of it, after all he introduced me to the friendgroup. Overtime I slowly came back to the friendgroup because I wasn't having much luck meeting other people at college, despite joining clubs and talking to other students in my classes. I also decided to spend all my time on working out, piano, and homework since those are all things I enjoy (expect homework I just have to do that of course). 

2 months after we broke up, he came back telling me how much he missed me and how he regretted leaving me. I didn't expect that to happen so soon and wasn't sure what to do. In that point of my life I felt independent and stable but I was still lonely and I remembered how well we connected before. I did miss him too after all, but deep down I knew this wasn't the best idea since second chances don't always go well. After thinking it over, I decided to give him a second chance and we started dating again. At this point we were just a few weeks away from winter break so the feeling felt ""new"" again and everything in my life felt amazing. I was genuinely really happy because I felt as though I had some close friends and a new relationship and everything was going my way. After my last final I decided to trip acid with a close friend back home and it was great. I remember feeling a very strong emotion about the boy I was with. It was so intense I realized that I loved him. 

After winter break things were great, we got even closer and I would sleep over all the time. Since these things are still new to me, I never realized how much I enjoy just sleeping next to the person I love. Inevitably our relationship began to go downhill. He was going through a depression, not communicating about it to me, not focusing as much on school, and began prioritizing everyone else above me. He stopped being physically interested in me and we decided to ""take a break"" after 2-3 months of dating, again. He wanted to break up with me at first, this time because ""he felt as though we can't relate on our childhood experiences,"" but we ended up taking a break instead. 

It was different because the friend group began to fall apart and I knew I didn't have a place so I left. I'm in a sorority as well but I don't feel very connected to the girls they are just not my people. The last time he broke up with me he didn't talk/text me for the entire time he left and even though this time we were on a break, he still didn't text me. However, during the break, I learned some information I didn't know before. I found out the first time he left me was for his ex back home and he had lied to me. It was really hurtful to find out that he lied to me and during our ""break"" I find out that he met new girls with his guy friends and they all smoke weed and sleep over almost every night. I still have a tough time understanding why these people were better than me because I just wanted the best for him. 

About a month after we decided to take a break I finally texted him to break the silence and told him we needed to talk. I was going to end things because I knew he didn't want to get back with me and it was just a bad idea. He texted me back telling me that he assumed we broke up because of the silence, which upset me because I don't think that's how a breakup is supposed to go. Regardless, we finally met in person to talk. I confronted him about lying to me and told him about some of his behavior that was wrong. After an hour he started having a breakdown and crying. I felt bad because I still loved him and so I hugged him for a while when he cried. He told me he lied to me because he felt bad for leaving his ex with her mentally ill mother and absent father. Their relationship wasn't healthy but he basically said he just felt like he needed to be there for her because of her poor home life. Obviously, things didn't work out. As for why we broke up this most recent time he said it was because he felt so guilty for lying to me and for treating me bad he had to let me go. 

We had another final conversation before I unadded him on all my socials. He told me he'll ""always love me, it's just different. An appreciative type of love."" That just kills my soul to hear because I still love him and want to be with him even though I know he's not a good person. I've been through breakups before but they always hurt the same everytime and it sucks. I guess I'm jealous he gets to flourish in his new friendgroup because he can become a new persona to them. I'm alone and I eat alone all the time now. All I can really do is work on homework and get sad over the situation and my own loneliness. I feel very lost and like I don't know what to do or where to go next. I don't want to be alone for the rest of college but I'm afraid that's going to happen. Thank you for reading about my predicament I was hoping for some kind words, bits of advice, or relating experiences. Hopefully, things will get better, it's just hard to see the good sometimes.",2022-03-24 01:55:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1588792870,3,/r/lonely/comments/tlthhr/almost_done_with_my_first_year_of_college_and_i/,,0,0,Almost done with my first year of college and I feel lost/empty after a breakup

As a 25f I was in a relationship 5 years ago where I was abused and cheated on, and I still live with the trauma today. I’m such a hopeless romantic and crave affection, but I’m so scared of being hurt again that I haven’t even been on a date since that relationship. 

I tried dating apps, but as soon as I started getting attached I backed off and deleted everything. I’m trying to come to terms to being alone forever, but I’d kill for another romantic relationship just to feel wanted.

Now.my mom and dad are separated, I've had my own traumas with both of them, bad childhood ect, and so one of my younger siblings brought up a trauma event from my past, and there was an argument between me and older sister.

4291,tlwo9r,Apprehensive-Day6620,"I’m not sure where to start so I’ll kind of just go with it. To give you a little insight I’m stable mentally. I have a job I enjoy and am surrounded by good people. I’m in college and socialize/ meet a lot of people. Perspective wise, like I said I have a good out take on things. I’ve been through some of the shittiest situations in life and am grateful for everything beyond believe. Everyone says they’re attractive but I’ve genuinely been told that a lot. Of course, the girls who i want to be attracted to me usually hook up w me once then dip. Or I just get kept as a f buddy on the side. Not to be scary but I’m a sociopath so I can be pretty much who any girl wants me to be. I wear nice clothes but am humble and down to earth. I do carry myself with confidence though. I used to lead the party/ rave life and I loved it but ended up getting into legal trouble because of it which made me realize it’s not worth it. Anyways I feel like every girl I ended up with so far has just been toxic/ struggling with their own shit. I’ve been single for almost 8 years and pretty much came to the realization the all the bonds with women I considered “relationships” were just meaningless and I was just being used as a rebound. I’m only 19 so I’m young I suppose. I know there’s time for it to get better but it’s just so lonely sometimes. My only real good friends are dead, in jail somewhere, or just fucking so isolated from the same feeling that they barely leave their basements (I tend to have similar friends to me.) Point being no matter how happy you are with yourself, there will come a time when you wake up in the morning and realize that there’s no point to anything in this life if you don’t have someone to share it with. This is pretty much where I’m at right now. Lately I haven’t been hooking up with anyone because I just want a relationship at this point. I don’t care how long it lasts and if it goes down in flames in the first month. I just want the experience. I’m a lesbian so that doesn’t help (but that’s a whole other topic.) I just know that the clock is ticking and am scared shitless times gonna pass me by and I’m going to be 25-30 and still alone. That’s what shit gets really dire and I’m already feeling hopeless as it is. Money is not making me happy anymore. I’m starting to get traction off of a hobby so maybe fame would feel the void but that’s a LONG shot. I just want someone to spend some time with (because apparently sharing your life with someone is to much to ask even temporarily) and to give my heart to. Sorry this was long but I wanted to cover all of the things I feel like everyone misses when talking about the loneliness of being single (when perfectly happy and content with yourself.)

It makes me feel like I'm too boring, worthless or simply not enough for someone to at least feign interest.

Another guy saying he'd like to meet, then ghosting when I can't meet on his terms, and again with another guy. Over and over and over, I have lost count of the amount of times I've been ghosted. I always hear stories of this or that woman that has someone that goes above and beyond to be with her, nobody has ever done that for me. I've always done that for everyone else though, but I think the exhaustion of depression and constant rejection has rendered me to weak to try anymore.

I personally don’t enjoy that so I don’t engage in their gossip, but for some reason they like my personality and include me in everything (which is why I stuck around - an adopted introvert )

I felt sociable and extroverted when I talked to them and so I hung out with them for about 5 days, while still talking normally with the other group. However there’s a clear shift in attitude from the circle I was adopted in. They’re avoidant, they keep mentioning “how I don’t talk to them” which was never the case and they don’t invite me to hangout or have lunch with them anymore. I explained to them I like being a bit sociable these days and trying to talk to different people (like am I not allowed to do that) and they were like “um yeah sure “ in a sarcastic tone. now it’s really awkward and idk how to deal with shit like this.

With my friends and family, I feel like I don't have a place anymore. It took me a while to accept this feeling because as ironic as it may sound, I do hate it when a friend vents to me about this kind of thing. I usually think, ""hey, carry yourself well, we all feel that way sometimes,"" that I forget how tough that can actually feel, especially since I'm in that situation now.

Because of this, I feel ashamed, too, to be lonely. I just immerse myself in my studies to distract myself. When at the moment, I do enjoy it. In turn, I'm doing pretty well in school. In the long run, I don't find it as fulfilling as having a deep, solid connection with someone. I do think my life has gotten out of balance. It feels so so lonely. People say loneliness comes from not being able to express yourself freely, and I kinda agree. I feel trapped.

I'm also not sure if this loneliness is just part of growing up or something I have to address because I feel like my values are getting different from my friends', like we're taking diverging paths in life. I feel a little lost. Because making new friends with the same values as me now feels somewhat unfulfilling, too.

4325,tm01pn,lbrowneu,"I’ve had 3 (me and them) trio friendships. First was K-9th, second was college freshman to end of sophomore year. Third was 4th grade - beginning of junior college year. 

The first ones became ex friends because we didn’t have to same views and they stopped reaching out first. The second ones were just toxic and kept bailing on me and shit talking about me to each other. The third ones completely ditched me and they hurt the worst. 

The third were two twins. We grew up together. My family and I helped them out of almost being homeless twice. We almost adopted them. My mom and dad have paid  so much for them. Then they just ditch me? We went to different colleges but I have a friend 2 states away and we’re better friends than the two friends that were 3 hours away. The friend that’s in the other state has only been my friend for 5-6 years. The twins were 12 years. The first year of my freshman year they start bashing me all the time as a joke. My humor is mostly sarcasm and trash talking so I was like okay that’s all they’re doing. They don’t mean it. I didn’t trash talk them much because they always seemed to have something worse to come back with which hurt so I didn’t try. I started getting hurt by what they were saying so I got on my phone a bit more. They got into kpop and I didn’t. I tried to listen to songs here and there FOR THEM but I guess that wasn’t enough to show them that I cared. They made their entire personality kpop and it wasn’t mine. They’d ask me to do things related to kpop and I did here and there at first but then they never cared about my interests so I stopped. I got on my phone more. They noticed that and kept pointing it out to me and I always told them it was because they kept saying mean things to me and never did things I wanted to do. What I said didn’t matter at all but I was still at complete fault for being on my phone. This fight happened before junior year started. I transferred colleges literally mostly to have better friends (them) than my last friends at the other school and the twins begged me to come here. It was closer to home so I got to see my bf more and the drive doesn’t bother me so much so I transferred for my mental health. Their boyfriends moved in with the other twins bf and they were never home. I never was in their priorities. I asked and asked when to hang out and they kept bailing or never answering and I felt excluded and I told them that. 2-3 months in and the completely bailed on me. Everything became my fault. They never called or texted or came over. I literally live in the same apartment complex as them. Not once have they come by. 

I miss them so much. I literally have no friends anymore close by. The friends I do have are always busy or lives far away. I feel so lonely and hurt and I feel like no one cares about me. No one ever reaches out to me. I get so depressed over it. Idk what to do anymore. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it but keeps saying. “You’re not poor” “you don’t have a horrible life” “ you have me” so he doesn’t understand it.

I crave the comfort of just coming home, putting my stuff down and doing whatever I want. Most of the time I play video games but sometimes I'm so tired I just pass out on the couch under a blanket, only getting up to eat dinner and take a shower.

I am depressed, 100%. But the feeling I get after hanging out with friends tears me down I guess that's why I don't want to see them anymore. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but I feel so far behind when it comes to my peers I frankly feel pathetic. 

And that's what hurts the most. I feel pathetic beyond measure. My job is a joke. I don't even earn minimum wage, I spend most of my salary on gas to get stuff for the shop I work in and I work in retail so I spend most of my time fake smiling and laughing just to appease customers. My love life? Non-existent. If I don't get rejected straight away it's always the same pattern!

I think something is wrong with my brain. I just can’t imagine having a friend anymore, let alone several.

Really sucks to be lonely. I was fine with it for a long time, but as I get older fantasy and escapism don’t work as well. But when I am among people I just can’t do anything to move forward. All I feel is discomfort and all I can think to say is some boring shit.

I don’t know if that can be fixed or helped, probably not. I’ll probably die alone and for some reason it now scares me. Seeing all these old people walking around with dogs is depressing. Retirement home one day? Awful.

I was never praised for my achievements (of which I have many, I know it sounds arrogant but this is only for context) just told to do even better next time and if I failed, I would receive the verbal lashing of a lifetime.

19 years later, I am a selfish cynical asshole who is afraid of emotional intimacy and uncomfortable with physical touch. To make things even more pathetic, lately, when I pretend to be mentally ill, it's oddly comforting. That's terrible isn't it?

Yet I crave for someone to understand me and love me, but due to my underdeveloped emotional intelligence, I can never put my feelings into words.

This has led me to be a faker. I can act friendly and even charming at times, but in truth I am very lonely. Because of this, any attractive person who shows me the least but of attention, I give my whole loyalty to them, in case of women I fall in ""love"" with them.

For the first months I actually really enjoyed having some time just for myself and to recharge my batteries but now it just hurts getting to work on Monday again knowing everyone will be talking about their great weekends and parties they had and I can’t add anything to it.

4390,tmwnl4,Extreme-Cut840,"I know this won’t get any attention, and I don’t really want any. I know that sounds weird, but I just wanted to share what I’ve been through. I’m not looking for any new friends, for reasons explained later if you read that far. (Also sorry for shitty grammar, I’m pretty retarded.)

So, on with the “story” now. It started when I had to move to Texas because of my dad’s job, which I was not very excited about. The move from Virginia to Texas was a massive change in my life, and that’s when everything started going downhill. Due to the sadness of leaving my life-long home in Virginia, I stopped eating as much and still don’t for some reason. I did make a lot of friends, met the bully, who I’ll just call “Ass” and was having a pretty below average time, until the divorce. My parent’s divorce completely changed the way I thought and lived. I stopped making friends, stopped talking to people, and that’s when the minor self-harm started with my fingernails. After the divorce, my dad, the one with the job, stopped helping us pay for the house. The bullying from Ass got worse and worse, and I couldn’t defend myself due to anxiety and being just weak overall. My mom, who I decided to stay with, thought of moving into an RV due to money issues. Then the move to the RV happened, and I just didn’t know how to feel about it. 

Ass still bullied me by stabbing me with pencils, kicking me, and picking me up and throwing me due to my tiny frame from under-eating. This led to my severe PTSD, so I have a huge fear of being around potential people to meet, due to not wanting to go through the same experience with Ass. One day, I really lost all hope I had. So I was on Discord, with the remaining friends I had, and gave one of them admin over my server. This short part may seem stupid, but I was traumatized by Ass. So my best, most trustworthy friend, whom I granted the admin, started to do a “minuscule amount of trolling.” He made a rival server, planned an attack using bots, made a shitty diss track, and called my server corrupt and garbage due to my lack of trust in most people, while all my other friends were against me too. This is what caused me to lose 8 friends, which were all I had. That event evolved my PTSD tenfold, and caused my self-harm to become more rampant, using sharp objects. After that school year ended, my mom decided to put the RV to use, and take a trip across the country. Although I had escaped Ass, I still had to be cooped up with my sister and mom, which was not ideal for me. The trip was nice, and I am still on that very trip, but my mental health has been deteriorating. I don’t know how to feel, as I am having violent dreams and ideas of hurting others, but that goes against my own morals. I don’t know if I’m the victim, or I’m the reason of how I am. It’s just confusing, and I had to put this somewhere. 

I shortened this a lot, excluding a view major details for privacy of course, but I hope at least one person understands a little. 

TLDR: Got bullied, developed quite a few mental issues, and parents got divorced. I moved into an RV, having to be cooped up with my mom and sister. My mental health rapidly deteriorated, and still is.

Anyway, thanks for reading to anybody who got this far.

4396,tmzbu6,RelatableMolaMola,"I have noticed several posts in here from OPs who have been trying to strike up conversations and make connections with people but not getting good responses. Most of the time, these OPs don't really know why people aren't receptive to them, and so default to believing that it's because of the way they look or other superficial reasons.

Sometimes it may be due to appearance, but in my experience, there are also many things people do that will put strangers off, no matter how hygienic and well dressed and generally acceptable looking you are. So here are some do's and don'ts that I put together based on years of observation and being on the receiving end of conversation starting attempts. Maybe this will help some of you guys!

DO: Limit your conversational attempts to people that are already in your immediate vicinity. So let's say you're at a coffee shop. Starting a conversation with someone who's already sitting near you is going to feel much more natural to them than being approached by some random person who crossed the entire room to say hello.

DON'T: Try to start a conversation with someone that you have to cross a large distance to talk to, UNLESS there was already some eye contact and sign of receptivity (like they smiled at you or something). Sorry, but it looks really fucking weird to be approached out of the blue by some person who came across an entire room or open space just to talk to you.

DO: Limit your conversational attempts to just one person. If the person is not receptive, call it a day in that location. It looks really fucking weird if some person is just wandering around a space trying to talk to random people. (Exception being if you're at a party or a bar or club, but even then, try not to look too desperate to find someone to talk to.)

DON'T: Go up to multiple people one after the other trying to start something. It looks desperate and creepy. People notice that shit. You don't want to be That Person that others are warning each other about. 

DO: Strike up a conversation by making a comment about something that you and the other person have in common. For example, if you're both at some kind of group event, make a comment about something happening at the event. If they're wearing or carrying something that shows they have a shared interest with you, make a comment about that.

DON'T: Start the conversation by asking personal questions out of nowhere (like what's your name, are you from around here, do you live near here, etc.). A lot of guides on making conversation will tell you to ask the other person about themselves. This does NOT mean to give them the third degree, especially about things like where they live or work. If the conversation that you started about a general topic or shared interest is going well, you can introduce yourself and then ask their name after a while. Not right at the beginning.

And one last DON'T: DON'T make comments to the other person that make it sound like you've been watching or taking notes on them. This has happened to me several times and to other people I know as well. When someone that I have never noticed or spoken to before in my life somehow knows that I often go to such-and-such place for lunch or that I like to take walks here at X time of day or week, that is just immediately creepy. Yes, people often notice each other, especially when their habits or routines coincide. No, they don't need to comment on that right when they meet. It really makes it sound like they're borderline stalking.

Hopefully this helps someone!",2022-03-24 19:45:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643169231,30,/r/lonely/comments/tmzbu6/dos_and_donts_of_striking_up_conversations_with/,,1,5,Do's and don'ts of striking up conversations with strangers

4431,tn8ggn,Independent_Runner,"I think I’ve always been a lonely person. Even when around other people. Ive never actually had that strong of a connection with many people. 

I think this stems from my romantic relationships that I’ve had/the relationships I witnessed growing up. And maybe someone else can relate to this.
I think most of my life I saw the negative aspects of what relationships were. So I would typically jump into what I thought were the “good” parts. I would hold on to them even if they were tiny and possibly insignificant parts. 

I’ve been in two very serious relationships and both started extremely quickly. Is this a result of being lonely? Do we quickly rush into things to avoid that feeling? Is this a bad thing? 

I had a talk with a friend about loneliness. How that manifests for other people. 
For him, he questions everything. Nothing feels safe for him. For me, I rush into a lot of things. My last relationship started day 2 of us meeting. I fell for her instantly and told her I loved her day 3 and she said it back. (Uhaul lesbian Love is blind style lol) we were in a relationship for 3 years and almost married. He said I was absolutely insane. And that it wasn’t true love. 

But we stayed together So can’t be horrible right? I guess my question is…the way loneliness shows up in my life vs the way it shows up in everyone else’s, is there a right or wrong way to be lonely? Am I crazy for being the type to not want that? I know some people are comfortable in that space.

4432,tn8q4t,BlackDog94,"-One year ago my closest and dearest friend screwed me over really hard and I simply couldn't handle that friendship anymore, despite a decade of being my closest friend.

-I became a little bitter after that and I ended up being a toxic person to some of my friends, the ones that backed up when my friend had screwed me over. They decided that they wouldn't feel comfortable around me anymore and I agree with their decision, I deserve it. But now I don't have those friends anymore and even other friends who have forgiven me and still talk to me hang out with them so i barely exist around that circle anymore. They used to be my daily hang out on discord, some irl too. Now it's gone. 

-The few (few which I mean 1?) friend I have left to talk daily have a very different mind and values they I have so lots of things in this relationship don't work. We are good presences for each other, for now, but just that friend isn't enough for me, specially after having had all those close, comfortable to be around, friends in the past. 

-I'm on my fourth year of collage without having made a single friend. Which is okay because I do not like what I'm graduating in and those people around me seem so shallow and mean. Not in a edgy way of my part and not in a bully way if theirs, I just wouldn't be able to connect with any of them not even if i tried really hard and lowered my standards . I would also need to change my whole personality for them to even give me a social chance with any of them. 

-I said I was on my fourth year but I should be finishing it already but I'm dumb and had to repeat lots of classes. I can get a job without graduating and I'm almost hitting my 30s, being from a poor family, unemployed and useless. 

-One of my favorite hobbies was drawing but I'm terrible at it and for this whole year I couldn't make a single drawing worth of anything even for my standards. I can't practice feeling this way that I'm feeling but if i want to one day draw something that I won't feel ashamed of I should be doing that daily. I don't. 

-There's this girl that I kinda like since 2019, but it was just a crush. This year she broke up with her ex and we ended up getting a lot closer, I know she came for me because she knew I had something for her and she wanted some comfort after the break up but I don't feel comfortable taking advantage of her vulnerability. At the same time some time had passed and we are already getting disconnected from on another and I don't know how to get closer to her again, to know her more and do things together. She's very reclusive and I don't want to bother, and every single little interaction I feel like that, even tho she's the one that starts conversation with me sometimes. But, as of it now, I know she doesn't have any feelings for me and I sincerely can't see me having a single chance with her anymore. 

I was not a happy person but all of these things that happened in the spawn of a year had broken me apart. I don't want it to keep falling a part. Today I've woken up very happy because I was going out with that friend of mine on a trip but she cancelled and I was really looking forward for it the whole week. College resumes Monday and I don't know when or if we'll have another opportunity because of some personal stuff. 

My parents are still alive but they are not of good health, I just hope things stop for a second to get worse and worse and for a year things go up hill but I can't see that happening because idk what to do. I live in a very very small town and every day seems the same, but something out of nowhere happens and it makes it worse then repeat. Will good days come and stay for a bit of consistency? I can't take this anymore, I know nothing of this is major but I really am not happy being alive for so many days of the past years and for a whole year I wasn't happy a single fucking day. Is it worth a life like that when you feel like that? 

This is just a vent. Sorry.",2022-03-24 23:37:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1396545598,2,/r/lonely/comments/tn8q4t/life_seems_to_be_going_downhill_for_quite_some/,,0,0,Life seems to be going downhill for quite some time

4434,tn9cnf,SUPERSAAB222,"I have nothing left to try and be friends with anyone. I am tired of being betrayed and kicked to the curb. I am a hard worker but this is too much. I need someone who understands sitting around a fire not saying a word just being happy to be around me. But that won't happen. I recently moved back to the city and maybe its good as where i was i had endless access to the mountains and wilderness in the north.

I found myself wandering farther and farther getting lost more than once and i realized any more wandering i would be lost beyond lost. Lost forever. But no one would know. Yet it was beautiful wandering in forests in winter covered in snow. Falling asleep under a tree under the night sky in 0 degree temps was so peaceful so soothing. I remember feeling this heavy feeling of sleep once in a snowstorm and i quickly got up as i knew what that sleep would lead to. But deep down i wanted that permanent rest, free from uncaring people and maybe if one person did care slightly they would find me asleep and hopefully learn to love the next person as much as they could. But i couldn't quit. I never will. Maybe One day i will return in my old age and wander but never find my way back. To be a part of that peace permanently. Build a cabin where no one will find me. The ending to Call Of The Wild sums up what i want. Right by a river. Only the animals will know my story.

What will i do now? I write music that tells a story in my own secret code. One i built with someone who i thought cared but didn't. 

What will i do now? I will keep working physically.

What will i do now? I will stop existing mentally. I will stop trying to impress. I will keep caring in little ways to help people but accept i will never get that in return....

To those that did care and read this. Thank you for the little love you showed. I don't hate you but i wish you didn't lie.

To those that read this i hope you find your special someone in life or group to hang with and watch the stars at night. I hope you find someone to laugh at a inside joke with or look each other in the eyes for minutes reading and sharing love and kindness. 

To those that read this find your fire to keep going. Find your fire and share it with others. Roast some marshmallows with them and never forget it.

I wish i had someone to talk to despite having family they just don't understand and don't try. 
I am a alien in my own home. 

But i won't quit on life itself. I will keep living with all my strength. Maybe be a hero one day to someone. But i won't hand out my heart anymore so it gets handed back in pieces.

Cheers, Thank you.

Now more than ever,
I understand how to love you,

how to live our romantic fantasies,
as we’d once intended to.

But alas, we both were troubled,
heartfelt, and naive.

If I knew then what I know now,
perhaps now we’d be healing.

How headstrong were we,
for holding on so long.

If only ignorance were curable
without, first, severing bonds.

I wasn’t missing out on anything,
staying with my first.

I assumed our case was futile.
Now my daily thoughts are cursed.

Our intimacy was unmatched,
the connection truly special.

All things that I couldn’t see,
‘til I saw other people.

A few key moments without you,
was all I truly needed.

Now I have the skeleton key
for a lock that’s been defeated.

Oh how ignorant I was,
to close so many future doors.

My trials were trivial and problems fake.
My heart was truly yours.

This other server started becoming more active recently. Now it is just as active as our main server. They voice chat there when they dont want me and Nate in there. Ive been advocating for months about it. I don't want leave this group because I have several real friends amd I go to a very small school so there are little options for school. So Ik when they are in VC together because on Steam they will all conviently log on the same game at the same time. What a coincidence.

Any time I make a good connection with someone and an actual friendship develops, at some point down the road they pack up and leave town to an entirely new area code (or in one case, an entirely different country). Don’t get me wrong, I want to see my pals succeed so if that means relocating then so be it. But this has been the case with most of my good friends over the course of my life. I routinely hear, “at least you’ll have places to visit!” which yea, is only cool when you have the time and money which I don’t. 

I’m friend-ish with some people from work but I prefer to draw that professional/social line that would best not be crossed these days.

But wait there’s more… I have a mild chronic illness (a mostly invisible one) that during the times I have a flare, it’s embarrassing and I’d just rather isolate myself and hide away from the world until I feel better, because who wants to hang out with a cranky, miserable B who is in a buttload of pain?

4473,tndowm,Basil_spice,"To make a long sad story short, back in August 2021, I relapsed self harm; it was bad. worse than when I was in high school. 
It ended with me and the love of my life breaking up. I dropped out of college and went into a residential treatment center.
Now it's months later, and I move halfway across the country. I'm still in an outpatient program, and so I do see other people in treatment. 
But I can't make friends, and every time people get close, I shut down. I'm so scared of people. So I'm alone when not in treatment. I'm just in my apartment with my cat, and I feel like shit all the time.
I don't always have the energy to play with my cat, and I worry that he'll start to hate me, and then I'll be truly alone.
My brain keeps saying it'll all be better if I hurt myself, and all this treatment won't work, so I should give up. I hate it. It's not true. I've come so far, I'm 135 days self harm free, but I find myself walking to the razor sections in stores and I couldn't stop thinking about the best ways to band aid shit on a budget. 
I have no one to call. I have no one to sit with me and distract me from this shit. psyically sit with me. Online conversations make me feel worse and even more empty.

I miss self harm and I'm scared of myself I can't go back into residential. I just wish I was normal.

I reach out and try to fit in and then get ridiculed on public chat apps like Discord, I sit in voice chats alone and then have two people join who are more interested in each other than me.

I thought I managed to get some friends, but when I had to take a mini break for a week, none of them messaged me or even talked about me. I'm just there to make some jokes on the side and say interesting facts. Like a weird piece of furniture. I'm not important to them at all. Not memorable enough to desire when I'm gone. It just completely gutted me.

I'm at the point where I feel like I should just post my socials somewhere and just schedule calls, like some sort of job. Like a call for half an hour at dinnertime once a week or something. Some sort of weird telehealth appointment offshoot, pretty much. Maybe the appointment-like quality will help with some of the nervousness, and a future appointment can be scheduled if both of us are happy with the conversation, cancelled anytime or rescheduled anytime for any reason. I only know how to ask people questions about their life and interests though. I have no idea anymore on how to hold a day to day, regular conversation.

When I went to college I thought maybe starting over in a new place that wasn’t a small town reputation type of place it would work better. I had three cool roommates and made some good friends. Then one of my roommates broke up with her bf of two years. So I invited her to hang out with my friends to get it off her mind. The first week or so she didn’t engage much, but was happy for some company. Then after that she started to feel better and came out of her shell. We all hung out together and things were good, until out of nowhere she says that she is super into one of the guys in my friend group and he’s reciprocated the feelings. This is like two weeks after breaking up with her because that she had made marriage plans with, so I was a little wary and warned her to take a bit. She agreed and said they had discussed and decided to wait at least three months then check how feelings were to see if they still wanted to date. Two more weeks and they’re dating, and everyone in the friend group is worried and thinks they are moving way too fast. Two more weeks and they are all over each other and saying I love yours, and all the friends are having serious talks with them against this. Then we have Thanksgiving break and we all go home for a week. Five days into the break my friend calls me sobbing that she doesn’t have feelings for him. I console her and we agree that she should be honest with him, and that she was probably confused and used him as a rebound. We expect hurt from him, but know that he was also moving too fast and pushed her to say ilys before she was ready and such and was generally pushy so it didn’t help. He’s very upset with her and starts talking bad about her behind her back and is incredibly rude. I approach him about it and we seem to come to an understanding, but then he continues. I approach him again and tell him that yes, she was at fault, but so was he, that two weeks of dating shouldn’t have love involved anyway etc. basically I defended her, losing a friend in the process. The drama of the situation seemed to turn over the entire friend group and by the time Christmas break came around the friend group dissolved, but my roommate and I remained quite close. We have a pretty long break for Christmas and don’t go back till February, and I thought it would be a good emotional break from everything. But then my roommate started talking about another guy friend she’d made at college. Once again we discussed how she should wait and make sure she was emotionally ready. Hint: she didn’t. Two weeks after we get back and they are dating. And suddenly I never see her anymore. She’s suddenly best friends with one of her new flings female friends. Guess she just uses girls to get to guys.

4568,tntpzu,TheTidark390,"I'm 19years old, I have never had fell any love to anyone, and when I did it took me sooo long to tell them.

But one day I cracked, I told them, they also had feelings but they weren't sure it was a good idea as they just had a break up 2 months ago and they didn't felt ready... 
We ended up kissing 2 days later, trying to love eatchother not matter how hard it would be, I would have done everything to not make her feel stressed.

3days after my brithday we spoke about future, moving out together, family? Love stuff... we had small chats, and I asked her how they where doing, told me that it wasn't that great  but that time would help... 
The day after I asked them again how they where doing and not to hide it... and that when they told me they wish they never said to me that they loved me, I knew what was coming  we chose to talk front to front the next day.
The next day we went to the same place we talked the first time, and that was it, my heart was rushing, knowing what was about to happen, I couldn't believe it.
We left on our ways, I was alone, nothing made sense, an empty feeling in my chest, like I just lost everything. 
We talked later on, it gaved me hope, we spoke that we could retry one day if we still had the flame running for eatchother, it gaved me so much hope... 
And now that hope is lost burried under hundreds if not thousands of regrets. Receving a message telling you that they had been feeling so much better since they left me. Dreams where broken, the empty in my chest grows bigger every seconds.
I lost the love of my life, my first true love, and now I'm back alone, completly alone, family can't talk with them whitout being hurt, best friend as been so distant, and now I lost all hope for my love...

Time goes by, you heal a little. You meet a new person. And the whole thing happens again. Over and over till your last breath is gone.

Why is it like this? Why won't anyone love me or wanna stay friends with me? Ik im better than a lot of people out there with successful relationships and friendships ...is it because I'm ugly? Is it? Or is it because I care too much? But then, you can never care too much for someone.

There are some who post pics of their other friends on their birthdays as status but not mine. However I am a decent looking Indian 20 year old male. Most of the time they just demand help from me in studies or beg for some other favour, otherwise they rarely talk. There is a girl whom I liked but she has a boyfriend and still wants another boyfriend at the same time. I feel guilty for not valuing myself and falling for characterless girls still I can't help it since I am craving love. But since I am single and not getting love the way I want, I feel hatred towards everyone. I feel like cutting off all contacts but can't since I need updates on study/work.

My father only has stories related to work, study and machines to tell me while my mother only has spiritual sufferings to cry over. According to them I must study, work, endure, suppress my desires    ( emotional,romantic and sexual) but still stay happy. Nobody understands my feelings.

I am a good artist who paints well but my so called friends rarely appreciate my artworks even when they aren't busy.

I am a masturbation addict and I have become very lusty and frustrated. I cannot live normally until I get the attention, love, and respect I deserve.

You can tell me about your favorite or newest hobby, about your favorite book, or you could even vent to be about what a dork Bill from accounting was this week. (Darn Bill!)

Incase you'd like a sense of who I am, here's some fun facts about me:

* I live in the midwestern region of the USA.
* My favorite food is pasta. Just give me noodles plus an absurd amount of sauce and I'll usually be happy.
* My newest hobby is game development. Very early into this, but I'm learning a lot!
* Sadly I have no pets... Not allowed to have them where I live but I'm real close to sneaking a dog into the situation.

4609,to48cb,Constant-Spinach-326,"19, female. I grew up with strict parents that couldn’t afford to put me in extracurriculars so I only went to school and came home. I was always praised by teachers since I was so quiet. Now I’m in uni, have social anxiety, socially awkward and have made no friends. It doesn’t help that there’s a pandemic so I stay home everyday to keep my parents safe. I have one best friend but I introduced her to my other friend and it seems like they are closer than we are which makes me sad. That friend I had also made fun of me for my awkwardness which is why I decline hanging out with my best friend because she wants to invite her even though she knows I don’t like her. I was at my other “best friend”‘s bday party and she drunkenly told me “I like you better when you’re drunk, I wish you weren’t so quiet and talked more”. I’ve heard this from others as well. When lockdown hit, I worked on myself and glowed up - fixed my posture, started wearing clothes that flattered me, wore makeup, and I was called pretty for the first time. I’ve never had people actually want to talk to me before - people would only talk to me to get close with my best friend or if they wanted to date her. So now idk how to act when people wanna actually talk to me and get to know me. I grew up ugly so I would get asked out as a joke and I have only 1 guy friend. I fear the awkwardness that comes with hugs, handshakes and any physical touch but at night when I’m laying in bed I actually think about how nice it would be to have someone to cuddle with. 

Everyone says to join clubs in uni but my interests include things like dance and painting and I don’t feel like I’m good enough to join a legit club where there’s people who have been dancing since they were 3 and majoring in art. Made friends in classes but when the class is over we don’t keep in contact. I also don’t have the energy to respond to people on Snapchat and I feel like there’s a pressure to look your best when snapping. I also feel like if I have something to say, it’s not interesting enough so I won’t say it/snap my friends. I want to find life-long friends but don’t know how since I live in a town where everyone knows everyone.

I feel like I need to develop a personality as well. I don’t really know what people are up to - I know everyone is a fan of marvel, anime etc but I’m not into those mainstream things so I find it hard to find common interests with people when I meet them and to talk to them about. I feel like a child in an adult body because I watch old Disney shows and cartoons and the bachelor. I spend my time either creating content (I’m an aspiring content creator and don’t want to sit at a desk job for the rest of my life and want to do smth fun while making enough to take care of my parents) or studying. Any advice on how to develop a personality, not be socially awkward and have things to talk about?",2022-03-25 22:40:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1641972051,3,/r/lonely/comments/to48cb/how_to_develop_a_personality_backstoryventseeking/,,0,5,how to develop a personality? backstory/vent/seeking advice

I’ve been married for a while now, 5 year this June. I’ve been questioning if it’s the right thing for a while now, after she has said some pretty brutal things to me - but we’ve got a little one, and I lost my job to the pandemic and we can’t find daycare. So I’ve been without a job for nearly two years. 

She comes home from her work (nursing) and doesn’t want to spend time together most days. She doesn’t want me to make plans with people because she needs my help with our toddler (who I’ve spent an entire 13 hour day alone with) and just wants to play on her phone or watch tv (or fall asleep).

I had to text her tonight to let her know I was painfully lonely and very bored. She told me to go play video games, then stopped responding to anything I said over text or in person, until it was time to put the little one to bed. Then she asked me why I “seem so grumpy.”

I’ve voiced to her multiple times in the last few weeks that I’m wrestling with suicidal ideation, chronic loneliness and just plain misery. Somehow she always manages to give a shallow apology and then move on. Usually later in the same day asking why I’m “sad or grumpy.”

I feel trapped, isolated, unloved and completely invisible most days.

4666,tofmlo,Flyaway_5,"I still remember this incident that happened 12 years ago and it still bothers me today. I just can't let this go. In high school, I went on this trip to England, Ireland, and Wales with some classmates and teachers. On the plane going home, I was wearing a bracelet that I had bought while I was there on the trip. It was almost the same color as a rubber band, but it wasn't a rubber band. It was also a little thicker than a rubber band and had a design on it.

My teacher saw the bracelet, and she knows my dad's occupation, which is a surgeon, and my mom is a stay at home single mom. I felt like she was jealous of me, because she knows my dad is rich and my mom didn't work. She said, ""Are you wearing a bracelet?"" I said, ""Yes."" She said, ""I just thought it was a rubber band.""

This remark bothered me so much and I saw it as offensive and insulting. I remember thinking like, ""What the **** was that supposed to mean?"" Why would she ask me if it was a bracelet and say thatshe thought it was a rubber band? My own interpretation of her inquiry was that it was as if she was thinking, ""If your dad's a surgeon, then why are you wearing a rubber band for a bracelet, because only poor kids would wear rubber bands as bracelets?""

Was I just giving this more meaning there needed to be? And viewed it as a problem when it really isnt a problem? Because I tend to take everything that is said to me in the wrong way? Was this some blatant remark that doesn't need even a 5 second thought?",2022-03-26 03:12:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1601518649,2,/r/lonely/comments/tofmlo/was_this_an_insult/,,0,3,Was this an insult?

4674,toglmd,gildedpotus,"I’ve been in the mental hospital 3 times in the little over a year for severe anxiety and depression. I’m not sure why, but in 2021 I ended up going inpatient for anxiety that wouldn’t end and my life hasn’t been the same since. My 3rd trip in the hospital I would wake up not even caring about being lonely, but just hating existing so much I would just think only suicidal thoughts, but I knew I couldn’t do that to myself or my family. But it really was hell. I was even looking into ECT where they induce a seizure into your brain to help depression which can have big side effects. In these times, the only that could sort of help was talking to people - other patients or staff.

By a stroke of luck I met a girl during this time inpatient and my medication seemed to be helping at least some. We had common interests in board/card games and started dating when we both got out of the hospital. For the first time in a long time I experienced what it felt like to be physically close to someone, cuddle, kiss, etc. She very quickly was saying things about a long term relationship which I should have known was a red flag, but in my position where I was in hell for so long I didn’t really care. But soon, she realized she didn’t wanna be committed, and in fact didn’t want to be in a relationship at all, and this switch was so fast and jarring it hurt me a lot. One of her disorders is BPD, and I guess these people can be prone to relationship difficulties just like this. We tried to stay friends, but even that was too difficult for me, and I kept getting hurt, and she called me emotionally too sensitive for catching feelings when she still wanted to do things like hold hands/cuddle but not get attached... I wanted to try but it wasn’t possible for me, Everyone in my life told me this person was manipulative and gaslighting and not good for me and after a few more times of trying to make it work I realized it couldn’t and cut off all communication. This was devastating to me of course but I knew it had to be done because everyone including me saw a toxic pattern. 

But this was someone I could hold, who wanted to play cuphead with me, someone I could watch a movie with and a girl who liked me. I didn’t realize how motivating all of that could be and help me through even the most severe of my bouts of depression. And it all happened and vanished so quickly.

It just meant so much to me that someone cared enough to want to message me everyday, who wanted my presence and just liked me for who I was. And now I look back and it just seems like her side of the interest was just part of her disorder or whatever, and I got mistreated and always was made to feel like everything was my fault. So it all feels false in a way, and I had to block her on everything and she’s out of my life

All in all, I guess it’s good I had the experience, because how much it hurt me made me realize how lonely I have been and how I’ve been running away from that because of fear of rejection I’ve just withdrawn for many years and focused on other things, but all the while I think I’ve been desperately seeking validation - especially romantically and feel like I have failed so dramatically. I just feel like a pathetic person, trying to get the attention of others but feeling unworthy, or incapable of absorbing it somehow.

I don’t know why but I feel alone even around my friends and family. I feel like I can’t speak my mind. I don’t find myself interesting so why would someone else? And to have a connection with someone also dealing with mental struggles, be made to feel like they were very invested, and saying unprompted things like “I’m not going anywhere” etc, only for them to not want that anymore and have to cut them out is so painful. 

And now I just feel like nothing… I don’t know how to meet someone that can make me feel like that again. I think the painful truth is I have to work on myself first before I can try a relationship again. I am lucky that I have friends but I feel like I can’t speak what I’m really thinking, I even feel alone with them most of the time. I don’t want to die without a healthy relationship. There have been times where my depression has been bad enough I really think there is a risk I could die before that happens by my own hand, but that also serves as motivation for me. But it’s such a lonely road to walk, when my depression already makes me feel disconnected. I am just hoping I have another stroke of luck and taking care of myself the best I can. I have been doing daily exercise and sticking to a schedule, etc. and I do think I’m doing a bit better but I just feel so empty compared to when I was with that girl, even if it was not the right one, and it’s made me feel like I’ve wasted so much time. And I didn’t even meet her of my own will, it was just lucky we were both in the same place at the same time, more or less forced to interact. I have no idea how I could create this scenario in the real world, with anxiety, self doubt and more freedom. How do you even meet people? I find myself annoyed by everyone, including myself, but I am so alone. Why am I like this? How can I change this?

I’ll never forget one night with her I randomly just felt horrible, and I was just crying for no reason, and she told me “I’ve never known someone so depressed they don’t even know why they’re sad, but I’ll be here for you when you’re like that” and it meant so much to me and by the end of the night my mood had turned around. And how it all turned out makes me realize how empty those words were, and how little I meant to her.

But it also makes me realize I think loneliness is a core part of this depression. I so desperately want to reach out to those around me and connect, but it’s like I hate everyone and myself too much at the same time. I so desperately want a romantic connection, but I am so insecure and feel I have nothing to offer. I feel like a shell of a person who will be stuck like this because I’m too empty for anyone to bother filling up.",2022-03-26 04:11:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597381047,2,/r/lonely/comments/toglmd/i_just_need_to_share_my_experience_with/,,0,2,I just need to share my experience with loneliness and my depression.
4675,togmq9,Person96,"I think I might have been cursed or something. I can't explain what happened. I'm not sure when it happened either, but I genuinely think something happened that changed who I was. Who I am. In my 8 years since entering University, I have not made a single friend. Someone who I can rely on. Someone who genuinely wants to know more about me. Someone who...who wants to help me for once. I don't know if that person exists or I'm just living in a fantasy, but they say there's always someone out there for everyone. So why the hell can't I find them?

In the beginning, I made friends. Hell, I had a group that I actually talked to. The one girl, her name was Kat, that I met during my first year of uni I considered a friend as well. She'd tease me. I'd tease her. The group I was with all decided to go out for drinks at the end of the year. I had a group of people I talked to. At the time, I considered them friends despite never seeing them or talking to them outside of uni. This continued in the three schools I've attended. I've met so many people but have not seen any of them outside of school. That, coupled with a bunch of shit at home that still haunts me to this day whenever I close my eyes, have made me cynical and feel like an outsider to everyone. I don't know when it happened, but one day something just clicked and I realized that I never did have any true friends. Only one person in my life has ever bothered to ask how I was doing. How I felt. Maybe it was too much for her, because even now I feel like I'm a bother to her. She's in another city, living her life and being happy and I'm over here bothering her whenever I feel the urge to talk to someone. Even then I don't consider her a friend anymore. Why? Because I initiate every conversation. Every interaction is because I want to use her voice for a song or a voice over or something. Then, it's back to silence.

I feel like an outsider to everything. To everyone. I feel like the only thing I have in this world are my parents. My family. But I'm away from them because I want to make money so I can repay back everything they've done for me in my 25 years. I want to give them a life where they don't have to worry about anything and they can go about their business without any stress.

But is it so hard to ask that I want at least someone to support me a bit? To say that they're proud of me? To comfort me when I get like this? To hug me and stroke my hair while they tell me it's going to be alright? That's all I want.

Even as I write this, I'm doubting myself. ""Oh, you have people you talk to! What about today? That pleasant conversation you had with your group mate with whom you were forced to work with? What about that guy that always talks to you but never see outside of class? What about your parents who are still working to still support you while you grow tired, weak, more damaged, and stressed and bullshit your way through university so you can finally repay them back for all they've done for you? You have so many people already.""

So, why do I still feel alone? Why do I insist on writing this shit? No one's going to read this. No one's going to listen to your sob story. Your plea for pity. Your self wallowing. You're not worth anyone's time. It's best if you just shut up and do your work. Because that's all your good for. You're meant to serve everyone else. You're not meant to see your own happiness. To experience what it's like for someone to ask how you're doing. To take an interest in you.

As a child I was still introverted but had many friends now I’m looking at myself and I know my younger self would be disappointed in me. I’ve been alone for a very long time now and it’s gotten to the point where even when people talk to me I don’t expect them to ask anything more than a question and always plan 10 different responses to questions people might not ever ask. I talk to myself more than I talk to anyone currently. It’s been so long since I’ve had a day where I haven’t felt lonely that I don’t remember the feeling of being social. I work at Amazon and being relatively younger compared to most of the people that work there I had a lot of time to myself thinking and thinking. Being so lonely has caused me to casually strike up a conversation with myself. Sometimes it’s a simple conversation and other times it’s can get really heated even though it’s only me. I usually feel depressed and my low self esteem has lead me to heavily self deprecate. I would offer argue with myself during my 12 hour shifts on moments of my life and how I do the same thing over and over. Once it’s got so bad, it felt as though I got sucked into a black hole of nihilism. There’s people I’m supposed to be close with but they don’t check up on me unless they wanna go out or hang out and which case it’s usually me spending the money. I don’t even want to get into past relationship. I’ve just be lonely for so long that I don’t know how I was before.

I'm a high school student from Singapore who is going to graduate soon (Early May) and I really don't want to attend the ceremony because it's the day when friends come together, take group photos and celebrate the last moments of high school together and I realized that I don't have a group of friends and not even one. It's just going to be painful seeing people laughing and enjoying this day. I just cannot wait to get my grad certificate and get the F out of there. 

Well, to be honest I had tried very hard to make friends since Day 1 but no one seemed interested in making friends with me. I took the initiative to introduce myself and got myself out there to socialize but it seemed like nobody cared. The worst part was when cliques were already formed within the first few weeks of school, which made it harder for me to form friendships. Group work was the worst because the teacher allowed the class to choose their own groupmates and I always ended up being the ""leftover"" and had to join the cliques. I'm just so afraid that I'll be this lonely in university as well.

4733,tomdiy,DIED_FOR_YOUR_SINS,"So i just went on a date with a girl. All was well until we were a few drinks in and then she lets slip that she was on datings app( we met on there ) to play with dudes as it lets her feel like she has control over something in her life.

Then proceeds to tell me that there were at least 10 other dudes she was talking to on the same level as me, meaning that they got her number and were asking her out and what not. Even said she enjoys it when boys spend money to meet her.

I have never felt so digusted and disappointed in my life. 

She told me she enjoys acting multiple personas to bait different guys. So i was led to believe in a lie.. 

At least i kept a straight face throughout the night and the day ended amicably.

But i cannot stop thinking of how utterly callous she was. 

To say that kinds of things in front of me and to even say it was her entertainment. It makes me sick to even think other girls on dating apps or even irl would even share any similarity to her wicked state of mind.

That thought really terrifies me. I wish i wasnt so lonely and eager for relationship and that i can dissociate from the desire of romantic connection. Its so fucked up that another human being, one supposedly diagnosed with clinical depression can think so little of other people feelings.

Idk why, maybe i was naive to believe that she was genuinely interested in me from our texts and convos...

4738,ton4m9,SonataSprings,"So, my wife of 4 years and I will probably be getting a divorce. We started dating 10 years ago when I was 19 and she was 17. Since then we had been happy together. We spent tons of time together, I think we've only had 1 or 2 ""major"" arguments.

Fast forward to the beginning of the month, my wife told me that she wasn't sure she loved me anymore and was considering a divorce. Not only did this come out of nowhere seeing as we were acting lovey dovey the day before ready to celebrate our anniversary that week, but she told me this ON our anniversary as well. It hurt, but I wanted to try to fix things before just giving up. 

I got her to agree to couples counseling. During our first session, she reveals that she had been talking with another person on snapchat. Needless to say, I was hurt. Our therapist wanted us to get off social media for a while and go out to a nice dinner. 

Well our dinner date was supposed to be yesterday, but she was crying when I came home from work. It was then that she told me that just a few days ago, she met up with a guy and they ""messed around but didn't sleep together."" I was gutted, but I could tell she genuinely regretted her action. This all got me feeling guilty so I had to reveal that I cheated when we started dating.

About 1 or 2 weeks into the relationship, I got drunk at a Halloween party and ended up sleeping with a friend. (I know being drunk is no excuse, if I could go back and tell my younger self that I was dating my future wife, I would). And I've kept this secret the whole time.

This of course led to her saying that she's done trying and wants the divorce. She left to stay with her friend and is looking for somewhere more permanent to stay. I honestly still want to finish our therapy and try to mend the damage.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm scared, we share an apartment with our 1yr old border collie. and I have no one I can turn to. I'm honestly a bit of a social recluse, and am terrible at making and maintaining friendships. To the point where outside of seeing ""work friends"" at work, I haven't really hung out with anyone besides my wife in years. and my parents moved across the country for work.

I'm about to lose everything I know and love, and while my parents have offered to let me move in with them, that's a big change for someone that has never lived outside his hometown.

Was going through my messages today and saw all the ones from people who deleted me after they told me to reach out to them any time I wanted someone to talk to. Lol. I'm so over it.

I'm so over the toxic positivity of people telling me that I'm going to get through this and I won't be lonely forever or people who tell me to ""get off my lazy ass"" and go to the gym. Why can't I just find one person who will just talk to me and actually be genuinely my friend? Someone who doesn't keep track of who initiates the conversation first all the time and with whom the conversation just flows naturally. Maybe it doesn't exist.

I haven't really given up on finding a relationship but I'm about to. People are just too goofy or aren't in my age bracket. They're either just graduating college or they're over 40 and have kids already, I don't want to be a stepmom, I don't even know if I want kids of my own.

I do have a few friends that I can talk to occasionally but my best friend (who's a guy) crossed boundaries last month with me so I'm trying my best to repair and set proper boundaries with him so I can save the friendship or atleast what's left of it after 3 years. 
i don't have anyone else tbh and I don't like being alone for long periods of time.

I'm just feeling super lonely and I've turned to dating to fill a void. I don't know what to do really? Apparently I should be focusing on uni work and going the gym but I feel quite numb and have no motivation to exercise.

4781,toz576,YoongzJams,"after 4 years of not having friends or ever hanging out with people, i found a friend nearly 7 months ago. and i don't know, i just dont really feel appreciated? i will try to explain more specifically, but it's hard to start writing stuff like this at the start, feels like a whole scientific essay.
anyway, when i become friends with someone i always try to be as best as i could, i try to do everything to make them happy, even at the expense of myself, because i just like seeing my friends happy more than i like being happy myself. but i just would want to get something in return, even a little? and i don't know whether it's me overreacting or something.
on christmas we were supposed to exchange gifts, i made them a pot from modeling clay that, where it was in half and one side was closed, it had a little spooky house on the closed side, a pumpkin and some gravestones. i spent 4 days on it, sculpting, painting, putting it together, even during night i was working on it, just so i could make it on time, so they wouldn't have to wait for me. the day came, but they told me that they gonna give me a gift later (just so you know, i hadnt gave them a gift then, since i wanted for it to be on the same day). some time later they gifted me one of those small portable hairbrushes and told me that they gonna give me more stuff later and make me a ceramic plate. but i never got anything else. and the problem isn't that, it's that they promised me, but didn't come thru with it.
3 weeks ago we agreed to meet today, i messaged them a week ago to confirm it, they did, and i dmed them 2 days ago and yesterday at 10pm to ask them again, every time it was a yes. so today i woke up at 8am, cleaned my face, did my makeup, put on my best clothes, started brushing my hair out and putting one snack, they told me they really liked and birch sap into my backpack to give them it. 1h30min they cancelled on me, because they didn't get enough sleep, it was the 2nd time it happened. and i completely understand that, but i just would want a notice earlier? since i counted days to hang out, was making plans and was just really excited today to meet them. 
i just don't really feel loved, which again, might be an overreaction. yesterday i went to a thrift shop and bought like 8 things and went home, when it was dark. and i was just so happy, that i teared up. because it was the first time i have ever done anything for myself, the first time i bought clothes and went out till dark. i never felt enough to do it, too ugly to buy clothes, where it would be just a waste of money and time, i thought that i didnt deserve to have pretty clothes, that me wearing something pretty would just be pathetic for myself. but i bought them. and what caused it was the said friend. because they made me feel like a person, that after all not all people would find me disgusting enough not be my friend. and because of our friendship, i finally felt like i was deserving enough. i finally felt like a teenager with them, not some sort of dead child, that has been far too long not decomposing. and i wanted to thank them today, to express my appreciation, but i just don't really feel like the same goes for me. i don't want to feel like i'm the only person that finds this friendship important. i just want to be enough, but sometimes it feels like no matter how much i have to sacrifice myself, it still won't ever be enough. 
i always felt that way, even when i was 11. me and my old friend had a sleepover then and their bday was coming the next day. i spent the whole night, without any sleep, making myself the bday card, writing and memorizing a speech to give them and making them a breakfast in the morning. a month later it was my birthday and they forgot. and i just don't understand what is average and normal here. is me throwing a bday party and doing so much for my friends just too much and people just actually don't really like it as much or is it that they just didn't give me back the same energy?

4794,tp0ecq,BareThoughtsIHave,"I (28M)Recently got out of a 6+ year toxic relationship with my (29F) Ex maybe a month ago month and a half tops. I haven't tried contacting her nor do I bring her up in conversation. (Either way she's blocked me on everything.) Which upsets me not because she blocked me or rather ""cut me off"" but because all I've ever tried to do is help her or give advice with her family problems / anxiety / insecurities / career / hobbies/  and to become a better person and pushed her to try and obtain her goals / aspirations / and dreams.   


Over the years my friend group has gotten smaller and smaller to the point where the main friends I'd spend time with were mutual (or so I thought) friends with my ex. I know personally she always bad mouths me to them, and that would bother me a lot. a very long story short. I've noticed that after she left I rarely here from there people now and in addition the guy whom I considered a close friend (known for 3 or 4 years now) has all kinds of excuses as to why he no longer reaches out. I'm never invited anywhere and I cant help but feel like this is happening because of my Ex and her being vindictive. I know that they all still hangout and drink and go out places. Truth be told, it hurts but I just grit my teeth and bare it. I've been actively pursuing a future that I want and I just feel like once I've made it I'll suddenly start hearing from all them again. Wanting to be all buddy buddy. As I write this the thought of that makes me upset / angry, but to my core I'm a kind hearted person and wont hold on to animosity for long.   


I don't have much of a support system. Talking to people and being social isn't a problem but, once again I'm stuck here sitting alone trying to focus on my future while my ex and former ""friends"" all go out and live life and have fun as thought nothings happened. 

Life is good...  Deep down I want to cry but something in me physically, mentally, or emotionally wont let it out. (I've listened to new Adele album like 3 times one night to get it out of me.)

Being alone is fine, and even necessary to some degree, but having given so much to those around me only for a few crumbs of it to be given back when I need it. That hurts... a lot.

4796,tp0qm5,H_is_nb_rg,"for what is surprisingly the first time ever, i feel completely defeated by life itself. it may be a cowardly move to blame the ""circumstances"" for everything going wrong in my life instead of blaming myself, but it's like no matter what i do, and how hard i work to avoid something, that very thing ends up happening. i make mistakes, yes, but i learn from them, and better myself. if that wasn't the case before, it sure is now. why then, does life decide to fuck with me? can't i feel happiness for an amount of time such that i don't feel like i'm being made to feel happy so that when i'm sad i'll have something to miss. there was a time when i thought my mental illness (ocd) would never find it's way into my personal life, and would forever be about how my laptop is placed on my desk. jeez, i was so fucking wrong. ocd controls every aspect of my life- from how i drink water, to the way i talk. i feel defeated. i feel like whatever life has to offer isn't worth it. i hate being alone, but my ocd loves being alone. therein lies the contradiction that makes me up. im a walking contradiction. screw ocd. amma, and nana if you ever see this, then please understand that i want you to continue living on to the best of your abilities. you will get over anything that might or might not happen in the near future. you only need each other. i'm so sorry that i'm too weak to live through life and give you what i owe. you guys are the best parents ever. please do not ask yourself where you went wrong. you did not. some people aren't built for life. i'm one of them. this is such a complex situation, and no one is to blame here. definitely not you guys, though. it's funny. i always wanted to be remembered even after my death. when i didn't have a care in the world, i thought i'd be remembered for solving the riemann hypothesis, or unifying gravity with quantum mechanics, or proving the goldbach conjecture or something like that. now, i feel like i'll be remembered as the prime example of the kind of guy to *not* be like. the newspapers are going to write ""seventeen year old boy kills himself"". my entire life is going to be reduced to those six words. that'll be my legacy, if i indeed go through with what i have in mind. it's sad, but my desire to die is stronger. i wish i could say something like, ""oh well, i've had a good run"". i can't. i can't say that because i haven't had a ""good run"". i shouldn't have ever been born. my parents, and everyone i know deserves better than, well, me. well, fuck. i guess i'm just the guy who fails to live up to expectations and his potential. Trust me, i have a lot of potential, i'm smart as fuck and i know it. of what use is it though? here i am deciding on whether i should throw it all away to finally feel peace, or if i should live through a life that tests and tortures me at every turn.

I’m not alone. I live with my mother and brother (can’t hard afford my own place but still thankful to have a roof over my head anyway, so I can’t complain). Loneliness for me is yearning for new people to be friends with, make new connections, etc. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family’s company and I don’t take every conversation I have with them for granted. I just don’t have that much of a life for a 25 year old. I don’t have a job because my mental health is certainly poor, I wouldn’t be a great employee to have anyway, friends have come and go or just don’t bother with me anymore. I don’t go out. I stay in, every single day. I’m autistic also but I’ve never been taught to accept that I am autistic and it’s okay, it’s always been “you’re autistic and we need to solve the problem”, it felt as If I was a problem that couldn’t be solved, the way my parents were behaving about it. The only thing that’s keeping me to not mentally breakdown, is music. It’s my passion and I’m also getting into history as well. I also watch YouTube videos like abandoned places, dead malls and stuff like that. I’ve been isolated away from the real world since I was 17/18 (I won’t go into detail as to why, I’ll just say, I sought for help and it wasn’t a pleasant experience).

I’m losing weight because I don’t eat properly, it’s becoming noticeable due to how my clothes have become bigger on me the past couple of months. I’ve never had a good relationship with food anyway.

4837,tp6zhk,Black_prince_93,"I've always felt like this for as long as I can remember. Over the years I have become friends with all sorts of people throughout my life and they have considered me as a friend of theirs (well most of them anyway). Surprisingly the vast majority of them have kept me on their friends list on Facebook however no-one reaches out to me anymore.

But what I've always lacked, and still lack at the age of 28 (soon to be 29) are friends of my own that I can hang out with. Was bullied a lot, developed social anxiety because of it and ended up keeping to myself a lot. Hardly got invited out to anything when I was a teenager, only time I was able to do things with others was when I was an Air Cadet from when I was 13 up until after I turned 19, job conditions during my early 20s prevented me from having a social life due to working hours and being unable to afford to go out to places.

I have been living with my parents for most of my life with the exception of 7 months from when I was undergoing basic and trade training in the Army before I got medically discharged. I'm living right on the outskirts of my village on the county border where one side leads to the countryside, the other leads to the towns and cities. So if I wanted to have a good social time, with anyone it would take a good hour to get to anywhere decent.

Outside of work, I do voluntary work with my old Air Cadet Group and also help out on my local heritage steam railway. I am friends with the people I work with in both instances but again, they have their own lives and I don't have social dos with them. I'm also doing a part time higher education course straight afterwork which I'm doing for 2 years. So out of the week, thats 3 nights during the working week that I'm busy and two saturdays a month that I'm busy on the railway. Also hitting the gym when I have the time to do so but I'm only there to workout and not socialise with anyone.

Unfortunately for me it is incredibly hard to meet new people due to how busy I've been. Still on a low wage and can hardly afford to go out anywhere, especially with the rising costs of everything these days. Haven't been in a relationship or gone on a single date for the past 15 years either so that adds to the loneliness.",2022-03-26 23:06:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619896577,2,/r/lonely/comments/tp6zhk/i_have_friends_but_dont_have_friends/,,0,0,I have friends but don't have friends

4846,tp7sc6,Upset-Passion1457,"A brief understanding of who I am and my situation: I am a senior undergraduate at a prestigious university in a city. I have been diagnosed with depression with loneliness and social isolation as my symptoms. I don't really have friends as I go outside by myself and I haven't really been intimate with a girl before. In the past couple of weeks, I have been focusing on my purpose by making a plan filled with goals, strategies, and practices for myself to grow into the person I want to be and I have no doubt but to live up to it by challenging myself every single day. Previously, to remedy all sorts of problems, I would resort to drinking loads of Coca-Cola at my apartment watching TV shows/movies or have unstable moments with emotional instability and mental breakdowns.

In the past weeks since starting to focus on my purpose and sticking to my plan, I've seen couples and friend groups around town when I am outside but I would be able to keep my emotions and thoughts in control and not let my thoughts have an associated emotion to it. If I did, it would dissipate in less than a minute while allowing me to focus on what I'm doing and live up to my plan and focus in the moment while assuring myself that I will get the life in which I get everything I want, like friendships and relationships and all. However...(and this is the problem)

Today, I was outside focusing on my needs and everywhere I went, every single thing damn place I was in (gym, campus, restaurant, hell even while I'm driving to pick up and do things), I see couples every where and it was just so adorable and I just felt down. Before, I know I had unstable habits I've developed and this is probably new to me, but I would like some advice as to what to do in these situations to give myself the peace, self-assurance, and security I need for myself. I guess it could be because I watched all of HIMYM and almost finishing Love Is Blind, so I could be sabotaging myself; however, any advice and tips would be apperciated.

i’m (18f) pretty socially isolated. i’m autistic and have intense anxiety issues, despite this i do have 5 friends who i am quite close with but i feel really uncomfortable reaching out, and staying in touch with people online is something i find really stressful. i meet up with one of my friends now and then to study together and am always invited to group outing and mini trips with smaller groups within the group. but i’m so so so lonely. 
i do online school now which is much better for my mental health over all but i have like no social interaction apart from with my parents, my two younger brothers (15) occasionally my aunt or cousins or a family friend or two now and then. i barely see anyone at all which confuses me because i always hated seeing people so i don’t understand why i feel so lonely now. 
it’s the worst when i’m in my room which is why i often hang around in common areas like the kitchen or living room so i can be near people but i often feel like i’m in the way or something. we do have a dog but he’s not allowed upstairs and i have the smallest bedroom (by choice, since i like small spaces) but i sit in there and feel so isolated and lonely i sometimes wish there was someone or something there with me just to be near another living thing. 
i sound pretty pathetic and maybe it’s hitting me particularly hard right now because i’m sick and i feel more sad when i’m unwell, but it has been getting to me more and more recently. i have asked about getting a cat but my parents aren’t keen on the idea and are the sort of people that will forget about something or being frustrated if i bring it up a bunch of times. also being autistic i don’t have the gift of knowing when is and when isn’t a good time to bring something like that up. 
i am getting counseling soon which is nice since it’ll be someone to talk to about things but this loneliness is so awful and i’m afraid it’ll get worse when i go to university (which won’t be until next year but it’s still something i worry about). 
i tried to talk to my mum and it didn’t really go well. she doesn’t really understand me and stopped trying for awhile. she’s great at fighting for me in like equality aspects but not very good at being comforting or understanding or anything. my dad is autistic too but he doesn’t really need or like people so i don’t think he would understand, plus i already hang out with him loads and i still feel lonely.

4878,tpagxn,Gingerloe,"
I’ve felt this way for probably 6 years now, I’m 16 and have amazing grades, am in pretty good physical condition, and do lots of extracurricular stuff and am very involved with all of them. A lot of people rely on me and think I have my life together, I act as a confidant and a person to talk to for a lot of people. 

But there the issue arises, I have no one like me in my life. I for some reason never focus on myself and am always trying to please other people; my parents, my teachers, coaches, etc. I have never had a girlfriend, I have very few friends that i feel emotionally close with.

I feel so alone but I can’t tell anyone, I have a porn addiction and just hide in my room unless I’m at school or sports.

I feel stuck in place and have no motivation in life. I don’t care about the things that used to make me happy, I have friends that try to do thing and hang out but I always come up with an excuse and just lay in bed.

I don’t think I’m alone in this feeling and if any of you have dealt or are dealing with this, please reach out.

At the moment I am sad, sad because I can't do anything against that invisible wall in front of me, the impotence in my body is too much, I have never felt something similar in my life, it is too much that I don't know how to manage it, and as if that were not enough the memories chase me like children chasing an ice cream truck on a hot day, the nostalgia is punishing me for having lived good times with my family, for two years I could feel what it was like to be in the company of people you know and love, is it my problem for having experienced happiness with my family?, Having spent good times with my sister with whom I was able to rebuild my broken relationship with her in these two years, isn't that what I didn't have to do?, I was able to watch movies with my father and my mother because I didn't have time because of school, I had to fill my emptiness during these two years with these experiences in order not to live the loneliness again, that thing I felt when I was going to school and I was alone, because I was unable to socialize, the problem may have been me getting used to what it was like to feel accompanied, nostalgia is something that goes hand in hand with loneliness, I could feel what it was like to have a person I could talk to, it's me that's wrong, I'm a jerk for not being defensive when it was two years this nice.  

Person suffering from loneliness to which you give accompaniment for so long is the same as giving a child one sweet a day and from one moment to another no longer give him anything, and the result is just as dangerous as giving a matchbox to an arsonist inside an explosives factory, I’m afraid to see so many people gathered in my classroom, I don’t want to have to experience the same thing again, please someone help me, I don’t want to be alone again I don’t want anyone to talk to me for 7 hours straight, I want to wake up in my room on Monday at 6 with fifty minutes to get into my class online and then take my free time to talk to my sister I don’t want to feel that loneliness again I’ve had enough, school was easier while I could manage it I don’t know if I have autism or something that prevents me from being normal, I just ask to have a normal life in which none of this happens to me.

Crying doesn’t help me shit, I don’t want to repeat those moments like when I was little and I cried for anything, but I have to admit that in my most intimate moment at night with loneliness I imagine a scenario in which, after telling my week to my partner and my problems open my arms and I fall into them, and start crying like a child abandoned in a train station, i need a hug, while I was writing all my feelings in this post obviously I released a few tears but I did not make a sea since it would not solve anything.

4932,tpegii,Evil_Evin,"I’m turning 19 in less than 2 months and I haven’t made a single friend since I started high school 5-6 years ago since I moved to a different area. It really sucked going through the entirety of high school without making a single friend, even had to sit by myself for lunch which was always the worst part of going to school. Suffered from depression after the first couple months of high school once it got into my head that no one is going to be my friend for the entirety of high school which ended up being true. I ended up also losing a lot of my social skills and also became introverted so I can kinda understand why people might’ve thought I was weird since I would always be quiet and keep to myself. Always had harmful thoughts come by once in a while since I knew I was going to be doing the same thing for 4 years. I did end up graduating high school and here I am now with still no friends but only 1 person that I am close with but I get super lonely when they hang out with their friends or they end up being busy since it just makes me realize that I literally have no one else to talk to or play video games with. I do have some co workers that talk to me but they’re more of acquaintances since they really only talk to me about work related stuff. I still come home with nothing to do even with video games I just get bored of playing something for like 10 mins. It just really sucks not having anyone else checking up on you or having people to hang out with. I just really hate being alone and I know there’s a lot of other people out there that are going through something similar but it just feels like everything is going to stay the same for me forever.

4938,tpf8dh,wendy_with_an_i-,"I once was a person so excited to meet people and have friends and get along with anyone I came across.
I (F20), was a college freshman in college when covid hit in March 2020. I stayed on campus when everyone was sent home , because I don't have a home to return tk. I was totally isolated from any human aside from a cafeteria lady who only said hi to me when I picked up food every few days. For two and a half months I didn't speak with another person. For two and a half months I didn't have an in-person conversation with another person. I know that this time really changed me, although I think I'm still learning how it did. 
After all of that, my sophomore year began and covid restrictions at my university kept everything under wraps. I was in online classes but only had physical, in person contact with 2 other people. 2.5 months into the school year, it turned into one other person.

Now it is my junior year. Things are fully opened up, people are getting back together, people have reconnected, connected, and are having the time of their lives. The people I used to be close to are back at it,, and yet I'm here.

I'm lonely.

I'm socially anxious, I'm afraid of getting close to people, I'm desperate to only keep conversation surface level and run away from anyone who tries to get closer. Why? I don't know.

The isolation I've been in these past two years have fucked with me. I am not the same person, I wish I was. I've been trying to be. 

Tonight there was a party and I went..., I've been to parties this whole year. Yet, I am awkward because the people I used to know have come back together and have formed new relationships and seem to be unfazed.
Yet I'm struggling and isolating myself.

I run into people and I run away

Yet I'm here crying my eyes out because I have no friends. It's lonely. It's lonely knowing that once people would consider you their close friends and take time out of their day to hangout and catch up.
Now I'm out of the loop, out of their life, a remnant of the past. I feel like I am a side character that shows up in season 1 and is only seen in the background for the next couple of seasons.

4940,tpffxa,JesusWoreCrocs,"I‘m 23 years old now. I experienced bullying etc. in my early years in school.
I always felt like I don‘t fit in this society.
Nobody ever really knew me, not even my family. I was never able to fit into Peer groups and i learned to deal with ist pretty well.
But then all of a sudden I met this girl.
I thought she is that one of a kind girl you know?
I opened up about everything in my life to her, we talked for hours, days, weeks. For the first time in my life, after 22 years i felt understood and in peace with myself. My brain stopped overthinking each and every second of my life.
We got together and i loved her so much I can‘t even describe it. And I probably still love her..

Anyway. I always tried to be there for her and make her happy because she had a pretty bad time during covid. I did everything for her without expecting anything back.
It would be a bit too much to write it all down here. But in General I can say that she hurt me so often without noticing. For her every problem there was between us deep down was always my fault.
I got so depressed about it that I was ready to end it all. And when i told her that I could need her too now, she indirectly rejected me in a very hurtful way. I don‘t think she even noticed that.
In the end she broke up with me. When she did she also mentioned that her so called best friend told her that I‘m not good for her. The day after she already behaved like there never was anything between us. As if we always just would‘ve been friends what showed me that she planned it for longer and was totally in Peace with it.

This broke me so hard. It‘s over 6 months now and I‘m not able to trust any person anymore. I never felt so lonely in my life. As soon as I have a minute of silence my head explodes because of all my thoughts.
I can‘t talk about what she did to me to my family, it all just floats around in my head and I can’t stop thinking about it anymore. No matter how many people are around me, no matter how much I like them, I feel completely lonely in this world. There is nothing that makes me happy about being lonely anymore. Once I enjoyed being on my own because I learned how to live with it and how to benefit from it. But now I just feel like a hollow shell nobody even notices anymore. 
During the time I noticed that she was going to break up probably I wrote down all my thoughts on my phone because I wasn’t able to trust or to talk to anyone anymore. When I read through those 131 notes I don’t know how I’m still sitting here writing this post. I’m at the lowest point of my life ever. And I feel like it doesn’t get better anymore.

I'm no threat to myself but maybe something will take me out. I was laying there with the IV in me realizing, I have nothing.

I don't even care about that anymore and if you want to think that go ahead. I just don't care anymore and wish there was something to end it all. I guess not.

4945,tpg0e7,InfinityXR,"19M. I’m new here so just bare with me. So I feel like I’m slowly coming to a sudden realization about my life. After graduating high school, life has threw me around like a rock rattling inside a box on how to become an independent adult. While that was going on, I still had a bunch of close people that have stayed by my side. When it came to guidance, help, and company. I had my parents. I had very handful group of friends each unique and different with their own groups that I would have fun and vibe with. Lastly, I had my bestfriend who I wouldn’t trade anyone for the world. Everybody knows us as the dynamic duo. As the months and time has went on, things started to shift around but not chaotically and drastically, but slowly and painfully. What felt like a blur, my father passed and my mom was sent to a nursing home due to having Alzheimer’s. Suddenly, I lost a friend one by one until my “handful” became empty. We all drifted away. Through that, I still had my bestfriend. Until last week. There’s only so much arguments that can happen between two bestfriends until one decides to finally part ways. We had stupid and serious arguments before but we always came back to each other. This time it’s not going to happen. While I lost a lot of people throughout the months and years, one friend remained constant and to lose everybody you truly care about all to the last being, is a different type of tortured pain. I’ve been alone and had felt loneliness before whether I didn’t have any help, I didn’t fit in with certain people, or had someone simply just check up on me but this time feels different. I truly wonder if there’s something wrong with me? I’ve always had the question running in the back of my mind if I’m destined to be alone but after typing out of all this, I know I am. It makes me realize that If there are people that were destined or made for each other whether it is as their twin flame, soulmate, or some form of companionship, then what’s not to say that you can’t being completely and utterly alone?",2022-03-27 08:54:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1586286749,2,/r/lonely/comments/tpg0e7/the_deterioration_of_loneliness/,,0,2,The deterioration of loneliness.

4967,tpj18e,freeNadiin,"My boyfriend (27, M) and I (22, F) just quit our old jobs for better ones, both of us taking a very significant pay raise. His little brother, who I love as my own, is coming to live with us in a week and we’re very excited about it. Also, his parents are visiting us at the same time and they’re absolutely amazing, they love me like their own daughter. So essentially, only good things are happening to me right now, things I’ve been wanting for a long time. 

But, for whatever reason, I just feel lonely and disconnected. I haven’t been active on the internet in about 3 years, I gained a lot of weight (nightmare story about birth control and hormones) and I don’t have many friends, never mind talking to them on a regular basis. I don’t have any hobbies because up until this point in my life, I was just grinding to get to where I am now in terms of financial and physical freedom (escaped an abusive household). I want to get back into gaming, as my boyfriend and I own two of everything but a PC, however I kind of feel burnt out of it. It’s to the point where almost any game I play has to be a complete surprise to me or else I lose all interest and even then, after about 6 hours total of play time, I’m done. The only games that can suck me in anymore are shooters which strike my competitive side, and I can only play them with friends. 

The worst part for me now is that I have a whole week of down time before my boyfriend’s family comes down and I have to start working, which sounds amazing to most people, but I’m just filled with anxiety worrying over what I’m gonna do all day since I have no hobbies or friends that I truly click with. There’s my boyfriend, but he’s more of the silent type and he loves playing games, so he’s wrapped up in that all day. And I don’t expect him to constantly provide me with entertainment anyway, that just leads down a toxic hole. 

So, the issue is that I have absolutely no clue what makes me happy and I don’t have people I really connect with around to enjoy it with me. Any advice?

So I'm turning 21 in a couple of days, but ever since I left home for college about 3 years ago, I have been spending my birthday alone and I suffer the most around this time of the year. 

When I was alone on my 19th birthday, I was still emotionally okay because I still had high hopes for the future of finding friends and maybe a girlfriend too if I'm lucky enough. After a year, the special double-decade 20th birthday rolls along and nothing has changed. All the people I've tried to make friends with always have more important priorities or some COVID excuse, and I'm always the only one initiating conversations and trying to meet up or they just stop texting entirely after a while. I've also tried to ask out a couple girls I was really interested in over the course of the year, but every time I was hit with the ""I'd date you if you were taller"" (but that whole topic is for another post)... I spent my 20th birthday alone, because even after swallowing my pride and straight up texting people if they wanted to spend my birthday with me, they either said they had other plans or just didn't respond at all even afterwards when they probably should have seen the text by then. So I bought a small cake and a candle from Walmart to facetime my parents with to let them think that I'm doing okay, and so they can sing me happy birthday since they couldn't make it this year either. After they hung up, I continued to sit on the floor in my dark apartment room and just cried for hours without ever being calm enough to even taste the cake. I don't know what got into me when I did this, but after I couldn't emotionally handle the pain anymore, I relit the candle and just held it up to the bottom of my forearm in hopes  of the physical pain of getting burnt overpowering my emotional pain of being chronically alone, but I can say for a fact that it did not. I kinda just plopped over and cried myself to sleep after that lol. It wasn't until the next day that I realized how stupid I was to harm myself like that, and I had to deal with a big blister on my forearm for 2 weeks that hurt like hell every time I showered.

So almost a year has passed now, and I've made a couple new friends with whom I study and chat with whenever I am on campus, but nothing deep enough to call them close friends, since they never text/call for things besides schoolwork. I'm also still invisible to girls because of my height apparently. Some days I wake up wishing there was someone beside me, and some days I wish I didn't wake up at all. I feel lonely, empty, and unloved. That's where I'm at mentally right now. Most people online tell me that I need professional help, but I think I just need a friend. Anyone in the world will do, so long as I can feel from just 1 single person (besides my parents) that I am cared for. It's my 21st birthday in a couple days, the BIG 21st where you go out with friends and get your first drink at a bar or club and have a blast. I'm supposed to be in my prime, supposed to live best days of my life his year, but I just feel like I'm missing out in life... I've already accepted that I am going to be alone for my birthday again this year, but I don't want to resort to self harm again in order to cope with the pain. Do you have any suggestions/advice for what I can do to cope, improve my situation, or would possibly be down to chat or keep me company on my birthday? I do not care who you are, girl or guy, what you look like, what you sound like, or what you enjoy doing; I'll literally take anyone as a friend. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, it means a lot to me. 

TL;DR: I've spent my past 2 birthdays alone, and I will soon be alone for my birthday again. I can't seem to make close friends or find a gf. I feel lonely, empty, and unloved. I coped with the pain in the worst possible way last year, and I dont want to go through that again.

5000,tpowr0,bikersquid333,"Each year as spring and summer comes along, I've grown to despise it even though the weather is great and everything is open, businesses are thriving etc. Everyone is out enjoying, being social, just living happy lives just as I want to do, but I'm alone. I've become completely cut off from any kind of bond with anyone and it kills me inside that I have never been able to experience a 'normal' summer out with friends and just living life without constantly questioning my actions or doubting myself since I'm insecure and self-conscious. 

No family down here where I'm living at the moment, and definitely no friends or gf I can go to the beach with and walk and talk and eat ice cream with. That's literally all I want and I'd be completely content with only that every weekend or so but instead I'm riding down the seafront or walking through town and all I see are happy families or couples enjoying the weather together. It makes you feel even more alone than you already are (which I didn't think was possible!).

It's a double-edged sword because the weather is so nice out so you almost have to go out or you'd feel guilty for not taking advantage of it. But obviously on the other hand as soon as you go out and try to do normal 'summery' things you quickly realise it's gonna be a constant battle of anxiety, sadness, loneliness from seeing the rest of humanity living it up without you.

5003,tpp100,Jay-is-still-waiting,"My girlfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me, we were both mentally unstable and she got overwhelmed with my sudden burst of emotions as I was suddenly attacked by my past traumas out of nowhere and she decided it was for the best and despite not wanting to I just had to because I love her and I want what's best for her. I say recently but its been a almost 2 months now and I'm still suffering from the sadness and the loneliness. She lost her friends due to drama and I decided to add her to my circle of friends because I thought it would be best if all of the important people in my life were friendly with each other. I regret that a bit now, I had a main circle of friends or the ""boys"" and an outer circle of friends, because of the breakup all the important friendships I've had has either crumbled or felt different. They chose sides and split with me and I don't blame them, and ever since the breakup every emotion I've bottled up came gushing out, the thoughts and the overthinking and the noises in my head don't stop and its gotten worse and worse to the point I almost always have to listen to something on my phone or else ill start breaking down. The outer friends chose her side and split with me and it saddens me how fast long time friends turn to strangers, I look at old pictures of me with them and my ex and its sad how only two of them remained.

My main circle of friends feels different, I treat them as family or as brothers, but recently either due to the breakup or me overthinking it feels different, everyone feels distant and despite them telling me otherwise I feel like they've gotten tired of me venting almost always because of how they ignore my messages and never invite me to anything like play games and go on calls. Another reason as to why I feel like they've grown distant or felt different is because one of my friends in the main circle is comforting my ex on almost on the daily and that hurt me a bit and made me overthink a lot, he knows that I haven't moved on and that I'm still waiting for her, and it feels like he's replacing me and I'm overthinking about how he has a hidden agenda. I stated how I feel and now he ignores me despite him being the one who was comforting me at the exact time of breakup and was the one who told me he will always be there for me, and funny enough he hasn't. I'm guessing he sees me differently and maybe the awkwardness between us has made the whole group uncomfortable or something, and for the past 2 months I've been alone because of the constant pain I feel when I see them and the crippling loneliness keeps me awake at night. Dealing with the breakup and with the sudden loss of friends and the death of my friend and dog with no one to talk to has been hard and I decided to talk vent it here because I have no one to talk to about it and I'm so overwhelmed with everything and I don't think I can last any longer.

5006,tpp63k,thekebabguy,"I started the year off being optimistic and excited to go to a university I was dying to get into. 

As time went by, I found to hard to make new friends due to me being extremely socially awkward and introverted. I rarely got to see my close friends that I've known for years and that got me even more upset (I lived far from my home town so I barely got to see them). By the end of the first semester, I felt quite depressed and started having negative thoughts regarding how much of a loser I am and if there is something wrong with me that made people not want to talk to me.

During the Christmas break, a girl from a random group project I was in started texting me. We didn't talk much to each other in person. However, when we started texting each other, we surprisingly had alot in common. It was also the first time a person of the opposite sex had shown some interest and ""signs of attraction"" towards me, which was kinda overwhelming for me at that time. After a week into the second semester we hung out. She invited me over to her place for tea and we talked for hours. I confessed that I had feelings for her (looking back I should've not done that so early). Was initially awkward, but then we started holding hands, had a bit of banter and flirted with each other for a while. 

That evening was the last time I seen her in person. After that, she started skipping classes, texting less frequently and almost seemed like she didn't want to talk to me anymore. After a couple a weeks, she told me she went back to her home town and said she prob will drop out. I fell into a deep depression afterwards caus the only person that I could relate to and vibe with in my university, just out of the blue disappeared from my life. I kept beating myself over the idea that I might've done something that led to her dropping out to never see me again. She was being vague about why she didn't come to classes and why she wanted to drop out (she did tell me before she had mental health problems and a troubled past so that could play a part). As a result I became a bit pushy and desperate for her to stay, without acknowleding her feelings.

I haven't been to college in 4 weeks due to my depression getting in the way and the negative thoughts I had previously coming back to overwhelm me. Tomorrow, I'm returning with only 2 weeks left of this semester, and I'm a bit anxious about it. Idk how I'm going to spend the next couple years in college being alone and sad, and the thought of that makes me more depressed. I feel extremely guilty for the way I treated her the last few times we texted each other, but idk when to apologize since it seems she doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. And I do miss her alot aswell. I wanted a place to get this off my chest, caus I feel like nobody else in my life besides random strangers on the internet can relate to me and maybe help me.",2022-03-27 17:52:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1556567390,5,/r/lonely/comments/tpp63k/miserable_college_year_almost_over/,,0,1,Miserable college year almost over

5031,tprr7q,imsuspendedsomehow,"I have suffered with my fair share of mental health issues. I’ve dropped out of school and finally finished last year by homeschooling myself. I’ve never had a face to face friend. I was treated like a freak or a nobody. I went to hospital programs both inpatients and outpatients and even the saddest people there were able to build friendships. Surprisingly I was treated like shit there too. I spent a lot of time to myself because I didn’t feel I really fit anywhere.

A few years ago I made a discord and decided to try the online friend route. I’ve met a lot of people who have too claimed they were sad and lonely. Others told me they were socially awkward and were able to relate to the struggle of making friends. Yet they made friends and later left me to say I’m too much. That’s the thing these people who I thought were just like me keep finding people. The lonely people make friends. The introverts make friends. The people who also have mental health issues make friends. Those who said too many people have ghosted them ghosted me. Those who promised they would always be there and be nice to me turned on me just to tell me I meant nothing to them.

Why does it seem the people “just like me” still find people but I am still alone. I could get comments on this post or no comments at all and I will still be alone no matter how many people text me they don’t find comfort in me. They don’t see me as a person they want to talk to.

At least that’s what he’s been telling me. Earlier this month, he informed me that my feelings of loneliness has been hard for him- and him constantly having to cheer me up, and deal with my depression has left him “too exhausted” for our relationship. Hearing this has worsened my loneliness, and I feel I can’t even ask him to hang out because I’m  afraid that I’ll add to his feelings of exhaustion with me.
I’m in therapy and take anti depressants, but nothing seems to help me make friends or look for emotional connections outside of my weak relationship. 
He makes me feel like such a loser because he seems to be able to make plans with his friends so easily. He never even bothers to invite me to do things. When we do hang out, it’s either at my apartment or his apartment. We live in Atlanta, and there are so many things I want to do with him. I don’t just want to sit around with him, I need someone to spend quality time with, and someone who appreciates who I am. I never used to feel this way, but this last year, with my friends moving away after grad school, I’ve been struggling so hard to find a friend group or even one friend. I have a roommate, but she never invites me out or do anything interesting on the weekends. She’s always with her boyfriend or has other friends to hang out with. She’s also really involved with the black community at my grad school, and I don’t think she’s comfortable inviting me to those gatherings since I’m not a part of the community. 
I’m not sure what do to do at this point- part of me wants to end my life and another part wants to move away from this awful city.",2022-03-27 21:06:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1623338349,4,/r/lonely/comments/tpt8ao/im_lonely_isolated_and_worthless/,,0,2,"I’m lonely, isolated and worthless"

I have an extensive history of being abused as a child to the point I've been hospitalized. I have severe PTSD from it and have screwed up relationships and friendships because of it. It's a lot to handle. But I've done things I'm not proud of and have hurt people because of those episodes where it's triggered. It's somewhat of a self sabotage thing  I guess. The point is, I think it's too hard to care about me. I guess I'm to the point now where I think that I'm scared to put myself out there because things will just fall apart again. But I hate it. And I don't know what else to do. I'm shut inside my house all day and I can't drive anywhere because I'm visually impaired and can't legally drive. I feel hopeless and feel like if you knew everything about me, you'd hate me, for some reason or another. I'm not easy. I'm very complicated. And I'm just so tired...I have tons of great qualities. But the ptsd has screwed up so much for me. Am I really that unlovable? Do I deserve to be here? I don't know what else to see.

I have normal conversation skills and good voice, people often compliment me for it and ask me whether I’m a professional voice actor or not. But I’m very short(5”6). I know there are a lot of people shorter than me, but in my country this height is far below average. So I’ve always been the shortest kid everywhere, all girls and boys were taller than me. Of course, I was bullied a lot, but I try to forget it. I remember I used to measure my height many times because I couldn’t believe it that I was actually 5”6. Well, ok, that’s not the topic. 

A few months ago I’ve tried dating server on discord and the results were shocking. I’ve never had so much attention in my life. And the most important thing was the attitude and the treatment I got. I will never forget it. Unfortunately, due to my work and hobbies I can’t spend much time on my internet friends, but it’s depressing to think of. How different my life would be if I were tall. 

I really don’t get why things which are out of our control define our life so much. It’s sad that people can enjoy friendships and relationships in real life, but I can’t. Loneliness isn’t a choice for some people and it should be treated correctly. There should be a loneliness payment from government.

5101,tpxsib,TheUnluckyR,"I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’m 25. About 4-5 years ago I found someone I meshed with beautifully. I thought maybe it could be my first girlfriend. Then she started lying to me. I’d have mutual friends tell me oh ____ and ____ are fwb. And I’d be like oh I didn’t know that. I told her hey people are saying this about you and she’d be like no. That’s a lie (comes to tell me 3 years later that it was true) and she did this with maybe 3 different people. I was crushed and ended up vomiting cause my body doesn’t feel anxiety and just builds up stress. 

A few years later I meet a new girl. She’s very beautiful and starts talking to me. I’m shocked but in my head I’m like oh she’s nice. Along with that I’m still not trusting of people cause…. People lie. We go for dinner, take a day trip, go on mad dates. We both state we like each other and so I ask her. “Will you be my girlfriend?” She says no. I don’t take it to heart cause her reasoning is we’re co workers. Which is totally fair. I’m not upset by it and carry on with my life. A few weeks later my friend tells me she saw her with another guy holding hands in another city. When she saw my friend, she told her “don’t tell him you saw me here”. She tells me cause she knew how much I liked her and again. I’m hurt. My vomiting starts again (between 2019-2021 it Avg’d about once every 3 days). But whatever I forgive I forget. 

Another few years pass and that same girl in the other city tells me she’s obsessed with me. Sends me all these pictures, suggestive texts. We have great conversation it’s beautiful and I fall for her. I tell her I’ll go visit her and she’s beyond happy. She tells me imma get laid (I’m a virgin) and I’m more than happy to lose it to her. I go to her city and the day before she tells me she’s going through some family stuff and she’s not the happiest so obviously I’m not gonna pressure someone who’s sad so I respect and enjoy my weekend there. Few days pass and she tells me she was seeing someone else and they make her so happy. 

Again. I’m crushed. I dont know what I’m doing wrong… it sucks. Maybe I’m unlucky. Maybe I’m just easy to step on (I’m still friends with all of them). Either way I’ve come to the conclusion I’m just unloveable. Maybe one day someone will love me the same way I love everyone.",2022-03-28 01:10:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648255510,9,/r/lonely/comments/tpxsib/im_unloveable/,,0,4,I’m unloveable.

Why do I have to be like this? Why do I have to sit through this fucking life and watch my sister and her husband be happy and my parents be happy and see my old crush in Walmart being happy with her boyfriend? I have to listen to songs about people being happy and finding people to love them despite being way more fucked up than I am. I have to watch movies about people being happy finding each other. I have to watch to shows and anime and read books and manga about people finding people who love them despite their flaws. I have to watch all my fucking peers in college flit around being happy with their people. And I’m alone through it all, I’m just sat here with my eyes forced open, strapped to a chair and being made to take it all in. I have to watch every fucking person around me be happier than I’ve ever been in my whole life, happier than I’ll probably ever be.

I hate this. And why tf did I have to see her in Walmart? I was TWO GODDAMN HOURS away from my home to be in the same city as her (where my parents live) , and I just HAPPENED to be in Walmart at the same time this gorgeous, funny, kind af fucking bitch happens to be there. This fucking girl who my dumbass actually believed I might’ve had a chance with. What tf are the odds, dude. Shit like this makes me think there’s an evil god specifically torturing me.

I don’t fucking get how broken people find love. It doesn’t make any fucking sense. Aren’t people who’re fucked up not supposed to be lovable? But I see it happen all the goddamn time. But if they can be loved, why can’t I? What special kinda fucked up am I? Why tf do I even have to breathe if I’m that awful a person? I’m not on drugs, never smoked or drank, I’m not mean or abusive, I’m pretty fuckin smart. Literally the only fuckin thing wrong with me is no one has ever even had a goddamn crush on me, and it’s killed my self esteem. But apparently that’s all it fucking takes, that’s enough to disqualify you from having a happy life. Get a fucked, isolated, religiously traumatized childhood that makes you scared to fucking talk to a girl and that makes you hate yourself for even wanting to, and boom; now you’re fucked up and lonely until the day you fucking die.

I don’t fucking want this. I don’t want to have to put up with all the bullshit life makes me wade through just so I can come home every night and HAVE TO HUG A FUCKING PILLOW JUST TO PRETEND IM NOT ALONE AND HOPE THAT I’M EXHAUSTED ENOUGH FOR MY BRAIN TO BE DELUDED INTO BELIEVING IT SO I CAN SLEEP.

This is the first time I’ve wanted to cut myself I long time. I know it would help. And it would validate me. Right now I feel like I’m just a whiny fucking pussy ass bitch who’s too fucking prissy to deal with the normal shit everyone deals with. But normal people don’t cut themselves. If I cut myself, I’m crazy, I have a reason for feeling as bad as I do. It would mean that I’m not just weak, I’m actually insane. I don’t think I’m gonna do it, cuz it’s a bitch to hide and I’m a bad liar and don’t wanna have to lie to my therapist. Maybe I should just stay up all night? I’ll be fucked for calculus in the morning but I’ll also be so tired I’ll dissociate, and finally get some fucking peace for a second.

Music has been there for me more than anyone else. I have been coping with my loneliness with the help of music. When I put on a song I really like.. I can picture myself in a much better situation. 

I have a friend, a significant other.. just someone to hug me. Someone to hold me or wipe my tears away. It’s not real, but it helps me. It does enough sometimes to get me through my days.

With the last straw being him losing feelings for me which made me finally realize how fed up i was with his shit. He apologized profusely but a stupid half-assed apology doesnt make up for all the pain he caused. What really sucks is he was actually a wonderful partner and my first love, he just had a lot of difficult issues. He was also my first best friend and basically the only real friend i had throughout my teen years leading up to now which made the pain of having to leave him for my own sanity even worse. He saw every good and bad thing about me and decided in the end that its not enough after all, despite promising he'll love me forever while constantly calling me his soulmate, and that shit really fucks with my self worth and feeds into my self esteem issues. I know people arent obligated to stay or love you forever but this feels too cruel.

I have an older sister who im close to but she of course has her own life so i dont expect her to be around for me 24/7, so i really appreciate when she makes time for me. I get along decently with my parents but obviously im not that close to them. They dont really understand the things i go through. Besides this, im alone and have nothing but self-hate to keep me company.

I want nothing more but an irl close friend or two who i can hang out with often, and a lasting and loving relationship thats preferably not long-distance, but my life is literally a mess rn and i dont rlly have my shit together yet because its rlly hard to find motivation with how awful ive been feeling about everything.

But that being said, my best bet is to go on every social platform and talk to family and people I knew back in high school right? Well no because literally everyone ignores me (including in real life) and I'm starting to doubt the need to even make real connections.

I've never had a great track record with friends. Because I have BPD (Boarderline Personality Disorder) not many people want to deal with a roller coaster like me.

But sometimes I wish the roles were switched y'know. I know it sounds pathetic, but I wish I was the one receiving physical affection. I wish I was the one being pet or cuddled. 

I'm surrounded by my family most of the time, but I'm more like a ghost that occasionally leaves its room. Needless to say, I don't like most of them, and the few ones I either like or am indifferent to are distant in some way. Not to mention me pushing away my dad even though we got along the most.

I have this weird feeling on my skin that is hard to explain, and it's not my eczema. It's like a feeling of coldness or emptiness idk.

I have some ways to cope, my cat being one of them, but one of my other coping methods is kind of embarrassing to share. 

I've been doing online school for 2 years now, so that just adds to the isolation. Idrk what to do. I'm just starved of touch I guess.

5137,tq1o6w,Stitchex,"Hi. My friend told me she posted on this sub and I felt lonely tonight so I checked it out. Well, actually, I usually feel lonely. But I’m also socially awkward and that’s what keeps me feeling alone even though there are a lot of people who want to know me. I am 26F and have experienced severe depression since middle school. I’ve tried meds, therapy, exercise, etc. and nothing keeps it at bay long enough. I don’t think any other person can fix this but I just feel so alone in this battle against myself. There’s only one other person who knows the following, but now you do too: I have my concealed weapons permit. Had it for maybe over a year now. But I haven’t bought a gun yet. The reason being I’m sure I will use it on myself on one of these nights. I’m not mentally stable yet to trust myself with a gun. Louis wasn’t. And since I have my permit all I have to do is purchase one…no need for a background check. I won’t but god, on nights like these, the thought is so tempting. 


Anyways, I just really needed somewhere to vent about what I’m feeling. Thanks.",2022-03-28 04:57:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1540166796,37,/r/lonely/comments/tq1o6w/theres_only_one_reason_why_i_havent_quit_yet/,,0,8,There’s only one reason why I haven’t quit yet.

The """"""friends"""""" who are going as well all have their own agendas and simply don't have time to meet with me. I don't blame them for that. My agenda isn't their agenda. 

So I was extra lonely about 20 minutes ago and I unblocked my ex. I last contacted him in 2019. 

We fell out of favor with each other when he didn't support my goals. He referred to me as a ""ghost"" that I'd be present one minute and gone the next. In my defense, I was going to school (he was not) and didn't always have time for him. 

We're both 28 now, nearly 30.   
I won't lie, I miss him. But we broke up for a reason.

5145,tq1wz9,i-have-nofriends,"A few years ago I used to have a really tight friend group. We were like each other’s second family and it was fucking amazing to be part of for as long as it lasted. That fell apart and I’ve been frozen out of socializing in a way ever since. I watched my old friends move on or go their own ways and all forget about me, and I kept in touch with some of them but it’s just not the same anymore. I don’t have this kind of close connection with anyone now and every day it feels like there’s a hole in my soul where those people together used to be.

I’m not especially close with my family and that’s been made even worse by the fact that I (and a couple close family members) are the only people in my family living outside our home country. 

Sure, I’ve met a lot of new people since then, and I’ve grown as a person too, but it just doesn’t feel like enough, and many days I don’t have anyone to talk to unless I reach out first. I feel like an afterthought in the lives of everyone around me. They all have other friends too who I feel like are so much better than me in every way and it leaves me with a feeling of “why bother? What can I offer?” And I’m afraid the answer will be nothing no matter how hard I try. I feel like if I died tomorrow no one would care, they would feel sad for a week at most and then it would be like I never even existed. Recently I noticed myself catching feelings for one of my friends and to me she’s important, but to her I’m just another dude she hangs out with occasionally. I have one person now who I could consider a close friend but if he made a list of people he cares about I’d be tenth place at best. It feels horrible. I feel like I’m living a shadow life, just waking up and forcing myself into doing everything I need to do, and eating and shitting and showering and going to sleep again. 

My family isn’t very understanding of mental health and they think I’ve become too soft and am “looking for problems because my life is too easy”, so I don’t really have anyone to say this to but it feels better to get it out somewhere.

TL;DR: no friends, feel like a ghost, feel worse than those around me, and I care about people I know but if I died tomorrow would they care?",2022-03-28 05:12:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1522453215,56,/r/lonely/comments/tq1wz9/i_wish_i_was_important_to_someone/,,0,10,I wish I was important to someone

Maybe I wasn’t the most fun to be around for a long time; depression does that to you when you try to live without the someone you can’t live without. So she walked away and I fell apart for a while. 


Eventually I think I hid it well and stopped talking about it because I felt them all creating distance. Now we’re years later and I’m okay again, but I think it’s too late. I’m so tired of solitude and unreliable people.

Hey guys , so I (22m) have this friend (21m) that I met last October from my friends group (they know him was before) ... we became really close since we had a lot of things in common .. after that I’d always call him to join us (sometimes nobody would invite him cuz they found him nerdy and annoying) ... we began going on our own to football matches, cinemas and more. He has this laundromat business that’s about to open and no one really cared about it except me, I’d go with him to check the place and see the goods and give him my insights on what’s good and what could be changed. Also , I was the only one who gave him a gift week before he traveled and he was so happy about it. lastly, im currently helping his older brother to find a job in the company i work for.

So he had to study aboard this late Feb for his diploma, and I’d really want to know how he’s doing. But i have these thoughts that since our friendship is the shortest (among the friends group) that he might find me annoying, and I too worry that I don’t want to disturb him from his studies ...

Anyways, in 2021 i entered College, that’s when my friends and i started to grow distant from one another,, which is normal because different schools and schedules. i did try my best to arrange meet up with 🐚 and my other friends but our schedules just didn’t work out.

Around August 2021, 🐚 started to rlly avoid me. i would tell her i miss her and i would like to meet up with her now and then but like usual , she isn’t free or i’m not free so i just decided to stop asking and wait for her school holidays. One day on IG, she posted this story on her spam saying how fake ppl can be, i replied to it asking what’s wrong, she then answered me in a very dry response… once again i asked her if i had done something wrong for her to reply me in such a manner, that’s when she burst out saying what a bad friend i am ,that i never made any efforts when it came to this friendship and that i always chose my bf over her. i decided to just take blame because i did feel like i chose my bf over her.. she then told me she doesn’t want to be friends anymore and i told her if that’s what she wants then i respect it. 

moving on , a day later i went to her place to confront/make up for things. we made up and moved on.

that’s when i realised she somewhat showed her true colours from the beginning.. she’s the type of person that if she wants something, she MUST get it. she has lazy eyes and has been insecure abt it,, i told her she looks perfectly normal the way she is but if she wants the surgery then go for it, she’s from indonesia so originally her fam planned to go back Indo for surgery but due to covid… you know the rest, she cries , beats and scolds her mum for the lazy eyes she has and it gotten to the extend of her mum having to beg her dad to get the surgery in SG(which isn’t cheap). the pattern doesn’t end there…i change my phone? she begs and beats her mother to beg her dad to change a phone too.

My conflict between 🐚 and me started when she started using excuses to not do the things that she has to do. she gotten into a LDR with some stranger from a mobile game twice too when i told her not too(FYI they broke up on my anniversary with my bf and she blames my anniversary…)

i’m not trying to make her sound bad but.. i miss how she used to be. the fact that she’s using my bf as an excuse to not like me anymore is ridiculous as well.

right now, im still in contact with some of my friends but we don’t rlly meet because of school but the 🐚‘s situation has been bothering me since the day she had that outburst on me..

any advice would be greatly appreciated but once again i’m sorry if the story/timeline is messy.",2022-03-28 12:37:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608573445,1,/r/lonely/comments/tq8cx7/i_only_have_my_bf_as_my_only_friend_friendship/,,0,5,i only have my bf as my only friend + friendship rant

5197,tq9tt6,sweetoon01,"I have a pretty low opinion of myself over all. Everytime I'm talking to another person and feel like we could be friends I find out how much better they're doing in life and then I slowly backoff and avoid them until we stop talking. 

I met a guy in college who seemed really friendly and he initiated conversation with me as he saw I was new and didn't know anyone. Within weeks of knowing him I found out he is doing Mechanical Engineering in college, plays four instruments and composes brilliant music, writes fantastic stories, plays chess very well( has won many inter-college tournaments),  is very enthusiastic and knows a lot about economics and politics and often talks about the things he wants to do for the betterment of the country. 

He also has a blog where he shares his opinions and thoughts on various topics, and  everytime I read something written by him, I'm blown away by his depth of thought and the interesting perspectives he always manages to introduce his readers too. He plans to do a Master's degree in Quantitative Economics after graduation, and I'm sure he'll get into a great university and be awesome no matter where he goes. 


I on the other hand am doing a easy humanities degree and I chose it because it was easy, my hobbies are watching Netflix and going on Reddit, and am boring and dumb and ignorant. Everytime I have a conversation with him it's mostly me nodding along to whatever he says and sometimes i don't even understand anything, but he patiently explains everything to me. 


I'm slowly cutting contact with him because I feel like an embarrassment of a friend and also because I don't have anything to contribute or be of any use in our friendship. I feel very inferior and know that he's better off being friends with people who are on par with him mentally, and can consistently keep up with him.

5215,tqcyzd,Jurez1313,"I've come to the conclusion that I will always be alone. I'm just not interesting enough, outgoing enough, funny enough, or useful enough for anyone to want to be in my life. Just struggling to cope with that realization. It's like, I can't stop my brain from wanting what I know I cannot have. Previously I've been able to distract myself and occupy my thoughts with other things, but those other things have stopped being enough to do so, the thoughts have become so overwhelming.  

To become more interesting, I'd need to do more things. Get more hobbies. Have more experiences. But every time I think of a new hobby to try, I come up blank. No hobby seems even remotely interesting enough, or even possible, for me to pick up. They're all too expensive, too physically demanding, or require too much patience/waiting to keep my interest. The few that don't fall under those categories, I just have no interest in learning or investing time into, because I just innately know I will not enjoy it (normally as I have not enjoyed very similar activities in the past).  

And one cannot really ""become"" outgoing, which is required to become funny. I could become useful by learning some skill, regardless of whether I enjoy it, but I've tried doing that in the past to no avail (college twice, online courses as well, all failed).  

Some people say to volunteer my time, as this can provide fulfillment even if the activity itself is not enjoyable. I've looked and looked, searched high and low, scoured the internet and even asked in my city's subreddit. There doesn't seem to be a single volunteer position that I am qualified for, that has shifts I can work. Probably 80-90% of volunteer positions I find only have weekday shifts available, no weekends or evenings. I could e-mail asking ones that I find myself suitable for, but if they're not advertising for those shifts, it's likely because they're always filled, if they exist at all.  

So I'm out of ideas. The few hobbies I do have - playing video games &amp; board/card games, watching movies &amp; TV shows - do not really hold my attention for very long anymore. You could say gaming might allow me to meet people, and normally you'd be right. But while I have no problem socializing with people online, as soon as it comes to interacting face-to-face/IRL, I completely freeze up, especially if we don't have something to talk about (like we do when we're playing a game - the game itself is the topic of conversation 99% of the time). Similarly, board &amp; card game meetups are all online now, too, which means they aren't even necessarily with people in my area.

I don’t even know what made me think of Reddit now but I was thinking to myself „why do I feel so bloody lonely when I am such a loving person?“ and was overwhelmed by the injustice that (probably) all the most sensible, loving and loyal people out there get pushed aside by those who are just louder, less inhibited or simply more „simple“.. and I guess I came here to even just virtually send my thoughts to someone who might understand.

I love myself. I have done therapy for a few years and it has really helped me to finally love the person that I am. To love my story, my heart, my sadness - just all of it. But I still cannot get rid of the bad thoughts I have about myself. Me not deserving love, care and happiness. Every day is a fight with myself, of not letting those thoughts take over my life and some days it just wins. The love for myself is still there but it even sometimes pours gasoline on it all: „I am deserving of so much love, why do I never feel it then?!“ - Am I broken? Ah, I just don’t know.. There are so many thoughts in my head, one louder than the next. 

Why does no one love me? Or why don’t I feel loved by the people that might love me or say they do? I wish I could feel and accept love, but I don’t know how.

Sometimes I think that some other „lost soul“ understands me or I fall in love with the brokenness of someone else, in the hope that that person might finally see me for ME, all of me, and understand what goes on in my head, just like I want to love someone with all their dark sides, even because of them. But maybe I don’t deserve it. Just maybe, I don’t deserve love. Who am I to be loved and love in return. Sounds so fucking cheesy, but I mean it. This weird little human existence on this weird little planet - why should I be entitled to feel love and connection?

And so I spin my sad little stories night after night.. just that today I’m sharing parts of it with you, in the hope you will feel less alone because of it. I feel sad for all the loving souls out there &amp; if I could hug you all and send you all the love from my heart I would do it.

But all the same, I crave friendship, care, companionship, intimacy, etc. I have this ennui about keeping up with people that contradicts my general sense of loneliness. Anyone felt the same?

At my workplace, there’s only me and my director (no other co-workers). I work 9-5 and my spark has faded. Every day feels the same and I feel empty literally no emotions what so ever but loneliness. After work, I watch TikToks or YouTube videos just so time passes. 
I can’t afford a GYM membership. 

My college friends are all busy with their jobs and I kinda don’t feel like hanging out with anyone though I know I desperately need to get back my social life. But we no longer share the same interests. They don’t want to go to the places I want and vice versa. 

How do I make new friends when I don’t meet anyone at work beside my director. 

We don’t have clubs/bars at where I live. I tried to go to the places I like in hopes for building connections but it didn’t work.

I started looking out for new jobs but in the meantime please help me out!

5282,tqo44a,thatlonegirl," Hey there!

You can call me Hanna, 32 from Southeast Asia who was just recently diagnosed with PDD (Persistent Depression Disorder). I just thought of writing this to let it off my chest. I've been dealing with a lot of things since the year started. A series of unfortunate events if you may call it that. They might not be big of a deal to many of you for you might've gone through a lot worse, but for me, this has affected me and it's only almost 3 months in this year. Maybe these things that have happened to me were a trigger that's why I am feeling like this, but what do I know? Anyway, I'd appreciate if you would give me that tough love kinda thing but I think right now, all I need is comfort and listening ear. In this case, eyes that would read this and share my feelings with.

So, lets start shall we?

* My family attacking me and accusing me of things that I am not. They've thrown hurtful words without reaching out to me first and asking me things or talking to me first like normal people would. They've been telling me that I've been distancing myself from them when they know exactly why I am doing that. They always make it seem like I am the problem when they keep telling me I'm not. Action speaks louder than words - I always say this because it's the truth. Don't get me wrong, I love my family and I miss them so much but the complication we have is long overdue and I don't know what to do anymore. I have the intentions of fixing everything but the way they interact with me is what makes me not do it anymore.
* The person I consider my bestfriend that I care about so much left without saying a word. Yeah, he basically ghosted me. He's such a dear friend of mine and I will always hold a special place for him in my heart. I like him so much but not to the point that I am in love with him yet, if that make sense? It may sound silly and stupid but I only met him online almost two years ago in the midst of pandemic, I wouldn't have met him if it weren't because of Covid-19. I miss him so much, there hasn't been a day where I don't miss him. He was the one I go to whenever I am feeling blue or when I am going through something or just about anything, good or bad, but now he's gone. Though he's still in my social media and I think he didn't block me on the messaging app we use, I am staying away from him, keeping my distance because I respect the space he made between us. I am not entirely sure what happened between us, I thought what we had was just a small hiccup that we have to overcome but I was wrong. Two months has passed and we still haven't talked to each other. I was the last one who reached out to him and he didn't respond. No response is a response. I just hope he's happy and doing well.
* So when the friend from second bullet left, I revert back to this other friend I had previously that I had sexual relationship with. I needed something/someone to distract me from the things I was going through but only after 3 weeks when he broke the agreement we had and that kinda triggered me. You see, I've been fooled 3 times before, they all cheated. I mean, I know I can't blame him for what he did. Couple in a relationship have this kind of problems, much more with us as we are not in a relationship. I know exclusive friends with benefits is not a thing but it's what I want and need for now and that I all I want. With what he did, it kinda made me think that I wasn't enough and it made me wonder if I will ever be enough for anyone. I'm not enough for my family, for that friend I mentioned earlier and I am also not enough for this guy. The only thing I liked about it was, he had the courage to tell me and own up to it.
* My work has been overwhelming me for the past months and my performance is failing. With all the things that distracts me about my personal life and the load of work, its not really helping me. I came up to the point where my boss has talked to me about my work and I still have lots of pending work.
* And lastly, I am flat broke now. I honestly don't know what happened, how this happened. But I am guessing its because of my excessive expense. I always go out and meet up with people. I travel. Do things outside. Buy stuff I don't need. Treat my friends whenever where out somewhere. I think that was me coping up with things that's happening in my life and now it has caught up to me.

With all of these that has happened, the intensity of my suicidal thoughts has grown stronger, but I won't do anything that would harm myself, that's a promise. I've come this far in this life, I wanna see the outcome. I wanna know how it feels like to be genuinely happy, I think I deserve that.

If you made it this far, I thank you so much for reading and spending time with me.",2022-03-29 01:05:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648513472,4,/r/lonely/comments/tqo44a/that_asian_girl/,,0,2,That Asian Girl
5283,tqo4x4,capybara_tamer,"He was treated like garbage all his life and we had that in common so it was nice to find eachother. Over the year+ that we were together, there were times that his insecurities came forward but they have taken the cake now. He's convinced himself I am not who I say I am and I'm not to be trusted.

 as well as painfully narcissistic and self obsessed. I can’t really see another person wanting to deal with this, but even if they did, I’m not sure I’d let them. It’s too late. I’ve been like this too long, I’d just push them away.

I am at college, its been almost 1 year by now, but because of covid, this was the first day i had to actually drag my ass off home to go there.

At the very end of the class (The last 10min of the last one of the day) i dropped my pen on the ground, and i thought to myself ""I'll get that later"" - the thing is, i actually said it out loud. The girl on my right took the pen and gave it to me, i said thank you, she nodded and the class ended.

When i was walking on the corridoor, i saw the bathroom, opened the door, and saw how it was busted and dirty, so i closed the door and continued walking, three seconds later, that same girl said: 

""Hey, are you looking for the bathroom? It is right here""

""I know, but it is completely fucked up""

She laughed very loudly and asked how i was going home because she was looking for the bus stop, i said i was going there too and we started talking and walking to the bus laughing our asses off, we talked at the bus too, and when we needed to part ways, she gave me one of those little hugs with a kiss on the cheek.

My logical side wants me to realize she was just too nice to me, a type of kindness i have not experienced in a very long time, and i need to lower my expectations very fucking fast

But i am so happy about i am not going to give a shit about logic, even if she only wants to be a friend, she is very fucking wellcome and i will allow myself to be happy about it.

Update: She have a boyfriend, but at least im not going through college alone! And people in my class started to talk a lot to me because they think i sound like a movie narrator, lol

Not gonna lie, it hurted a little to know that she is compromised, but she is one girl around a giant campus (Looks like a small city, seriously) so i have really high hopes!",2022-03-29 02:06:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616114432,226,/r/lonely/comments/tqp7zd/best_fucking_day_of_my_college_life/,,4,33,Best fucking day of my college life.

5299,tqq0jt,GirlBoss_1999,"Hi Reddit. I don't wanna give any details but I just wrote this little ""break-up"" text I'm planning on sending to my best friend - the closest one I've ever had; and I'm honestly scared because I don't think I'll ever have a true friendship like that ever again.

See, I had a very traumatic childhood and a very traumatic experience last year. Both honestly made me currently terrified of trusting... anyone. I just don't know how to be vulnerable around people, and I don't even know how to approach them at this point. So I don't see myself making a single new friend in the future.

But, although I'll miss him and don't have the ability to make new friends for now, he does neglects me a lot. We've been through this over and over, but the pattern always finds a way to repeat itself. So, to spare myself from further hurt, I wrote this text telling him, politely, that ""our friendship is doing me no good, please don't text me again"". 

I can't send it, though. 

Cause I know the moment I do, then that's it. And then comes that alfuw time to face the impending grief of a relationship that will always mean so much to me.

Well, I love him very much,  but I don't want to keep someone in my life just because I'm afraid I'm incapable of finding a substitute for them. Plus, I don't want to condition myself to cumpulsely force future relationships to feel these voids of lovenessless inside me.

Like everyone, I guess I have to learn on pratice even little by little how to heal from loosing people close to me, because it can and sometimes will happen often in life.

But I so feel very empty and depressed and anxious because I generally don't know what to do with myself or what's to come.

Does anyone have any tips/life-hacks or resources (even academic) on how to cope? Or letting other people in?

When I try to focus on working or studying I get serious burnout. I've been planning on volunteering.

Oh, any reading recommendations?  Cause I've been reading (and journaling about) bell hooks' ""All About Love"" and it's a tough read, but truly cathartic.

I've also been rewatching Succession because everyone in that family is just so alone in the world and it would be... almost relatable if they weren't ultra muti-bilionaires. Great show.

5307,tqr1m2,FadedOnline,"Hello reddit,

I have floaters in my vision and although these aren't necessarily always a cause for concern my eye doctor told me there is a slight risk of retinal detachment and to make an appointment with him if I notice any sort of change in my vision. Even though he said slight risk I can't help but think it's over and I'll go blind someday. This thought has been on my mind a lot lately but in addition to this, I just feel so insanely isolated these days. Can anyone else relate? How did we get to this point? I go online and this loneliness seems to be prevalent everywhere. I guess what I'm saying is I feel stuck and voiceless. Sometimes I hate days off because they remind me or how much of a loser I am. Nothing to do all day, no one to spend time with. Funny how big cities make a lot of us feel disconnected. I know the vision thing is something I'm going to have to be diligent with to ensure my vision can be saved. But I guess I'm just looking for some support since I don't really have anyone in real life I can reach out to. I'm not expecting a key to all my problems if anyone has any kind words that would be good enough. Thanks for taking the time to read my little bit.

Because of years of solitude, I convinced myself that I dislike people. That I would much rather be alone than enjoying time with others. I believed that for so long that I pushed everyone away. That I subconsciously self destruct relationships because, being alone is easier than talking. I pushed myself so much that I feel like I am alone in the world. Like a side character that no one cares for unless their right in your face. I try to make friends but I’m either easily forgotten, I don’t know how to communicate, or I simply push them away because would much rather be alone. This feeling… I hate it. But it’s comforting in a way. It’s familiar. Something that will always be there for me in the end. I truly try to make friends but I can’t seem to hold a place in anyones lives. In public it’s the worse. I always feel like everyone, especially females, are looking at me. I know I’m not anything special but I can’t help but feel this way. Social media is one of the same. I don’t post any pictures of myself because i feel like it’s all a contest of popularity. I stay to myself because it’s easier to just be quiet than to find conversation.

5332,tqtetm,Is-Ashe-Okay,"I’m a 19 year old male who this past week just got his first job. I’m a courtesy clerk at the grocery store, meaning I fetch carts, bag groceries, sweep the floor, clean up spills, that type of stuff. Today was my third day, and it was nice. All of the staff are pretty nice, everyone is helpful when I’m not sure what to do about something. I’m not a very active person, so the cart work can be kinda grueling, but I only do them for 2 hours, so it’s not that bad. 

I got this job because I felt like it would be good for my mental health. I thought being productive with my time, interacting with people, and getting outside the house would all be good for me. However, so far I’ve just found myself feeling lonelier than ever. 

Things are fine at work, but the second I get home, I just feel so mentally drained. I have no energy or motivation to make myself food, to play video games, to do anything. I’ll just sit there wishing I had someone to do stuff with, someone to make things interesting. I have online friends I play games with, but my new job clashes with their schedules. Also, ever since starting this job I’ve felt so distant from all of them. It feels like I miss them so much, and wish i could do stuff with them, but they don’t seem to mind the fact that we haven’t had time to spend together.

I just really didn’t expect myself to have this reaction to starting my first job.

5338,tqu4vh,Lost-Object-9701,"(24 m) I get so much anxiety it gets unbearable and I seriously cannot change this aspect of myself. My major relationships have consisted of me isolating my partner. I've been alone again and now I'm *really* a late bloomer. I haven't bloomed. I tried and failed and I am basically rotting away and I don't look as good as I used to. I grieve endlessly. It's been half a year. I still have a foothold in every stage of grieving. Time never seemed to heal much for me.

As far as friends go, I wouldn't say that I have any close friends. Anyone I may consider a friend is pretty much someone online that I'll only occasionally message with. I feel like every chat is a void. Yet somehow I think that an even more impersonal void is worth writing to.

My personality consists of random esoterica and obsessively trying to wordbuild and come up with things for my story. I'd like to create a webcomic. I've never read one, but I'd like to make a magnum opus to at least contribute something to someone and have something to show. My way of coping is to focus on this story and setting. But when i stop thinking about it, or the night comes, it feels like sobering up, and inside of my chest it feels like a black hole. Well, it feels more like a big heavy atom chaotically spinning inside and eroding me away.

I feel like I really need a close friend, but I practically never care to talk to other guys and I don't really know why. I always try to talk to women

And I am way too picky for my own good when it comes to finding a girlfriend, however I can't simply change my preferences. I've only felt a certain absolute crushing feeling for a few people since high school.

My anxiety and depression suffocate me every day, and sometimes, often, I am up at ungodly hours of the night. The night time used to feel like my friend, now I don't know what it feels like.

I know they are just thoughts, and that they do not need to be acted upon. But I'm reaching a breaking point and it's consuming me quite a lot. Even when I study, ""you could just go"" and I start to shake. And it pains me that I'm saying that to myself when I know I don't want to go.

My family have been abusive since I can remember so I barely keep in contact with them.

Most of my friends I lost because of another friend. Some of my friends just drifted apart. 

I can’t make new friends because I have really bad anxiety, the moment I step out of my house and go out I feel like everyone is staring at me and judging me and when I need to buy something or order food I completely fuck up my words n start trembling out of embarrassment.

I don’t like talking to people it scares the fuck out of me. I can’t go out clubbing and make friends because I’m not 18 yet (I turn 18 in 3 months.) I don’t do sports and I don’t go to school. I can’t work because of my mental illnesses.

My boyfriend is at work 90% of the time so even if I wanted to hang out with him I can’t because he’s always busy and when he’s not we just sit together or sleep together we only do things every now and then.

5357,tqx74a,JesiDoodli,"So background, got into high school, none of my close friends were in the same form (we took the same classes in form thanks to covid), and there was this group of pretty, smart, cool girls in my class and I wanted to be in that group. They seemed nice, by the way, they weren’t brats or anything. So I tried to get into their group, but they didn’t really care, so I spent the next FOUR MONTHS BEATING MYSELF UP about all the various things wrong with me that made them not want to hang out with me, until one girl FINALLY invited me to sit at their lunch table. But… it didn’t get better. 

They say hi, hello, how are you, basic stuff like that, but when I try to keep the conversation going, they just ignore me, even though I’m pretty sure I make my voice loud enough to be heard over the noise of the cafeteria. I tried to tell one of them how I felt and she said it’s because they talk about a lot of private stuff, and they’re not good at letting new people in. So I thought over this answer for a few days and decided it’s a shitty excuse for a clique, and that they’re not worth what I put myself through worrying about them. So I left the table, and went to go sit somewhere else. Buuuuut now I’m back at square one. The other girls in my class are either gossip girls or have their own group already, and I don’t want to go through that group stuff again, plus I don’t really click with them.

5378,tr28hk,Bredbanani,"Disclaimer : I don't know if I'll keep this post up cause I know there's actually no one who can help me. I just wanted to write it down for once and send it to the void rather than repeating it in my head every single day.

My name is Bren and I'm currently 30 years old. I grew up with my mom, dad and younger brother. As nice as that sounds however, we never had what I'd consider 'a warm family'. I never witnessed any love between my parents. My dad never showed any interest in us and was mainly found looking over his birds or watching tv after work. I think my mom sees her input in this differently as well, but I wouldn't say we necessarily got a lot of love or affection from her either. I know she was tired from work as well and she'd provide us with food, but there was never any 'quality time' for us after school. We could join them in watching tv up to a certain hour before bed, but that was about the best you could get. Like things like playing boardgames with us was definitely too much to ask for.

At the same time aside from that, I was also definitely not liked at school. I can't remember any time where I wasn't seen as 'different' from everyone else. No one ever wanted to play with me, people would avoid me, people would actively make fun of me. Basically to summarize it I was bullied from a young age. The thing that hit me the hardest in that regard has to be when I was about 8 years old. My classmates had started this new thing where they would pretend to be spraying themselves after they had been in contact with me. For example if I were to bump into them by accident or the teacher made me pass papers in the classroom, they'd spray themselves so they wouldn't be infected because it was something I touched as well. I guess it sounds silly now, but it definitely put a lasting effect on me. I do feel like I must be disgusting and that even being accidentally touched must be the worst thing in the world. I switched schools a few years later, but unlike other succes stories, no matter which school I switched to and even when I moved on to different high schools, it still happened. I was always an outsider, someone who people just didn't like or didn't want to be associated with. (I could give so much more examples here, but it would only get longer than it already is.)

So with my family life not being great and my school life definitely not being great, I ended up being drawn to the internet, especially to games where you could walk around as an online avatar. It definitely temporarily filled a void for me. Somehow with me not talking to people face to face and using my hands to 'talk', people could at least tolerate me. And over the years I definitely made some what I'd consider 'friends', something I could've never thought of irl. Unfortunately those times are already long gone and these people have actually moved on and actually created a life for themselves (and I'm happy for them that they did.)

My life took another turn for the worst when my parents decided to divorce when I was 18. I initially didn't think it would be too bad cause they never loved each other anyway, and it was a clear choice to live with my mom out of the two, but I didn't expect that my mom would end up being an alcoholic. After moving with her I suddenly had to learn and take care of a lot of things in life which I had little experience in, on top of trying to be there for my younger brother as well who had just started high school. I just tried to stay strong, escaped on the internet when I could and had the illusion that maybe with time someone would come and save me, cause fairytales always have those happy endings.

Unfortunately 30 came, and several moves later I don't see my situation ever improving. While my mom isn't constantly drunk anymore, she's a very negative manically depressed person with spending issues, a hoarding disease and CFS, meaning she's home all the time on disability pay. I don't want to talk too negative about her, she's still my mom, but I can't deny that it weighs heavy on me. She doesn't do anything but eat, watch tv &amp; perhaps whatever her current interest is. (For example she's heavily into gardening now, so she will spend all her money on new gardening equipment and seeds, but when it comes to actually maintaining the plants once they grow it becomes too much effort and she'll just let everything overgrow and allow it to be a mess). And I get so jealous whenever I look at my coworkers who are roughly the same age as her and see what they're still able to do.

I just feel so.. stuck. I feel so tired and drained and I feel like I have nowhere to go. I started working parttime when I was 21 and have been doing this job ever since. But because of the odd hours it's insanely hard to combine anything with it. I also get insanely overwhelmed and exhausted by every day interactions and I don't know what that would be like if I worked 8 hours a day. Needless to say I can't afford any housing on my own and any program which focusses on housing for people with low incomes have a waiting list of at least 10 years, and it's only increasing.

I feel like I've spent all of my young adult life just trying to survive while not being able to work on my own issues that I've had since I was little. I do am getting tested for autism in about a month, but I feel like if anything that will just add another label onto me but it's not going to help. I fear that I'm just going to waste my life working to have help fund her financial issues and then come home and be a house maid.. the only thing that still keeps me going is that I also have my pets that I have to take care of, but even they're getting sick a lot lately so most of my spare time is going to nursing them too..

And then i didn't talk about the fact that I'm terrified and overwhelmed by everything in regards to driving so the best I can do is bike to places.. \^\^'''''

So I'm basically just a very pathetic person who has literally no one left to actually reach out to. I don't know what I'm hoping to gain from writing this down. It feels good to get it off my chest I guess even tho it has barely scraped the surface of all of my issues, but it was already long enough as is.

If anything, I hope I can at least be the 'bad example' parents warn you about, don't end up like me.",2022-03-29 14:54:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594805633,16,/r/lonely/comments/tr28hk/my_long_story/,,2,8,My long story
5379,tr4lub,B-I-R-S,"Everyone, I am an young adult, 22 years of age. I feel guilty, sad, and I feel bad to my self. I see my self as a bad image/ person as a whole. It's because I disrespect my mother by naming her some kind of a bad word. I just did it because I can't take the pain anymore. I can't take those words she came out from her mouth. I can't take the toxic traits of hers. It's been years since I was a child, I suffered a lot by her toxic behavior. When she's getting mad, she often calls me that I am a child of a devil, I am dumb, and so on. Those words really hurts me knowing those came from my own mother.  Yes I know, she is my mother and whatever she does she is still my mother but the toxicity level is really different. I have nothing to go to share my feelings because all of my family members are all toxic. And yes I know that what I did was wrong and a disgusting act as a son. But I cannot believe she has all the toxic and negative traits, I can tell because I keenly observed and by understanding her behavior even when I was a child. I never forget how much pain I've dealth emotionally and mentally. Now that I have grown. I don't know what should I do to fix this all. Sometimes I think that it is better to have a distance and boundary between me and my mother. Aside from those bad, negative and toxic side, I still see her goodness sometimes but most of time she is a total toxic. Now, I have nothing to talked to, not even my families co'z their toxic too, I don't have a lot of friends, like I feel I am all alone. And I feel so bad to my self.

5387,tr8d6i,MonkeyDforda,"Hey there 

I made a post on here before about my recent lonliness wich was also caused by covid ,but I realized that I have always felt lonely all my life even when there were times where I had lots of friends and daily social interactions.

I kinda always felt like I was born with the specific role of being an observer. Someone who wittnesses the life's of others, but therefore has no life of its own. I never felt like I was the main character at some point or even an important side character. Maybe I got to be an unimportant side character or just a charcter in the background sometimes, but for the majority of my life I always felt like the viewer who no matter how loud he scearms at the screen, no one will hear him and he won't have an effect on the outcome of the story whats so ever. 

When ever I had friends or was in a friend group I rarely felt like I had a connection with these people. To me it felt like people were never friends with me for me, but most of the time it felt like I was there to fullfill a specific role. Often I just was the filler, the target of jokes, the last guy to call when there was no one else and often I just was sorta there. Even with people I sort of was close with I felt like was just there to play my part. More important roles than the ones I just mentioned, but still just a role that could easily be discarded or replaced.

I don't have the sense (and never did) that I have an important impact on other peoples lifes (not that I really tried to tbh). Even in my family. Like if I were to die tomorrow their lifes would just continue like normal with the only differents being my abbsence. Of course they would be sad for a while, but once they overcome that its like almost nothing changed. No one ever told me in any way that Im important to them and that I provide something only I can. I guess I have always tried to be a good big brother to my sisters, but as I said I never got any feedback so I don't know.

I know that my position in life is without a doubt largely my own fault for not trying to be more to myself and people around me. I've been in this postion for so long that now where I wanna be more I don't know how to and how to even get started. Things like my introverted nature and social anxiety only make it harder. 

I kinda already accepted that I might be dying alone without ever having achieved something im proud of or without ever having made an important impact on someone's life.

Can anybody relate?

5402,trjbs2,Basil_spice,"I've been alone for a while now. the only consistent human interaction is with therapists and doctors. I'm in group therapy,  and even so,  I'm so scared of connection and rejection I can't properly connect with anyone.

And since I've only been talking to nothing but therapists and doctors for the last 6 months, I'm completely socially inept. If I do get into a conversation with someone,  I will do most of the talking,  and most of that talking is what's troubling me. I know I do it, and everyone else knows. It makes me want to isolate more and makes social interaction even more nerve-wracking. 

But after a really bad weekend, I no longer felt human, but then I remembered a few weeks ago I matched with someone of bumble bff, and we added each other on snap. Her and I never spoke, but since I'm new in town, I asked her about a popular abandoned building and the possibility of exploring it. In my limited knowledge of her, I knew she dumpster dived. it didn't seem like a big jump to go from dumpster diving to trespassing. She was totally down and said she would go with me.

After that, we've been chatting back and forth,  and now we have plans to meet up possibly this week. I realise I still do talk about myself a lot, but I am trying to have actual conversations with people in group therapy and ask them about their lives. I didn't ask not because I didn't care. I never asked because then it could lead to friendship, and that was terrifying. And still is..

But I'm trying to actually start doing the work to be happy and be the social person I was a few years ago, before my co-dependent relationship, and before the pandemic... and before, I started self harming again. I've been in treatment since November, and I'm the only thing stopping me from relationships. I'm going to freak out and probably want to cancel plans, but I won't I NEED to get out.

5414,trnd98,Nxgent44,"Idrk why im writing this but I gotta vent so if any of u are lucky enough to read this I apologize in advance. Im in 2nd year College and tbh its everything I thought it would be, from someone who never really had a good time in highschool for various reasons in and outside of the institution. I have a good amount of great friends now, something I wasnt sure I would ever be able to achieve, I feel like im an easy person to dislike if that makes sense. I wouldn’t describe myself as Rude or an asshole or anything like that I think im a pretty nice person but that might also be the problem. I have trust issues meeting new people I think its cause I already assume they have a bad opinion of me before I ever talk to them, maybe my brain thinks it’s easier to assume everyones secretly against me and act distant rather than be too friendly and risk getting walked over. My roommates are probably the best friends Ive ever had! I got extremely lucky finding them and Im not taking that for granted but I find it hard to actually trust them. I trust them but I don’t feel like I could actually talk to them about everything I’m dealing with, because my mental state has been very up and down since I was a kid and being at university my parents aren’t really someone I can talk too about it, mainly cause I dont wanna worry them and they aren’t the most understanding when it comes to emotions but its honestly just how they where raised. My roommates are great but I feel like any second it could change and they could any minute not wanna be friends with me anymore. Its happened  times before with friends I thought I was gonna be friends with forever and im sure a-lot of other people have shared that feeling. I have a pretty good social life id say We party every weekend but always make time for school yet I feel invisible when it comes to meeting Girls, Im not an overly attractive male but I don’t think I’m necessarily Ugly but again its all perspective ig. Dating apps dont work for me and im starting to think its not the pictures that aren’t good, rather im just unattractive and awkward. I don’t really understand whats so wrong with me? Im not a simp or a Douchbag but for whatever reason I either get shot down instantly or if it actually develops into talking I manage to sabotage myself either by putting too much or no effort In. I also seem to be attracted to girls that obviously don’t like me, the few times I’ve actually been approached by a girl its too weird for me, almost like I cant comprehend someone would actually be interested in me. I heard this saying once “people only accept the love they think they deserve” and I think maybe that might be apart of my problem. I feel like I also crave the one thing I cant have, and I think alot of people do this but when I didn’t have friends all I wanted was friends and now that I have friends all I want is a girlfriend, I think about it for probably 80% of my day when I’m not distracted by school or something. I wish I didn’t care so much but its been months now and its not even something I can cry about anymore its just acceptance at this point. I feel like theres almost some dark force preventing me from being happy and having a relationship like a curse or something. Ive been trying to be more positive but as the days go by it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, its usually 2-4 months in between meeting a girl that I might actually have a chance with (I usually fuck it up) and seeing my roommates essentially have any girl they want whenever they want secretly kills me inside. Im happy for them but also extremely jealous, I just wish that someone would see me for me yk. Ik that if I had a girlfriend I would do anything to see her smile [within reason] no simp shit I might be down bad but mama ain’t raise no bitch. One day maybe it’ll be different but I also know that nothing will change If I don’t make some effort to change something in life.

5415,trnfx8,sweethop99,"So I'm not quite sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just had the thought.

I'm a 28 year old guy, soon to be gratuating from the university I'm attending, and I guess I just hit some sort of wall tonight. I am sitting in my one room apartment by myself as I do every night at this point, and I just got to thinking, it's actually been 4 years since I touched another person.

Like, i can think of a handshake I did maybe 3 years ago at a job, but that's been it really.
I have an auto immune disorder that sort of made me shut off the world when the pandemic hit, but I had the zoom meetings for school, so I guess I didn't really think I was missing out on anything. I just let the whole world move by while I hid away from everything. 

But now that I'll graduate soon it got me really thinking about my life and how I've been going about it so far.
I used to be pretty out and about. As a teen I always kinda placed myself in all kinds of situations with other people and I was really quick at making friends back then. I had a ton of friends from all kinds of differemt groups, and I felt like I fit in with mostly everyone. 

But for some reason I just couldn't keep those friendships going into my 20's and nowadays I just spend 98% of the time by myself, doing mostly nothing really meaningful. With the last 2% shared between my parents and the local cashier at the store. 
I haven't been engaging in social activities for maybe 6 years or so. And I haven't ever dated at all.
I feel like I have devolved into this odd existance where I seem to have forgotten how to interact with people. Even on here I mostly just find myself having reationary burst or I'm lashing out on people in comments.. Like what the fuck am I doing? I'm a grown ass man, right? I should have this shit figured out by now! 
But for some reason I have just become this complete asshole, who isn't contributing anything positive to this world besides making my mom happy when I come home for Christmas. 
I mean, I have really let myself become a fucked up fetished weirdo that I honestly have no idea who would ever want to have any relationship with. 
I'd of course welcome anyone who would want to spend time with me, but on some level they'd have to be crazy to. 


Looking at some old social media account I see many people from my past having children. I guess the pandemic really is a babyboom scenario. But it does makes me feel very lonely.
I feel like I'm missing out on so much of life, yet it all also seems so overwhelming and honestly estranged for me at this point. I feel like I forgot how to exist in the real world and how to interact with people. And I have no idea where to begin with any of this and how to move forward.

Anywho, that's me spilling my guts.

And then I deleted anyone from my phone that has ghosted me in my most desperate time of need. One of them I desperately want to come back but I know he won’t. “Normal” people can’t handle the birds that don’t rise. So for anyone that stumbles across this mish mash of what’s been going on inside my head, I’ll tell you about myself. I treat Reddit like a journal of sorts. It’s a terrible idea and I don’t recommend it. It feels therapeutic to put my thoughts out into the universe but that invites the cruelest humanity has to offer. I’m (33F) and on my 2nd failing marriage. I know, trust me no one is more embarrassed than me. There is no saving this and we are not romantic partners anymore. But I’m a graduate student and don’t have anywhere to go so I’m trying to hang in here a little while longer. I don’t have any kids but I do have two pugs. I’m a Leo and I used to be an extrovert. The life of the party. Now I would say I’m an introverted extrovert. I suffer from anxiety and depression and I’m currently in week 3 out of an 8 week transition to new psych meds. So you can imagine how many relationships I’ve managed to destroy in the process. It’s lonely and isolating and I connect with people for a bit and then get ghosted when they see me struggle. I have many pet peeves just like anyone would but being intentionally ignored drives me insane. It has my entire life even as a child. I think it’s the worst thing you can do to someone’s suffering mentally. When we need someone and we can’t just be the pretty, outgoing, perfect girl they bail. Getting out of bed right now is a chore yet I rarely sleep. I have a psychiatrist, therapist and I’m a mental health professional myself…go figure.

As a former person who was bullied and rejected for being this type of person in the past, people can be scumbags to very optimistic people. In the past, it was very pessimistic people making it worse and now it's optimistic people turning them into lonely, feeling-like nobodies cause of this mindset.

We need to change this mindset. Give people a chance unless they're asses. But no, people would rather judge...I am aware that there are toxic optimism which is terrible and is a form of judging one with a different mindset, but now we're doing the same with the energetic, optimistic, and extroverted ones.

Because I am who I am, I own the fact that I have issues pertaining to my sexual identity and my race within said identity that even the most well meaning, educated people won't understand. But, lately another anxiety bug has reared its ugly head. Gay men culture, generally speaking, is highly sexual (even in the most mundane of places) and our current technology encourages it (at least, I feel). Though, I am a victim of sexual assault and stand firm in my boundaries, I've always viewed myself as pretty healthy in a manner of speaking with my desires, frequency of connections and any other way one would measure insight into my sexual prowess. Lately, however, I've been feeling more prudish. Or sensitive, and triggered even. It's like, no matter who I'm talking to and no matter the subject, I'm dodging trite innuendos, steering the topic back to the original focus, or pretending I didn't hear it at all. This seems to happen all the time. With gays in casual, intimate or even professional settings. It's exhausting. And honestly, it's making me not want to interact or have sex. I'm a gay man, who's beginning to get turned off by interaction with men. Because I'm 41 and the combination of my upbringing and geographic breading, I wasn't equipped with identity vocabulary. I'm researching identities, pronouns and communities. For a while, I've identified as gay, and sapiosexual. I'm now wondering if asexual is being sprinkled into the mix. I've researched asexuality but it hasn't seem to resonate. I still get horny and desire men. I long for companions. But, I wouldn't be caught dead at a social event.

I got ""kicked out"" of my family's cult religion. So their contact with me is at a minimum now. I barely see them anymore.

Winter where I live is depressing. Very cloudy. I work from home so I have no contact with anyone.

I have great friends, they are the only thing that keeps me sane. But they are busy and we can't see each other all the time.

On my day-to-day, I just feel extremely lonely now. I hate this feeling. I feel desperate sometimes to just grab a coffee with a friend. Or I text anyone I can think of just to go to the gym with someone. Or get a roommate. Or start a new physical job just to talk to people. I turn on the TV every day and put on a series just so I can hear voices and not feel alone. Sometimes I want to go back and live with my parents.

I'm also sorry if I lack English vocabulary, English isn't my first language so I might also have a hard time expressing my feelings because of my language...   
so anyway, I just feel kinda empty, and lonely every day. Throughout my life, I never really have friends that much, I do talk to people but most of them are just classmates and families. I had friends before, but most of them ended up leaving me behind, and sometimes I just feel like I am at fault. I feel guilty, maybe because I talk too much(?), but I always do consider their feelings too, I let them talk and express their own opinions, whenever they need something I would always help them. Honestly, I don't know, I'm confused whether I'm at fault or maybe they're the ones making me think that I'm at fault. And just a month ago there's this one online friend who just started ignoring me even though I did nothing wrong, we were just talking about the current updates of a game then they suddenly start ignoring me. I first thought that they were busy so I waited for months, I always see them online talking to a lot of people but they never talked to me... so it just leads to my conclusion that they never really want to talk to me anymore. maybe they thought that I was boring, or they just generally don't care about me.  
It also happened the same thing in real life as well. It's because of these events that I just feel like not making friends anymore, I'm too afraid to get abandoned, and rejected again. But it hurts to know that no one will care for me. I just don't want to deal in friendships anymore, I don't want to trust anyone anymore. it's just too scary to be judged and be rejected... I don't know what to do in my life anymore... ever since I was in grade 1 I've been so lonely and whenever I see people having fun with their friends somehow I felt envious that they were having fun... I think that's all. I'm not really expecting people to help me...

To be fair, Im sure they have their own problems to deal with and i dont blame them for not also having to deal with mine. Therefore i dont bring serious topics about me, as e.g. things that gets their mood down, up, and when i do, with a lot of time inbetween.

I am usually a very happy and talkative person if the group gets quiet or bored or have a conflict e.g., and i rather take resonibility and look like clown to save others from it. no matter the history with the person. Otherwise im naturally rather a shy and introverted person. Since i have issues trusting people with my emotions, i barely talk about them serously.

i hangout with my boyfriend a lot, maybe too often. he hurts my feelings when he tell me a wants some alone time or that he doesn’t want to hangout that day. and sometimes i know that he forces himself to hangout with my just so he doesn’t hurt my feelings. i cry to him all the time about how lonely i am but i just don’t think he gets it he’s always been popular and had huge friend groups.

5541,ts7nnn,True-Human-Scheme3,"Hi, I’m 17(M) and I can’t understand what is wrong with me. I’ve already experienced puberty a couple years ago, so it’s not about hormones and teen depression stuff. I can’t say when all of this started, I feel like I always was sort of introverted guy, tho I love to hang out with my friends. I don’t have much of them, less than 10 in fact, but they are all good fellas, since I’m very picky about choosing who my friend is. Unfortunately, I don’t communicate with them to much and I always feel being side kick. I don’t really feel like any of them can truly understand me also.

I have decent social skills and good and a little bit weird(not quirky) sense of humor, I don’t have opportunity to use those tho.

I have never been in relationship that last more than 1 week and I have never kissed someone. I don’t struggle without gf and I don’t know why, but I rarely think about relationship in general. I have never had crush on someone also. I’ve been seeing those relationship memes/vids from insta/tiktok and I don’t feel they are quite right, I can’t see love there. Some might say that true love needs to be developed, but what is sense then? I can love absolutely anyone following this logic. I’m dreaming to have someone to hug and talk to tho.

I’m in good relations with my family, but we do not communicate too much and I don’t have much connections with them neither. I feel like I do not belong anywhere but myself. So I moved to my grandma, so I could have my own room and nobody would be able to bother me.

I also want to talk about my sexuality: I am very addicted to deviantart fetish porn. I struggle really hard about that since I’m orthodox christian. This is not heritage since my family consist of atheists(I am not against that). I decided it for myself and religion is just another confirmation of my moral beliefs. I don’t want to consider myself as bi, who I am in fact. I don’t think lgbt is bad, but I would rather be straight.
This is also not the case of my loneliness, I still do love women, but regular porn often can’t satisfy me. I’ve tried NoFap several times and I was feeling better, but not in way about loneliness, but self-esteem.

About looks: I’m not ugly but wouldn’t say I look manly enough. I’m lazy and don’t have muscles. I also have too childish/feminine face, too high-pitched voice.

I don’t really like psychologists due to I’m don’t like opening to strangers. I’ve been at one’s once, when I was passing medical comission for uni. I completed test which shown that I have high submissiveness?( I don’t really remember) and suicidal tendencies and depression, which I don’t actually feel. Maybe I’m in regret? Neat part I didn’t specially choose negative options in test.

I’m not motivated at all, don’t have ambitions and I do nothing to achieve my dreams. I also do not have much hobbies. I rarely listen music. I don’t watch movies almost at all. All I do is existing. The only thing I love to do and do frequently is playing Minecraft on my server. Unfortunately, m friends quit it a long time ago.

I don’t believe that I’m unhappier than anyone. Every human being has their own problems, that we may just not understand. I just would like to solve question about why I struggle from loneliness and often feel like hole in the heart but ok with it at the same time?",2022-03-30 14:27:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619631264,5,/r/lonely/comments/ts7nnn/i_can_not_understand_myself/,,0,5,I can not understand myself

5555,tsabo2,ZeroX2021,"I feel like the years of being the quiet, respectful, adult-fearing, antisocial kid that my parents helped raise turned into a lost cause for the modern era of social interaction. I didnt used to have a mean or resentful personality like I do now, and I believe it stems from my desire to reciprocate past and present acts of meanness with my own. I become extremely angry when I think about all the times I was beat or pushed or made fun of where the outcome was always that I need to brush it off and prepare for the next time. It was a constant show of what others were allowed to do that I wasn't, be it because of my weak stature or my mental conditioning to be nonviolent and to trust the system. It also didn't help when ur bullies also seem to be floundering in your wake, since a lot of them were very popular and seemingly very consistently happy. Now, after having long been removed from school, my emotional state is deteriorating. I used to be able to hold in lots of repressed rage by transforming it to sadness, which is a way more socially acceptable emotion to have. Nowadays however, I've been feeling my rage slip every now and then, but it doesn't provide any catharsis. I want to get away with what my bullies were able to and get away with it, because in my perspective, it was the way to become popular and therefore happy. I want to be able to assault someone then go to the homecoming game with my 10/10 gf. I want to be able to constantly berate someone with insults and have all my buddies laugh at it. Ik it wrong as shit, but I'm so fucking angry that others have been basically rewarded for being awful while from my perspective, I've only been punished for trying to act proper and correct. I fully believe I will never be able to let it go, because how can I believe in other human concepts like justice and equality if I do? And even if I let it all go and forgo a belief in societal justice, at that point I would just act out my repressions anyway if I didn't care. Even my therepist had to drop me cuz I cant get over it, and if its obvious that i cant find love for myself with all this repressed hate, then i obviously am a lost cause and should end my life before I really hurt someone, right?

5616,tsns10,Puzzled_Phoenix," I don’t think I have the energy or maybe even the care to type out my life story. That would probably be a very dull read. I will go ahead and express what I am feeling present day. 

  I feel empty. I’ve felt that way longer than I’d like to acknowledge. Years of pretending to be a good guy. Witty, wise, caring, and always wearing a smile. It’s just too bad that smile was never real even in the moments I truly want it to be. Forced to wear a mask for so long that it grows into you becoming who you used to be but twisted. Strange looking in a mirror and barely recognizing who you’re even supposed to be after the old you died. Trying to crawl out of a grave too deep to reach freedom or peace and so I’m left with what I am now. An empty shell pretty on the outside with fading memories within that I wish to forget.

 Days feel like hours. Hours are seconds. Seconds are..well you get the point by now. I don’t feel any purpose anymore with the absence of anyone who could really care. Even when there was someone there they really weren’t. My comfort and kind nature benefited them and I never mattered when I wasn’t useful. I like to think it was just me creating an illusion that I won’t be alone. To be truly honest, I don’t understand why I do it. 

 I used to have faith in God. Now I don’t even know where I’m at with my spirit. Having gifts that don’t make sense or source. Visions, dreams too real for it to be lucid. Encounters of things I still can’t prove being anything but strange. Now a heavy weight sits inside of me making me feel alone. Not cold but heavy. It’s becoming unbearable. I’ve always been ok with not needing a big social life and even pretending didn’t bother me as much as this feeling does. It’s like I’m missing a piece of myself too important to ignore. 

 I don’t know where I’m going with all of this so I’m just gonna stop here.",2022-03-31 00:48:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609440350,2,/r/lonely/comments/tsns10/emptiness/,,0,0,Emptiness

in my relationships i want the attention, the affection all the time (probably saying something about me but idc) but i sit waiting, left only to be frustrated, confused, stressed and crying

I guess in a way, we're all ships at sea. We yearn to be able to find a port to dock at, and get to watch everyone else get their turn. Only difference is, these wooden boats can only handle so much turbulence on the hard waters and we're stuck in the way back of the big ol sea. Yeah, you go on Noble Barque. Enjoy being able to find refuge at a dock and peace. There is no such peace when you're lonely. 


Is that really a bad thing? I guess the answer is yes. Nobody to disappoint you, nobody to let you down when they forget anniversaries, birthdays... Nobody to cheat on you and leave you worse off than you were before. Then again, there's nobody to comfort you when you're sad. There's nobody to validate your feelings or make you feel better about the way you look -- so you use websites like Photofeeler and /r/rateme to try and feel comfortable in your own skin. Nobody will throw you a bone, though.. They're **brutally** honest -- which I guess is a good thing. After all, you wouldn't want someone blowing smoke, right? That'd make you feel twice as worse.


Feel, feel... FEEL. That fuckin word does more harm than good, most days. If we could just turn off emotions, would that make things better? Well... Probably not, honestly. We'd all be psychopaths. What would make politicians so special then, if EVERYONE was one? 


I dunno the point of posting this, honestly. Maybe someone can find peace knowing they're not the only one feeling this same way. Waking up every morning, almost disappointed they didn't expire last night because they have nobody in this life to make it worth while... Or haven't for such a long time that they're convinced it won't ever happen again. Maybe it won't. 



There are so many things in the world other than finding love, but then again nobody wants them unless they've already known the most important of them all : How it feels to just **be wanted** in someone's life. 



Yeah... You and I both, bud. I hope you find your safe passage, Noble Barque, 'cause I sure as shit won't.",2022-03-31 02:54:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,5,/r/lonely/comments/tsq3pw/maybe_someone_needs_to_read_this/,,0,0,Maybe someone needs to read this

All I've ever wanted in this world was love, not money, fame, cars, power, just simple love. 

What is the purpose of being alive without someone to share your life with¿ Even one sided love is better than the emptiness of existence. When you accept that you'll never truly have the one thing you want in life, your will to keep going gets snugged out just like that.

I guess I just don't have anything left in me, I feel like my insides are gone, like I'm hollow. 

People say ""it gets better"" or ""you're young give it time"" but there lies, it dosent get better, everyday is somehow worse than the last, just when you think things can't possibly hurt anymore, things somehow do.
One thing that never disappoints is pain, it's always there, always getting stronger until it breaks you.

I heard this quite recently that I've come to like a lot ""when a man meets a force he cannot destroy, he either submits to the pain or destroys himself.""

5658,tssqtg,Sparkie_Dime,"23m. As the title says, I feel I'm going to be forever alone. Dating is a hollow dead end. My depression has been getting increasingly worse recently along with family situations and most things in general. I'm honestly not sure how long I can deal with things going forward.

It's like I'm on failing autopilot that can do less and less as time goes on. I don't want to die or anything, but I don't want to stay living like this. When I think of the future I no longer think of me being in it. There's just this deep feeling of emptiness between being mostly numb or feeling stressed out by something.

I don't know what to do, times just a blur, and there seems to be no way out. Everytime I find a glint of hope, it's soon smudged out and turns out to be a mirage or so small and fast that it barely leaves an impression.

Depite arleady knowing the answers I keep asking myself how I even got here. I used to be so optimistic, carefree, and happy. Interested in every little thing and now I'm barely interested in anything at all.
I've ran out of distractions, self help only went so far, and some of the things I used to love now cause me great anxiety. I've got no money and once my phone finally stops working I'll be unable to do the few hobbies that stop me going insane with bordom. There's no opportunities here. Barely any respite from problems. No support I can currently get and nothing to look forward to, only the dread of what the next problems may bring.

Idk what the point of writing all this is for, knowing nothing is likely to change. Maybe the brief interactions in the comments. The few people who message then ghost after a short while. Prehaps just to feel heard and let others in my situation know they aren't totally alone. Maybe it's a cry for help from my subconscious. Maybe it's even a vain fantasy hope that I'll find someone by posting and it'll turn into something, but that's probably the least likely of all. Whatever the case. I hope you all have a better night/day than me and can have something good happen soon.",2022-03-31 05:30:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609952077,6,/r/lonely/comments/tssqtg/worthless_and_forever_alone/,,0,0,Worthless and Forever Alone.

5675,tsuuc2,Caleb556,"So it’s spring of my freshman year at college. I have a girlfriend and she’s super amazing, but I still feel lonely. It’s nothing about her, she makes me feel way less lonely, but I’ve been struggling to make friends. It’s been the root of my loneliness, especially since when I was in high school I was really social, had lots of friends, and made friends easily. But moving away changed that, I never talk to my old friends, except for one who lives an hour and a half away but I have no car so that’s out of the question. It’s just like over my 2020-2021 gap year I’ve been so much less social. I feel like it’s too deep into the year to start any new friendships as everyone else already has a group. I was super excited to start college, especially with the expectations I had from my parents stories from college. But it seems like it’s been the complete opposite. I don’t really get along with my roommate, he’s not bad or anything but our personality’s just don’t match. Idk if it’s technology or my newfound social anxiety, but I really want to have someone to hangout with other than my girlfriend. I want to have guys that I can talk to and party with, but I’m too scared that everyone will find me annoying. I did talk to some guys that I overheard talking about snowboarding. Because I snowboard, I tried talking to them to hopefully have some snowboarding friends. To me the convo seemed chill and natural, but I texted them after and they didn’t respond. Idk what to do, I’m too busy to join a club but too anxious to reach out to people individually.

These four people get out of a bar and walk behind me. It was two guys and two girls. I was assuming they were couples. They were walking faster and I pulled to the side to let them pass and before they did, one of the girls looked at me and said disgusting with the others laughing then going ahead of me. I know some of you will think I was just being paranoid and they were talking about something else but due to being called names throughout most of my adult life, I know the difference between personal attacks, and people talking to each other without talking about me. This was as personal as it gets. All four of them were attractive. I'm this unattractive guy who looks even worse due to illness. I can't take this anymore. This is what happens when I go outside. People will say, they are just four jerks, ignore them. If it was just them I could ignore them but it's been so many people throughout my adult life. This is why I don't have friends and will never have a sig. other. People think I'm disgusting. I can't take it anymore. Why do I have to be me?

5680,tsv87n,PurpleRazberry,"I’ve felt incredibly lonely and gone through several month long depressive episodes over the course of last year. I’m in college, so this has even caused me to fail this semester purely because of how much class I’ve missed when I couldn’t get out of bed. 

For context: I am a femboy, this is an identity I’ve grown much more comfortable with over the past year and it’s a part of myself that I could no longer leave behind even if I wanted. My (now ex I guess) girlfriend was never supportive. She had even said she couldn’t be attracted to me. 

This made me feel so alone, yet I couldn’t imagine ending things. We still loved each other (we still do). There were some points that it felt like killing myself would be the easier option, and honestly the intrusive thoughts of doing so we’re becoming more and more frequent and it was scary. 

I had decided a few weeks ago that we need to end things for both of our sakes, I could tell she wasn’t happy with me either. We had plans to go together to prom when I was home in the summer, so I thought I should wait till then. Both because I didn’t want to make her go on her own, and because I didn’t want to do it over text. That would’ve been in April, and in hind sight definitely too far off. She brought it up the other night, and after some discussion we ended things and are remaining friends. 

For some reason I can’t help but feel less alone now, I feel free to be myself. Don’t get me wrong, I haven’t been able to sleep the past two nights and I feel dead on my feet. But part of me feels excited thinking of all the things Im free to do now that I wasn’t before. I finally started telling other friends about myself (that are back home, everyone up here knows) a bit before this, and they’ve been supportive. 

I still am a lonely person in general. I have very few friends, even less who care, and now no girlfriend. But it feels better, like maybe I can actually find someone who loves me for who I am.

Maybe this is too optimistic for this sub but I finally feel like I’m at the end of this, I can finally get better and finally be happy. I can’t remember the last time I got to be happy, maybe it’s finally my turn.",2022-03-31 08:31:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646269777,16,/r/lonely/comments/tsv87n/my_girlfriend_of_25_years_left_and_i_felt_less/,,0,1,"My girlfriend of 2.5 years left, and I felt less lonely after"

I’ve typed this out 100 times but I can’t even describe the loss I’m feeling. I broke up with my my boyfriend of 4 years at the beginning of the month. I’m finishing my undergrad this semester and balancing an internship that will hopefully turn into a full time job. I couldn’t manage my time between that and his needs so I let him go. 

The first week he would text me each night, apologizing and saying how much he loves me. I wanted him so badly. I wanted to get back together but I put myself first. I blocked him this week to think everything over. This morning I got a call from his mother saying he had taken his own life and that he had written a letter for me before carrying out his final act. I’ve never felt so unbelievably empty, guilty, and worthless. I can’t accept that he’s gone. I don’t care about my future anymore I don’t deserve one. I would do anything to take it back and it’s killing me that now there’s nothing I can do.

To anyone that cares,
I don’t really know where else to turn. My depression is getting really hard to bear. The simplest tasks seem difficult because of the emotional pain that I am carrying. I feel like my heart is bleeding inside of me. I feel like, it feels like, the pain I feel emotionally feels like poison circulating through my viens, almost as if my blood itself was poison. There are so many negative feelings that I have about myself I can’t get rid of. I hate how hard it is for me socially. I hate how lonely I feel. I hate how awkward I can be. I hate how shy I am, how introverted I am. I want to change it. I have tried to change it. I desperately want to be different. I want people around me. The pain of loneliness cuts sharper than a knife. But it feels like all of these traits I deeply hate about myself are woven into my being and no matter how much i try to be confident or outgoing or gregarious I can’t. I feel like no of my dreams will come true. I feel like I’ll never find the family I want. I’m just too broken. I have so much emotional pain, it’s hard, I don’t even have that much at work to do today but it’s just hard to find the motivation to keep pushing everyday. I want it all to end. Please. I’m tired. I’m exhausted. I’m hurting. I’m in pain. I really want it to end. I’m tired of pushing everyday. I just, i don’t know what else to do. I needed somewhere to go to talk about the deep pain i feel.

5754,tt8no5,ItsMeZyphiria,"First of all, before I ramble I wanted to mention that I get attached to people EASILY and genuinely breaks my heart when they leave. Sorry for the long message..

Anyways, I basically grew up with this “ friend “ and his mom was basically my “ mother away from home “ we always hung out. As we got older, he sorta drifted away from me and I don’t know why. I’d always ask to hangout but he’d most of the time “ be busy “ .

We randomly one day hung out again and he took me to his other friends house. This new friend and I started to hangout ALOT. But slowly they started to leave me too but we’d always Discord call. I guess I discorded them because it felt like they were all I had and were my ONLY “ friend “ . But I always thought they’d only discord me because they didn’t have anyone else to hangout with at the moment or was bored. So I always felt like the last resort but still discorded because I felt lonely all day every day.

My childhood friend and the other friend I met used to ALWAYS hangout together. They still hangout to this day but I’m never invited and it genuinely breaks my heart.


To this day, I still discord this person because again, they are my only “ friend “ it feels like and if I stopped discording, I’d have no one else to talk to. I always feel like I’m the last resort and when we do hangout it’s once in a blue moon and I feel they only wanna hangout with me as they “ feel bad “ I guess.

Also, the other day my “ friend “ who I grew up with wanted to hangout. We didn’t really do anything except drive around in their car. But I don’t know if they genuinely wanted to hangout with me for me or because I knew a decent amount about investing and he wanted to learn from me as we used to be best friends.

I've been so lonely for the past years/months but it always seems to get worse around my birthday...

Does anyone have advice maybe or suggestions on what I should do for my birthday? I'm thinking about maybe treating myself to lunch and a margarita....

Trigger warning rape and sexual assault

I was assalulted by my sisters at the age of 6 till i was eleven years old. I told my mother and she told me i was being manipulated by the devil. My 22year old sister told me i would pay for what i have done and i have demons inside of me and may god have mercy on my soul

Ok so background, my mom earlier 2 weeks ago asked me if i was going to my sisters birthday dinner (today is her birthday). as soon as she asked, i immediately said no i wouldnt, and she asked me ""why not? Why are you still mad with her""

Like i havent told her my sisters have sexually assaulted me. And she has been staying by my sisters new house everyday. Like she doesnt want to be around me. And now it is my sisters birthday, and i feel as if she has chosen my sisters over me.

And i feel like i am on an island by myself, No friends, or even a phone. Trying to learn how to code, and having no one to talk to but myself. Am i wrong to feel this way? That She has chosen them over me?

Cause im starting to feel like the demon she called me that night i told her what happened to me as a kid. I feel like i am Lucifer who has just fallen from heaven. Is this normal, did any of you feel the same way?",2022-03-31 22:53:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603612775,5,/r/lonely/comments/ttc0l8/hey_i_have_been_abused_my_entire_live_and_i_need/,,0,8,hey I have been abused my entire live and i need love

First part of the lyrics are these

 ""This is for all the lonely people  
Thinkin' that life has passed them by  
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup  
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single people  
Thinkin' that love has left them dry  
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup  
You never know until you try""

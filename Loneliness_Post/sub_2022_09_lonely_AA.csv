48,x2xer0,MinimalCollector,"After a few weeks of back and forth tension and playfulness, I asked a coworker to do something with me outside of work. Fairly attentive to the odd one-off things I'd say and would recall them weeks later. Very positive yes-man type of person. After an hour of conversation, in the middle of which I tried to depart saying ""I'll let you go, you're busy"" and she'd smile at me, sit on her desk and say ""No, I don't have anything going on right now."" I thought after a few weeks of stuff like this that I had a chance?

 She seemed surprised but agreed and seemed enthusiastic about it. We seemed to have had a good time. But since then it's been lukewarm. I had asked if she wanted to do something again the following weekend, to which she had family coming to visit. She said maybe that Sunday but wasn't sure. I said no worries and maybe we could find another time. I left it in her court, and she never followed up and work has been the same as usual. I want to ask her again but I don't want to be pushy. I think it's time to throw it in

I'm disheartened. She's still just as kind and sweet as usual. But I know if she had wanted to do something again, the ball was in her court. I see her every day, and when she's just as nice as she was before it almost stings a little. She has such a sweet smile and the look she gives me regularly makes me melt. But anyone I've spoken to about it agrees that she would have done something by now if she was interested, platonic or otherwise. 

I almost wish I didn't make a suggestion to hang out. I think I enjoyed having my little work crush and the ambiguity of it. I feel gross that I'm still thinking about her this way. I haven't had feelings for anyone in about three years and as sad as it sounds, this is the first time in a very long time I've felt like a living person when talking to her. I thought maybe this was a lucky break. I'm not sure what else to do but whenever she's overtly kind to me at work it just makes me feel melancholic.

I recently came home from a bachelor party. The social life was great and the environment electric. For once I was able to be social and be myself.
Coming home I've been burdened with loneliness. I realized I moved away to be where i am, my social life is my partners network of friends and family. I have no one to chill with away from that. Nor have I met anyone new in years.

74,x30h06,endless_afterthought,"I'm so lonely. But I find that the wrong connections can actually make you feel lonelier, drain you even. 

So I try and keep to certain preferences and boundaries whenever I seek connections but I end up not really finding anyone I can connect with properly. 

Because of my trauma the only relatively ""safe"" option for me to have human interactions is online, and I find myself on reddit friendship subs a lot of times. Sometimes lurking, sometimes posting. 

I'm in my 30s, and I prefer talking to people around my age or older; I find the familiarity of having lived out the same timelines at a similar age helps with the connection. 

I feel too old for most people on here and cannot relate much to their lingo even if I'm just a few years older, and as much as they say they are more mentally mature for their age some sort of gap is still prevalent, I can't explain it but it's there.

And since I ask for people around my age and only for platonic connections, I mostly get messages from married people (they say that since they're married it will always remain platonic - fair point I guess) 

But while I'm not out for a relationship and I know married people also get lonely and need friends I still feel so uncomfortable messaging with them. I admit it's because of me low-key envying them for having someone and sometimes hearing them talk about their SO just feels incredibly mocking sometimes. And as someone who gets possessive and jealous (I'm too broken and toxic for proper relationships I'm afraid), I would be livid if I have a partner who is on their phone all the time messaging someone from the opposite sex sharing stories and details of a personal nature and being affectionate and clingy to them. Because that's how conversations with these people usually are from my experience. As respect for their partners, I tend to just leave the convos or not start any with someone who says they are married. 

And while I would love to message with other women too I find that they only message two days at most and respond a few times, I've never had an engaging convo that lasted for a few days even for some reason.

Then there are also people whose profiles already have tell-tale signs I won't get along with them: 
men (in their late thirties or forties) who ask women (17 to early twenties) to DM them; men who only ever post compliments to women's photos on selfie subs that when they tell you in messages that you're beautiful and all, it feels generic and insincere. And don't get me started on those people who blatantly post photos of them naked and frequent obscene subs mostly. 

And then there are those users who like to pick fights and call people names, put people down in comment sections and just overall abusive with their words (which shows how they are mentally as well) that it makes me scared of even starting any conversation with them as they remind me of my dad (the major culprit of my cptsd).

Then there are people who seem to be decent at the start but then have traits that end up hurting me nonetheless; like someone saying a dish from my country looks like someone had been sick in it, someone who gets obviously upset when I have to be off my phone to work, someone who keeps pressuring me for photos, someone who keeps on insisting I do things with them for ""bonding"" and ""fun"" without regard for my time or my preferences (constantly asking to watch this film together or cook this dish at the same time and make me get ingredients and get upset if I don't or to repeatedly ask me to download a game when I don't want to or learn a language and obsess about me not progressing with them).

And there are people who don't understand that healing from a relationship is different for everybody and seem to get frustrated I'm still grieving over my past just because they let me vent a few times. Or the ones who don't understand how depression works and tell me things like ""there's no space for depression here, you can stop those thoughts"" and scarcely reply when I start spiraling when all I need is someone to just be with me. 

I don't know why I can't seem to find anyone for long- term connections, am I asking for much? Am I being unreasonable?

I'm so lonely but I feel like it's of my own making now.

You might see someone and think ""how did this person manage to get a gf/bf?"" but to that I say, life's not fair. It's sadening to see how everyone is so divided yet remains ignorant of eachother.

Tell you what, if you ever feel lonely without a partner, just think that those who are in a relationship at very young age or at their first relationship are probably just dating to be dating. By that I mean they won't last long. And if it doesn't work when you try with someone, be happy that at least you didn't keep going for something that ultimately wouldn't have worked

154,x3f20z,[deleted],"Hey, so, um I don't know what to title this post but I'm gonna try to keep it as relevant as possible.

So, um, I'm a 20 year old guy, trying to have a successful life, unlike my parents. Well, my so-called dad abandoned me and my mom had to work to make sure that I was well-treated. But it just created more seperation between me and my mother, I found myself to be lacking motherly love and honestly, I feel I'm a disgrace to almost everyone who believes in me. I have some Mommy issues, not that I really want to work it out, but since I know how it feels to not have love IRL, I try to be a Mommy for my fellow random strangers online, to ensure that atleast they aren't suffering like me, or worse than me.

So, as I grew up, I later realised that My Mom actually wanted a girl child, and so, I was treated like one. During childhood, I was often called upon by my mother, stating that I'd be having my periods if I were a girl and a LOT of other stuffs. I often spent my childhood alone, isolated, because I'd see my parents fighting, and my depressed mother at a really younger age. So, I couldn't really share what's in my mind cuz I didn't want to burden anyone else. What eventually happened is that I wanted to be a girl, influenced, apparently. However, the place where I'm from, transformation is not really a wide well-known thing and it's really expensive. Besides even if I did transform now, it wouldn't really mean anything. I'm too ethnic to do such stuff, honestly.

I wanted to be financially independent. And right now, if you actually look upto my life, I own a freelancing business, I have to manage two study courses, I wanna play videogames at times, and I'm a musician. You would think that my life is already pretty awesome. It isn't. When I started earning, potentially more than my mom, she got into this deep ego-problem, and basically started seperating things into her and mine. Well, I only have a laptop that's entirely mine in the whole house. And she would make me feel worse. If I talk my heart out to her, she would use it against me. And out of all the people that I've known and talked to, I can't really find a good person to trust and you know, be friends. My social skills are so poor because well, I was shut up watching my parents fight.

In my studies, ofcourse, it was difficult for me to focus especially when I'm earning. I want to expand my business, I want to study hard, I want to be the best pianist the world has ever known, I wanna learn the guitar, I wanna learn the drums, I wanna make my own website, sing professionally, ah, a lot of dreams. Often times, when I think about it, I feel sad that I can't pursue any of them and I start procrastinating. Since I'm not focusing on my studies, my mom would give me a lecture on that, demoralising me further.

So um, I look out for love from people. Since I'm socially awkward, I can't really get any girls. Even if I do, I make it too late and I'm stuck in the friendzone. The women around me say that I'm a good flirt, but I'm just too slow or too shy to make a move. When I tried to talk to women online, here, my chat wasn't accepted at all most of the times, even if someone did out of pity, I personalised the conversation a lot that I scared them away. I want to be abroad, away from my family and potentially, finding a partner there. But if I can't talk to women online, how would I actually have a significant other. (sighs)

Besides, I'm really sorry. I know this is more of a rp subreddit, but I really wanted to speak my heart out. I was depressed for a while and I couldn't open up to anyone. I don't have any IRL friends whom I can trust, honestly.

So, my question to you is, Am I really that un-date-able? Can I not be fixed?

And please don't suggest me to go for therapy. It's way too expensive and I can't really afford to go when my mother's controlling my life out here.

Sorry to be bothering your precious time. Have a great day. Peace &lt;3",2022-09-01 18:37:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/x3f20z/i_really_couldnt_think_of_a_title_ps_sorry/,,0,0,I really couldn't think of a title (PS:- Sorry)

157,x3fbor,Worshipper61,"I’ve suffered my entire life from depression of varying degrees. I’ve never had a relationship, well at least not a healthy one. Always one based on the other person wanting me to do something for them or for me to give them something. So I am bi and about 6 months ago I reconnected with a guy I had first met several years back but we ended up drifting separate ways but not from some falling out. But for the last six months he and I have been spending a lot of time together about a third of the week time wise. I didn’t reconnect with him in pursuit of any relationship other than buddies BUT it gravitated into being a FWB arrangement and then got even deeper by both of us doing overnighters. And slowly but surely after months of him calling me sexy, handsome, honey etc plus us smoking weed and him giving me shotguns I allowed the walls to come down and began reciprocating that affection. Well a week ago he got really sick that required an ER visit. The night before however he had come over to my house and that night he developed a fever and chills. I gave him some Tylenol and wrapped him up tight with blankets AND ME. And while he was laying there shivering I hugged him tight and told him I hate to see you like this. I care about you. I love you. Neither one of us had ever said those three words before. We woke up the next morning. He went home and then he took himself to the ER. I told him to please let me care for you and told him it’s important to me. Don’t leave me out because you’ll hurt me. So then after he got home I asked him what he needed first and he said that a buddy of his was bringing him his dinner and was going to pick up his prescriptions and wanted me to then come over after his friend left As I had expected that did a number on me and as I often do to deal with sadness and depression I fell asleep. When I woke up at 8:30 I saw he had texted me saying his buddy got tied up and was a no show and asked me if I was coming over to stay with him. I told him now I’m hurt AND mad because he hadn’t eaten or gotten any meds. I drove over to his place with food but told him I am not staying the night. He apologized the next day. To wind this story up I asked him “how exactly would you describe our current relationship?”  He said “I wouldn’t, I don’t like labels. I’m fine with it as is without labeling us. Now come over here and hug on me”. I told him I think I better back up now. I think I put a scare on you saying I love you and so you asked your friend to care for you instead of me. I think the wise thing for me to do to protect myself from getting hurt is label us as friend status. No more overnighters, no sexual anything because to me I can’t just sport f*ck with you without getting damaged because my heart has gotten involved. Long story short he went from initially apologizing to now calling me an asshole and has cut off all contact not even wanting to be friends.

We're not officially dating yet but we could very much be and we're slowly getting there, enjoying the journey. Regardless of how it ends I haven't smiled so frequently and continuously in so long, and all the negative feelings I had about myself and my life vanish when I'm with this person. They invalidate every bad thought I had about myself just by being by my side. I almost cannot believe my luck, but I know it's not pure luck. Despite how often I cried out of loneliness, I tried, and I got rewarded for it eventually, and for that I am incredibly grateful.

I'm not trying to invalidate people's feelings, I just see a lot of negative posts in here I hope a 'success story' kind of post every once in a while would make people feel better when they come to this sub feeling lonely.

164,x3g480,natepow666,"At one point I was married to a very beautiful woman, in my young 20's. She was always far prettier than I should have ever been able to obtain, she was a strong brunette with beautiful green eyes.. always a perfectly maintained body shape. She was short, but with class, wit, and intelligence...the body of a model, and a mind worthy of a scientist. Its been many years and I haven't even spoke to anyone remotely as beautiful as she. Not to mention, she was the love of my life.

Anyways, years into our relationship, and also at the end of it, I struggled to perform in bed. I was getting out of shape, and I was losing my own libido. Sex between us became rare and when it did happen it felt robotic and programmed. We fought about it constantly. 

All of those things were real. In reality, eventually I asked her to leave and she moved out and left.. end of story. However, in my nightmare, somehow we ended the relationship and she kept living with me. Next thing I know, one of my best friends of today, Jonathan, was there. 

Jonathan isn't an average man, hes an airmen in the air force, is incredibly ripped and his accomplished far more than I'll ever be able to. Hes a man who doesn't have to try hard to constantly find ladies in his bed. 

My nightmare began with jonathan entering my apartment.. and my ex wife telling me theres nothing I can do. She just glared at me with disgust, and reminded me I can never have her again. She grinned as he whipped out a massive c*ck and began giving her his best. He lets out a menacing laugh as he inserts it inside of her.

Meanwhile, I remained frozen.. incapable of movement. All I could do was lay there on the floor, and clench the pain I felt in my gut. Tears rolled out of me as I basked in humiliation and disgust. Words keep screaming at me from all directions... attacking me with effortless strength. Things like, ""Your Pathetic"", ""What a loser"", ""he should just kill himself"", and ""what an idiot"". Moaning sounds of pleasure and chuckles surrounded me. The moment continued for what felt like days. It wasn't going to end.. I was stuck there for an eternity. 

Finally, after another image of her letting out a powerful, screaming orgasm followed by a violent chuckle... my eyes opened and the nightmare was over. I could only lay there in bed and feel everything I felt before... what if that was really me? I still feel the pain.

After all, 5 years after my marriage I remain here alone and unable to find another partner. I'll never find anyone as good as my ex, not even close.",2022-09-01 19:22:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1585090752,14,/r/lonely/comments/x3g480/i_had_a_nightmare_where_i_was_a_cucked_but_it/,,0,16,I had a nightmare where I was a cucked... but it definitely was NOT a fantasy.

Also just started playing osrs again so if you wanna play on that it would be cool. 

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

Ive been having a bad time with anxiety, so I’ve found myself unable to initiate anything with anyone I met last year, even if it’s just messaging to see if they are in town. As a result of things that happened last year, I don’t really tend to meet up with people unless it’s at class or a society event, and even then it’s a very small group.

This isn’t necessarily too bad, but what made me break down crying was when I wanted to talk to someone about how I was feeling kinda bummed about the situation, and I realised I had no one to message.

180,x3i7sr,big_millennial96,"Bit of backstory. I’ve never really had that many friends at once throughout my life. Mostly just stuck to two or three close friends at one time. A couple years ago I met my now boyfriend and became friends with two of his friends. 

For the last two years these three people have been my only social connections. We used to talk all the time and play PlayStation most nights but now I have conflicting job schedules with them and they all have their own friends that they’ve met through their jobs and such. 

Now most of my evenings are spent coming home from work and asking if anyone is busy or wants to play and their either at work or hanging with their other friends. My boyfriend is there for me as much as he can be but sometimes he leaves me to go be with his other friends. I don’t mind him doing this and I’m happy that he’s able to have other friends that aren’t me but I just feel really jealous and lonely. 

I have suffered with bpd throughout my teenage years and my early adulthood so friendships and connections are a difficult thing for me especially when I see them all out having fun with their friends I find it really hard not to get angry or feel abandoned because of this. 

It’s not their fault and I’m not mad at them for having friends but I just feel so left out and lonely. The evenings are the worst. I get really upset and I can’t even do things like watch Netflix or listen to music because I can’t stop thinking about how lonely I am. I loose my appetite most nights and just end up lying in bed scrolling on tiktok waiting for my boyfriend to come home at 2am. I love my boyfriend and my friends but I can’t help but be jealous of them.",2022-09-01 20:50:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1546167379,5,/r/lonely/comments/x3i7sr/i_feel_so_lonely_in_the_evenings/,,0,4,I feel so lonely in the evenings

231,x3own1,place_of_desolation,"Often, like now, I just wish with every fiber of my being - to the point it makes me almost shake - that I had a woman in my life, that I had someone to come home to like most other normal adults, that I had someone who loves me and gives a fuck about me and would ask how my day went and hug me when I come home. A hug...being touched by someone I love, the most natural thing in the world. I'm so fucking touch starved, I'd probably just cry.  

Loneliness has been my default for as long as I can remember. I don't know how it feels to not be lonely. I don't know how it feels to truly be desired. It's a mythical state to me. I've always had difficulty with dating and making/keeping friends (due to being neurodivergent), and this has only gotten harder as I've gotten older since there are fewer single people and it's harder to get into established social circles. I've mostly been single all my life and it is really demoralizing entering middle age alone. I do have a few friends and acquaintances who I see occasionally, but they are all partnered up and rarely have the time.

My 44th birthday is coming up soon (which I'll be celebrating with a parent, like always), an age I can't relate to at all. It's soul crushing to still be at square one at an age when many have grown children by now and many years filled with happy memories, while I go years without even a date. Multiple blocks of years slide by in what feels like weeks, unmarked by any significant memory, and suddenly I'm not a young man with my whole life ahead of me anymore. I'm now looking at the very real prospect of growing old alone, becoming even more invisible in a future that doesn't look worth seeing through to the end.  

In the interest of taking control of my life, I've made a lot of progress in both my physical shape and social health, but is it too little, too late? Middle-aged unattached men are basically invisible to women.

Why does love just happen for a lot of people, yet for others it takes an act of god (who I don't even believe in anymore)? That's all I want in this life...someone to light up my world and make the drudgery worth it. I'm so tired of going through life alone. I don't know how much longer I can do it.",2022-09-02 01:46:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1570662820,7,/r/lonely/comments/x3own1/going_through_life_alone/,,0,10,Going through life alone

238,x3pe23,Appropriate-Code6035,"Hello Reddit!

I am a fellow internet lurker to many of you here. I've never made any of your acquaintance before now. And I decided I really needed to finally make an account on this website just to express my voice of this struggle.

I've heard so many indifferent quotations in my time surfing the Net about Reddit as a whole.  How it is full of cult like mentality thinking, immoral degenerates, and basically a overall negative view of this social media platform. Even I myself have a sceptical eye to anything being authentic on a social media website. As it's prone to confirmation bais, invalidation of people's experiences, and a victim mentality. 

But overall my time of browsing this site from afar searching relatable question to answers has been an overall positive experience for me. It has helped me greatly in understanding myself, finding people of similar personality, and just feeling more comfortable with who I am. For someone like myself a total shut in who lives inside his head, and has made more metaphorical walls around him besides mental one's. Hiding inside the four walls that is my bedroom, and having too much social anxiety to let any light at the end of the tunnel in most days. I find a place to like Reddit helps me massively. As I am not the type to open up to people. Rather I search up my problems. 

When I find someone going through a similar experience to me like this subreddit as an example. I feel so much better about myself. It's my own personal free private therapy. I know all in all it is basically looking for a confirmation bais. But simply seeing that someone in a place like this feels, lives, breaths, sleeps, the same way I do. It brings tears to my eyes. That something so effortless, and expansive as the human experience, with it's vast worlds of uniqueness. Someone in this crazy world is exactly like me without either of us knowing it, we've already saved each other from isolation inside. Even though I myself know that I do not reach out to show I am listening. I am there in the shadow of that other person's pain knowing what it feels like to be the outcast. 

It's the ability to save someone from themselves without speaking. By speaking, in terms you've saved someone from a life time of guilt of feeling like the only one experience that is real. We get so caught up in our minds that sometime we really believe that our experience, is the true experience, the only experience, and the only one, that can experience our pain. While in generality a true statement, your not alone with the issue you're facing in daily life. Beyond being in the abstraction if you're taking away the voices around you. Then yes you still are alone in a immediate sense. But if you tune in correctly, you are heard, and listened too, and your voice is growing here on Reddit with others similar, and it's morphing into a powerful shout that will shake the heavens (Yes...I am referencing Skyrim a bit...as I love Elder Scrolls lore and games sorry in advance.)  

But I just had to say how grateful I am. How proud even I am of fellow Reddit users. Who have more confidence than me to go on a public forum/group and to do talk therapy. If I was half of strong as some of you here of character. I wouldn't be in half the  situation I have gotten myself in over the years. The struggles of bad mental situation I've put myself in, due to my constant inaction to do anything as a reference point, poor emotional detachment to protect myself from pain, always a conflict aversion type of person which gets me pushed over, and just plain introversion at times, and being ignorant to other people feelings about me. I would probably have friends. I would probably also not be on Reddit r/lonely subreddit. So do believe all of this comes to a point at the end of my tangent. 

If I am being honest with all of the people here on this Subreddit now. As I feel it is my time to shine, and speak my voice on the elephant in the room we all won't address in our daily lives. I've been thinking within myself for years now about this issue, and I've fallen into many dark ideological spaces online. Which was very hard on me mentally. And the reason I feel into such places of complete wrong think, and judgement of fellow humans around me, thinking I knew a greater universal true, a egotistical god complex of self absorption to over analyse my experiences, trying to fit into the wrong groups of people who didn't fit my true narrative of what I want in a person. This and more happen because I am a very lonely male. At 23 years old I've always felt alone, I've never felt fulfilled by the relationships I have made in my daily life. Nowadays it's lack thereof as I don't have any friends online, or offline. And with this new found freedom of zero distractions, no reason to uphold social media accounts, or post what has happened to me over the years. I have basically dropped of the face of the planet. I can go years without interaction with someone of my age group. I have tried to rectify this with looking for groups, or recreational hobbies outside, but my also bizzare work times of 3am starts, and 1pm afternoonish finish times, puts me away from most people. As they're still studying in school/working/busy.

I've noticed my isolation isn't necessarily as much self inflicted as much as I blame myself above. But it is super hard with a whole different lifestyle to most, a more naturally reserved person who isn't opened to new experiences, and someone like me who's all I've ever known is spending time alone in my room. Finding anyone motivation to put myself out there even when situation allows it. So my next best option is finding online friends. I'm not sure about all of you here, and you're successes with that outlet. But here's my two cents...

Whenever I personally interact with someone online. That is to say when I manage to finally meet someone online who gets past my social awkwardness, oversharing of concepts, and messages with super long ranty texts like you see above, and small talk. I always feel like it's a one sided ordeal that the effort I try to maintain this relationship is never reciprocal. It ends up me getting so frustrated enough that I sadly have to end the friendship because I get sick of always messaging first, always trying to engage with the deeper questions beyond their situation, or dissecting it properly to find a good solution, trying to send long messages that go into detail about what's on my mind, or how I am feeling at the current moment in time. (Like right now as example. This is how Vayillia talks to people normally not a one off Reddit post.) Everything I'd think someone would want as a friend online, or in real life.

Perhaps there's a disconnect between what I think people want, and what they actually desire. And I've misinterpreted their kindness as a green light to information dump all over them becoming overbearing and pushing them away.  I don't rule that out as a possibility but it is frustrating to me none of the less. As like anyone here I just want to express myself. If that's something someone doesn't want to hear I wish they'd just tell me honestly that they're not interested hearing my thoughts/feelings. It ends up making me retreat further within myself. As I already struggle in my daily life to have self confidence to have a conversation with someone. When I try online to be my absolute self to make up for the loss of time I get gaslight. I know for online interactions people either swing to two extremes. They're totally fake to who they're in person, more colder online, and more quicker to judgemental, bullying very aggressive with their tone, responses. The other side is far more authentic to who they're or want to be as a person but cannot for whatever reason. So this will manifest in positive ways for them, more understanding of someone needs for connection, they spend more time showing consistency to the relationship, willing to talk about anything and ask the deeper question about the why that is,  and just overall being a good friend.

I can see my own self injection here writing this. I am sorry if it comes off as I have a moral high ground. I wasn't trying to explain myself in that way at all. Mainly I'm sure a lot of you understand this way of interacting with people online there's various spectrum of engagement. And depending on the person's ""Persona."" online all in all who they're trying to be through the expression of the internet. Will depend greatly on the type of interactions you'll have with them on a intellectual level.  I don't like dishonesty in all forms, and I find the internet at times can be the number one place for making a cult of personality work for you. We see it all the time in many social media celebrities. So don't be surprised online when someone has totally distinguished the internet from reality in their mind. Thinking they can go about treating people here like trash, and in real life be a much kinder empathetic person.  That to me is a dangerous mentality to have as the online sphere is the most real place I know off. Without this Subreddit I'd be lost as a person. I need you guys honesty more than anything. I cannot believe people abuse the beauty of places like this for clout chasing.

In many discussion I've had with my older sibling about life in general. I've come to the conclusion for myself all I want is to understand the world around me as accurate as possible. The loneliness aspect is also apart of this life. Though I am not pleased of this discovery. I will try everything in my power to fix it by expressing myself here honesty here as that's the trait I value the most. I think this is a pretty difficult world in modernistic times to not be alone. I personally try not to fall into the trap of thinking. (Though honestly I am struggling with this factor a lot nowadays.) that as an introverted male. I do not ever want to do small talk, and people are a waste of time for me, because they do not under my personality for internalization and quietness. And that I am not made for this extroverted world of tendencies needed to strive in this competitive world of dog eats dog. All true in a simplistic worldview looking from the outside without the nuances. But in principle the ideological flaw lives inside me. If I want to meet people, I have to meet the demons inside myself. I need to forget pre-conceived notions. I need to try small talk as a basic foundation for formality later on build it up to more depth through trust and consistency. 

But I will never achieved these things in an isolation mindset. Introversion to me has been a double edged sword. In some aspects I accept that I am naturally reserved. But by being so reserved, and closed off from the outside in perspectives, it's harder for someone to break down my metaphorical barrios for connection. The more quiet I am in the background of a scene, the harder it is to be a point of interest in the painting on the canvas. I struggle with the distinction. I think all introverted persons do. We want to be noticed while being the wallflower. It's extremely difficult tugged the mental battle of detachment, confliction aversion, and desperate to be accepted by someone. Someone has to ""Show up."" in these situations and you can be sure it isn't the introverted person. Not out of malice but we just like to only interject our voice when it holds value. But for this fast paced world value is something that is constant. If you're not constantly in the presence of the cultural zeitgeist then to most you do not exist and therefor to many you're not very valuable. 

It's not the issue of validation that we all seek. It's how we are recorded, and referenced for later attachments. We are the social creatures that care a lot about our ""Impressions."" the masks that we wear in the external reality. But for someone like an Introvert the Tatemae (Society mask) is a harder concept to manage. We want to be Honne (Ourselves) but in this society we have to mask social personas of energy, engagement, social confidence, that we may not have in social situations.  This can leave someone even further isolated. As to why the whole social pheromone in Japan of Hikkimori exist. Tatemae (Society mask) philosophy of external self says you must keep up appearances no matter the intro or extroversion of personality. This is what many Introverts struggle with, and why introversion I think leads to more social isolation than extroverts. We are the extroverts of the online world. And without such spaces of true self expression for people us we'd be long gone, and forgotten by most of society as social rejects we cannot conform in a Tatemae way. 

All in all I just for myself want to make some friends who understand the way I see the world. Hopefully someone who will at least read this, and understand it's basic concepts. I don't want to post this as ""Victim mentality."" whatsoever so please do not misunderstand my post. I just wanted to express my view of loneliness, myself a bit, and a thank you to the r/lonely subreddit for keeping me alive. I have wrote all this as my usual ranty, nonsensical self, as honest and overwhelming as usual, typos, and errors be damned lol. I hope whoever read this learnt something new. And if it did fall into obscurity that's also fine. As simply express all this down in words my recent thoughts/feeling/struggles means the absolute world to me. I'm new to Reddit so will mess up as I go along don't worry. 

So thank you all again for everything. I will continue to lurk as a no responder. As I love what all of you say here even if no one seems to read and listen I do I promise. If anyone also wants to write me here and be friends feel free I am open to terrible posts like this one haha.

See you space cowboys :)

242,x3psq8,thewitch045,"Hi everyone,

I recently got out of a relationship. The break-up was mutual, but I brought it up. He was going through some stuff before we got together, and I knew about it. Then, something happened with his family. He started to slowly isolate himself because he didn't want to drag me down with him. Our communication was only once a week after that. I still made sure to tell him that I love him, and hope he has a good day. Then, he started to say he needs to talk to me. He said it on multiple occasions. So, after a while, I took the initiative and told him that I need to know. He basically said he doesn't think he's mentally healthy for a relationship, and that I deserve better. And we broke up after that. I know I did the right thing for both of us, but I miss him so much. He did say that he'd take a chance on us again, but right now just isn't the time. His birthday was a few days ago, and I did say happy birthday. And he responded, then I replied. We talk every now and then, but it's mostly me reaching out to him. A part of me feels like taking a break and giving him space. It would benefit us both, I think. Him more than me. I just don't know what to do. I've told my sister and she said that I shouldn't because I'm basically throwing that second chance away. I don't know how to talk to him about this without wanting to cry or feeling like I'm adding more to his burdens.

251,x3qlrv,lifewdbebetterasacat,"I've been dealing with depression, suicide thoughts and chronic pain since around 11 years old. And with complex trauma, since 3 yo.

Things are getting worse and worse, the physical pain has destroyed my life and taken away my money  and its getting insanely worse and unbearable. 

Please do not talk to me about treatments. Yes, over 30 years I have tried pretty much everything,  traditional and non traditional. Really everything. In the last decade and a half I isolated myself, because I feel a LOT of pain and its exhausting not being able to do simple things, especially during the crisis, its exhausting always having to explain (especially explain that no,  its not going to get better in a few days), answer about all the suggestions of treatment  listening to people that don't believe in the disease, complaining etc. Its hard to see people leaving (I don't blame them  I would leave my painful body if I could. I wake up playing for God to kill me during the crisis, and a crisis can take 6 months.

I can only count on myself, I need to work and cook and clean and solve normal day by day issues and Im feeling more and more incapable of dealing with that. My mind and body are burned out.

Yes  I get emotionally better when I have loving people around. The pain doesn't get better, but it gets more bearable when im not alone. However, I got so isolated and im so hurt from past experience that I have literally no one left. And the rest of the people only see a mask of someone that is always smiling or disapears because is busy (its too much work telling the truth).

I have no family and the family I had has probably a lit to do with my health issues, due to all the years of abuse, violence and other things.

I only wish I had someone who loves me and cares for me and hugs me,  checks on me everyday. I wish I was the SO for someone, that I was part of someone""s life, that I was really important for that one person. But I won't be. I just won't.

259,x3rjq9,PsalmoftheSad,"Every day I spend alone feels just like the first step of a thousand-mile journey... Except this time I don't have anything to look forward to at the end of it. 


A few months back I made a post that I met a girl through work and I was cautiously optimistic... And rightfully so. Her and I have been on two dates so far but the conversation died. Only time her and I will talk nowadays is if I message her first or send a stupid fuckin meme. I'm still alone -- shit, Monday I could've died in a fuckin accident I had at work and the only people that would know (or even care for that matter) are my folks and my coworkers. Mostly because they'd have to find a new guy to take my place, but that's neither here nor there. 


I'm a quarter of a century old and only recently went on my first date **EVER** -- something that should'a happened a decade ago. I'd say better late than never, but sometimes I lament over all the fuckin time I've pissed away. How many hours did I spend deciding to play video games instead of hanging out with my friends? That actually had a lot to do with the fact that my mother never let me do shit as a kid, but I could've just as easily found a way if I was determined enough. How many hours worth of porn have I perused as if I was getting paid to do it? I guarantee you I'm not gonna be on my death bed with my last words ""boy I sure wish I watched more porn."" 



No.. I'm gonna be sad, just like I am right now, over all the time I wasted. Over all the missed opportunities I had to meet someone, whether it be from lack of trying or just not caring enough. Shit... Maybe I was just too shy. Whatever the reason might be, I don't really care at this point. It's moot -- and why the fuck wouldn't it be? 



I'm gonna remember the time in my life where I actually had some meaning. That one glimmer of hope in an otherwise pitch black tunnel. It was a LDR, because of fuckin course it was -- nobody would want to see my ugly mug in person. Not a day goes by where I don't think about her, and maybe I don't even love her anymore. Maybe all I miss is having someone that gave a shit if I died at work in an accident. Maybe I miss sending her gifts in the mail for her birthday and making her videos to show how much I love her. Maybe I miss staying up till 6 every Friday night because I didn't have school in the morning so we could spend it in a call together because she'd cry when I'd have to hang up for the night. Maybe I miss telling my ma about her and how excited and happy she made me just for ma to shrug because it's something on the internet therefore ""it's not real"" 


... She showed up to my workplace one day, too. It wasn't on purpose, I actually worked at a Lowe's at that time. Her and her dad showed up because he was working on a project. She saw me.... And faked a phone call instead of saying hi. 



And yes, this is the closest thing I had to ""true love."" So... I guess this is life. Alone",2022-09-02 03:56:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628561032,4,/r/lonely/comments/x3rjq9/so_is_this_life_now/,,0,4,So... Is this life now?

You can also just send me memes and I’ll send you some back, or I can rate your homemade memes before you post them (I hope they’re good).

I used to have a lot of friends, but because of my bipolar and drug addiction I lost them. Problem is, part of the reason I had those friends is because we used to smoke and drink together.

Marijuana makes me psychotic, and alcohol increases my risk of relapse. I have to stay away from both, and as an adult it is hard to find sober friends. Plus, I’m so fucking self conscious when I’m sober I come off as awkward and weird. I probably come across as too much and weird when I used too, but I was more outgoing.

I try making friends at work, group therapy, 12 step meetings, and online, but people always just become friendly acquaintances. No one calls, no one texts, no one adds me on Facebook or Instagram. I’m tall, half black, big boned, and strong so maybe that puts people off in one of the whitest cities in America. I don’t talk like I’m black, and I don’t look white. I like Anime, games, lifting weights, and literature. I don’t care for sports, which it seems everyone in my demographic is into.

I recently started my freshman year of Highschool and things were a little shitty at first, lot’s people that I don't know, and none of my friends go to the same school, no one. Just me, myself, and I. But it's like the third week and I've met some great people! Especially my one friend, let’s call him Zalen.

Now being a homosexual such as myself and having a certain personality trait(mainly mine) can be really tough at times. Zalen’s a great guy, funny, smart, playful, etc. But here comes the big problem, he's straight. For me, it's like “Oh, look at that cute dude. I'm gonna be friends with him and beg and hope and pray to God that one day he’ll be into me” But that's never the chase, is it?

Sometimes, I'll just go into my room, lock the door, turn on my music and try to find the dumbest thing to cry about, sometimes I'll just force myself to cry cause I have nothing better to do with my life. And I'll just sit there, thinking about shit that's happened in the past, is used to so fuckin easy back then...

305,x3ygoz,ivealreadyReddit00,"alright, so, the more days pass the more I understand that making friends is a whole lot harder when you’re not playing with a good hand. What do I mean by that? I’m saying that while the term “anyone can make friends” is technically true, some people sure do have it a whole lot easier. Take attractiveness for example, this isn’t going where you think it is so stay with me, conventionally attractive people always have at least some attention right? Granted it can be positive or negative. I’m gonna sound bitter saying this but we, as humans, are vain when it comes to looks, and I’m a bit of a hypocrite. People ignore people they believe to be “ugly “ all the time, as for i, I admit there’s been a time or two I didn’t wanna talk to someone because of their mannerisms or appearance but I never let it stop me from being kind and I never was rude. But, appearance to some people is just this mega factor to them, like “oh my god I just CANT be friends with an uggo!” I thought beauty was subjective? That’s only one part though, if you’re lucky enough for someone to wanna talk to you because they weren’t shallow enough to turn away from your looks, it never lasts long. I don’t know why people can never express their feelings, but don’t you think it leaves kinda a stinging feeling if you just leave someone high and dry? I know there’s bound to be some duds and not everyone wants to be your friend, but at least tell me what I did wrong or why you’re not really feeling it, then I’d understand and wouldn’t feel terrible for being ghosted by another person. And all those “friend making apps”? They all suck, trust me I’ve tried them all, they’re all tinder wannabe’s that do nothing for giving people genuine connections. On every single one the way you make friends is by swiping left or right on people, doesn’t that sound so dehumanizing? I’m tryna make a friend not trying to meet up for Netflix N Chill, but they all borrow the same format, putting looks on a pedestal while devaluing the person behind the face, so if all those apps are bogus, and making friends in person is virtually impossible, what then? Sorry for all over the place rambling but that’s my two cents, we live in a looks over personality era, and there’s really nothing we can do about it except be the change I guess. I don’t even know if I’m making this post right because I usually don’t make posts, but yeah, all of you all in r/lonely, have a good night, or day for my peeps in different time zones, you’re never alone in your thinking guys and gals, PEACE ✌️ps, I read, play games,watch anime and also am kind of a deep thinker so if you want a friend with those qualities, I’ll be here DOUBLE PEACE✌️",2022-09-02 10:54:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1574278460,4,/r/lonely/comments/x3ygoz/a_little_vent_before_i_sleep/,,0,1,a little vent before I sleep

My last relationship should’ve worked, but I wasn’t enough for her, it didn’t last long and whilst I was in it it was awfully unfulfilling and I felt alone (she was a bully amongst other things), but I’ve also found myself now being the sole carer of my mother and my aunt who just got out of cancer treatment and is 82 years old. My brothers have abandoned the two of them pretty much and it’s all kind of fallen on me. I find myself a slave to a family that has taken so much from me. I feel tied to this fate having tried desperately to fight it my entire life (my parents have been chronically Ill since I was 8 and their care has always fallen on me). But now I don’t feel like I’m cut out for anything more than this, I don’t feel like I have anything to offer anyone, I feel forgotten, very alone and I’d truly welcome it all being over. I’ve lost a lot of zest for life and don’t know if there’s anything worthwhile for me out there. I’m struggling to really understand who or what I am, I don’t feel seen by anyone let alone myself.

I’m Not sure what you call them on here. It intrigued me to write about myself on the slight chance someone may listen. Writing is something I’d usually do on the daily, but not to share with anyone or if I do it is very rare because it is never of any interest to said individual and they can’t understand what it is I’m trying to get across or not get across for that matter. The whole lonely thing has been relevant I’d say a large portion of my life in regards to family especially, 1 of 4 children and the middle child which is the best kind… lol. I was in some ways a child of neglect and would act out to find ways of attention which 90% of the time worked I was creative in my ways but at the end of the day I was using others to fill the loneliness I felt blah blah blah. as time went on I got louder and louder with my behaviours and habits hurting lots of people along the way. Mostly myself though. From age 15 onwards with sex addiction, methamphetamine use, plenty of locked psychiatric ward visits, rehab a handful of times and avoiding prison time on more than one occasion.

When my mental health is bad I use escapism and delusion to find reason to continue and it works because I’ve gotten to this point.

333,x43dmv,[deleted],"So to start ive been feeling real lonely the last months because i struggle with anxyeti and deppression, because of this im a massive introvert. i think i would still be an introvert without those problems to be honest. so anyway because of me being so anxious and introverted i have thought alot about finding someone to you know love. im in no hurry to do so tho, i just feel like a relationship would be too much stress right now but anyway ive been thinking about how i would ever find love. 

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like most girls nowadays just wants a strong, handsome and rich man. ofc most guys just want a hot attractive girl. idk if its too much to ask but i feel like the way most people meet is at a party or a bar or a club they drink dance have sex and suddenly they are in love. idk if its only me but i find that way just wierd. i wanna meet someone that loves me for my personality i dont wanna go out and party and drink i just wanna relax and take it slow do get to know eachother. i have just lost all hope that there is someone like me our there that im ever going to meet. i hate people that just party and find love that way idk why. its like a man sees and attractive lady they talk then get drunk then the man is like ""oh wanna go back to my place even tho we just met and we are drunk "" then they have sex wake up and for some reason that sometimes works out.  is that seriously how most people do it? 

&amp;#x200B;

is the no one that just likes to chill take it slow and actaully get to know the other person before they do that? idk guess im just a bit wierd. Who would i want. i just want someone like me. just meet someone that has a good personality doesnt really have to be attractive. someone that just takes it slow i guess.                    

like seriously i feel like thats what 90% of what people my age do jsut party and drink.  so stupid to me.

Ive felt lonely for quite a while now. Since an event in my life, that i wont mention here, almost all of my so called friends have turned away from me. I'll admit, i changed a lot since then, i can see why they went their own way, and i went mine, but it still hurts to lose your whole friend group. 

I havent been physicaly lonely tho, if that makes sense. i go out with people, i go to bars, i have fun now and again. But the one thing that is as sure as the sun rising tommorow, is that i will go home, i will sit down and i will feel that even when i was hapy i didnt feel that sickening mental lonelines leave me for even a blink. 

This mental lonelines is in part of my own making though. Ive been betrayed many times in my life. Those events never caused me any physical harm, but they took a small mental toll each time, and that stacked up quick. 

So to sum it up, i feel mentaly lonely because im subconciously, or maybe conciously, too scared to believe im not alone, i guess

344,x471hi,averylazytom,"I am a 17yo guy, who wants a girl like any other 17yo guy. However, I DESPISE that uncontrollable relationship desire, because sometimes it gets in my way of speech, and I actually lost friends because of that. So I tried everything there is to keep my mind away from it, including diving deep in various topics, reading... They worked very well, until the day where we start going back to school. Seeing those kids handholding and doing fun with each other just fuel that stupid fucking desire again. I know it is a combination of hormones and stuff, but if I could cut it away from my life and body it would be SO much better. I also know that constantly wanting a relationship is doing no good if you want a relationship (like if I know how to slice the relationship wanting parts of me  off and turn them into brainpower I'm going to be Einstein level smart) and I'm working on myself as well (not for relationships) 


I have circles / online groups where no one has ships before (i.e one was a competitive programming group where we challenge each other or solving problems together. We are countries far from each other, so we can't really meet). But unfortunately for me, I see couples in this physical 3d world everywhere I go. And whenever I see them I always get a envious / annoyed feeling. 


If you hate long texts as much as I do, here's a TLDR and questions: I'm some 17yo dude, that is desperate foe a relationship but I want to cut that need away for several reasons. I'm working on myself and know that being desperate is no good (but I can't un-desperate myself). seeing happy couples everywhere in this 3d world I see make me annoyed / jealous for some reason.

Just countless rejection feels like women, the world and the universe just telling me I’m not shit and not worth being loved.  Fuck that, it feels like they’re saying I’m not even worth getting acknowledged and sometimes respected.  It just gets harder and harder to wake up and get out of bed and go through each day with confidence, Knowing your next rejection is around the corner.  

Then people tell you to have confidence as if it’s just supposed to stay the same through rejection.  You get confidence from success and no success will obviously equal a fall in confidence.  It’s like fighting a battle you can’t win.  

Does anyone keep track of their rejections?  Do you have some that just stuck mentally and haunt you?  I find nothing nice about dating, if I can even call it that.

I'm primary interested in voice chat, I'm not to big on texting as a main form of communication. I mean I do it but I prefer voice chat once we are comfortable.

I'm posting this now but I won't be free to actually talk/text any till later tonight (7-9 hours after this goes live) so if you don't get a response from me till then, or my responses are really sporadic till then, thats why. 

**What I'm looking for:**

Someone who is interested in getting to know each other, talking about stuff big and small, and just in general hanging out. 

Someone who is willing to be an equal contributor to the conversation. 

Someone who understands that life happens, I'm not always going to respond 10 seconds after you message, I'm not always glued to my phone and I understand you probably arn't either. 

**What I'm not looking for:**

Someone who is just bored and wants to be entertained.

Someone who sends one word replies, and doesn't make much effort.

373,x4arbl,TDGoat23,"I'm (20M) ever since I was little I've been shy and reserved. Still had no problems making friends at an early age me and my family moved from Sweden to the UK when I was around five years old I came back to Sweden 1 and a half years later. Here's where the problem started I had no friends from my class. I would get bullied by this one guy until I finally stood up to myself and punched him. I had fights with classmates aswell.

 My parents decided to move to a smaller class for kids with special needs. They were a lot kinder to me and made me open up more. When I was 12 I meet my long time friend of 7 years let's call him Z and my best friend at the time A one year later after meeting Z. All of us three klicked me and A were at each other's houses playing video games. We did lots of fun activities together all three of us such as playing basketball going to the nightclub going to parties. Me and Z ended up in the same high school together. 

Z had a best friend I'll call him M. He was a chill guy at first but soon I noticed he acted really cold towards me everytime I tried to strike up a conversation he seemed uninterested. I noticed huge red flags with him I'm of African descent and he's an Arab that would use the n-word around me which made me feel uncomfortable. I told him off multiple times. Even Z said the n-word and he was from the Middle East. M said in our groupchat consisting of our highschool friends from me and Zs high school he hates black people. No one came to my defense not even my best friend A. I explained to him how wrong he was to say that. He said stuff like black people are dangerous. He apologized for what he said and I let it go. We play video games and forget about it then he says he hates black people again while Z is laughing, I block him this time M had a bad influence on Z and I noticed that. What I noticed in our groupchat is that they were making racist memes about black people. Making jokes about poor African kids starving and making KKK memes. Constantly saying the n-word in the group. I left the group and I blocked them all. I don't miss them at all, good riddance. 

Now I have no one to really spend or hangout with my parents are busy my 3 other siblings are busy with school and friends. I don’t really feel like no one understands me. My siblings and parents tell me friends aren't everything but what I'm looking for is just to hang out with someone to feel less lonely.

380,x4bnmm,[deleted],"I googled and found this place. Never been on reddit before but I’ve been reading so much in this group that today I decided to register and join this group to finally, for once have the opportunity to say how I’m feeling and how I’ve been living.

I’ve been incredibly lonely for my entire life… severely for the last seven or eight years. I have never told anybody. I’m embarrassed/ashamed and usually people don’t ask or wonder…

I go to work for eight hours, people don’t talk much to me (just when they need something). I spend breaks alone, too. Nobody at work ever asked about my private life… if I’m single, married… where or how I live… nothing. I really just work eight hours not exchanging a word with anybody and go home. When I was sick last year (broke my foot), was out for two weeks and came back… nobody asked why I was away.

Usually after work I go grocery shopping for the day, come home, eat and just lay around, read or watch a movie or series. I don’t receive any calls or any texts. It’s just quiet over here. The whole day. Sometimes I go for a walk. I do sports alone, too. Initially started cause I thought I might meet new people but that didn’t happen.

I have an older brother who lives three hours away. He has a wife and a small child. I text him in the morning and I’m lucky if I receive a short answer three days later. I try to go visit as often as I can. My parents (divorced) live in two different foreign countries and I see my mother once a year tops. I exchange voice mails with my mother regularly. But she thinks I’m so busy with work and friends… I just never told her how lonely I am.

I have two or three people I’ve known for decades and sometimes we send each other funny memes or write a text to superficially ask how we’re doing. They’d probably tell you that we’re friends. But it’s not like we meet up, spend time or talk on the phone. Sometimes I get courageous and ask if they want to go watch a movie or just spend time… but they always have other plans or can’t because of family life. But I see them post pictures on social media of their weekends and it looks full of fun activities with other friends of theirs. I feel so stupid writing this.

I help out at a soup kitchen for homeless people twice a week. I thought I could do something good and at the same time meet new people who also work there for charity. But I couldn’t really connect with anybody.

I don’t want to make excuses or explain myself but really: I never did anything to anybody… I never been a backstabber, fought with people, did cruel stuff or anything which is why I keep wondering why I’m so lonely with just nobody around. What have I done? I’m introverted yes, but I can hold a conversation and I usually am a very optimistic, motivating and loving.

As I said, I’ve been lonely all my life. I never had many friends… as a child my older brother would spend all of his time away from home with his friends while I was at home alone. I always wondered why people were gravitating towards him and I wasn’t as popular. And the years just passed by with me hoping I could meet cool people to connect with, find a partner… but it all turned out very different.

I’m in my thirties now… scared that I’ll continue the rest of my life like this.

I feel so tired. Tired of hoping, praying, waiting for something to happen. Tired of trying even. Sometimes I just want to move away, start anew and try my luck somewhere else… maybe it’s the city… the workplace… the country? I thought about it all. Maybe I suck? Maybe I’m just not that interesting for people to want to connect or be friends with?

But when it starts bothering me it’s the absolute worst. I lay in bed at night feeling absolutely empty, wishing I could at least cry so I can feel something. Never had a relationship or anything close to it, hell I’ve never even kissed a girl. I’m tall and fit and not the ugliest person in the world, and considered pretty good at what I do, but it seems like I always push people off. Every time I had the courage to tell someone I liked them it ended in the exact same way- rejection, and every time it happens it gets harder to try again.

399,x4dnih,AcneRiddenRotten,"I've met enough socially successful young men and women to be able to notice the things they have in common, and comparing them to me and other people who are left out.

1. They are stable. Financially, through consistent income, inheritage or savings.

2. They are mobile. Typically owning a car or a motorcycle.

3. They are independant. Have their own place, take care of themselves and their own needs.

4. They contribute and get involved. They reach out for business opportunities, for parties, for charity.

Of course there are physical signs as well but I choose to ignore this for now.

The main idea I am getting from these characteristics is that the people who have a good social life are the ones who fit the best in our society model. They found a way to gather earnings, and they make the best of structures like roads and houses/apartments to not have to rely on anyone but themselves. Once they have this solid foundation, they expand their relations to make things happen, to find opportunities.

Speaking of relations, there really is nothing stopping them from just talking to someone they're attracted to. Wanna meet up ? I'll drive to that place. Wanna chill ? Drop by my place. Wanna have fun ? Come with me to this party a friend of mine is organizing.

When I compare myself to someone like this I realize I have almost nothing. I don't have a license, I don't have a money or a job, I don't contribute anywhere because I feel lazy and anxious, and I'm renting a small room in some house that's not mine.

I don't care how better my personnality could be and how handsome I could have been, even with all that I would still be a nobody. And when you've known and befriended people who had everything, from the fundamentals to the physique, you just feel like a roach next to them.

So what's stopping someone like me from having the fundamentals ? When I go to a party I want to sit in a corner and hug the wall. When I imagine myself driving I'm overcome with anxiety. When I wonder if I should contribute more I don't feel like it.

Is it childhood trauma ? Is it a genetic disorder ?

It was a challenging time... Although feeling alone was quite familiar to me... It felt far more severe at that time. I was motivated to read a lot of books and journals for finding a cure (or at least understanding) of my mental state.

This animated story describes that challenging time of my life, how I overcame it and the key lessons I learned:

I still feel lonely from time-to-time and I have accepted it as a natural consequence of life. However, I feel well-equipped to deal with these feelings. I have been blessed with a lot in my life... Including the freedom, health and knowledge to always take action and improve my situation.

429,x4h57t,valleylillies,"I grew up being told I was too needy/attention-starved, now I don't have a single friend because I'm afraid of taking space in the world

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and now that I am medicated and doing therapy I've been able to analyze my life for what it is and understand how everything happened. I'm getting better at managing my emotions but some things hit me pretty hard and I don't feel I can move foward properly.

I have a deep rooted self-loathing that traces back to my early childhood where I was constantly rejected by everyone. I didn't have any friends at school because they didn't like me, my family were constantly fighting about custody and alimony and thought I was a mistake and blamed me for being the reason it all started, I didn't even have kids in the neighbourhood I could play with. I grew up alone, did things alone, taught myself almost all I know. My childhood were endless fruitless days watching television after school, waiting for my mom to come from work to watch television with her. That was it.

Now I'm on my 20s and I hate social media, I don't identify with my generation's overall behaviour but even though I try my best to put all aside and stand it, I still can't make friends. Even when I deeply care for others, I can't find someone to care just a tiny bit for me.

I'm not victimising myself nor hoping for any kind of pity, I don't even expect anyone to even read this post. But I guess it is the first time I put this out in the world, that it leaves my body. I'm not depressed per se anymore due to the medications but my life is so still.... I have nothing, I do nothing. I tried hobbies, I tried cleaning, I tried taking more naps. Nothing distracts me from the fact I have no one to talk to, no one to go to, no one to laugh with. And it fucking sucks.
I feel so worthless and powerless, I don't want to try to hard and bother people, and feel even smaller than I already do. I don't have coworkers, my colleagues from college didn't seem to take interest in me away from the classroom and I feel like the small part of my family that are still close, are trying to pull away because they are getting sick of me.

My partner of 2 and a half years broke up with me almost two months ago and I've cried everyday ever since. Not only in sad to end the most meaningful relationship with the most mindblowing person ever, buy it also triggered all the unresolved issues that I thought I was handling while in the relationship (because of how happy I was). But I wasn't functioning that much, I was only distracted with all this love that I still don't know what to do with. We want to stay friends (please don't advise me otherwise, if it's a bad idea time will tell, we both agree we shouldn't be a couple but want to stay in each other's life), but being friends is so clumsy and sad. 

I have no job right now and therefore no healthcare. All my options are call centers (3rd world country) and that's what I'm going for but I studied literature and it's so frustrating!! I'm in debt, didn't pay rent last month and probably won't pay it this month either. All the money I have right now is the equivalent of 3USD. 

No one visits. I used to be host for big parties and casual hangouts with lots of people but now that I don't live in a hip neighborhood, I can spend days without seeing a familiar face. Everything is a mess anyway since I can't bring myself to do much cleaning, so it's better no one sees this I guess.

I live alone in a 1-bedroom, barely see my brother, and the rest of my family lives in another city and our relationship is strained because I'm gay and they hate it. My closest friend also lives in a different city and is currently super busy because she will be moving to another country!!! We barely talk now. The rest of my friends have jobs and lives and resources and I don't know how to ask for help because when I do they are busy and if they weren't I wouldn't know how to open up. All social interactions and relationships are confusing for me and I went to therapy for it last year but it wasn't enough to make them clear.

I wish I had money for therapy but it's just impossible right now. Or have the chance to talk and cry about this with a loved one. I need a hug and there's no one that can give me one.

Also broke my leg for the first time in my life. Still living with the consequences. I wouldn’t lie and say I’ve never had suicidal tendencies but never have I or will I act upon them, my family and also faith which I would leave behind wouldn’t forgive me. Now we’re plagued with what feels like end of the world vibes, uncontrolled rise in prices and inflation, personally saw all potential we all possessed as children flow down the drain. I have no friends, feeling lonelier than I’ve ever been in my entire life. Everyone I knew is just no longer available, like all of a sudden we’ve all been dragged into the rat race, am struggling to juggle uni and work at the same time and oh god I’m turning 24 soon already in 2023. No end in sight for this life. I stumble upon those nostalgic happy memories compilations everywhere on social media and I cry every time. Nobody wants to talk whenever I’m outside nowadays, they just stare into their phones, just to scroll back forth through the home screen to blend in. I just wanted a break.

It just seems that way sometimes, but we always find each other, eventually.

The long breaks make the reunion that much sweeter.

It helps crystalize and distill what we're seeking during these interludes of silence.

If we were always together we would eventually stop appreciating each other.

And we would take for granted the beauty of friendship and companionship.

If you were truly alone I wouldn't be here writing this missive to you.

You may be sad, depressed, and even desperate.

But you're not alone. I'm here with you.

And not just me, look around you, there are so many sympathetic voices.

We've only just begun this journey of self-discovery. Yes, the self that you think is alone and abandoned.

Some of the most damaging lies are the ones we tell ourselves. ""I'm alone."", ""I'm unloved."", ""I'm unworthy.""

Don't give up, drink from the silver cup.

Where are the clubs and activities that have 25 to 40 yos?? Anyone?? I’m really struggling here. I’ve tried dating apps but they seem to be more geared to short term relationships and superficiality.

I’m well into my 30’s now, and for about 16 months I’ve spent just about every night alone. I still think about my ex gf from 10yrs ago - every day. Of my 3 serious ex girlfriends; one committed suicide, and 2 got married.

Admittedly, I am very much co dependent; without intimacy, or at very minimum friendships, my mental health takes a huge toll. My sleep, my job performance, my appetite are all f-cked up. Some days I don’t want to wake up.

I know there’s not much to say, and I don’t really have anything to ask. I just really need to vent.

I miss my ex girlfriend, my dad, my dog, so many friends, and being happy. I haven’t been happy in many years. I have panic disorder + PTSD, I often wonder if I’ll ever have sustained happiness. Or a family of my own.

I lived fast and partied hard when I was young, never thinking I’d make it past my 20’s. I’ve partied with celebrities, musicians, and had sex with a lot of gorgeous females. Now late 30’s, the party feels over, officially.

I hope to God my happiness comes back to me someday soon. each lonely weekend feels just a little worse than the previous. Same with holidays and birthdays. And it scares me. It scares me to think everyone would probably be fine without me.",2022-09-03 07:05:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1497967050,7,/r/lonely/comments/x4o435/i_hate_weekends_they_remind_me_of_how_alone_i_am/,,0,2,I hate weekends.

496,x4obo7,BimjiB,"This past year, I've felt completely isolated despite being in a university with a relatively large amount of students. It sucks because while I want to have close relationships, I'm extremely quiet and shy which prevents me from making new friends. And that crushes me.

However, what hurts more is how I often think of and miss my past friendships. There was this girl who used to be the closest friend I ever had. As we both didn't really have a lot of other friends, we became each other's support systems as we'd spend time together everyday day-to-night.  To me, she was the only person who truly cared about me and understood me for who I was. But, once we graduated high school and attended different colleges, we gradually became more distant. At this point, we almost never talk at all.

However, I recently went to visit her, thinking it would reignite our friendship. But, considering how long it's been, our meeting felt really awkward as she's changed in so many ways that it's almost impossible to recognize her; she's so much more outgoing and is relatively popular at her university. While I'm happy that she now has many friends, I came to the realization that our friendship would never be the same as it was before. Not only are we distant both socially and physically (hours away from each other), but we simply have completely different and separate lives.

I know that's just how life works and it's something I need to suck up. But, just thinking about how lonely I've been, it still breaks me whenever I think about the friendships I used to have, knowing that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be as close to them as I used to be. Anyone else feel like this?",2022-09-03 07:19:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642971178,4,/r/lonely/comments/x4obo7/lonely_and_missing_past_friendships/,,0,0,Lonely and Missing Past Friendships

499,x4oj3v,Ok_Shop_4631,"I'm a 22yr old male and I'm currently in school studying pre-med microbiology. I've been out of high school for 3, almost 4 years now. I have about a year and a half left on my degree and hopefully, I get accepted into medical school. There was the girl in high school that I had the biggest crush on. We met in middle school and became great school friends. I never got to truly know her on a personal level. I wish I truly got to know her well. Gosh, she was the sweetest, intelligent, and most angelic women I've ever seen. There were many signs that I should have made a move; however, being the clueless nerdy guy I was, I noticed the signs too late. 

Needless to say, junior year of high school came around and she got a boyfriend, but we remained friends. I remember being a little jealous; however, I quickly reminded myself to not move on and cherish the friendship and memories that were created along the way. Anyways, when high school ended, and we went to conquer and achieve are dreams we stopped speaking to another. I never messaged her after school ended because I didn't want to get in between their relationship. 

The thing is, I never knew her on a super deep personal level. We were close but from a school perspective. Even though it's been many years, I can't seem to shake it all off my mind. I have massive feelings of regret, but I can't understand why. For some reason, my soul feels as if the us two could move mountains together. Logically my head is telling my soul to grow up. I'm more inclined to follow my head in this case which what I have been doing. Every now and again I get these little flair ups of sadness and think about the shoulda, woulda, coulda moments involving her. 

Recently I was talking to my best friend that I haven't spoken too in a few months. Somehow through conversation, he mentioned that she works with him. I of course asked how she was doing. He said she broke up with her boyfriend a while ago. I figured what the heck, I'll try and reach out to maybe rekindle the friendship. I was hoping that maybe something would go farther, but I least I tried this time. Well, even though were friends on snapchat and haven't spoken for so long, she never even opened my message. I totally understand, and I accept that it never was meant to be. Deep down inside though I can't help but think what I did wrong. Logically I know I didn't do anything wrong and there are plenty of reasons why she never responded. And to be fair she has every right to and I totally respect that. 

I'm more or less trying to gain understanding of my own mind and body. I don't understand as to why I seemed to have cared for a girl that I was only ever friends with.",2022-09-03 07:32:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595562071,2,/r/lonely/comments/x4oj3v/what_to_do/,,0,1,What to do

It’s a strange reality! 
Many past birthdays I was struggling with the fact that I got minimal to eventually no birthday wishes whatsoever.

Now a-days I have managed to keep everything under better control. Since last year I have learned to embrace non-other than Solitude, yes the state of Isolation and Seclusion. I had set myself a set of tasks which I’m constantly preoccupied with. One of my hefty tasks involves losing weight and working out. With these tasks I’m slowly becoming the more healthier and better looking version of my self. 
Along with financial stability. It’s an ongoing struggle that requires 100% of priority and attention. I’m hoping that soon (in 2 years) I will build a new House.

Just 5 days ago I got an offer for a better job and when I came in to hand in my resignation from my current job the Human Resources Manager couldn’t help but noticed that I lost weight. It’s a great feeling if you ask me!

Now I don’t have anyone in my life and I must say that every so often I still do wish it would change; at the same time I had been growing by myself and along the way I had adapted to my concurrent environment.

I think I always felt like I wouldn't fit in anyway because I don't drink and don't really like clubs/""dancing"". Needless to say I've lost contact with pretty much all of the people from school and finding new friends seems extremely hard. Now I have one friend left who doesn't leave me, though I don't really know why because I sometimes take days to answer him and we meet up every few months or so... 

tl;dr: I am basically alone and know I have to change things or I'll be so forever but at the same time I like being able to pursue my life-wasting ""hobbies"" whenever I want",2022-09-03 13:40:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662210242,1,/r/lonely/comments/x4uox2/anyone_can_relate/,,0,3,Anyone can relate?

First of all I apologize for a bit harsh title. I couldn't figure out any better title. A friend of mine is suffering from depression. That is the primary reason why I became interested in this subreddit. The thing I have observed in this community is that even though some of you, ladies and gentlemen, have truly difficult stories and live experiences that you have had to go through. And yet despite all of this, this is one of the most polite conversation forums on this platform.  


My point is, we are not created equal, we all have our problems and concerns we must bear, and it is a fact that some have been given bigger burdens than others. Yet I firmly think that despite the hardships many here have endured, most of you are far stronger people you think you are.  


Politeness and kindness of many of you, may just be because of the things you have had to go through and not the other way around. So embrace what you have learned and carry on despite the difficulty.  


Life always finds a way forward even if it feels like you are only going to hit a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a pleasant day and may this one be better for you all!

580,x53chy,Amir-s-,"During my high school years, I went through a depressive destructive period where I became distant from everyone. I isolated myself and deprived myself of a lot of opportunities. There was this friend of mine and we knew each other since we were 8, and we came to Canada with each other. During my depressive period, she started having a brain tumour and I didn't go to see her in the hospital, and I didn't contact her after that for years. Now we have started reconnecting and we chat with each other weekly. But I can't get rid of the guilt of being a bad friend and not being there for her, even though she has told me she has forgiven me. What's more, I start thinking of how close our relationship could have been having I been there for her. Now, our relationship may never be that close. She is far away, has a boyfriend, has her group of friends and has a job. What’s more, now and then I am reminded of all the opportunities I missed because of my self-isolation. It is not much that I dwell on the past, but rather the possible future I could have had. For example, I could have experienced love during high school or I could have found that group of friends that I could call my second family and go out with and have fun with. These are just simple examples, and I know I can find love and that group of friends later in life, but there is something about the high school years that I feel I will never have back. I will never get the chance to make mistakes without the burden of being an adult. I will never be in the same building with people the same age as me who have free time. Now, everyone my age is an adult with adult responsibilities and jobs, uni, etc. To me, high school years are the years where you get to be moulded and since I missed those years I feel unmoulded. And when I look around I feel I have been left behind and everyone is ahead of me, I feel lonely and if I’m honest sometimes I feel like there is no point to it all. My social skills aren't good as other people's, I'm not good at holding a conversation and my English speaking skill is not. I'm not the person I want to be. I know there are ways for me to improve and turn into the person I want to be. But whenever I try to improve, I am reminded of the people who are ahead of me and were there for their friends and are good communicators and have many friends and have a full life. I just lose all motivation. And when I look at how lonely I am and don't have anyone to call my own and what a bad friend I am and how bad at English speaking I am and how much I suck at communication.

I could reach a higher potential if I didn't desire connection or sex, romantic pursuits are literally pointless, I get shamed for desiring a gf anyway by all of reddit and ppl in real life.

Yes, I'm 25 years old, a virgin, and I'm curious about sex with someone who is attracted to me. I want to go on dates, I want to have a gf and have a romantic relationship. So no this doesn't include prostitutes because I highly doubt I can pay someone to be genuinely interested in me romantically. So offering that advice is silly I think.

609,x566bt,rastaman289,"Was scrolling through this subreddit and thought maybe I'd feel a little better talking about my loneliness.

Started feeling lonely since I was 20, been getting gradually worse over time.
I have good friends, I have family, but I've never felt so lonely.
I get along very well with my friends, but we don't talk often as they are quite busy. 
I get along well enough with my family, but I don't feel like they understand me quite well. 
I never experienced a romantic relationship in my whole life.

I found myself to be crying more and more these days. I don't talk about it with anyone cause I've made the mistake to show myself as someone who's always happy, something which has not been true for quite a while now. All cause of that lonely feeling.

About romantic relationships, that's something I really want to have. I'm tired of people telling me ""You'll find the one"" or ""You're better off alone"" or even ""You're still young, go have fun"".

There's this one girl I like, but I can't even find the courage to tell her cause I'm afraid it won't end the way I'd like it to. She's about to leave for another city soon so ig I already failed there.

615,x56m54,Vegetable_Incident90,"As a kid I thought being lonely is a temporary thing. It will pass when I go to university because then I'd be with more like-minded people. Then I thought things will be better once I start working, because by then I'll have things figured out. I don't know when it happened, but somewhere I've lost hope. In the last ten years the only physical contact I've had with other people were handshakes and quick side-hugs, and not very many at that. I see posts on here about people wanting someone to cuddle with and I don't even know what that's like. 

What the hell have I done to screw up my life this bad? I've given up on love or romance. I guess it's not meant for everyone, but can I not have just one friend to talk with on nights when I chase away my suicidal thoughts with alcohol? And I don't mean to blame the world for my problems. I know I'm the common denominator, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong anymore, and the only advice I get is to start loving myself. What a fucking joke.

Nothing is as depressing as trying to do activities on your own for ""self-care"" just to be surrounded by couples and groups of friends. Even worse when the place is busy; congratulations, now you're just the waste of space that's preventing the couple from getting a table on their date-night. 

It's not that I don't put myself out there either. I go to meetup events, try classes and hobbies, I initiate conversation, listen to people, take an interest in what they say, but as soon as someone more interesting comes along I'm dropped like a dirty rag. If it was some dating event I can understand it, I know I'm not good looking and can accept that, but I'm just trying to make some friends. Do I seriously need to be built like a celebrity just to be approachable?

I'm moderately successful in my career because that's all I have, and I'm starting to resent even that. The smile I put on at work is so fake it feels like I'm wearing a stranger's skin, and my depression makes it hard to focus. Besides, what good is a career, hobbies, achievements, anything if you have no-one to share it with? 

I sometimes count the people that will mourn me when I'm gone, and I can maybe name five people. The only thing that's held me back these past few years is the thought of causing pain to my parents, but at what point does that become too unfair towards me? What does that say about me as a person when I've had so little impact on the world around me that the best thing to be said for my time on earth is that at least I didn't leave a mess behind? That's no summary of a life well lived. That's how you describe a well-behaved tourist.

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out.

Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same.

The only companion I have is whoever I’m dating. Ive been with this guy now for 7 years. I believe he has undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. He is at times emotionally abusive. I’ve grown to hate myself so much over the years because I’m afraid to leave, because I’ll be alone. 

I used to be afraid to even get married because I’ll have no one to invite to my wedding. I wont even have a maid of honor. But I don’t care about that right now. I don’t want to get married anymore. Ive been waiting for my life to start for over 3 decades. I’ve missed out on so many chances at things because I have no one to do them with.

633,x58no2,Meaningless_Ninja,"For last 2-3 yrs I had some problems, and I was trying to find it root cause for that I start researching and analyzing it a lot.

One day I came across a post, from which I can relate to almost all of my problems and it says that lonely people will find it relatable.

I don't know if I'm feel lonely, I'm in solitude but don't know if there's any loneliness or not. If it's something else pls tell me.

So my problems was 

1. I was addicted to porn for 3 yrs from which now after hard work, now I'm free, but it really did waste a lot of my time and drag me to the bottom.

2. I can't feel connected to others, I feel some kind of distance.

3. If someone's listening to me I over share myself and even say things which I want to keep secret.

4. I can't be myself in front of others, it's like I became someone else.

5. I try to fit in and it's hard to say no for me.

6. I even say things and behave in such a way, which I don't believe and which don't represent who I am.

7. I was almost in solitude in those 3 yrs. And I don't have any friends at all, I have my school friends but we rarely meet and whenever we plan to meet I just get excited.

8. I day dream of having a intimate romantic relationship.

9. I don't why but when talking to anyone I feel like that I'm boring or what if they don't find me someone worthy of spending their time. And tbh according to me im one of the most interesting person you can find.

10. If someone appreciate me I feel like I owe them because in my life I rarely rarely got any appreciation from anyone.

But the reason why I'm so confused is that I like being alone.

Remember when we first talked months ago, you suggested that we play your three-words game ? I'd give you three random words before going to sleep and you'll write me a story so I have something to wake up to.

I kept every single story you have ever wrote for me. It was like love letters.

I remember the joy and happiness when I used to wake up to your stories. Most of them are about us, sometimes about you, sometimes me, sometimes just about anything but every note has your presence

I never imagined I could feel that happy. But I was. The happiest I ever felt in my entire life.

You said your stories were genuine and reflections of your feelings towards me and towards us. I read them like love letters. 

I didn't realize I was falling deeper and deeper after each note. I thought you'd be there to catch me. 

I was wrong.

You gave up on us at the beginning and didn't tell me about it. You played along for weeks, led me on, showered me with affections, initiated so much intimacy through our words, and made me fall for more, only to just say you met someone else. Someone nearer to you.

I am still confused how it took one look, one conversation and one coffee date with the girl and you decided to invest yourself in her and abandoned me completely.

It will haunt me forever. And I am traumatized.

So I deleted all the stories you wrote. Wishing I could burn them. I love them too much but I had to.

You left me. You abandoned me. You practically destroyed me.

You left me alone while you go to someone else, and take all the affection you had given me before, now they are all for her.",2022-09-04 01:30:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654610202,4,/r/lonely/comments/x5afkg/i_deleted_all_your_threeword_stories/,,0,4,I deleted all your three-word stories

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them.

694,x5fhxy,Deurmeus,"As a lot of us might know, a great sign of depression is dismissing our own problems and I realized that and kind of chuckled to myself as I wrote the title.

I've learned to cope with my depression somewhat but not well.

However I have nobody to talk to about it. Not one soul I can say with confidence ""Yes, you are my rock."" That person is no longer on my life and it devastates me to this day knowing they're no longer there for me and I can't be there for them.

I've gotten a little too good at recognizing social patterns and behaviors and have deduced this;

Not one person I know cares about my mental health. Nobody. If I try to talk about it with the people I THOUGHT I could talk about it with, they completely ignore or divert the conversation.

I am so, so, so desperate because despite my ambitions in life (music production, first responder, electrician etc) the benefits of them do not outweigh the serenity that being dead would bring. So much less to worry about and I've been fully convinced of this for the last 2 years. Yet I'm still pushing through it because I stupidly cling onto the dopamine rush I get when I make others smile and laugh. 

I'm insanely extroverted and always go out into social environments with friends but there's a completely different level of loneliness when you're surrounded by those who only care about you if you can make them laugh.

695,x5fmqa,flame22x,"Well, here goes a long story that still haunts me to this day. Sorry in advance for the long text.

When i was younger, back in school, i was never the popular kid, more like the opposite, so it's a given that making friends was a struggle for me. But luckly there was this guy, let's call him Phil, and we had a lot in common, both shy and kinda nerdy, so we became best friends and stayed that way for 10 years. No, he wasn't my friend, he was my brother.

Well, things changed in high school. It wasnt my best phase, i was going through some trouble with my parents, puberty, moved out of my old house, and all that conflict in my head translated into my personality that year. To sumarize, my friends at that time excluded me from everything, telling me that i was being annoying, just that. I know i wasnt perfect, and made some dumb mistakes, but i didnt hurt anyone, that's for sure. But the killing blow was when i talked to Phil, who knew and participated in that situation, he basically said that those 10 years of friendship were just mere numbers and that i was discardable.

I was all alone for the rest of the year, spend my vacation in my room without contacting anyone else, worst time of my life. The following year i changed schools but didnt make a single friend the whole year, i kept all my feelings stored and tried to go forward by myself.

Little by little, i moved on, made a few friends and now am in college. But i am aware that i became even more reserved, i still was/am afraid of people, that someday they will all leave me, it's hard for me to make the first move, opening up to someone. It's not that i have something against other people, it's just that i think they might have something against me.

Also, remember when i said that what happened in school still haunts me ? Thats because recently, Phil and I ended up in the same class, in same college. He came to me and apologised, for all of it. I forgave him, but also said  that i would never be able to forget what happened, thats why it would be tough to be friends again, but either way, we are now on good terms. I got the closure i always wanted, but i still feel this emptyness inside of me.

Because of what happened to me i became who i am today, so i dont have anyone who i feel like i can actually trust, open up, tell my problems. Oh and of course that means no girlfriend as well as staying a virgin to this day (almost 21y). I never had a bond with anyone that comes close to the one i had with Phil. I miss having that kind of bond,  a lot. It feels like i became what Phil told me many years ago, I'm ""discardable"". I just don't wanna be a bother to anyone

It's hard trusting people, and even harder to trust myself. Wounds heal but they leave scars, and those scars will always stay and bring back memories when we look at them.

707,x5gr8h,cherrynoirxx,"Sometimes I question myself for letting you break me and my heart again and again. 

I think I literally just gave my heart to you and thought to myself : he can break it but it's his. But I never knew you'd shatter and destroy it many times.

I considered the possibilities of us being together many times. Thousands of times. It has always been realistic and practical. 

I had always thought what we had could have evolved to something great. That's what I thought at the beginning. It may be too wishful thinking but I was holding on to the chances things can work out. It's wishful thinking and hope altogether.

Sometimes I wonder if we can progress from just talking on reddit, to something more. 

But when you told me you gave up at the beginning because you believed this will  never work out, made a list even and rationalized your feelings over time and finally moved on - that was painful.

Like I was here, at this side, holding on to the possibilities and not seeing this is a failure because we had been moving in the same wavelength and we got along so well it felt like a miracle. But you gave up before giving the possibilities a chance. 

You said bitter reality. On my side, it has been nothing but literaly physical and emotional pain 

""Toning down is the most delicate description of the change"" - reading this feels like a harsh stab to my own self.

Yes now we have to talk of neutral topics only. Just like two strangers meeting at the grocery store discussing the weather. What I understand here is : We go from very good friends to something more and suddenly
one day you said ""sorry I met someone else"" and pulled away. And I'm left that at this weird point, not knowing what I need to do. But god, the pain is unimaginable.

No personal touch in our conversation that used to be filled with sentiments ? How do you think I'd feel ? 

I actually feel stupid. Truly just stupid I let myself into this. At my end, you were the one flirted first, initiated intimacy first and even challenged me to be more open with you, and when I finally did, suddenly one day you said ""oh sorry, met someone else and I want to invest myself in her so goodbye now"". 

What of me ? Now that you did all this, said things, made me feel so many emotions and suddenly ""oh that's all bye sorry"" ?

I am actually questioning my own worth and my self-respect. Coming from someone who had avoided men at all costs, I am disappointed that I got myself into this.

I invested everything of me for you because I want to. Everything. Because I chose to. And it was my decision to try and see how things could have worked out. ""Simply be and exist"" was my way of holding on to the good and possibilities of working things out. But turned out I was literally on my own.

I suggested to tone things down is because of the new girl. You think I was happy and willing to suggest so ? No. I was in so much pain. And still is.

I feel like I lost some fight I never knew existed. Like I did something wrong and was not enough in some sense. It's like I was easy to get and disposed at any time possible.

You left me like it was so easy. Cut ties. Deleted your account. Left no means for us to reconnect. You left me alone to deal with my side of pain.",2022-09-04 07:19:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654610202,5,/r/lonely/comments/x5gr8h/i_let_you_break_my_heart_again/,,0,3,I let you break my heart again.

Years since I interacted with another person properly, years since I've been able to speak properly around people, years since I've felt happy or loved. There's nobody in my life that I can love or trust or be close to, all I have is my emotionally immature father, who does not love me. I'm scared to go to him for anything, especially love and care, I could never.

I don't go to school, I don't have a job, I don't have any friends. I don't have a family doctor, a dentist, any teachers, any other family, any pets, not even acquaintances. I sleep in my closet on the floor and it's been a few weeks since I left for anything other than using the bathroom, I'm shut in here right now, it's very small and dark.

I'm hungry and I'm dirty, my face is soaked in tears, just like every night before this. I don't understand what I did wrong. I don't know what I did to deserve this. Why doesn't anybody want me? Why doesnt anybody even want to talk to me? I dress in cute and attractive clothes, I wear nice makeup, do my hair, I have clear skin and a pretty face. I try so hard to look nice and approachable in public so why? Why me? Is this a prank by some ""god""? Is this my eternal hell for doing something horrible that I just don't remember? Am I being punished by the basilisk for not aiding in it's creation? Am I already dead and just living in my hell for eternity now? Am I really just that unpleasant and annoying? Do I give off a terrible aura? I thought people liked pretty women, why doesn't this work either? I've tried everything else, it was supposed to work.

Or maybe I just really don't deserve it? Maybe I'm not worthy of love, and never have been? Maybe I was just born destined to live a life of misery, plagued by endless loneliness and mental illness? Maybe my illnesses are what's making me unworthy, maybe people can sense it from my energy and just don't want to associate with someone as ill and disgusting as me.
but I have so much love to give, I have so much to say, I just want one person to come to me and want to be my friend. That's all I need, just one friend. Just one person who will come and spend time with me, and love me, and hug me, and let me love them. I don't even need a partner, or family, or pets, I just want somebody, anybody, to be able to love and support and be loved and supported by. But I'm never going to get that. I've tried so hard, I give up. 

I was kicked out of public highschool because of low attendance because of severe mental illness, and my name got spread around, there's so many rumours about me in all the schools in town, I'm unwelcome everywhere. I can't hold a job because of panic attacks and depression, I can't go to social groups because of anxiety, I can't even walk to the store as an excuse to try to meet people because I'm dead broke. I've gone every single mental health building in town, I've phoned every number I could get my hands on, trying to get some sort of social worker or companion, but they all just told me to try making friends my age and gave me shitty tips. Well, newsflash, assholes, I can't.

I can't even make online friends anymore, I can't hold a conversation online for more than a day, and I'm awful at texting. I always used to weep ugly tears over how much I wanted my old online friend with me physically, it hurt so bad, I'm not going through that again 

I can't even remember how long it's been now since I genuinely felt anything but loneliness, guilt, shame and sadness. It's been years. I just want it all to stop. I know that a friend or partner wouldn't fix all my problems. Hell, it would barely fix any of them, but at least it would be some sort of love, right? It would be some form of enthusiasm to get up, to be better, to get better, to stay alive. It would help me so much. I don't eat or shower or drink water anymore. I'm so severely underweight now, I'm always so dizzy and tired and shaky. I would get up and try to shower and go out to find somebody again, but I can't. I can't move anymore, I'm too weak to move, and even if I could, what's even the point? I've been going out and trying for years, nobody has ever said a word to me, this time wouldn't be any different. I haven't gone out and tried again since I gave up trying anyways. I don't even know why I'm still holding on right now, I'm useless and hopeless. It's not like anybody would notice if I was gone

I'm scared to live alone my entire life. I don't want to keep having to live through days like this. It's miserable being conscious, it's miserable being alone, and alive. I just want it all to end so bad. I hate being like this. I just want love, I don't understand what I did to deserve this. I'm only sixteen, and my life is already over. It's not fair. Everybody else my age is out hanging out with their friends or meeting new people at school or work, but not me huh? I clearly don't fucking deserve that, huh? I just wish I was a normal kid, I just want to be not alone and in pain anymore. Why is that so much to ask? Why don't I deserve to be happy?
I don't know what I did to not be worthy of being loved, not even by my dad. I don't know what I did to deserve this agony

I wish that I could say that I'm sorry for whatever I did, so that I could be worth something to people. But it's never going to happen. I was born into this world destined to be miserable and alone, and I'm going to leave that way too",2022-09-04 08:31:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653025228,8,/r/lonely/comments/x5hvia/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,,0,1,I can't do this anymore
720,x5i29y,BeginningSympathy851,I’m trying to get over the sick feeling I get whenever I go outside or whenever a stranger looks at me. The second I leave my house and walk outside my stumach churns and I feel nauseous by the fact that ppl might be looking at me funny or don’t like me. It’s gotten so bad lately I find it difficult to be around my closest friends to the point where I’ve completely shut them off or stopped talking to them. Before I was very extroverted but due to one of my olds bsfs making fun of my weight to others and 2 of my exs using me and leading me on I’ve become self conscious and scared to go outside fearing ppl are judging me. Idk what to do but I want the sick feeling to go away so I can go back to the way it was.

722,x5idj9,RealRymo,"Greetings. I'm Ryan Daniel. I'm a musician working on a dual album, finally having gotten all the equipment necessary to put my music out there, I'm really eager to release this project, but, I've got nobody here man.

My brother died 10 years ago and I'm missing him badly tonight. I reach out to people, I only strive to be the very best version of myself that I can be, I exist to help others help others because I know what it's like to be down and out with nobody there and I don't ever want anyone to feel that way, so maybe this album will speak to some people, but I don't even know who's gonna hear it. I don't hang out with anybody, all of the people that were my friends ended up stealing from me, talking crap about me behind my back, I'm not sure why. I am a 30 year old guy with a big heart, but nobody is ever around to care. I'm a decent looking fellow, but with Asperger's I find it very hard to even know where to begin talking to women because on these damn apps all I can seem to find are people trying to be ""content creators"" re:onlyfans OR girls who only want to talk to somebody who sends them money, and even with that they'll just take it and ghost. Like, damn, where the fuck IS everybody man? I feel absolutely alone and I do not know what to do anymore. All I want is to have people to talk to. If I died, nobody would even know for like weeks, I can go a month without getting a single message from anyone. I feel extremely abandoned. I'm not even sad about it anymore, it's just something I'm self-aware of. I just want genuine people to talk to, to share their thoughts with me, but it's like, there is nobody there, ever. I have nothing but love and kindness and dope music to bring to anyone who is interested, but, it seems like nobody is there. I'm losing hope. I don't want to be SO alone anymore. It's been this way for a little while now. I don't have any skeletons in the closet, kind of a goodie two shoes in that I don't harm others, start shit, I keep the peace and only want to help others find their own inner-peace in the face of adversity. I'm doing really well to be honest, like, the old me would be far more aggressive with how this feels - but I find peace everywhere I go, I create my own inner-peace, and I am happy being alive. But I can't seem to find a single person interested in talking, being friends, can't find a girl who wants to interact without it being like ""hey buy my content""... I'm feeling so dejected. I've got SO MUCH to give and, man, nobody, at all, wants any of it. Or cares. I just want to feel loved or cared about for one moment. :'( I am missing my brother so much right now. My only sibling died when I was 19, 11 years ago, in front of me in my mom's arms... He was the one guy who held me down. Now, I feel like I have absolutely nobody at all. I have my mother, and by some miracle I have my father back in my life after 25 years of not having a dad, so I'm unbelievably grateful for that. But every day is the same. I crave companionship, interaction, I feel like I'm in an echo chamber all alone and it's just not a good feeling. I'm not numb to it, because I do not like it and, hence, why I'm writing this. I'm peaceful with it, which is good because the old me would use this as an excuse to like go drink my sorrows away, or do stupid stuff to get heard, but I'm so far removed from that. I'm just a 30 year old guy with unconditional love in his heart, a kick ass talent for hip hop and guitar like you wouldn't believe (ask me about it if you're interested, I'd be honored to share what I do best with you, it's my purpose), nothing but positivity and good vibrations. But I have not a single soul to vibe with. There is nobody there. I don't want to continue living so alone. It's going to start getting to me, so here I am posting this in hopes that somebody is interested enough to maybe want to start a friendship with me, something. Anything.

Please. I don't want to be alone anymore. :'(",2022-09-04 09:03:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,1575423276,2,/r/lonely/comments/x5idj9/hey_guys/,,0,3,Hey guys. :'(

I mean people are genuinely so nice and caring to me and try to get closer but it’s like I have completely lost them ability to be able to connect to a human. And so I end up alone. 

Maybe I’m just a coward who is afraid of rejection, even when people are making the first moves. This sounds so stupid as I type it. I think covid has messed me up beyond repair.

I felt like I had even less last year than before I went to uni. Only being around these people I’d known for really just a few months, how many of them even cared about me?

Even this summer being back at my parents, I still just don’t feel as if I truly have anyone I can speak with about things, about me. Not my parents that’s for sure, they don’t need another child dealing with shit.

758,x5pbmk,Wachudoinhere,"I’m an 18 year old who moved to Canada when I was 12 years old. Being an introverted and shy girl made adapting into a new country very difficult. It also didn’t help that I was placed into a regular class instead of the ESL class where most new immigrants were placed. I felt intimidated by my white classmates so I didn’t speak to anyone except teachers and family for a year. I hated going to school. Whenever I was there, all I thought about was going home. Things got better though when I entered Grade 9, I forced myself to be friendly and tried to approach people. A bunch of new filipino immigrants also came there so I was able to form a friend group. I sticked with them throughout highschool and also made a few foreign friends along the way. However I just graduated highschool, and now I’m having trouble finding friends again in college. Switching programs is also making it more difficult. Since me and my friends are going into different careers, I feel like we are slowly losing touch. Anyway, I recently visited the Philippines and I had so much fun hanging out with all my cousins and I wondered if it was really necessary for me to undergo all of that trouble. If I had stayed here, it would’ve been so much easier to make friends in high school because I already spoke the language and the classes are designed in a way where you really bond with your classmates (basically for a whole school year, you have the same classmates in every subject). Me and my cousins would also be in the same school. Even if I did struggle to make friends at school, at least I had my cousins to rely on. I feel like I would’ve been so much happier in the Philippines instead of living in Canada where I spend most of the time alone and working.",2022-09-04 15:12:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608786638,1,/r/lonely/comments/x5pbmk/i_feel_like_my_childhood_was_stolen_from_me_by_my/,,0,1,I feel like my childhood was stolen from me by my mom

Hey there. I'm sorry if I kept you waiting. I took a detour through hardship and depression but I'm here now. I hope you don't mind that I arrived late, or maybe you too have been following a different script and played into other people's hand at your own detriment. If you have don't worry, we can slowly heal one another. I'll play my music to you when you're sad, a mix of Bon Iver, Lana del Rey, Interpol, Bloc Party those are but a few and they are depressing themselves but there is catharsis in listening to sad music. If not music let me entertain you with film, will we follow the criterion collection, or watch new releases on Netflix or should we follow a new trend and have a day to different themes horror, psychological thriller, romance or whatever you fancy. 

Are you prepared for belly laughs, me being an all around goofball when you're sad, unplanned days that end on the beach looking at the sunset, kisses that are planted whenever the need arises. Will you put up with my sulky face and my obliviousness at certain things, with my shyness, or will you inspire me to come alive and take chances.

I wish I could be the man you dream of and I can fill his shoes entirely but I doubt I ever will but what I can promise I can be the man you would need. I would fight by your side until the end. It's the little things that would endear me to you, your laughter maybe or that little scrunched up nose, or the way you pick at your food or maybe take hours in the morning but I love those things and they make you, you.

Will you forgive my past, I've been hurt and I guess if you live long enough we all get hurt at some point. Will you atleast try and understand that I don't want to fight, I'm passive and I don't want not to trust people, or that I may seem aloof when your friends are around. I don't mean to be all those things but I find it very difficult to let people in even when it doesn't seem like it. I want to one day let you in, so completely that you would understand me more fully and I hope you do the same for me. I've longed for this so long for you so long and here you are. I thank my lucky stars that you're here and I would nominate you as my favorite thing on earth, for you carry a world inside you and that's where I want to live. 

Maybe our paths will never cross, maybe we'll meet one day and you'll take me at face value and I don't meet a desired requirement or maybe the paths we have taken will be permanent. I sure don't hope so. I know a sea of possibilities lie infront of you and maybe I will never get my chance, if that be the case I hope you all the happiness in the world. 

So in my loneliness I have written this in hopes that you may stumble upon it, but I know the chances are slim to none. If that be the case, I wish you well and may you be unendingly happy.

I never knew I will come to hate my city.

I went out for a drive just now, with a friend. He was kind to take me out for a quiet one hour drive - no talking. I sat on the passenger seat, crying quietly and despite me trying not to think about you, you were all I think about.

The drive was meant for me to distract myself from the thought of you. But every single minute, this whole city reminded me of you.

Remember the colorful bridge that lights up at night ? I sent you a photo that day. We drove by the bridge and I remembered our conversation about the city. I felt pain. So much pain.

We went around the beautiful and calm city. All I could think of is how much you might like going out for your mandatory rides here at night - less traffic, big roads and beautiful night lights. 

I thought to myself, ""he would love this city""

And that was my constant thought the entire drive.

I love this city. But you made me hate my own city.

I even thought you'd enjoy taking walks with me here. 

It pains me to think you abandoned me yesterday. It pains me more to think I still love you even when you hurt me so severely.

810,x5x1hv,Angry_Grandpa_,"I know the old saying ""misery loves company"" ... but reading the posts of people who feel miserable will not cure your own depression. If anything it will normalize it.

You should read these posts in moderation and find ways to improve your situation. That could be attending local meetups or other public events. If you invest your time in other people in the real world and create friendships that will also limit the amount of time you can spend online reading Debbie Downer posts.

I'm not saying you should never read them, but too much time spent reading posts from people expending huge amounts of time reflecting on their own inner torment is anything but uplifting. It would be different if there were social workers or therapists offering guidance and a plan of recovery, but a lot of the participants are simply affirming self-destructive behavior.

Meanwhile, in the real world there are a lot of people out there trying to make new friends, but you have to put in some effort to show up and meet them. And wallowing in self-misery will not change it and nobody wants to hang out with someone who is constantly focused on their own shortcomings versus trying to improve a small amount every day.

Today could be the day that you break this pattern and begin to tame the negative voice in your head.",2022-09-04 20:36:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662166648,88,/r/lonely/comments/x5x1hv/if_youre_unhappy_and_alone_then_reading_100_posts/,,0,21,If you're unhappy and alone then reading 100 posts from depressed people will not help.
811,x5xdxe,DangerousFly9271,"I've been single for over 4 years now and I'm 21 now and just started my senior year of college. I've struggled to find another woman. I don't smoke weed, vape, or drink heavily which I feel is part of the reason why I don't attract much. On the other hand, I have friends that do all of that and they always have girls in their phones or sleeping with someone.

I've been using dating apps for quite some time now to no success. In fact the apps make me feel worse because I know I'm not ugly but for some reason I get no matches (paying probably boosts your profile). I went out to a couple bars but it's tough to go up to a woman who's surrounded by her friends.

Most people will say learn to be alone and discover yourself but how much longer can someone do it? I like to hit the gym, go the beach, hike, and do other fun stuff but I feel like I can't find the one that's meant for me. I guess women at this age don't want to settle down but instead have fun. There's so many beautiful women out there too but I've heard of so many bad stories of them how they're ran through, which is sad because when did having no morals become so normal? I'm afraid by the time these women settle down for marriage I'm just going to be collecting the leftovers if you know what I mean. I don't want that though, I have so much love to give and want a relationship but it seems like I have to settle for something casual. My point here is that I'm losing hope to finding a good woman and will probably be alone for life.

824,x5zdnr,merchandice,"Seems like as of late lots of friends are making plans without me. I know the old saw “gotta put yourself out there to get invited” - but no matter how many times I invite folks to do things, even if they do come I don’t hear from them again until I reach out. The folks I’d consider my best friends seem like they’ve relegated our relationship to text only.

Couple examples, mostly to vent but hoping to solicit some advice on how to feel about these. First, there’s a friend of mine who is one of those human magnets: everyone loves him. We used to be super close, but as his circles have widened he’s deprioritized our friendship. Always has plans whenever I try to reach out, never reached out to me. I don’t fault him for that, part of why he’s so well-liked is because he never says no to making plans. I just really wish we spent more time together. 

Then there’s another friend who I physically haven’t seen in years but we text nearly every day. Lots of levity in our conversations, sprinkled with intellectually stimulating takes on current events. Ideal friendship in a lot of ways. Come to find out he’s been playing games online with some other mutual friends (mostly tabletops) with a discord and everything. That was a huge blow to my self esteem. 

It’s been a tough year. Lost some close family, got demoted at work, struggling in my relationship. I don’t know how much longer I can fake not being upset about this. I figure I’m projecting that small dick energy people hate to be around, so it’s a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But as a man I feel it’s taboo to tell your friends you’re lonely and would like to be included. It’s just begging for acceptance instead of earning it. 

Sorry for the sob story, but any advice is greatly appreciated.",2022-09-04 22:15:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1383775108,1,/r/lonely/comments/x5zdnr/feeling_left_out/,,0,0,Feeling left out

834,x5zzc3,SleepyNymphie,"I always tend to drive people away for many different reasons! But my main issue is how clingy I am, I mirror people OFTEN it's really the only way I know how to interact with people without panicking from nerves.. The problem is I mirror them *too* much to the point it's probably unsettling. I also have huge like massive attachment issues, which cause me to probably border on ""totally a weirdo to avoid"" territory. I just don't understand social situations, cues, I don't even really understand humans it's like I'm an alien thing or something, and I in general am TOO much! I also fall asleep a bunch because I have narcolepsy so I forget/don't reply and people get upset, which is very understandable! 

I think that's one of the many reasons why I'm so alone, and I really only blame myself (not that anyone else even could be to blame..). I do believe one day I'll hopefully break this cycle, I'm working on my problems but I can't have professional help so I'm not sure how it's going.

861,x62qr4,Ok_Shop_4631," 

I'm a 22yr old male and I'm currently in school studying pre-med microbiology. I've been out of high school for 3, almost 4 years now. I have about a year and a half left on my degree and hopefully, I get accepted into medical school. There was the girl in high school that I had the biggest crush on. We met in middle school and became great school friends. I never got to truly know her on a personal level. I wish I truly got to know her well. Gosh, she was the sweetest, intelligent, and most angelic women I've ever seen. There were many signs that I should have made a move; however, being the clueless nerdy guy I was, I noticed the signs too late.

Needless to say, junior year of high school came around and she got a boyfriend, but we remained friends. I remember being a little jealous; however, I quickly reminded myself to not move on and cherish the friendship and memories that were created along the way. Anyways, when high school ended, and we went to conquer and achieve are dreams we stopped speaking to another. I never messaged her after school ended because I didn't want to get in between their relationship.

The thing is, I never knew her on a super deep personal level. We were close but from a school perspective. Even though it's been many years, I can't seem to shake it all off my mind. I have massive feelings of regret, but I can't understand why. For some reason, my soul feels as if the us two could move mountains together. Logically my head is telling my soul to grow up. I'm more inclined to follow my head in this case which what I have been doing. Every now and again I get these little flair ups of sadness and think about the shoulda, woulda, coulda moments involving her.

Recently I was talking to my best friend that I haven't spoken too in a few months. Somehow through conversation, he mentioned that she works with him. I of course asked how she was doing. He said she broke up with her boyfriend a while ago. I figured what the heck, I'll try and reach out to maybe rekindle the friendship. I was hoping that maybe something would go farther, but I least I tried this time. Well, even though were friends on snapchat and haven't spoken for so long, she never even opened my message. I totally understand, and I accept that it never was meant to be. Deep down inside though I can't help but think what I did wrong. Logically I know I didn't do anything wrong and there are plenty of reasons why she never responded. And to be fair she has every right to and I totally respect that.

I'm more or less trying to gain understanding of my own mind and body. I don't understand as to why I seemed to have cared for a girl that I was only ever friends with.",2022-09-05 00:56:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1595562071,1,/r/lonely/comments/x62qr4/whats_wrong_with_me/,,0,1,What's wrong with me?

866,x637zh,incrediblyLonelySW,"I hope it’s not a yes simply based on the perceived notation that she’s pretty or hot or whatnot. I’m saying, would you date a girl who you would normally otherwise date except that she happened to be a streamer / OF content creator. What if it involved other men? Where would you draw the line? Would a line be drawn? Would you eventually ask her to quit after 4 wonderful months of being together even though you said you were fine with it in the beginning? That’s a bit specific but you get the idea. Or at least I hope so.

Also, where would she go meet you that doesn’t involve clubs because those are kinda scary and it’s weird to go out alone and her “friends” are just a bit too wild for her taste in this hypothetical situation

Edit: this kinda blown up and I’ve read nearly every comment. I really appreciate all the feedback. 

To clear up some assumptions, I do almost exclusively solo content. The non solo shoots are collabs with other girls however I do have a guy friend (who is gay and has been in a super cute relationship now for years that I’m lowkey jealous of cause they’re literally perfect for eachother) who helps occasionally behind the scenes. Friend / employee I guess since I make sure to compensate his time obviously since why wouldn’t I. We’ve always said that if our professional relationship ever complicates our friendship, we’ll both just go back to being exclusively friends so it’s more friend then employee. It’s a bit of an odd relationship but it works out great for both of us. 

I’ve done one other shoot with a guy a while ago but pretty quickly realized it’s not what I want to be doing. Luckily the director was amazing and he ended up not publishing anything at my request. Overall I’m glad I did it just because now I know for certain it’s not really something I want to pursue. 

I think there’s some other pretty common misconceptions about the work that goes into all this. I think I put this in a comment down below but it’s a lot more then just taking pics and pressing upload. In essence just like a “real” business, I still have to do things like all the backend finances (payroll), marketing, strategic planning, etc. Plus since everything’s tied into my brand, I have to be careful to try to grow and expand to incorporate my new passions so I don’t get burned out, while also not abandoning my existing audience. That’s all more or less the back end. 

On the front end there’s the actual production (lighting, props, cameras etc), planning future releases (ordering outfits / getting them custom made and tailored). For example I knew the LOTR show was coming out so a couple months I ordered a bunch of LOTR related things so I could release LOTR themed content during the initial hype. I did all the shooting a couple weeks ago, then I edited and went through everything to make sure I’m happy with it. On top of all that, there’s meetings with my graphic design / occasionally vfx freelancers and about a million other things. 

Plus I also need backup content ready to go just in case I get sick or something like that since I release content at least 3 times a week minimum. 

I’ve gotten better at delegation but I still kind of like to be involved in every step of the process. I could outsource a lot of this to a management firm but I like conning my own vessel so I guess it’s kinda on me for putting this all on myself. This is all just the tip of the iceberg of what goes on with in my line of work that most people don’t realize and it’s why I get so irritated when people dismiss my 60+ hr weeks as just taking a picture and pressing upload. 

Anyways small rant over but this has honestly been super insightful and I’m really glad to have at least I hope a bit better of an understanding from the other side so thank you to everyone.

It's a delight, try it, I promise it is amazing, I recommend fig jam, my life has not been the same since.

My head is a mess, there is so much change in my life and I do not have the one that I want to share everything with. I wish I had friends out here, I'm going out and forcing myself not to just sit at home. So far it's been alright, I have been more outgoing than I have expected. 

The people here [this town/university] are strange. It's my first year going to classes in person rather than over Zoom. It's like the majority of the student body thinks so highly of themselves. I say hi to people whom I sit next to in class and they don't even say anything back. I get it that we are all going through shit but to not even have the bare minimum of common curtesy? Idk.

My roommates are out partying all weekend, they know I party too but don't invite me. I've shared some drinks and smoked with them before, they seem very chill and they are courteous. I feel like I made a good impression as well. Still, they do not invite me to their parties, even though they come back to the apartment and rave on about how amazing they are. Idk, I feel like even if I didn't come off as the party type, it would be polite to invite me at least, even if I say no, especially when they describe them as huge, as in 100+ people, I'm sure I wouldn't be an inconvenience.

But fuck it, I'm just going to the gym, went out to the clubs to dance this weekend, went to sports team practice last week, so I am at least glad I am doing something and not completely spiraling anymore. The fact that I need to get a job soon is looming over me though, I hate that thought, I hate working. 

This is practically a substitute for me journaling tonight, I found this sub by just pressing the ""random"" button on Reddit. I was about to stop but I thought to myself, ""I'm bound to find a subreddit where I would belong"" and this sub popped up. I was feeling left out because, just an hour ago or so, my roommate had a few of his friends over, they were just chilling in our living room and then went out to a party they mentioned. I wish I could join them but I do not want to ask as to not seem like I'm begging for company. It's their choice to invite me or not and I cannot be mad about that. I greeted them and introduced myself to them at least, I was nervous to do it but overcame my fears.

I should preface my comments by saying it’s important to separate out those who are clinically depressed and may suffer from a chemical imbalance or psychosis from those who are depressed as a result of their life experience. An extreme example would be someone who is suffering from schizophrenia --  no pep talk or handful of helpful suggestions will solve their problem. 

Anyone in those categories should seek professional help.

I think subreddits focusing on lonely people have the potential to be a positive experience, but it would require a lot of effort by the moderators since there is an overwhelming amount of negativity. I know that there is some amount of catharsis in sharing deeply personal feelings that are hard to share with others in real life  – especially the self-loathing and self-deprecating narratives that are common here.

The problem is that hope appears to be lost amidst all of the despair. A lot of the posters are quick to give themselves an excuse for their situation. If the universe conspired against them then it’s a lot easier to go on as usual without having to change a thing.

After all, who can blame them if the cards were intentionally stacked against them? 

It’s a negative feedback loop where the same things are repeated over and over:

1. I have so much love to give, but nobody loves me. 

2. I’m fat and there is nothing I can do about it.

3. I was born ugly and that’s why people hate me.

4. I’m introverted and have anxiety so I cannot make friends.

It doesn’t always play out in that order, but I think that captures 90% of the self-hate and scapegoating narratives on this subreddit. 

That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have sympathy for those experiencing loneliness and self-imposed isolation. The very fact that I am writing about it means that I take notice and don’t assume they’re beyond our reach. 

With the being said, the list I wrote is 100% wrong. None of those excuses are valid. 

I know the list above is wrong because almost all of my friends are introverted and have anxiety issues. They may not have 15 friends but they have 3-5 close friends and I’m among them. A large percentage of my friends are overweight and that doesn’t prevent them from having friends, going on dates, getting married, etc.

I realize this is anecdotal, so you can test this out by going to a mall or any public place that has a lot of foot traffic and count the number of fat, ugly people who are with someone else laughing and having a good time. Look at all the people who in your opinion should be on this subreddit telling everyone else it is impossible to make friends – take the time to count them. When you reach 1,000 people you can stop – it won’t take you long. 

Note: ugly is subjective so I will defer to your own personal standard. 

There is a difference between a person who is overweight and has a social life and a person who is overweight and uses that as an excuse for the lack of a social life. And I’m not talking about being the life of the party – not everyone needs more friends than they can count. I myself don’t need more than a few friends. 

Plenty of overweight people are happy / content – there is no direct correlation between being overweight and whether a person is at peace with themselves. Plenty of unhappy, overweight people lose weight only to find they’re still unhappy. There was a short-term rush of happiness until that voice in their head starts ridiculing them again.

This doesn’t mean I’m encouraging people to remain overweight. Anymore than I would encourage someone to keep smoking. I will be their friend regardless of their weight and whether they smoke – but if they ask my opinion I will give them health reasons to try and control their weight and eliminate smoking altogether.

People who smoke tend to die a painful death related to cancer. I’ve had multiple family members and friends die from cancer related to smoking. So when I tell them to try and stop it’s not because I don’t recognize its enjoyable – they wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t enjoyable. However, they should consider the likely health consequences.

The same is true for obesity. Food tastes great. Especially chocolate chip cookies. I’d probably eat them three times a day, but I have seen the effects of diabetes. My friend lost his leg and kept eating sweets and he eventually died. Super nice guy. Lots of friends – but he couldn’t control his diet and it killed him.

If you think the worst part of being obese is how it effects your social life then you’re simply blind to the dire health consequences. You should visit a dialysis treatment center and ask those people how they feel after dialysis. My friend was wiped out 3 times a week and unable to do anything.

I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. And instead of eating non-stop because you feel bad about your social situation, you should get your diet under control to avoid pain and suffering later. Your self-esteem might increase and perhaps it will make you more confident, but those are secondary considerations when you factor in the extremely high health costs of being obese. 

What about the people who say they so much love to give, but no recipient? This I find particularly hard to believe. It’s like saying, “I’m rich beyond belief but I cannot think of anything to spend money on.”

What?

If I was overflowing with love I would love everybody. The homeless shelters are filled with people who feel unloved. The drug addiction centers are filled to overflowing with people who have been shunned by society and often their families who are searching for someone to love them.

What are they really saying if they’re not actually loving the un-loved? They’re saying they have conditional love. And that’s a very shallow way to view the world. If someone treats them like their “soul mate” then they will release all of this pent-up love. 

That seems very selfish to me. If they actually loved people they would find that people will often love them back. How I learned this was spending 1 day a week holding up a sign telling people that God loves them.

I've been doing this for years. It's also great exercise since you can walk while you hold the sign. 

They often pull over and tell me their stories. They often share their email address and phone numbers. And I’ve been a friend to some of them for years.

Any busy intersection will suffice. 

I could have hid in my computer room and created a fictional story about the outside world. I could have lied to myself about all the untapped love I had ready to be released when my list of demands were met.

Or… I could just go out into the world and let people know they’re loved. Much easier… no BS required. 

This is an extreme measure, but I've been joined by people with severe social anxiety who are heroes because they overcome it to share the same message. I don't have social anxiety so I'm always amazed when they stand shaking next to me to share a message of hope. That's true love -- that's being your brother and sister's keeper. Most people are not on reddit and they're living lives of quiet desperation and they can only be reached on the roadside.

You're among the lucky few who can be reached electronically. =-)  


You can choose to be another unfortunate statistic or you can use your personal experience to help others who feel isolated and alone. And in the process of so doing you'll find yourself surrounded by new friends. The very thing you've convinced yourself is impossible. Many of you commit self-sabotage because you secretly think you're unworthy of friendship and being loved. If you've walked in their shoes for many miles they will know immediately. And you won't have to fake empathy because you've been through it yourself.   


Think on these things.   


""If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

905,x66714,J87ckoFireBeard,"Hey guys, so a bit about me. I’m a 34 married m UK. I live in Yorkshire, but not originally from this part of the country.

I’ve come to realise that I don’t really have any proper friends! I have a small group of mates that I know through work, but outside of work I don’t see them all that often. My best mate out of work is a lad I went to school with and so lives back in my home town and I don’t see him that often.
I’ve just got back into going to the gym, love a beer, watching rugby &amp; F1, and getting out for hikes with the dog.

I’ve come to realise as a grown man it’s not that easy to make new friends and you have to get out there and make an effort rather than waiting for it to happen for you! Which is what has led to me being here!

I’m looking to make contact with other men late 20’s to late 30’s. Initial contact on here is fine, but I don’t use it too much so looking to move it away from Reddit towards WhatsApp where we can share a bit of banter, check ins on each other etc. If we can get a group of us with similar aims that’s even better! And bonus points if there is someone close enough to get out for a beer, walk or gym session with!

972,x6gq6p,[deleted],"There was a study done on attractiveness, and how people pursue partners. The study entailed men and women being rated on attractiveness by the opposing groups. The groups would then be given their rating on a piece of paper and placed on their forehead. No one knew their own rating. 

The men and women would line up single file and would walk past each other in a room and they would then try to pick who they found attractive.

The study found that everyone would tend to go after the top rated man and woman. Over time, each would pair off with their respective rating. Keep in mind, that no one knew their own rating. Once paired off, everyone’s rating would be revealed, showing that everyone unknowingly paired off with similarly rated counterparts. 

According to this study, Dating is a numbers game. It’s a game you gotta keep playing if you want to win. Everyone pursues attraction, everyone is drawn to finding the most attractive mate. Everyone is drawn to finding kinship of some sort. Rejection is painful, if you let it, it can destroy your self worth and confidence. But rejection isn’t what defines you. Don’t give up, play the game for yourself and win. Don’t let anyone tell you what you’re worth, you feeling dejected and alone and worthless is not the truth. 

The truth is you are worth being with, you are beautiful, handsome and wonderful. You might not be attractive to some, but that doesn’t mean you’re not attractive at all. Rejection is simple chemistry, some things don’t go together, and that’s ok! You want the right fit. :) You want the right person to see you for who you are, not the wrong person to never see you.

I don’t recall the source of the actual study itself, it was a video I watched in college lol. :). My heart weeps for the souls searching on this sub for kinship, you are not alone.

This leads to two things: One is that they are either uninterested or unavailable (which is fine as I didnt care about that when I interacted with them initially), and secondly they think I tried to be their friend only to get in their pants, and then they cut me off( loss of friendship honestly hurts more than just rejection)

So, all in all, I think if I don't change this friendship before feelings thing, I think I ll never find someone. I have tried dating apps, but did not find anyone attractive enough as there were no interactions before, hence no swipe right. 

Most recent knife in the gut was when I was talking to my current crush/close friend on how I never got feelings before friendship, and she said while laughing that she never got feelings for somebody after friendship. It didn't help that I was a bit drunk while conversing lmao.

I even had a beautiful girlfriend I dated online till I could go see her on her birthday ( for reference 19M and 17M so wasn't legal for me to see her ). That relationship was awesome till I fucked it up royally by being too honest.
I tried moving on with another girl who decided to ghost me, block me, then delete her account when I used another. After we had already been fucking in my car and talking about date ideas. Funny enough that shit happened just 2 weeks before I deployed 7500 fucking miles away from home. 

To get back to the point, here recently I feel like nothing is worth it anymore. Not In a depressed way, but in a whole cares way. Everynight I go to bed and just lay here, I feel angry. More anger than I have before except extreme cases. Im laying here angry about how fucked people are, about how that girl just dropped me like that, how I have no real life back home. Back home I go to work and go home and thats it. And I fucking hate it. I'm tired of being so damn lonely, but at this point its not my fault anymore. I just want to yell at something. I interact with my coworkers and they smile and laugh but do they invite me to their plans, when they invited everyone else. No, they don't.

976,x6hebm,MillTeaDuck,"Yaho.. 23M here. I want to let out my feelings once again.
Life is incredibly difficult when you're in a position of having no money, no luck, no one to help you. My dad has left me from a very young age, my mom is everything I have. She works so hard for me still, and I greatly appreciate her, but we've always been poor. I couldn't afford going to college, I had to struggle finding free courses and self study in order to get into a job because I can't do physical labor due to health reasons.
I had a lot of friends while I was young, and a teen, around the age of 13. That however, changed as I grew older. I've realized that, although I do watch anime, I play lots of games, I read a lot of books, play board games, and be overall very versatile; I can't find anyone to actually keep a friendship with me.
For as long as I've known myself, I've been the kind and considerate person. Always checking up on everyone, trying my darnest to bring the best out of them, and yet, no one stuck with me.. Why?
Well, I do not know for sure, but.. What I do know, is that I've been very unlucky.
I'm in general funny, interesting, pretty good with social skills, wonderful with emotional intelligence, but everyone around me.. or the people I meet online..aren't. I try to help them slowly get there but then I realize it only does more harm, because even though I'm doing something good for them, they don't take it well at all.
I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, and all I ever wanted was a friend that I could share my time and thoughts with while they do the same with me.
I've almost never been texted first and asked how I am or how I'm doing, never asked to do something together or spend time..

These.. online friendships have never worked for me, but with the bad neighborhood I live in, I'd even have in lesser chances in real life.
I'm becoming increasingly desperate day by day, when I realize I'm getting closer to my 30s and I've no one that would currently even tell me happy birthday.. aside from family which is just my mom, really.

I would like to meet like-minded people but.. I've tried everywhere and nobody seemed to.. actually want anything meaningful.
It's almost as if my generation is afraid to actually commit, and when I help them commit to it, they back down.. I'm emotionally stunned, broken and lost.

But I heavily thought that I had BPD because of the lashing out, fast mood changes, etc. My gf tried to do many things to make me feel less lonely, sometimes it would work sometimes it didn’t.

This morning, I broke up with my girlfriend. I told her I felt lonely and sad and felt that the relationship wasn’t going anywhere. I feel like the worst person on the planet, she did nothing wrong yet here I am leaving her because of a lonely feeling and sadness that probably doesn’t have anything to do with the relationship, and probably just a mental health issue I have yet to get confirmed.

So, now I’m just sitting here, thinking. Did I make the right choice for myself? I don’t know. But, has anyone ever been in my shoes before?  Maybe knowing if some people have been in my shoes, I can learn more. But I don’t care if you haven’t be in my shoes, I’m willing to hear what you have to say as-well.

I still love her.",2022-09-05 14:42:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661725178,0,/r/lonely/comments/x6hvet/anyone_ever_felt_lonely_andor_sad_in_a/,,0,2,"Anyone ever felt lonely and/or sad in a relationship, even tho there’s nothing wrong with it?"

It's been 9 months since I last used this account, and I'm happy to say that I'm back with good news!

College started in January of 2022 and I've managed to make a friend, and even though we barely have anything in common atleast I have someone I can eat lunch with. He checked up on me one time when I ended up skipping 3 weeks of college for personal reasons and nobody had genuinely checked up on me before him so that felt great.

I'm also seeing someone now! We've always been online friends even though we live just a few miles apart, and we're yet to meet up because authoritative parents and stuff.
We've actually known each other since 2020 but we used to be acquaintances. Lost contact for a while and started talking again 5 months ago, and then fell for each other 3 months ago.
She's everything I could've asked for and more. Our relationship isn't always sunshine and roses, we communicate things we don't like the other doing, we understand and make compromises, we're completely transparent and honest, and we plan on being together for forever. She's usually more emotional and I'm usually more logical, so we make a good combination. She knows everything about my past and I know everything about her's aswell. She feels like home and I love it to bits. We've discussed and planned out our lives multiple years into the future keeping our passions and interests in mind.

This feels great. It's amazing progress and I have no words to describe how happy I finally am.

Made a friend after college started.

But every since i told him i have depression and anxiety he didn't care much.

When i was sharing my life problems he seemed emphatic from time to time but one day he told me i am too negative because i talk about the world problems(not only mine)

I told him i talk about him about serious things,the future of Earth,generations,what is going on with the world which are not negative but reality.He even told me many times he never has much intelligent conversations with his friends because i talk about everything from daily things to space,aliens,politics.

But the thing is if i didn't talked about he never got topic to discuss.He never seemed to care about anything.He was careless about almost anything around him.

I know i have issues like depression,social anxiety but i was only sharing with him because i trusted him and i loved him as friend.

He was loyal and we had good fun,but he found new group of friends last year and i guess that's why he slowly faded from our friendship.

I hate him for lefting me but miss him at the same [time.](https://time.Now)I have some other friends but not that close.I can't share anything to anyone.I am alone.

At least i want explanation.Why he didn't say what is bothering him.Was i became too depressed.I can't control it but i thought real friends are there for you.

He became totally different person.He was sensitive months before the ghosting,about every little joke or something.

It's so sad when i get exciting news or some news and then realize i have no one to share it with.

I'm tired, moved out alone and I guess I am having a hard time adjusting to doing everything by myself with no help. But it's been 7 months, you figure I would of got the hang of it by now. I know it's just this fucked up mindset but I don't know how to change it. Or maybe just maybe it's because I am now finally asking for help and finding no one is here. I just don't want to keep doing everything alone its draining. And man what I would give for someone to just make me a cup of tea 😄.

1026,x6ocn9,dinkiedorf,"A year ago today my lifetime childhood best friend passed away in a car accident in our small community of around 300 total people (speaking in terms of population) We came from a very small community where a lot of people are related and families are weaved tightly. I can’t say it’s gotten better nor easier since he’s passed not even for a waking moment. I’m distant with a lot of our mutual friends and the healing hands of time feel as though they’ve not gotten their hands onto me yet. I’m 21 years old. I was a really bubbly and personable guy in highschool and often had a large social circle but with my best friend dying last year I haven’t really bounced back into any of that sociability. I moved even, hours away but still not where I was. I feel really alone, when I’m with our mutual friends especially. I’m still grieving and it often feels like some form of self torture or like I won’t allow myself to heal because maybe I’ve seen so many people just brush it off like his 20 years and mine were of different value, I often was in vehicles partying with said friend so I have to sit here and wonder the feelings my family would have if I were there that fatal night. I’m not even sure what exactly I’m doing here. But it’s been a year to the day and it still has left a large hole right through the center of my chest and a bottomless pit in my stomach. If there’s anyone else in the world with a heavy heart today, I hope you find some peace and relief, I hope you hug your loved ones and your friends today and think about your life a year ago today, because sometimes our lives can end so fast and once it’s over it is over forever. All that is left are the feelings that circulate in the ones you loved and the ones you left.",2022-09-05 19:06:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649628888,2,/r/lonely/comments/x6ocn9/a_year_ago_todaydealing_with_grief_and_true/,,0,2,A year ago today/dealing with grief and true isolation

Also local would be awesome 


Also just started playing osrs again so if you wanna play on that it would be cool. 

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

After my group got up to leave I went over to her and asked her if she’d like to get drinks with me, she said she was down and gave me her number.

Surprise surprise, when I texted her to make a plan, she ignored me. Really thought she would have been down to grab drinks.

Why not just say she has a boyfriend, or can’t give her number in front of her boss or going away or anything rather than give me the false hope.

1067,x6v0ow,DanceImpossible1394,I’m trying to see a point in continuing life but I just can’t seem to find any. I wasn’t depressed like this but my brother just passed away from suicide and idk what to do. My brother was the one to help everyone before himself making sure everyone is happy and a better version of themselves. He was the family favorite and he just left just like that. He helped me through hard times and said “we gotta stick together because that’s all we got”but in the end I wasn’t there for him. It haunts me thinking that I was a bad brother and I could’ve done something to help him. I miss him so much and everyday I talk to him and just think back but nothing stops the pain. The pain of losing someone you care deeply about and it keeps me up at night. I try sleeping early or taking pills to sleep but nothing works and I’ve tried smoking so much I couldn’t move but that doesn’t stop the flashbacks. I get flashbacks of the call and the pain in my fathers voice just hearing him say “my boy hung himself” over and over just thinking why why us.

A year ago I’ve met someone [28M] we loved each other a lot and did a f%#ck ton together, He was in my life almost daily. I’ve spent months with him doing all sorts of stuff, however ever since we broke up, the things that we used to do together hit me the most, listing to music, playing video games, watching movies/series and dressing nicely because I always wanted to look very pretty for him, all bring back a certain feeling.. 

A feeling that’s incredibly hard to put into words, but memories are coming back because of the near approaching months as the first months of our contact where the happiest months of my life, back when he didn’t abuse me, he cared for me, he didn’t hurt me, was gentle, loving and caring, and wasn’t rough towards me. 

Now these months are approaching with no one really with me, the time I really want someone by my side again. these memories are a curse, they make me feel terrible, I wish i could put him behind me, but for some reason, as much as I like to say I’m “over him” I’m still very much heart broken about him not being here anymore, even when he’s a complete and utter nobhead, he treated me like shit, he’s has hurt me so much yet I’m still saddened, still having him on my mind.. or atleast the nostalgia.",2022-09-06 00:36:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661982657,6,/r/lonely/comments/x6w5jm/18f_nostalgia/,,0,9,[18F] nostalgia..

1091,x6y18z,FiNaLPRoXY,"Hey, I don't usually do this but I'm trying to fall asleep and I'm fighting my feeling of loneliness and trying to understand why I am like this, could use some kindness. Honestly, I think I just want to be heard by someone that's not a therapist to feel accepted by a stranger cause I seem to struggle to accept myself.


If you're interested in what I'm dealing with, I'm not afraid to share it online, here goes.


I'm a young 20s guy, with an alright setup in life, still live at home, going to school and have some friends I can hangout with sometimes. Externally I feel like I look like I'm successful and happy but I'm struggling inside since everything is superficial and not emotional as I'm too much of a coward to express feelings to anyone besides my brother who is in another country and my therapist who has an obligation to listen. I'm a bit of a loner and a quiet type, but not always, I can get social when I drink or feel at ease emotionally with someone. 


I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I see a therapist regularly, take meds and journal once in a while so I thought I'd be doing better but it always feels like a temporary fix as the core issue is still me and I can't help but blame myself and go in a circle eventually spiraling down then get better after a session or something. 


I've been getting better slowly, as I've been going to the gym, reading and trying to improve myself personally but I don't have anyone that I feel like I can share my victories with or fall to when I'm suddenly feeling like shit. I've never had a ""real"" relationship, and those that I have had were very short like just a month long and nothing too deep that I'd consider them significant. I know I don't want to put pressure on another person to help me, or rely on them completely as it should be mutual and I do try to put my significant other first but I've usually ended up putting them before myself and we never address my problem which I think usually leads to an early end. It hurts, cause I feel like I'm the broken one and I end up trying to be my own support system even though I'm not the best at that. I usually end up convincing myself that I just have to keep fixing myself before anyone can even look at me for who I really am, that I don't deserve attention because I'm still an incomplete mess. 


I'm aware that I could easily fall down a red pill hole with these problems and I try to actively avoid anything resembling it as I know better, but I'm still vulnerable. I'm not the only one that deals with these issues, but recently I've just felt like I got to a boiling point that I keep wanting to express how I feel inside about my whole situation to someone but I always end up keeping it to myself as I try to fall sleep alone in the dark again. 


I could really use a hug and someone just being human to be honest.",2022-09-06 02:03:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1374704837,6,/r/lonely/comments/x6y18z/feeling_extremely_lonely_and_need_some/,,0,2,Feeling extremely lonely and need some encouragement

The thought of you and the new girl you met - the one you abandoned me for.

The one you said you are now emotionally involved in. And ditched me for.

I wonder if you ever woke up and realize how painful it has been for me. Do you ever look at something in your house and thought of me ? Thought of what you have done to me ?

Did you wake up the next morning after destroying me and my heart, thinking about what you have done ?

Did you text your new girl, and remembered how you used to text me ? How you have hurt me so severely ?

Have you ever gone to bed, thinking about my three words ? Or that was all just a game you played with me ? And it meant nothing to you ?

I cannot breathe. I cannot feel peace. Not when I keep thinking about you and the new girl, how you told me things are going well for both of you. How could you break my heart and chose her because she is nearer ? An easier option for you ?

In fact, this is really the first poem I have ever written.  It's probably really bad but I honestly don't know. Heck, it is kind of short so I don't even know if it is done.

Figured I share it just for fun.

THE LONELY POEM

No one gives a shit.

You must always remember.

No one gives a shit.

You will be alone forever.

&amp;#x200B;

  
They don’t want to hear.

They'll never shed a tear.

Alone, you’ll drink your beer.

The only one you can trust is staring back, in the mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

  
This was never your plan.

Yet here you stand.

The only member of a one man band.

You are your own biggest fan.

&amp;#x200B;

  
People are mean and selfish.

People pass the buck.

They point and blame.

People truly suck.",2022-09-06 03:36:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1584904049,15,/r/lonely/comments/x6zz48/the_lonely_poem/,,0,1,The Lonely Poem

1110,x705jz,Specialist_Path1535,"This year I'm 15, and I changed schools at 13. I've never felt more alone, no one talks to me at school and they all just make fun of me or ask me to go away. Even the people I first made friends with at the start of the year all found their own friend groups and left me behind. The only friend I've had for 3 years is my brother, and even he has his own friends. Whenever my brother goes out (hes younger than me) my parents always ask me why im never invited out, and I dont even know why.

I changed class this year and still everyone ignores me, I've even seen the teachers to ask how to make friends but none of their tactics work. whenever there's a group project, im always stuck alone or with someone who couldnt fit into their friend group's group. I feel so lonely especially on holidays... I'm lucky even to be added to the class group chat (I had to ask 3 months after I joined the class) and its dead af so they probably have another chat without me... but still its alive enough that I can see all of my classmates going out together without me on holidays. I'm too scared to download instagram or anything else because I don't want to know how unpopular I am. All I do during the holidays are just play games, and not even multiplayer cuz i dont have anyone to play with.. im such a loser

Once I even asked a guy I thought I was friends with (i only talked to him twice before that, im such a idiot) whether I could join him and his friends to watch a movie. He told me the wrong date on purpose and I ended up waiting at the movie theater for 3 hours waiting for him and his friends.. only to see that they went out the day after.

We are officially alone now, my wife will deal with this in her own indomitable way. And I will have to deal with it in mine.
We raised a family together and built the best life we could, but we are strangers to one another and I was recently told, by her that she is unhappy.
I can accept the fact that the children have left and have their own lives to lead, but for the first time in my life, I am truly afraid. 
I’m quite sure, that there are no turns left to take, except the final one.
She will be taken care of, financially, I’ve seen too that. And I don’t think she’s going to miss me too much, I know the kids won’t, I don’t have any friends or things like that, so I guess that won’t hurt too much.
My brothers and sisters haven’t spoken to me in years, and didn’t even call last year when I was in the hospital, come to think of it. No one else did either.

1117,x70lir,Dante_in_the_inferno,I used to love being alone when I was younger primarily because I was bullied all the time and never really experienced a true friendship. But when I was in high-school I made some really good friends at least at the time and fell head over heels inlove with a girl. Unfortunately everyone from then turned out to be really horrible and super 2 faced people who would all eventually betray me in their one ways and ghost me.

Ever since you said ""good bye"" so easily and cut ties with me entirely, my life has been death. I don't think I am emotionally alive.

I am just an empty vessel at this moment.

You took every part of me with you, and broke my heart completely. I gave my heart to you long ago and you broke it. You shattered it. But it is still yours. Still yours.

I refuse to believe you'd treat me with so much affection and adoration, spoke to with such wonderful passionate words, challenged my fear on intimacy and had me opening to you as I trust you more and more...only to destroy me with only one sentence.

""I am emotionally involved with someone else""

All the words you gave me, it was all a lie ?

The weeks we spent talking to each other day and night, the sentiments we created, the dreams and fantasies we shared amidst our vulnerability, was it all just a game to you ? Some sort of a role-play just to see how I'd react ?

I saw a bike similar to yours - the yamaha. Except that it was in blue. The guy had a female passenger behind him. 

Remember when you told me I'd be a good companion behind you ? And you said thinking about me being behind you made you ride with more cautious. 

That day you called me a delicate flower and you made an analogy :

If you imagined having a delicate flower being behind you, you'd ride carefully and not surprise me with sudden breaks or turns. 

You said you saved the passenger seat for me and no one will ever get to ride behind you.

I guess it was a lie all this time ?

Now that you met someone that rides too. And she'll be your companion, the one that can sit behind you and that seat is now hers.

She'll be your companion for your rides. She can ride her own bike and tag along with you on your mandatory rides. That's a dream come true for you isn't it ? Is that why you disposed of me the second you met her ?

I cherish this sentiment so much and it means a lot to me. But I guess, it was a lie. Just something you said because it felt right at the moment and not something you meant truly.

But it meant a lot to me. Words. I cherish words. And not just simple words. The words from you.

I remember telling you how much I love the ""vroom"" sound a bike makes and you said after knowing that, whenever you did the ""vroom"" sound on your rides, you'd smile like a little boy because you know I love it.

Will the ""vroom"" sound still remind you of me now ? Or it was also a lie ? 

I never get to tell you this before. But I have always loved motorcyles like yours. And when I was small, I wished to be able to ride one. I once told you my parents did not allow it. But last week, I talked to them and they somehow supported my rekindled interest.

I did not get to tell you about it. You left before I get to share this news.  My father even suggested some bikes I could actually get and how to get the license to ride a bike. It was a good day.

But I did not get to tell you about it. I wish I could. But would it matter ?

I miss our bike jokes. I miss you saying ""yamahahaha"" and how I'd laugh at that. 

But you left me.",2022-09-06 09:08:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662267305,3,/r/lonely/comments/x75q62/you_made_me_felt_more_alone_than_ever/,,0,0,you made me felt more alone than ever

But I feel like I have to.

At the moment I feel very lonely. I'm never alone because I'm a stay home mom to a almost 3 y/o.

I'm happily married to the most amazing man I have ever met. We tried to get pregnant right after marriage, I lost the baby within the first trimester, got pregnant again and pregnancy went great. I'd describe my birth story as a traumatic one.

Because everything that's going on in Europe at the moment, we decided not to have another child. That decision broke me.

It's a decision my husband and I made together, yet I'm projecting all my negative emotions on him. I have the constant that feeling he's taking everything away from me I've ever wanted. Which is not true.

I tried to get advice from friends and family (things are complicated there as well) but no one listens or understands.

I feel lost and trapped at the bottom of a spiral of sadness and can't get out.

I see many post in this sub about people just needing a conversation or some relief from day to day struggle and the issue that is mainly being adressed into this sub. 

I’ve seen post about girls getting harassed if they post with things you should not even ask a person. 

Thats why i would like to say, if any of you want to have a normal chill conversation with someone, just DM me. 

Something about myself : i have battled different stages of loneliness trough my life and i’m sure i can relate to all your experiences. Mind you, not only loneliness. 

So, just a help line - instead of making a post and get 50 DM’s for f**** nudes, text me and well talk and ill try to give you my best advice.

Just go watch it.

You will hear a TON of advice that is just unbelievably spot on, but you might dismiss a lot of it because it doesn't click at that moment. I realized that absolutely every word he said during the ""advice"" part of the video is spot on and is something that I had to painstakingly come to the realization of it over many years. If you don't get why something he says works the way he says, or you disagree, don't dismiss it. Give it some thought even if at the end you ultimately decide a piece of advice doesn't fit you. I would have disagreed with a ton of things 2 years ago, but now that I have worked a bunch to get a circle of friends, I think he just nailed everything he said!

Hi folks,

There  are lots of lovely folks on here, but every post I've read through  seems to be on the lookout for something very different from what I'm  seeking.

Loneliness has been a  theme throughout my life, has led me to attempt suicide at one point,  and recently I got so lonely that I spent an immense amount of money  (despite being far from rich) flying overseas to meet up with someone  who I'd only met a couple of times over a decade ago, simply because  they were kind to me when we met in a way that nobody else has been  since.

Most people on this sub  seem to be looking for an online friendship or a gaming partner, but  I've never really played video games and I don't have that much interest  in online friendship. I really need someone to meet up with in actual  real life.

I have a reasonable  sense of humour but can't be described as a particularly open or jolly  person. Topics I'd like to discuss are loneliness, depression,  bitterness, rage, self-loathing, crippling laziness, and other such  pleasant themes. I'm also interested in magic mushrooms, religion,  cycling, psychogeography, literature and right-of-centre politics.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

I worked with a girl in Chem lab last week. I missed an observation, and I knew I'd have to ask her for it today. I did my best to make sure she had to disclose as little info about her as possible to answer; tried to jog her memory, and was planning to offer my email if she was willing to email me it once she got home if she couldn't remember. That was the plan.

Well, she didn't remember. And then before I could inject my script into the conversation, she offered to exchange numbers. My singular goal at the time was to make sure she didn't have to give her number, cuz I know sometimes that's seen as somewhat intimate nowadays (or at least I think it is, since so many seem to use messenger, what's app, snapchat, or any sort of proxy, apparently so they don't have to disclose their phone number)

But anyways, I then like immediately threw and offered email instead. So I could've had her number, she offered it willingly to me, but I denied it in favor of email. Idgaf about giving my number out and I think it's silly to, personally, but now I look like the one who wanted to keep some semblance of distance.

After it happened, I like legitimately mourned the loss of the chance for a while. It took 2 hours for that feeling to go away.



But I don't know why it upset me, and that question is what killed the mourning. Having her number is no real boon, it's not like she would've texted me for fun or asked me out or something. It would've just been a different way to communicate. Sure, I think it's perceived as slightly more intimate nowadays, but only barely, and certainly not enough so to draw any conclusions from.

I made a comment recently saying that I have a deep divide between my intellectual beliefs and my emotional beliefs, and I think that's why this happened. Like, I know as certainly as I can know anything that me having her number would've changed absolutely nothing in my life. I could believe the earth isn't a sphere easier than I could believe that having her number was any sort of ""chance"" at anything. Yet my emotions responded as if I'd believed I'd lost the chance at a soulmate. It's a very cruel trick nature pulls, making us consciously aware of how reality works and yet forcing our conscious minds to watch in horror and disgust as our unconscious mind believes and acts on lies. Part of the fragility of being human, I guess. I'm not even safe in my own head.





This was just gonna be a vent, but now I'm kinda curious what others think. Do you feel this divide between intellectual and emotional beliefs as well? What sort of contradictory beliefs do you hold because of it, and how do they affect your life? Do you know of any way to help bridge the gap and let your intellect take control of your emotions, or are we all cursed to exist forever at the whims of our subroutines?",2022-09-06 21:44:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603483175,0,/r/lonely/comments/x7msmn/i_dont_know_why_im_upset_by_this/,,0,0,I don't know why I'm upset by this

1249,x7ofp2,Slight-Abies-1536,"Having been sexless for the past 5 years, and experiencing zero romantic intimacy as well as barely any physical / emotional affection, I decided I would finally, at age 37M, seek a temporary and artificial ""fix"" for my situation by paying for it. 

It was not worth it, and has only left me feeling worse off. 

The escort (which seems a generous term given the encounter) herself was very detached and severely lacking in energy. It's not like I was expecting some royal treatment, but the whole thing was underwhelming and even more impersonal than I could have imagined. The sex acts themselves were awkward and didn't serve to release 'bonding' chemicals or anything like that. I was immediately thinking ""This isn't as good as I remember"" and it certainly wasn't. Obviously there would be a difference between doing it with a stranger vs. someone you love, but that difference was much more significant than I thought it would be. I was relieved when it was over.

I don't really need to expand on the details to get at the core of my message which is, in my case at least, paying for it will do nothing to alleviate your loneliness. Instead you will feel shame and regret and wish you had just jerked off instead, sparing yourself the feelings of self-disgust. 

Maybe if I had a superior sex worker I would be writing a whole different post, but I can only reflect on the experience I *did* have, and knowing what I know now, I've no desire to give it another go.

I know for a fact that im slowly going crazy, between the loneliness and the job I hate and all my other issues, and I just wish I had somebody I could tell without scaring them off. 
I have a best friend but he’s my best friend out of necessity, because I have no one else, and I cant even trust him one bit, I cant trust a word that comes out of his mouth, and he just had a kid, so he’s too preoccupied now anyways, so I just have to sit here and keep all this bottled in.
I see all these relationship tiktoks and these memes about having a gf and it just hurts, like a ball of longing that pinches so tight I could cry. I want what they have so bad, the person they could literally tell anything and they wont think of them any less, the person who wont give up on them no matter what (except in cases of like cheating and abuse and that kind of thing), the person who accepts them for who they are, their flaws, their imperfections, all of it. I want that person I dont have to be scared to say anything too for fear of how they’d react. I want that person who matches my energy, who makes me so happy ghat just the thought of them makes me overjoyed, no matter how bad of a day I’m having, the light at the end of the tunnel, the daylight at the top of the hole I cant seem to dig myself out of. The person who sees that I texted them and immediately responds, who checks their phone every 2 seconds to see if I texted them back. The person I cant stop texting even though I know I need to go to bed. 
I am such a giver, I would give you the shirt off my back, the last dollar in my bank account, I would give you everything I have to the point it starts hurting me, but I wouldn’t care because I would do anything to ease your pain, your sorrows, I would make your problems my problems so that you dont have to think about them and you can get through your day, because knowing I made your day easier and better would be all I need to get through my day.

I just wish I could find someone to do all that for, but I have no idea where to begin, and no self confidence to just say fuck it and dive in headfirst, so I’m typing all this out here because I dont know what else to do, where else to turn, I just know I cant keep going on like this, and if any of you guys can give me some help, somewhere to start, some company, hell even a place I can go and copy paste this with some hopefully better results I would greatly appreciate it.

1254,x7okja,peachberrybloom,"I know comparison is bad and all, but it’s very clear to me that everyone around me has companionship in one way or another and I do not. Everyone has a best friend or a sister or a spouse or kids or a close aunt or SOMEONE. I’m 25 with a broken family, a sickly alcoholic mom and a father who generally doesn’t seem to enjoy even hearing from me. I am an only child who struggled through childhood and school. I know of my extended family, but they weren’t ever a big part of my life even as a little kid. I got married young and it only lasted a couple of years - from that experience I learned that I am infertile and cannot even create my own family. I’ve tried my best to make friends over the years but I’m incredibly socially anxious and awkward, nor am I conventionally attractive. People don’t just approach me dying to chat. 

I’m doing well for myself. I went back to school this year, adopted cats, tried to make new friends and grow closer bonds to family - but nothing has came of it. I have moments where I think I’m wonderful and I would love to meet someone just like me, and I have other moments where I question what the hell is wrong with me to be so isolated. My depression has worsened in this last year, and my only option for someone to talk to is the suicide hotline. That sentence in itself depresses me even more.

I often think I’d feel “normal” if I had a close family, or a friend group, or a partner. But the years keep passing despite my efforts to connect, and I am still isolated - so instead, I’m just getting progressively more mentally ill.

1271,x7rb79,Atelierkth_,"8.43 am , 7/9/2022

I woke up trembling in fear, my chest hurts and I cannot breathe. I dreamed about you telling me about the new girl.

It hurts. It hurts too much I wish I can just die just so I will not have to go through this ache.

I slept with my fairy lights on - I never did that. I have been sleeping with my tv on ever since Saturday night. I cannot sleep without any sound in the background. It makes me feel like I am too alone and the quietness is swallowing me alive.

I cannot sleep with my usual night lamp because I am now scared of the dark. I need more lights to feel safe, like I am not alone. I used to love watching the sky gets dark but now I tremble in fear as the sun sets. It makes me anxious knowing it is getting darker. It makes my chest hurts because I am terrified of what may come when the sky gets darker.

I thought I was feeling less shittier last night. I finally made my bed and washed my hair. I felt numb for a while. But when I got into bed, exhausted of crying, the thought of you hit me like a stab through my heart.

I remembered your words about me when you said you adored me like I am your muse. You called me your muse once, remember ? 

Then I remembered your words about the girl - how you are so interested in her, how you defended her in front of me, how one day you suddenly said ""I am emotionally invested with someone else now"" . 

I am scared of so many things right now. I am scared of every single thing in my house because there is you. There is you in everything. I am petrified of my own feelings because they will devour me.

It has been death since Saturday. I wonder how you could have lived normally, knowing you put me in this loop of anxiety and pain.

I wish I could write to God and ask of you. You hurt me. You killed me inside. But, I still miss you.",2022-09-07 01:02:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662267305,2,/r/lonely/comments/x7rb79/i_woke_up_in_fear_today/,,0,1,i woke up in fear today

1285,x7sofx,[deleted],"Next month is my birthday. I hate my birthday. I am going to turn 28. I’m a guy.  Typical lonely guy.

I have spent every birthday for the past 8 years by myself. I never liked to make a big deal about my birthday. My parents didn’t have a lot of money so I never asked for a lot. When I moved out, I felt like I would be inconveniencing people if I told them it was my birthday. Like, they’d feel like they have to celebrate my birthday. I told myself if anyone wanted to celebrate my birthday, someone would come up to me and plan something.

In 8 years, no one has ever planned anything. Friends and family text me happy birthday. But I live in a different city every couple years due to work, so those people are far away. So every birthday I buy a little cupcake, light one candle, and make a wish. It’s pathetic.

I don’t like the life I have. I have a great job, make good money. Chose a job where I could stay home a lot. Set up my life for family life. But I have nobody.

Seriously though. Nobody needs me. I could die tomorrow and everyone will be fine. My nephews, my siblings, my parents would be sad, but they’d move on. No one truly needs me. I’m not suicidal. I just see how little and insignificant I am. 

Oh and also, I discovered recently that Asian men are the least attractive race to date. I’m indian. So I guess I’m unattractive too. Apparently Asian men have to make 75% more than a white man to be equally attractive. Stats coming from data from dating apps.

Just. Wow. Life could be worse. My life is way better than others. I acknowledge that. Still though. Being lonely is tough",2022-09-07 02:06:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/x7sofx/birthday/,,0,1,Birthday

Ask my so called friends to hang, we plan a day, everyone bails last minute claiming they need to do something important or just cause they can't (for whatever reason). Next minute they are active on insta or posting stories with others. Or even just getting a text back is like pulling teeth. Try to make new friends and they just stay until they realize they got what they want, if anything at all. Seems like no gives a flying fuck about anything anymore and just to even talk to someone is like booking a doctor's appointment.

I keep thinking about a gym class I had in high school few years ago. There was this girl who was a year ahead of me and I didn't know her well, I just knew she was super outgoing and friendly. One day she probably saw how upset I was, I don't remember why, I was just having a rough day I guess. But she came over to me and asked if she could hug me and I said she could. It was the warmest most caring hug I've ever felt and it was so hard for me to hold back my tears.

1300,x7vcy3,Sleepy_snowy,"I’m sorry guys, I just need a platform to let out my thoughts to some kind of audience.

When I was 9, I moved out to a farm, which I still live on today, and became homeschooled. My mother decided not to teach me for whatever reason, so my education level was left at a 2nd grade level, that isn’t the worst part though. For the next 10 odd years, after a significant amount of fighting with my mom until I gave up, I pretty much sat in my room and lived more or less the same day over and over. I got up, got online with some friends, played all day, went to sleep. I didn’t really make any real memories and it wasn’t until my childhood was over, that I realized I didn’t really have a childhood. 
When I turned 18 I got a job, and realized I still wanted to go to college, I discovered I was actually pretty smart and was able to complete my GED in just 3 months, 1 month after that I did my college entry exams, then straight into college. My family was not very supportive which whatever. Things were looking up, but then Covid hit only 3\4ths through what was an amazing semester, then it was back to my normal lonely life, after that I decided to try moving out, and roomed with my cousins… I didn’t know at the time, but they were very much into drugs and I couldn’t go back home bc I was fighting with my dad, so I became really depressed, I didn’t want to be around the drugs and parties, yet it was impossible to avoid, I finally just walked out one day because I was completely lost. due to some drama I lost all the friends I made, then I kinda lost traction and two years, many failed classes later after once having perfect 4.0, I don’t have any friends, I haven’t talked to anyone but my mom in like a year. I’m just so unmotivated, all I do is study and work, but without human connection or people to laugh with it’s all just so dreadful. I’m realizing that it is the people that make life worth living.

I had never had something so perfect and for the first time I felt happy. 5 months ago my “family” sent me back with my bio mother and my friends stopped talking to me and my ex broke up with me. So ofc I was sad and upset but it hasn’t gone away. I constantly feel like there’s no point to life if there’s no happiness. I don’t think that anything could ever make me happy again because I don’t know how to be happy. I couldn’t say what I want in a person or even what kind of person I am. I can’t watch anything on tv or play any games because they just don’t make me happy anymore. And when something doesn’t make me happy then it makes me upset and my whole body shuts down and I can’t even do anything about it.

Remember I sent you a song, ""High school in Jakarta"" by NIKI ?

It was went things went downhill - you meeting someone else while we were still talking . When things had to tone down because you have someone else you're interested in.

That time I thought we can stilll stay friends - normal friends. No longer ""us"".

Our conversations went from full of affection and sentiments, to what you call ""a stripped down version"" . No sentiments. Like two strangers who never shared feelings and deepest thoughts. Like two people who had never shared affection and talked about intimacy. 

There is a line in the song that goes:

""And although you bring me to tears
I'm glad that we gave it a go""

It was my internal thought. We didn't specifically and explicitly said to give ""us"" a go but we somehow did. Or I thought so. Or I was just led on.

I still wonder how we went from being so close and almost like lovers for weeks but things just changed the second you saw her. 

There is another line from the song that hits me so hard after you said goodbye so easily :

""Glad she gave it to you real hard, but I loved you harder""

She can give it to you hard and real, because she is there and near to you. I am just an online figure you used and played, a temporary fun until you found a real one.

But truly, I love you harder.",2022-09-07 09:28:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654610202,2,/r/lonely/comments/x80kwz/remember_i_sent_you_a_song/,,0,0,remember I sent you a song ?

I had friends whos houses I could drive to and hang out and we all got in a large group and just walked around town. 

We all had the same sense of humor and we were just always laughing for hours and we would do dumb shit like run around drinking and smoking. I got so much physical activity just being around friends we are always outside and running around. We went on car rides together or just drove around with other people going to houses, meeting up, smoking, hanging out. 

And now my life is shit. I have no friends and everyone I talk to just ghosts me or is rude. Even if I meet people it’s not like my old friends where we just laugh and talk stress free and all like the same things.

1344,x844am,Brigxtte,"I wish I meant something to someone again.. A year ago I've met someone \[28M\] and we got along well, we ended up getting feelings for each other because we both saw there was a great chemistry between us. He made me feel special by just being there for me, someone to talk too and spent time with, most of our time was spend just chatting, playing with each other and listening to music, now that he's out of my life, it has left a giant hole in my heart.   
It also begged the question: Am I really missing him?   
Don't get me wrong, my feelings where genuine, I loved him dearly, but he was also my first, someone I held close to my heart because of sentimental value, while for him I was just another playdate.  
I didn't see his flaws because he was ""perfect"" to me, when in reality the first time I met/saw him, I said to myself ""there is no way in hell that we'll be a thing"", He's tall, I'm short\~ish He's build ""heavily"" while I'm skinny, He's older, I'm younger along with other things, yet our chemistry was off the charts, He really made me feel special, also having a giant boost by having a feeling I've never experienced before, it made us play all the right cards at the right time, it felt like we where ""made for each other"".  


He ended up being a giant red flag, with abusing me mentally and physically and manipulating me into doing things I didn't wanna do anymore, because the other day he makes me cry, hurts me, and the next day he wants to do something ""special"", Me being so in love with him I stupidly complied, thinking things could turn back to normal, when in reality the relationship was too tainted, I was used for his own benefit, something that scared me deeply.  


Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I miss having that special feeling again, that special someone to talk too, that special someone to do things with, that special someone that's happy that I'm there for them, I suppose I just wanna relive the time where I was incredibly happy.. the time where I did meant something for someone.",2022-09-07 12:41:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661982657,24,/r/lonely/comments/x844am/18f_really_wanna_mean_something_for_someone/,,0,40,[18F] Really wanna mean something for someone.

These past few years have not been kind to me and I pretty much lost everyone including a girl I loved more than anything else, but when I was at my lowest, wrestling never let me down, I know it's a business and they don't really care about fans but in a way it helped me get over my loneliness, it knows exactly how to balance between being funny and serious which makes it a really entertaining and interesting show in my opinion.

Lately I've been way more invested especially since I tried getting into the wrestling side of Twitter which surprisingly felt like a family most of the time except for the usual WWE vs AEW discussion we can see from time to time but it's still funny though, and it's pretty wholesome considering how toxic that platform can be, and honestly I haven't felt this excited and fulfilled in years.

The flow of letting go 


Learning to let go
Was the hardest thing
I had to get to know

Letting go
Isn’t moving on
It’s letting what is
Be what is

Letting go is the art of allowing
Allow the world to move without you
Allow others to exist without you affecting it
Allow others to be while you watch 

It’s hard sometimes 
When you want to exist in someone’s world
But know they won’t accept you in it
Knowing how much nicer yours is because of them

Sometimes love is letting go
You love them so much
The only gift you can give them
Is a world with out you in it

I let go a lot now
I’m scared of letting people in
Having to let go AFTER letting them in
Isn’t something I feel I could win

It’s easier to show them what they want to see
Than to ever think they want to be with me",2022-09-07 14:39:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662299137,8,/r/lonely/comments/x86ubu/second_poem/,,0,1,Second poem

I would guess mostly because we feel lost and alone..  and then of course there will be people that abuse this place. There may also be people trying to help..  

But, I am just speaking for myself here. I basically joined this and some other similar subreddits to hear other people with similar feelings to my own. 

Somehow it's validating and vindicating to know that I'm not alone feeling these things. 

But that's it.. I'm just using your feelings and posts to buoy myself emotionally. That's the purpose of this subreddit for me. I think I would want to help people if I could, but I really don't think I can. Not because you all are too far gone, but mostly because I'm a fool. Even if I think I am capable of aiding others, I'm usually not.. and I think it's more dangerous to potentially make things worse anyway.

Thinking of talking to somebody new always gives me anxiety, and that's really that last thing I'd want. This also makes it hard because I have to start working. I have gone to multiple job interviews and the managers all seem very nice. Once I get a job, I feel like I'm going to be a nervous wreck. I've not had too many great experiences with people in the past. I've dealt with a lot of bullying in my past due to being skinny, having longer hair (i'm male), etc. whatever and it's quite literally the cause of my social anxiety. I also just don't know what to say sometimes. I have a hard time adding onto conversation because my mind can just be somewhere else, I can't really help it, typically just overthinking. I used to be a very outgoing and talkative person.

1386,x8cic6,sadMig_,"I can't take it anymore! Fed up with illusions! My life remains the same! Loneliness is slowly killing me! Disassociated from myself. When you don't have any emotional connection how am I supposed to live? How will life make sense? How do I remove these traumas from some people saying I'm not going to be anyone in life... Sick of seeing pictures of me with different people! I just wanted to feel good and free! I wish I had someone by my side too! I'm terrified of ending up alone. Since 2020 my life has been a constant day-dream. It would only make sense if I had the things I had in my dream in reality. Pornography was the good and the worst. It masks these symptoms very well. On the other hand, after I become disillusioned it becomes a powerful drug that is difficult to release. I have no one to dream of. I wanted to feel better! I hate it when my parents say I'm not going to be anyone in life, etc. In my dad's case he has a narcissistic streak and when that streak turns on he talks bad about my life all day long. In the state that I am totally destroyed it affects a lot.

I also have a tendency to dislike reality people or think they are too superior compared to me. In April after having a conversation that was worth 1 minute I felt so good. I dreamed about this person so, so much. But she had a path too, and she was following it. My path is bewildered. I don't know who I am, I don't know what my worth is. I've gone from a high ego to the worst state anyone can be in. I learned several lessons from this but what I have left is loneliness. It's the loneliness of life not being worth living anymore. It is the loneliness of not knowing myself. I feel shattered and destroyed. The university starts in 1 week and I don't know what I'm going to do there with all these problems.

I wonder. Am I asking too much? Am I asking too much? My brain is full of fog, brain-fog, anhedonia... If I had at least someone and a shit-job with minimum wage I wouldn't care... As long as I felt happy. There are a lot of people with minimum wages who feel good, happy... The problem with shit-jobs is not exercising them. It's the people who walk past you and instantly criticize you. They start asking how you got there, what happened to you. I don't know what they have to do with it. I try not to criticize anyone. In a way, I already had a very high ego but that didn't give me any power to judge anyone.

I've been crying all day because I can't take it anymore. I want to have someone. I don't want to know about sex. I just wanted to hug that person, kiss him,... I wanted to feel good. Why a cloudy day affects me a lot. And why does a beautiful day tell me I'm missing out on experiences?

I could try a psychologist, I could. But nobody solves autism. Nobody solves anything that is inside anybody's mind. It doesn't solve the loneliness I feel whenever I think mine isn't worth it, whenever I think about past traumas, whenever I think about anything.

I wanted to disappear from the world! I wanted to end the story here! I'm full! What sense does this have? what sense? It's just illusions around us. Happiness here, happiness here, here... ""My man of the future is someone beautiful, charismatic, affectionate, smiling, good person, emotionally strong, protective, funny, competitive and full of experiences to tell. Someone who has a balanced life or a little above average, with such a job and who travels the world. Someone who gets along with people..."" Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkk! I'm nothing! Sometimes I see a child inside me, sometimes someone 17 who is actually almost 20. I wanted to go back to the time when I had no obligations and played my Minecraft. I felt connected to the people in the game and didn't have to socialize in real life. Did not have. I didn't spend all my time alone but... I don't know how to explain what happened. What decision did I make? What unconscious pattern or expectation led me to this.

People my age are already so much ahead of me. And I'm worried about everything. No self-esteem. With nothing... Anything is enough to end me. A mirror already makes me question everything. All...

I didn't care if they turned off the machine in my life. I did not care. Who am I? What am I doing here? My mind is blank right now. Nothing comes, no thoughts come... Nothing makes more sense. Depressed environment kills me. My family is here at home but when I have to study... I don't know if I can handle an hour alone. I don't know if I can live like this anymore. Trapped inside a body and a mind where I'm not given anything. Empty box with nothing to give.

Life is so, but so unfair... I just exist. That's what I have to say. Observer. Mere observer of reality.

I wanted to become someone. I wanted my life to make sense. I don't know what it's worth making money from? For what?

I wanted to feel good. I wish I had that person who is in my dreams. Having my own life... But I'm trapped in illusions... A 9-5 is so depressing. Working from home is depressing. 

I tried to find work on vacation but I don't know what to get. I don't know where people my age are. Seems like they're all after something. Something they believe in and go after. Something that makes them laugh. Something that makes them have the best amazing night.

My parents complain that my life is shit, is this... I felt so good in that daydream even though it wasn't reality. The cruel and harsh reality.

Trying to socialize with whom? I don't even feel like a 19-year-old. I'm not mentally evolved to overcome difficulties and the most terrible things that exist. I'm not ready!

I can't talk to anyone, I can't do anything. nothing

I don't know if this is another God prank. Are you playing with my game? Someone behind the screen is laughing with their group of friends and playing cards on my behalf. Does every regression and every progress mean my life? My life? I just wanted to be normal. I just wanted to breathe and feel good. Even if you had a job that made a lot of money, a fancy car, etc. It meant nothing. Material possessions mean nothing. Stay here. However, experience and progress already mean. already mean.

I probably don't feel emotions like anyone else. I don't know who I am. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Anything collapses on top of me. Anything!

I don't know if I write anymore. I don't know if this is the last time I write this. I don't know if anything. I don't know.

I just wanted to get it. Get. But my pieces on the board are already misplaced for you to lose everything.

I cry every single day and going to a place where I know I’m constantly judged doesn’t help.

1389,x8cshn,Gondal90,"I frequently feel like there is something wrong with me. What do I mean by this? Let me start from the beginning and explain my background. I was born to a Muslim family. Unfortunately my dad is a very violent and backwards person. He was very abusive while I was growing up. (***Mostly towards my mother***)

I was born in a muslim country but my parents immigrated to the US when I was 2 years old so I basically grew up and spent most of my life in the US. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience in the schools I went to. I experienced a lot of bullying and humiliation in the schools growing up. *(****a lot of it was because of my funny foreign name, some of it was because I was different and quiet***) I did not have many friends because it just seemed like people thought I was not good enough to be friends with them.

Middle school was the worst. That was where I got bullied on a daily basis. For the same reasons I mentioned but this time it was much worse. I don't think I had a single friend. I felt completely powerless and worthless. High school was bad too. I got bullied there frequently and found it hard to fit in and make friends. Unfortunately, my family did not do much about it. My dad was abusive himself.

I used to believe in Islam and agreed with my family's culture, but after having some life experience and reading arguments online, I slowly realized that religion was not really true. During my high school years I became an Atheist. The severe and persistent bullying I think left a psychological impact on me that affects me to this day. I became a resentful and bitter person. I developed frequent ***anger issues***, *i****nsecurity***, and ***trust issues*** which I still struggle with to this day.

Unfortunately, I myself have done bad things in my life. I bullied people too, threatened people, made death threats, and abused some people etc. I think a lot of that was because of the psychological damage that was inflicted on me from my negative experiences growing up and because I was never really taught how to behave properly.

A few years ago I started to commit to a serious reform effort. I just want to become a normal person, so I started seeing a multiple therapists to help fix my mental issues (anger, insecurity, trust issues) and a psychiatrist (***I take an antidepressant daily***). I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder by all these therapists. Years of therapy and antidepressant has helped significantly. I am a much more stable person overall than I ever was before and my mental issues are less severe and frequent than before, ***however***, they are not totally gone. I still, occasionally, have an anger outburst, feel insecure, and distrust others but I am trying my best now to manage these negative feelings.

I feel like there is something about me that makes me fail socially. For me even today (**I'm 27 now**) it is very hard to make and maintain friends. They usually leave because of my anger outbursts. I still have never had a girlfriend. (**The average person has had a girlfriend by age 27**) If I had to make an educated guess, I would say the remaining amount of anger and insecurity that remains is what drives people away. I am doing everything I can to fix this. All I want is to be a normal person. Sometimes, I feel like there is still something I am not doing right, something I am still ignorant in.

Meantime, we were in the middle of the COVID and I'm a sound engineer, so I was litterally jobless, and thanks to the breakup, homeless. I'm not a social person. I'm willing to chat, some may say friendly, but I find really hard to come to foreign people. I'm always on the verge of having a panick attack when I go somewhere to meet new people. Like I was literally cheating on people by using them to be new friends, like I was doing something morally wrong. My ex was the social link. We moved on the opposite side of the country a few years before. I met a lot of people around where we were but only common friends and thanks to her. So when we broke up, I obviously had to leave the house, and every one I knew there. After several monthes of asking the only personnal friends I have for a bit of space on their sofa, I eventually found a job as a technician in a venue around here. It's suposedly  just temporary (until late october) but I've been told if I was doing good it would turn into a kinda definitive contract. Did a lot of mistakes, hope it won't ruin my chances, but that's not the point. For this job, I moved several miles away from my previous guesting friend, where I knew no one. I'm just so desperate to find people around me, feel less lonely, know where to go where I got free time, someone to talk to.

1398,x8e32f,Exotic_Plum_3245,"I don’t even know at this point. 

(Before writing anything I have to mention that I completely understand what you think about the current situation we’re in. I am just some random guy and I have no real power over anything happening. Hope everyone’s safe!)

I’m 17M and I’ve always felt out of place. I don’t have friends. At all.

I can see that maybe that has to do with me being from a provincial Russian town and myself being raised very western-like, contrary to people here. But for the time being, is there something I can do about it and have a better social life?

Am I just not interesting? My only “big” achievement is knowing English quite well as my second language. I like to write music and do UI design, sometimes do photo editing…and that’s about it. Am I just boring? 

And the worst part is I go to school and people greet me (some girls even like to hug me as a greeting, but that’s not that common and it’s pretty usual for everybody else), I chat with my classmates just fine and sometimes it feels like I have a certain connection with people, but it never really “leaves” school.

I remember last year, after switching schools, a new class was formed and most people didn’t know each other, though some had connections from previous schools. So, I got to see how people build relationships…and it was painful. Seeing pretty much everybody else succeed, while not achieving that much myself wasn’t a pleasant experience. Yes, most people are ok with me and treat me well, but that’s about it. Nobody wants to do something outside of school with me (and if they do I have no idea about it), while they all divide into some groups by interests and build friendships, go out and have fun. I am just there by myself always left out.

It really makes you feel awful. I got to hear how “smart I am” for knowing English that well and girls also told me that I’m pretty (I used to always wear a mask and had a bad haircut. Last school year I decided to stop wearing my mask and cut my hair, also started wearing glasses. I really like attention, so when a good looking girl told me was pretty, it became “that monkey that I chased ever since” (not really, I don’t crave it now, but I really liked the feeling of being told compliments). And especially when pretty much every girl in my class told me how my new haircut “suited me so well” it felt even worse, cause now I knew they considered me pretty…but that’s about it. Never seen that much of a relationship interest in me.

I’m tired of this all. Questions like “what am I doing here?”or just “what am I doing?” cross my mind very frequently.
With time, because I feel out of place, certain things start happening.

I didn’t mention one thing before (and it’s not that important anyway), but I’m in the ethinic minority in this country (I’m Jewish-Russian), so I kind of made this into my personality. 

It’s really disgusting. When I came to the new class last year and talked to different people, at some point I told them I was Jewish. There are a few problems with this: 1) My family doesn’t live like Jewish families do, we’re just a usual family, except our views and tastes are different to people living here, so am I telling people that I am Jewish, when in reality I just have some Jewish ancestry?  2) We’re in Russia and, well… yeah, there has always been antisemitism here historically.

Was that a mistake of mine? I think I should’ve never told anyone that I’m Jewish (when I’m not even that Jewish really). The only reason for me telling that was the fact that I actually wanted to be different! Why was I so dumb?

And so the problem is because I’ve always felt different and tried to justify it by saying different things to myself (unusual upbringing (for Russia), different views and taste and, well, ethnicity), I have steered away from people here even more! 
Oh why…why did I do all of this to myself?!

So, in the end what we end up with is a guy who thinks he’s pretty different from the other people (where he’s living), who doesn’t do anything (ok maybe just a bit) to even try to go out with somebody and talk to someone, yet always feels lonely and wants affection and love…
Is there something I can do about all of this?

I really crave love. It’s so bad that I think of trying to build a relationship with a person I don’t like (but I think they like me?), just because I want love and well it’s easier to try with them than to try it with the girl I actually love. I had this experience last year and it was awful. I dated a girl, even though I didn’t like her, just because I wanted love and experience. Why am I such a d-head?????!!

And even after this, I still want to be loved. I want it so badly. I want to hang out with people.

What’s the point of trying? No, really? How can I even love myself like this?


I do hate myself.

I often feel very empty and also kind of emotionally cold. Everyone knows me as a happy person but I often don't feel good. Sometimes I’m tired of existing. Just getting up every day and acting like I’m doing well, like I have to be doing well because otherwise everyone would ask me what's wrong with me or i would just have to be honest with myself that I’m not doing well. I act like I’m doing well so I don't burden anyone else and I can be strong for the people who need me. Many people always say: call me when you are not feeling well. Have I ever called anyone when I was feeling shitty? never. Would I ever do it? no. It‘s just complicated. My brain thinks about everything and goes too far into detail which makes my life more and more miserable.

I know some people have it much worse than me and I should feel lucky/happy to be where I am, have what I have, etc. But I just want to vent, say how I really feel, and get it all off my chest: I’m so tired of being let down by people. I’m so tired of keeping positive, hopeful, and mentally strong despite all the letdown, disappointment, and rejection. I feel like a stray dog at a shelter trying my best to keep my chin up despite not being picked, but I see everyone else getting adopted. Each day goes by and I try to keep a smile and be positive, but it hurts so much now that my thoughts have gone from “It’s okay you’ll find the right people someday!” to “Why doesn’t anyone want me? What’s wrong with me?” 
I don’t have any real friends. I’m lucky to be close to my mom and my brother and spend time with them when I can, but it hurts not having at least one good friend. It hurts hearing how other people went out with their friends over the weekend or with their partners. It makes me feel like a total freak, like a loser.

1413,x8fqu7,confettisbunnies,"Sorry I know this is so pathetic &amp; sad but so am I. 

Whenever I see couples or hear about romance, etc, in real life or even in movies / shows, ialways get real depressed &amp; insecure. 

I rarely even watch movies or shows cause sex &amp; romance is everywhere &amp; i always compare myself to other girls (&amp; why am i here if i am so ugly and unlovable 🥲). 

And whenever there are romance or sex scenes on tv / any mentions of sex anywhere, or whenever I see couples anywhere i cant help but feel really jealous &amp; sad. 

I want to have a boyfriend, sex, all of that really bad. I just want to be important and special to someone. I want someone to like me. Just want to mean something to somebody. 

But i know i will never have that - sex or a relationship or even a chance of a guy liking me. 

I am not worth for anyone to love me cause I am the most repulsive, ugly, girl i have ever seen - i dont even feel like a real girl cause i am so ugly and disgusting looking. And thats why it makes me depressed. 

I am 18 in only a few days, never had a boyfriend/never been on a date, still a virgin (obviously), never been asked out, no one has ever liked me or has a crush on me, never even had a kiss yet. 

Might not sound like much but it makes me feel worthless &amp; pathetic &amp; embrassed. 

I cant try out dating apps either cause thats just asking to be laughed at, I am beyond ugly. I dont even look like a girl. I look like a corpse. 

My body is awful &amp; disgusting, my face is beyond hideous. I saw myself in the mirror before and couldnt stop crying. 

My personality is so awkward and boring too, my voice is also horrendous. I sound and look like a boy. 

I dont know no one could ever like or even love me. 

And all the guys i have had crushes on chose other prettier girls every time (every girl is prettier than me though so thats not that hard, &amp; dont know why i am still surpised, why would anyone want to even go near me when I look this repulsive, disgusting and hideous). 

I hate every part of my face. I hate every part of my body too. i am just so ugly and horrendous looking. I legit look really scary. I look dead.

1419,x8g6cc,mal3di,"I have always found it peculiar just how someone becomes the odd one out.

I think my childhood can be summed up nicely with just one word; rejection. My parents were abusive, so I grew up in the foster system.  

The state divided me and my siblings. I missed them desperately for years. 

My home life can be described as unpleasant. Lots of moving between foster families. In one home they cared more about their biological children and were vehement that I understood the difference between us. I was outside, they were inside. I slept in the attic or in the basement, they had their own room. They got presents, I watched. On Christmas eve I was left home alone with the cleaning lady, while my foster parents and their children were out celebrating the holiday.

Another time, I lived in three homes at the same time. One week per location. You see, no matter what I did to fit in or how I tried to better my personality, I was a person that others needed a break from. I never understood why other people's parents didn't need such breaks from their children, but everyone needed a break from me. 

The orphanage was decorated to look like a home, but unlike a normal home, the adults were paid to be there, and paid to be nice.


The school system was not good to me either. I won't tell stories about what I went through at the hands of my classmates. But I was labeled an outsider the second I introduced myself. No matter the school.  I remember how for years I wondered why exactly I was not liked by anyone. And that everything I did to improve myself, both on the outside and on the inside, didn't mean anything or help at all. I didn't feel the reflection in the mirror was so bad that it justified how alone I was, and how vicious they were at school. 

At 8 I tried to end my life. Little did I know then that the mental suffering and longing for acceptance would last another 22 years. 

I moved by myself at 16. At 18 I received a letter from the state telling me that they no longer had any responsibility for me. I was officially on my own. Ironically, in spirit I already had been for years. 

The following 12 years were hard. I fell deeper into depression and where not able amount to anything. I had failed high school due to my low intelligence. I feel like my twenties were characterized by watching others move on, getting educated, having relationships, buying houses and starting families, while I was left standing on the train platform. Every New Year's Eve at midnight, I made a wish to share the next New Year's Eve with someone who cared for me. I don't quite remember when I gave up on the wishes.

I don't know exactly when things changed, but it did. The sad nights of missing my siblings stopped. I no longer naively fell in love, I didn't see new people and hoped that if I could just get to know them before someone else told them about me, then maybe I had a chance of making a friend. I stopped missing others. I no longer daydreamed about holding hands with someone and being someone's person. Stopped dreaming of hearing the three words I've never heard before; I love you. 

Maybe I just accepted that I'm just a face in the crowd. Someone you see in the passing, but won't remember when you get home. I'm cold now. The ability to feel love is gone. Even if I did meet someone I can no longer develop feelings - friendly or something more. 

I think the last train left the station already as I was a child. I just wasn't ready to acknowledge that staying behind on the platform was my destiny. 

I am 30 now. 

I really wish life would have been different. I hope we get more than one chance at life.",2022-09-07 20:52:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659623074,3,/r/lonely/comments/x8g6cc/doomed_to_be_just_a_face_in_the_crowd/,,0,0,Doomed to be just a face in the crowd

Whenever I had feelings for someone i would tell myself “you’d just hold them back Pat and you’d keep them from finding happiness” I don’t know why I think that but I honestly believe it.

 I remember in high school I had a crush on a girl named Ivy but my brother had a crush on her too and I said I wanted to ask her out, my brother said “Why the f**k would she want you? I asked her out and she rejected me, ME Pat and I’m more handsome and thin then you so why the f**k would she settle for you.”

I was shocked and angry at first and we had a full on fistfight in the hallway, several teachers had to break us apart and the worst part was Ivy was watching the whole thing and when I saw her she looked at us like we were a couple of psychopaths, she just left and me and my brother were suspended for a week, so when I was able to go back to school I tried to ask her out but she said “I’m sorry but I can’t date someone like you, you can’t control yourself and I’m afraid of what you might do, I’m sorry.”

I felt crushed, the girl I liked and wanted to be with was afraid of me and it was my fault, so for years I told myself that I wasn’t worth dating and if I somehow found someone would I make them happy, would they secretly be afraid of me? 

I don’t know but I don’t want to be a burden to anyone, I’ve gone to anger management classes and therapy but I don’t think I’ll ever be worthy of someone to love, I feel like I’d be a big ugly piece of cast iron wrapped around their leg in the middle of the ocean and only after they kick me off can they swim to the lifeboat and be happy.

Having no friends, and no interest in trying to make any because they're all fake in real life is diffucult. This is the most depressed I've been since 9th grade (freshman), and I've been crying everyday even though school has only just started (4 days). 

I can't deal with it, there is no future for me. My parents have no money, and I don't want to spend my life slaving away just to pay off student debt if I decided to go to college. I have no connections, no friends, nothing that will ever get me anywhere. Maybe the classes I took are too stressful for me to deal with, or maybe the pressure of being back in a social environment is crushing me I just can't tell. Today I was kicked out of a discord server I loved and spent 3 years in trying to put effort in because I went inactive for a month to prepare for the AP classes I'm taking. 

I'm mentally trying to check myself out of the feeling zone but I just can't, and everything feels so heavy. I have no plan, no future, no money, no friends, no life.

1470,x8nuge,MinimalCollector,"Hi all. I'm just here to vent. 

I don't know why I do this. I don't dislike myself, but I dislike that I don't socialize well. I go through cycles where I feel extremely isolated because of it. I keep busy with a lot of hobbies because outside of work I often have a lot of spare time. But none of which, spare a few I feel like I can talk about with people enough to have a conversation. Listen to other people at my job (very friendly work environment) and some people I seem to hit it off with but they seem much more experienced in being social than I am, maybe they just know how to roll with the tide of my social awkwardness.

I don't know if I'm bad at small talk or if people just don't want to with me. I don't want to half the time, but I'm trying to get better at it. A few people a decade older than I, I hit it off with. People within a few years of my age (25), I seem to struggle more. Asking people about themselves feels like squeezing water from a rock. Sometimes it feels like others don't have much to say to begin with, and I feel like I'm causing awkwardness. I don't go out of my way to start conversations with coworkers unless we are doing something together and it calls for a bit of social indulgence.

A lot of my current friends didn't initially like me at first. That's been said almost unanimously. It's funny in retrospect but terrifying when it comes to trying to form new relationships with people. I feel like I've gotten better and am not the same person that my current friends met, at least not at work. But I still struggle a lot with these feelings that even the ones that are polite are simply being cordial due to the circumstances of our job and nothing more.

I'm horribly tired of this. I don't know what to make of it or how to address it. This is the most friendly work environment I've ever been in, but I still feel like keeping to myself out of worry of bothering others.",2022-09-08 02:21:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1599009452,4,/r/lonely/comments/x8nuge/i_struggle_to_feel_socially_viable_easily/,,0,1,"I struggle to feel socially viable, easily convince myself people don't like me."

1480,x8oc7i,Informal-Future9896,"23/M currently solo traveling in the U.S. and living in a minivan that I converted into a simple but cozy campervan. Pretty much been my dream forever, but now that I'm really immersed in the experience I realize it's not all that glamorous as I anticipated...

I don't think I've ever felt so homesick in my life. Which is something that started to bubble inside me in the past few years and actually brought me closer with my parents but still feels unsolved in a way. Many times I feel like a toddler in a grown body that still hasn't finished being a kid yet. There is a strange primal pain that I feel is at the base of this and brings tears to my eyes as I write this (I'm not editing this at all just a free form writing that I feel like I need right now)

Back home (Israel) I have a strong network of friends and family that really ground me, but here I'm all alone and no one knows me on the same intimate level. I feel so detached from this land even though I get to see beautiful landscapes and I do meet wonderful people. Somehow my spirit still tends to fall in these lonely moments..

I am so grateful for everything that I have in my life. I am so fortunate for many things that I am able to experience, achieve and feel. I know that I have a home to come back to and passions in life to pursue, yet there still is this deep feeling inside me that overwhelms me and makes my trip quite challenging.

I also feel like I have to fake being super nice and bubbly when in fact I am quite quiet and withdrawn.. so either my inauthenticity pushes people away or my quiet nature makes them think I’m hostile.  (I’ve been told I’m intimidating, intense and seemingly hostile). :(   

I ask people about their lives, lots of questions about themselves and I am kind.. but no one ever asks back. People seem bemused or like I’m making fun of them or have other intentions.

She kept coming to my house every day wanting favours because she didn’t have a car and it was very stressful but I guess I was desperate: (picking up furniture for her from the verge rubbish, taking her cat to the vet), and she would talk for literally hours but if I tried to say anything she just talked right over me. She ended up moving thankfully.

Another time, i was at the gym (I do group classes for the social element) and I noticed a lady who was new to the class got invited to a brunch group some of the women go to. She hadn’t even talked to anyone. All I could think was why not me? I felt terrible. 

I just want to give up… I’m so damn lonely and I can’t make a single friend. If I try and talk to old friends online they just reply with one word or not at all. I feel like an invisible human. I’m trying to overcome my depression and work on my mental health through therapy but this inability to make friends or have relationships makes me feel that life isn’t worth living. Even my own family doesn’t like me much, and my mum only talks to me about her job if I call, but never asks how I am or anything about me.

I used to love life and have so much hope for the future. People used to want to be my friend when I was younger.

1494,x8qdde,villmyman,"I recently moved to a big city and left everyone I knew behind. I have always felt lonely but never like this. I have 3 roommates. Two of them moved in together because the previously were friends. They keep to themselves and live on one side of the apartment. The roommate who lives on my side of the apartment constantly has his girlfriend over and he never talks to me (honestly it seems like he’s avoiding everyone else in the apartment too). So I have no friends, no one to talk to, nothing to do on my free time but lay in bed. My siblings don’t reach out to me. I always reach out to them just to have them tell me all their problems and them I have to comfort them and act like I’m going through nothing. Worst part about all of this is that I’m gay and still in the closet. I hate being gay and I wish I was normal. I was raised to believe being gay is a sin and now I’m too nervous to accept myself and find love or even just someone to comfort me. I have trouble making friends because it’s like a straight guy trying to be friends with women that will never like him. Like how you get nervous talking to someone you find attractive and you freeze up or say something dumb.

As a result I never had friends irl, I was a social outcast. It backfired because overtime people I knew online are all gone (due to distancing or other reasons)


So I've developed this huge fear of abandonment as a result of never having a real friend, it causes me to get too clingy and often DM probably too much. And when I do have someone I can call a friend I beg that they stay, so even the littlest of things  makes me think ""what if they don't like me anymore"". A week ago I lost another online friend and it has fucked me up, and I'm back to square one again



I wish I can go back in time and tell young me to not be an edgy social loser and talk to people. I feel like it's my fault I'm like this as I bought it on to myself by associating with online friends, people I will most likely never see irl, too much

1499,x8qp2u,joebidensghost,"I had issues with being lonely back since 8th grade. I had never thought about being alone but after ""falling"" for a girl for the first time. After simp (most literally) for months I realized how much my lifestyle, appearance and attitude was holding me back. But of course, as a young idiot I didnt do anything about it and blamed everyone and anything but myself for my problems. After that awakening of how lonely I was, I desperately wanted a girlfriend to supplement my sad lame life and ""make me happy"". 

As a freshman, I ended up have a handful of girlfriends but of the 3, only one of them was serious. The whole thing was a massive shame. I genuinely believe it was a right person, wrong time type of situation. I broke things off after nearly 2 years because I was miserable and we were arguing a lot, even though I don't think I can ever be that close with someone again. But I know that ship has sailed, and after grieving for a few years I have finally come to terms with that relationship. Also, I know it sounds stupid but just because I was the one to break it off doesn't mean I wanted to, I just did what I could tell was best for us since we both had issues to deal with I could see that nothing would happen if things continued.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I wanted to make changes. I felt so hurt from past experiences and I didn't want them controlling my life anymore. While I was in my last relationship, I felt horrible because I looked at my life and saw that I had it all, yet I still felt miserable and unfulfilled. Over the past couple years I slowly have been finding my passion in auto mechanics and racing which, especially toward the end of last year, gave me a small boost in confidence. That's what motivated and disciplined me to make changes this year. I had a gym membership at a nice gym in town that I rarely used, so I took advantage of it and starting going every other day no matter what (I was 17, living at home alone and had a totally open schedule.) I also starting cooking and eating healthier, and a lot less. Totally cut sugars and fats out of my diet. I started the year at 287 with a high body fat percentage, which I had for the majority of my life up until then. Part of why I stayed fat was being in that relationship. Why change when I had someone who liked me and was attracted to my fat disgusting embarrassing self? But now that I was single and out of school (graduated early) I knew I had to do something to get myself back out there. 

And it worked. I started in January at 287 and now, 9 months later I am 217, I am decently muscular and very active. For a long while it felt great. Everyone congratulating me, saying how proud they are of me and how far I've come. I am 6'1 as well so with the exercise and bodybuilding I look extremely different so some people even said they don't recognize me at first. So yes, it was all great, up until recently when things kind of sunk in. I am nearing the end of my weight loss journey, not necessarily my body building journey but that's less important to me as I find it to be a fun activity than a necessity. I have a passion I am working towards and am very excited about. I have some ok friends to hang out with every once in a while and a single best friend that I can always count on. I am no longer self conscious of my hobbies because I no longer feel like I will be judged for having them because of my appearance. 

So I have everything I was missing back when I was sad and depressed and coping by eating bad, doing things with my ex and other bland hobbies. But now I am missing the last important piece and that is someone I can share all my success with. All my troubles and worries. My free time and energy that I don't spend on work. I am finally ready mentally for a relationship again and I feel confident that I am attractive enough for most people that I like to want to be attracted to me appearance wise. But it still feels like I am back at square one. I don't know how to meet people. Everyone knows dating apps are a sham if you want a meaningful relationship and I have had zero success with them anyways. I see girls that I want to talk to when I am out at public events i go to, or at the gym. But I still feel like some ugly monster that people want to avoid. I don't like to even bother talking to people at the gym unnecessarily because I just don't want to be a bother in the first place, I mean I know I wouldn't want a guy bothering me mid work out for no reason. But I really wish a girl would. I don't have insane preferences when it comes to appearance so it's not like girls are hitting me up and I ignore them because they arent pretty enough. I can talk to people just fine, I am just too afraid to initiate myself. And no one ever wants to initiate one with me. 

It feels like a waste I guess because I had an expectation in the back of my mind that after all of this was in effect I would be able to easily meet someone that actually wants me and while I have been doing my best for the past few months, I haven't seen any difference. I makes me worry I never will. I am glad I am doing everything i have done this year, and i would much rather be sad, alone and in shape than what i was before, but the disappointment combined with that returned feeling of longing for something meaning yet seeing nothing of the sort in sight really gets me down. When I just go to work. Come home. Watch youtube or make dinner. Go to sleep. When I go out of the house, like to the gym, to events or to hang out with friends. It's always in the back of my mind how alone I am and that I probably won't ever get that chance with someone special ever again. I see a lot of women online talk about feeling the same way. I wish I could speak to them because I see they feel the same way but again I don't want to bother them. So i guess I'll go to bed, and get up tomorrow for my 8-4 and be sitting alone with my thoughts as per usual.

1500,x8r0dc,[deleted],"I’ve known this person for almost 10 years. We talk on and off. Recently they’d only come to me if they’re in a rough patch. After their struggles were improving, they’d push me away again. The cycle was put in place. They feel like shit, I try to help, then when they feel better they get upset at me for small things, I sincerely apologize because I never had bad intentions for a long term friend. 

This time they went too far. The small things were usually me trying to match their energy. Maybe they were in a bad mood, had a bad day, maybe I’m just not funny. That doesn’t excuse them actually calling me names, talking shit about me to others, making shit up about me. 

I am not apologizing this time. Fuck this cycle. I am also not going to entertain all the bullshit that’s been said. Maybe it’s okay for me to give one response. I don’t regret anything.

1504,x8r6ca,fake_friends_please,"Thought I saw an old homie at school today. Threw me for a huge fuckin loop. He was legitimately my favorite person ever, wasn't a goddamn day went by that I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with him. Like, my life was just better when he was around. I don't even remember him ever once pissing me off, we just meshed. (Or at least I think so, I obviously don't have access to his thoughts. But I'd say he acted as if he liked my company just as much)

&amp;#x200B;

Age difference is a bitch, though. 3 or 4 years, and we met when I was 15. Not my choice, I always hated the gap. But my only friends came from a small church, so it's not like I had many options. Plus the sort of stifling infantalizing religion I was in always made it feel like you were just a kid until you were married, so it honestly wasn't that weird for us to be friends.

&amp;#x200B;

But something happened. The story is that his parents thought I was a bad spiritual influence when I was 19, and they excommunicated me. I've kinda always wondered if he asked them to do that so he could get rid of me without have to be the one to break it to me, though. Only 1 guess as to what I could've done, and I do hate myself for it still, but we went right along being friends for 2 years after as if nothing had changed. So it doesn't make any sense. But it's unfalsifiable, and that means my brain can keep saying ""but what if it *was* that, though????"" .

&amp;#x200B;

But goddamn, do I miss him. It felt like I was more myself when I was with him, and it has felt like I've lost a part of myself ever since. I wish things could be like they were. So for those 2 reasons, when I physically bumped into this guy at school with his old haircut, it fucked with me for a while. In the moment, I couldn't look at the guy's face cuz I was afraid it would be my old friend, and I'd have to watch him leave and say nothing and act like we'd never known each other. And then after I had to deal with the longig again, the wishing and hoping and borderline praying that he'd contact me and want to hang out again and that I could feel ok for a while. If I wouldn't have had a stressful chem lab right after keeping my mind preoccupied, it probably would've been worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And also, if it was him and he is somehow just by sheer random fucking chance going to my school, I'd be interested as hell to know what he's in for. He never seemed all that interested in school back then, and we never talked about what we'd do once we were older. It was scary for me, and I think for him too. So I'd just really love to know what he's up to these days, and it sucks that I can't",2022-09-08 05:06:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603483175,3,/r/lonely/comments/x8r6ca/a_post_not_focused_on_romance_by_me_thats_kinda/,,0,0,A post not focused on romance by me.

My name is Alx, I'm 21 and I'm a very old soul. I like forests,plants, and have come to realize that autumn and everything about it has become my aesthetic. There's just something warm and comforting about it to me, I dunno. Maybe it's the way the wind feels, and how the leaves are all these different colors and shades. I feel less lonely in nature come to think of it, it's just all really beautiful so I find an extreme comfort in it.

1547,x8yitt,ichthxs,"i 17F have been struggling with making friends my entire life. ive always been seen as the wierd yet funny kid; confidence and dominance are a core part of my personality. if someone is hurting someone else i will speak out and if someone is abusing me i will speak out. its a skill i have learnt due to my traumatic childhood.

that being said, the friends and romantic partners ive had, havent been great, and because i spoke out i lost them. my only ex used to force himself upon me and belittle me. my ex friends used to talk about me behind my back and gaslit my that my past SA (not with my ex) was nothing to be upset about and that lead to disastrous consequences in my life. 

Last year, i started a new school far from home and was excited to have a fresh start. I mingled with people yet, no one liked me enough to be my friend and when i hung out with someone it was for that one time and then we’d not speak that much. we were all just acquaintances. 

As this continued for months i concluded that i was the problem, so i monitered how much i spoke and what volume and to be careful about certain topics and dressed nicely and forced a smile upon my face. this then continued for the final school months and i was at peak misery. i already had bad things at home going  on and i put on a facade which had no point because still no one would want to be my friend

when holidays came, i had never been so lonely and miserable in my life, and my grades were in the mud because of external circumstances.

i asked my teacher if i could repeat the year solely to have better grades and she approved it, that meant id restart the year with new people

well flash forward today and the same thing is happening. im really sad because i really want to know what is wrong with me so i can work on it. this time i have prior knowledge on the years content and give people around me extra knowledge to help them ease into the new year, i dress even more nicer and i smile and engage in convo. i feel so self obsessed saying this but theyre all the tips ive gathered from the internet.

please help me. i dont want to suffer alone again. i just want to love someone platonically for who they are vice versa

Our school planned an activity in a place that’s around 9 miles away from my house. So i met up with two girls (S and H) yesterday (a quick information about them: they are both new in my school and each of them went to a different school apparently S went to the same elementary school as me) and we planned to cycle there together. 

It was all pretty chill and fun, we first played golf, we rode a big bicycle (for 2 people in the front and something like a bench behind) and then we played golf again but it was kind of different, it was in a forest. That’s where things started to become strange. We met up with a few of my ex-classmates and the two girls started acting very buddy-buddy with each other. They excused themselves to go to the bathroom together. When i asked them jokingly “Was it fun in the toilet?” (I just wanted to laugh it off) they didn’t really say anything. S said her mom was going to pick her up later H said that S’s mom was gonna pick her up too. I didn’t wanna ask them if S’s mom wanted to pick me up too, i thought i was gonna bother them and that there was no space for me. So drove back home, some of you may be wondering how i found my way home, well i followed road signs and locked at Google Maps a little.

Then she asked me, multiple times the same question. I said no but I wasn't audible. I wasn't speaking. I was just moving my mouth because I was nervous and when I'm nervous I cannot speak audibly. This fueled the situation even more. She asked me one more time the same question before moving on to the test as I had the same answer which was no.

The gist will be to book our room in the same Hotel so we are close to each other but still have privacy.

One of them I was really good with and he unfortunately moved to a different country this year and that was the first time I felt real sadness. 
Now, I know only one other guy who I don't hang out with any time other than in school and I know a girl with whom is the same situation except I know her way better and we talk often, almost every day. 

Lately tho, I've felt as if I'm slowly drifting away from them and me being a pretty shy and private person who doesn't usually go out and socialize and don't really have a way of meeting new people, I fear that I might also lose them both soon. I simply don't know what to do, I don't know if its a pretty normal/regular thing to feel this way or if I'm just overthinking it all. Need some kind of advice if there's any to be given.

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

1602,x99r1q,venomkittyfish,"I don't need responses or advice or people pretending they get what I'm going to say, or that you can help me. I just want somewhere to speak, knowing at least one person will read it.

Most of my life, I've been haunted by this pervasive loneliness. I have a lot of emotional trauma (nothing horrific or cinematic, like abuse or poverty, but damaging nonetheless) on top of lots of mental illnesses. Ever since I was young, I knew I was different from everyone else. Not in a quirky ""I'm not like other girls"" sorta way. Nothing I could concentrate down into a specific trait or behavior. But I've never felt I truly belonged anywhere. I know now that I'm older that these differences can most likely be attributed to my adhd and probably undiagnosed autism as well. 

I've always felt misunderstood. Which is another common cliché. But it runs deep inside of me. I suppose misunderstood isn't quite right. Its more that I don't feel anyone understands me at all - an important distinction.  Before, I used to be unapologetically me. For better, or, more often, for worse. But people can't handle unbridled depression. It makes them feel hopeless. Bad. So they pushed me away. They couldn't handle hearing how much I suffered, or my mood swings. 

Now I hide it. My illnesses, my interests - things other people can't relate to or understand or handle. I'm not making up versions of myself for others, but instead only showing them certain parts of me. Hiding the rest, like a watered down version of myself. 

This makes all of the relationships I form feel empty and hollow. Fake and unsatisfying. It feels like there's this giant hole in my chest when I accidentally start thinking about how lonely I am.

I feel selfish and guilty because I do have some friends and family who I know care, some who say they love me. But it doesn't help at all. Because I know what they love isn't really me - just the version of me they want to see. The one they can handle and tolerate. 

Some people say I should just stop masking. But I know what it's like not to mask. People don't like that me. They can't handle my true feelings, my moods, my dark thoughts. 

Other people say I need to save it for a therapist. But I've tried tons of therapists and therapy techniques. They help a little bit, but then I hit a ceiling. I don't connect with the therapist. The usual shit doesn't work on me. I know more than they do just from years of experience and different therapists. Eventually, the therapeutic relationship breaks down until I call it off altogether.

So I don't talk to anyone about how i feel. But it fucking hurts, keeping it in. I want attention. Love. To feel seen and heard and understood. But I don't feel it at all. I haven't for years. Maybe my whole life. And it's fucking killing me. Without love, life feels so empty and pointless. Why spend all this time trying to be successful and have money and do shit just so I can come home to loneliness? Why am I struggling to survive in misery?

I'm only 23. People tell me to just wait - the right person will come along. They started telling me to wait at 13. Fuck, I'm so tired of being told that. As if my ability to feel loved and whole is completely out of my hands. I just have to submit to the will of fate and life. 

This is where people say I should love myself. Which, sure, is important, something I constantly work on and have made progress in. But it only takes me so far. Eventually, I need social interaction. I need validation and love from peers and friends and family - everyone needs some. It doesn't make me weak or bad or wrong to crave and need it - it's human nature to be social and to want to feel accepted. 

I try to go out and meet others, but it usually makes me feel worse. Another cliche, but I'm pretty empathic, good at reading body language and understanding others. Not that I'm always right or a mind reader, but I know I'm talented. It's easy for me to walk into a social situation and scope potential friends. It's such a let down to know almost immediately that there are no potential candidates. Not that I have super high criteria (I think), just that most people wouldn't be able to handle me as a close friend the way I want.

I'm like an exotic animal. High maintenance, lots of specialized needs. Require special training and certification to handle. People with no experience with mental illness can easily be checked off. People with too busy of lives can also usually be excluded. And most people at my college already have close friends, and don't really feel the need to make new ones. So that already hacks away most of the friend pool. 

Tonight is the first meeting for one of my clubs - mock trial. I really enjoy it as an activity. But going sometimes gets me down because I can feel so tangibly how much of an outsider I am. There's friend groups in the club already - and I'm not a part of any of them. It's a constant reminder of how lonely I am. 

I try my best to go to group outings and activities and such. But always feeling like I'm on the outside makes it really hard. I also have chronic energy issues due to mental illness and an autoimmune disorder. Not to make myself a sob story or anything, but it just makes it hard for me to constantly be doing shit. I wish I could drown my loneliness in activities and shit all day like other people do. Be cool and aloof like movie characters, focused on my career and myself, suppressing my feelings until ""the one"" comes along. But I can't. My energy limits me. 

And so I spend time laying down, left with my thoughts, and the feelings are too colossal and powerful to ignore, breaking me down for hours at a time in depressive episodes. I wish it was numbness, but it's not. It's white hot agony. The loneliness is so devastating and crushing, it feels like my body is imploding in on itself. Grief is not gentle - it's wretched and all consuming, tearing through my insides and making my muscles spasm from the searing firework bursts of emotional blisters. It makes me want to self harm - not out of punishment or self hate or to feel good or better, but just so my outside can match my inside. So I can rip and bleed the pain out of me. I never do, but I feel the urge every time. 

I gave that brief description in a vain hope that someone will understand. That what I feel is so extreme and torturous, something that's beaten me down again and again over so many years that I can barely remember what it's like to be without it. This loneliness. 

I don't know what to do. I'm trying my absolute best - have made progress in lots of personal goals - but none of it is ever enough. I am afraid this emptiness will plague me for the rest of my life. I'm not suicidal, but it makes me wonder if this life is worth living. If I truly cannot be cured, why live in misery? Why torture myself to try so hard, to reach such lofty heights, when in the end, none of my achievements will ever fill this loneliness? Why am I trying so hard to better myself, to have a successful career, to do all of these things, if none of this will change the end result - that I will be unhappy and alone.",2022-09-08 19:46:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1537246624,29,/r/lonely/comments/x99r1q/just_need_somewhere_to_say_this/,,0,11,just need somewhere to say this

1605,x9ac6t,Odd_Technology8765,"(14,M)  I dont think I have any right to complain. All I ever worked towards was my academics and now that I've done it It feels like getting stabbed by cold loneliness. I rarely talk to other students in my class, however I do participate alot in classes. I always wanted to just stay in the background and be quiet yet smart but it backfired entirely and now it made me look like a total geek. I do get comments then and there. But no matter what I do, no matter how hard I work. No one wants to be friends with a ""wierdo"". I was putting up with it, everyday I'd get home, lie to my parents that school was very fun, go in my room, do my homework and just fucking cry till I go to sleep. I always see others laugh, smile geniuenly and for some reason I envy them. I have all that I ever asked for, yet what is this pain that I'm feeling in my chest. I don't know how long I can keep this up, it feels like my soul has been drowned and my head starts to fill up with those dangerous thoughts and with each day they're only growing. I feel like I'm a mindless marionette following orders. I have no desires of my own, I have no friends, I have no one who I could rely on, I have no one who has my back. I'm all on my own. All the friends I used to have who now went to other schools told me ""We're still gonna be friends"" and ""Oh we'll hang out a ton regardless!"". Last I heard of them was 4 months ago. If this keeps up I don't know what coping tropes I'll resort to. I feel so disconnected, so sad and lonely. I've tried alot to keep up friendships I'd always be the one to start making plans and what not just to end up getting ditched few days later. I have no choice but to endure but endure till what? Till I break and shatter entirely and be put inside some psych ward or whatever. 

I'm just absolutely pathetic. I cry at looking fucking pictures of friends laughing together. I can't find the strength to keep this up another day. I'm seriously at my breaking point. I'm hopeless and no good. I've got no accomplishments and I'm a nobody.

1614,x9bbgi,jaguar1582,"I’ve come to realize that the lack of family in my life has made it nearly impossible to feel happy. For a long time I felt so desperate to be in a relationship, but I know now that’s not really what was going on exactly. I don’t mean having kids, though I’m 40 and know I may never. I mean I never had one in the first place. My parents seemed to have so much resentment towards theirs that i didn’t have one. I had no siblings (though I guess they tried), cousins on one side we stopped seeing due to family drama, and that’s it. We had some family friends at different times. When I was 18, I moved as far away as I could because that’s what both of my parents did. And ever since, it just feels like I am further and further from normal because of this. I have tried to get closer with my parents cousins, now that we are closer in age. But they still live far away as well. I have this feeling that my few close friends will always be more important to me than I am to them, because they have their own families, even if they’re single they have their families somewhere that keep them in some kind of system of support. 

I’m now losing a relationship that meant the absolute world to me, and I know that a big part of why it’s so hard is not only because I lose him but I lose his family, his kids (split cust). The community he lives in, which is many of his relatives. I never have help with things the way family is there to help eachother. I know many people hate their families, grass is greener, whatever.

so I had a fwb who initiated the sexual relationship a few weeks ago, after that night he tells me he has a long distance boyfriend but wants to continue messing around with me, I agreed to continue because God knows when last I had intimacy and physical affection. We continue messing around for a few weeks and on ALL occasions he's the one who initiates the sex and teasing, he even goes as far as to say he had sexual fantasies about me prior to our first sexual encounter, this made me feel wanted (which is something I've never really felt). Okay now I finally decide to pluck up the courage and go to his room because I was feeling horny, the dude literally ends our thing on the spot in the most heartless manner ever.... he just pats my shoulder and says he can't do it anymore.

I know I'm in the wrong for thinking anything different would've come out of this but I just can't help how I feel, I feel so abandoned and unloved! I also think I lack self-respect or something because why did I settle for someone who was already taken!?!? Anyway just comment away, I'd like to read your thoughts on this.

1627,x9eaqo,Right_War_4406,"Hey everyone... I really have nowhere else to vent so reddit it is. Don't know if its my anxiety but I'm feeling like many people in my life are tired of me. I'm a female, 23 years old. I've had a best friend that I've known for 12 years but lately I'm questioning whether our friendship will continue. Everything started to go downhill a couple of months ago when my friend told me that she needed to talk to me. Basically, she said that she wanted to be less considerate of me and wanted to not feel obligated to invite me places. She also said that she was annoyed by the amount of times I would text and call her. She said she almost felt like she was in a relationship with me because she felt obligated to spend time with me. My heart was honestly very broken because I never knew she felt this way. I just called her at times because I genuinely liked talking to my friend and felt she was the closest person in the world to me... she later apologized and said that she did not mean to word some of the things she said the way she did, but I just can't forget the hurt she caused me. Fast forward a couple of months later, we've fought several times. Each time it's usually her being upset about something without telling me and she just blows up on me and starts yelling at me. I almost feel like her punching bag because she always calls me when she wants to vent or hang out or goes off when she's mad and I'm always there for her but whenever I'm crying and need someone, she never answers the phone. I can't tell her how upset I am that she's never there for me because at the end of the day, she was the one who said me calling her bothers her. I don't know if I should even bother reaching out anymore and wait for this rough patch to end or if I should just stop teying altogether. The only other group of friends I have don't really listen to me either. They're not the type to listen to my problems because they're all guys and I'm the only girl. If I even try to tell them what I feel, chances are they will just call me sensitive. Is it really better to be lonely than in bad company? All I want is a friend who is as excited to see me as I am to see them. Who will both talk to me and listen to me as well.

1639,x9ftcd,BurntBananaPeel97,"So I'm in highschool and I literally just exist at school. 
I haven't had any friends until recently. Well, only one friend. 
Nobody talks to me at school unless we're partners in a group. There's this group of female freshman and sophomores along with some juniors that like to make my life at school more unbearable. 

The one person who talks to me at my school sits with me at lunch. I've gotten attached to eating lunch with them. I feel as though that's a mistake.

Many times when we're together one or two of the girls will come over and interrupt our conversation and start talking with my friend I sit with. 
I can't tell if I feel jealous or if it's me feeling uneasy. 

They completely block me out of the equation and pretend I don't exist. 

For example, I was coming from the lunch line and I sat down in front of my friend. There was a girl part of that group watching. She came over immediately when me and my friend started talking. She wanted my friend to come into the lunch line with her to get lunch. 

And today, one of them came over again and asked her to get them food out the lunch line. I told the girl I'd do it instead. She rolled her eyes and ignored me. My friend asked me to go with her to the line. 

The thing is, is that there are multiple of them sitting at a table. Why couldn't any of them get it? I know they like to make remarks about me sitting alone at a table, awkwardly eating. 

Idk, maybe I'm being possessive. My friend doesn't belong to me. I understand that, but I don't understand why they wait until we're talking to want to talk to her. It's weird...

I feel that now that I've gotten attached to someone I fear being alone. 
So, maybe it's just me overreacting because I don't want to lose the one person that talks to me.

I am feeling really depressed lately, all I do is work my two jobs, babysit and study. I hardly leave the house on my days off, I have only gone back to see my friends in my old town once since moving here. I keep in touch regularly with my friends in my old town through social media and phone calls, but I don't get that physical social interaction. I have one of my best friends who lives in the town over from me which is about an hour away, but I feel like our friendship has distanced since I've moved home. Sometimes she comes to my town knowing I have a day off and she doesn't contact me or pop in to say hello, I have invited her to come for sleepovers, lunch, dinner, or anything and she always seems too busy to do so, she hardly invites me out to her place, whereas when I was living in the old town, we talked so much and made the effort to see each other more even though we were 3 hours apart. 

I have tried doing social things in my hometown to meet new people, but nothing ever comes from it. I don't know if it's me or them. I am a very social person and I seem to get along with literally anyone, but since moving home, I feel like the biggest loner, I literally have no friends here. 

Even my workplace held a staff dinner the other week and didn't invite me, even though I am working for our family business... It really put me down, why wasn't I invited?? I was the only one that wasn't and I am their family.

I was asked to join a sports team as a social sport, so I said yes, but then they registered the team without me in it. I don't get it, I'm nearly at breaking point.

1647,x9gu5u,InconspicousBackup,"Tw: depressive rant with a brief mentioned of suicide.

I've struggled for a long time with health issues, both pyscially and mentally. I have made so much progress and even though I'm not doing ""good"" or even ""ok,"" I'm doing so much better and it's been an immesurable blessing. I understand myself and my thoughts so much better than I used too.

Other than that, I'm graduating college this may and things have been going great, I love doing what I do! I have hobbies and interests that keep me occupied (when my health lets me explore them.) I also have two beautiful cats in my apartment that I love to death.

But, I'm alone. I have no one to share my life with. I have no close friends. I've never had a partner. My relationship with my family is rocky at best and they live a 1000 miles away. I'm all I got.
 
I just feel invisible. (*Trigger warning: suicide - skip this paragraph) If I were to kill myself right now, it would take a week or so for someone to find me. I don't really ever feel like doing it, but it's such an awful feeling to think that no one would miss you if you where gone.


In this past year I've been two wonderful people that I was genuinely interested in pursuing a relationship with and was excited about. I enjoyed talking to them and every indication told me that they genuinely enjoyed my company as well. But they didn't want what I wanted. That's ok, that's life I realize that, and I find myself lucky to find two people I was passionate about in a years time. But it's just so frustrating to get so close to what you want, but then having to come to terms with the fact that they meant more to me than I meant to them.

It also sucks because one of the people I really fucking liked was in a relationship with someone else. I told her how I felt and she didn't reciprocate and ended our friendship.

I found someone I was genuinely interested in pursuing a relationship with, someone who I held a very high opinion of, and she didn't feel the same way about me; she felt that way about someone else. I know that doesn't have any bearing on my value as a human being, but it would fuck with my head. 

I had a procedure done with anesthesia and I had to be escorted home by someone. I had to pay someone to do this for me. And all the while, there was someone I cared about that I was willing to come through for, but she wouldn't want me too. She has someone who would do this for her, and she would do it for someone else, but not me. 

Again, I know this isn't a reflection of me or anyone's fault (especially not hers), but it's just so incredibly hurtful. When I'm vulnerable and I need someone to help me out, I'm all I got. I'm the only person who's willing to put for an effort to make myself feel better or happy about anything in this life. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who sees anything of value in me whatsoever. I'm no one's number one option. If there was a start of a nuclear war and we all had an hours notice, I'd have no one to say my final goodbyes too. I'd have people I'd like to talk too, but they wouldn't pick up the phone.


Sometimes I feel like I'm in this situation because I'm not good enough. Or that I'm a bad person and that I deserve this. Or that everyone can tell I'm a looser just by looking at me and they don't want anything to do with me. Sometimes I feel that those people I had feelings for would laugh at me if they knew how I felt about them, and they'd think I'm insane because I thought they may see me in a similar light.

But I know that's not true, and I doubt it's true for most of y'all here. I moved to a city 1000 miles from home about 14 months ago where I didn't know a single soul. I was a freshman in college when the pandemic started and completely uprooted my life. I have health issues that make it hard for me to maintain relationships with people. (I think I may have autism and/or BPD, but I haven't really explored that yet.) I've had some really shitty experiences in my childhood that destroyed my self confidence. I've been through some shit, and that doesn't make me any less of a person.

And even more than that, I've just been unlucky. But the people that are in my life indicate that I am a good person who has value and people enjoy being around. I'll find someone who sees me the same way I see me on my good days. I've gotten close before, and if I keep getting close luck will probably break my way one of these times. 


Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I have any less value as a person. If anyone would ever judge me for that, they can go fuck themselves.



Idk. If anyone read this depressive rant all the way through, I thank you for listening. If anyone resonated with this that would mean the world to me. I doubt that this post will gain much traction, but it's just nice to put some of this stuff out and share it with a bunch of strangers on the internet.

I hope you all find the inner peace you're looking for. Life is  hard, and no one should have to go through it alone. But just because you are at this moment, it doesn't mean you're any less of a person or that life will always be this way.

Stillness
I’m sorry if I made you cry 
I’m sorry if I’m not enough
I’m sorry if I’m too much 
I’m sorry for being needy
I’m sorry for being distant 
I’m sorry for being me

I have pieces missing,  I’m never going to be the same
Sometimes the piece thats missing ends your game 
Sometimes someone lends a piece to keep you  going
sometimes where your going needs pieces you never had

Sometimes you are the piece.
Sometimes your used and abused and thrown away
Sometimes your dusted off cleaned up for display
And sometimes no one sees you

Sometimes … well you just don’t matter enough 
And a few times you matter too much

Be still they say in the mind and heart.
But how when head and heart feel miles apart
The heart wants one thing and the mind says no
The mind tells you , be still and you will grow.
How does one grow with a heart that doesn’t beat?
With scars that don’t heal, and pain that won’t leave
How does one stay still , coming back from death with no more answers than when I first left

 I can’t be still.. I’m sorry.",2022-09-09 02:04:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662299137,7,/r/lonely/comments/x9iqcd/it_seems_i_resonate_with_some_of_you/,,0,5,It seems I resonate with some of you

Me, well I’m downstairs, on the deck, listening and thinking. Not overthinking, just thinking where am I going. What’s the point of getting into projects, work and all of this that we call “a career”, don’t get me wrong, I love what I do, but whenever I get good news, or bad, I rarely get the chance to share it with someone, not family, not friends, everyone’s in their own bubble, and they’re not to blame.

1699,x9mxeh,OppressedDeskJockey,"I hate posting negative vibes. But lately this week I have been working a lot. And I felt happy, I was looking forward to do fun stuff for the weekend. 

But yesterday my car has issues, was stranded for a few hours, the tow guy was rude. Dropped off my car and I forgot to take the keys out the ignition so my car died the next day when I spent 2 hours and $60(money I was going to use to enjoy my weekend) repairing my car then had to call service to help boost my car. Went to work noticed the brake lights where on when I turned my car off. Did a Google search and found out how to temporarily turn it off.

 I feel my job treats me like the hired help which I am but I don't feel respected. Found out a friend is having suicidal thoughts and is ignoring my texts. (I feel like it's my fault because I didn't hangout with them a few weeks ago). I've been arguing about stupid stuff at home with spouse. (Dirty dishes, making the water that I take to work in a bottle taste like crap.) I work 12 shifts. There is no water at work. I have to drink nasty water. I only expect that to be taken care of but it's always an issue. I don't even bring it up anymore. Its just saddening. 

I planned to hangout with one of my friends but they never got back to me and said they would. I was totally left hanging, waiting a whole week and won't bother to ask why. Because if I was important to that person they'd tell me what happened. I thought we were good friends... 

I have to figure out how to fix my brake switch. I can't spend anymore money because I'm on a budget. I haven't smoked weed in months but feel like I need it. I'm tired of drinking to feel better. I work out and it feels great but when I get home it's all back. I feel like I'm boring. I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to lay down. And do absolutely nothing.

I forget things a lot. I forget names, memories, and names of places, persons, and things. The one thing I enjoy is doing math in my head that makes me feel smart. But I just feel stupid overall. 

 I feel like I have to force myself to be social and I don't like it. I thought maybe new friends would help. But now I just don't want any friends. I just want to be alone. I don't want anyone to bother me. I think therapy is a facade and useless. I am a believer in medicine but I don't want to be diagnosed as depressed or anything else because I need my job to live.

 This weekend I'm just going to lie in bed until it's Monday again. I am the type to always care about others and wish to help. I wish to help myself but rn I am just absolutely tired and want to shutdown. Hope everyone else is doing well, I guess posting this to the void helps so I did just that.

The thing is that I have almost nothing in common with other gay men. I don’t really have much in common with most people, but especially other gay men. I’ve met a couple men I thought would make great partners based on our compatibility and mutual interest, but they were always straight. I’m kind of just admitting to myself I will be single likely forever. That is of course I compromise my primary interests and attempt a relationship with somebody I’d regularly consider incompatible. 

Have any of you had this realization that you’ll probably be single forever? How do you cope? It’s like no matter the time or mental gymnastics that nature in me wins out and I crave a partner. Not sure if it’s possible to truly be content as a single person. It may be something we are socialized into or it may be some basic constituent of human nature. Either way it seems inescapable.

1708,x9npze,pacific-oshun,"Every year for as long as I can remember since junior high I guess, I’ve had a new “best friend” every school year. Of course, by the end of the school year, summer comes, and we stop texting and we drift apart. I thought it’s normal. It happens. Next year i have a new “best friend”. 

In University, my life was still like that. I would have one friend I’m really close to, hang out with every single day, sleep over with, text all the time, study with, and mind you, they’ll invite me to do these things. Next thing I know, they ghost me the following year. Removed from all social media, no explanation as to why. 

This happened to me in High School as well, removed from all socials, no explanation as to why. I’ve just accepted it then. But now, being so hyper aware of this cycle, I feel like I can never make friends. This inherent underlying feeling of “There’s something about me that’s wrong, she’s just gonna leave me again”. 

I had a friend, who I would text and ask her to hang out with me, I’d pick her up all the time, she’d ask me personal questions and I’d open up to her. But when I would ask her similar questions, she would shut me down and tell me she’s not ready to talk about it. Her one friend cut her off, and she was devastated and texted that friend to confront her. She texted a mutual friend of ours that “she’s the only friend she has now” (This friend is the one that told me she told her that). I felt very hurt because I was always here inviting her out and picking her up. I realized she never texted to check up on me. I got into a huge argument with all my friends in that group. I felt very discouraged about all my friendships and I cut her off too. Unfollowed her off social media. It’s been a year since and no ones reached out.

It has been a week since you said goodbye. Well, that's the most delicate way to say it. 

You abandoned me. Disposed me.

I can't tell you anything anymore.

I almost got into an accident just now. It was not my fault but I was not really paying attention to the road. I was crying. I was crying a lot because I was thinking of you.

I went to work today. Remember how you used to say ""good morning"" and include the emojis at this time around ? I had to go to the office today because one of my very good colleagues is leaving. It's her last day today.

It hit me hard because the last time you left me abruptly, I lost a good colleague. History repeats itself - today, seven days after you left me, another colleague left me too. I feel like I am being punished by the universe.

I am writing this in my car at the parking lot, where I can see the yamaha bike I told you about that day. The bike reminds me of you and it is painful to look at it.

These changes would not hit me hard if only I am emotionally and mentally fine. Or if you had not left me so easily. But it is too hard to process everything right now.

It feels like I am a sinner and God is punishing me by putting me in this devastating state. The Universe itself seems to want me to suffer alone.

I have lost faith in everything. I enjoy nothing. I can't even find joy in the things I used to love to do. I shared those with you and now they are tainted with your presence.

You made me feel lonelier than I ever felt my entire life.

1712,x9osn7,idkidkwhattosay,"I (19M) don't think anyone has ever genuinely loved me, I'm not sure anybody even knows the real me.   When my mom was pregnant, my dad wanted me to be aborted. I grew up with a father but in middle school my family structure changed and I've not had a relationship with him since. I'm my mom's least favorite kid and she didn't like mistreat me or anything growing up but I could always tell she loved the others more and she would spend more time with them. I had one friend as a little kid but thats it really. I was 'friends' with my co-workers but they never wanted much to do with me outside of work. 

honestly I do think my mom loves her son, my siblings love their brother, ect ect but I dont think any of them love like the actual real me. I have a cat and I think she loves her human but i don't think she actually loves me. I just feel so isolated and alone, like I'm stranded on an island. If I died tomorrow a son, brother, coworker, 'friend' would be mourned but the true me wouldn't be thought about for even a second. I used to cope with all of this by thinking 'at least I love myself' but I looked at myself in the mirror the other day and I could just feel a new level of loneliness as I realized I don't love myself.

I've done so much and tried so many different coping methods but nothing is able to get rid of this feeling of complete emptiness. I tried bettering myself physically and it helped a little bit but not really, I tried picking up hobbies but I can't get them to stick, I tried talking to more people and although they talk to me back and stuff idk i just don't feel a real bond forming ever. I even tried things that I thought would at least numb this feeling, self harm felt just so pointless and didn't even give me temporary satisfaction or anything so ig thats not just for me.

How can missing someone hurt like this ? I have been miserable and dead inside. 

I wake up thinking of you. I go to through the day with an aching heart and destroyed mental state. I go to sleep with swollen eyes from all the crying. Then I wake up in the middle of the night, anxious and in fear, chest tight and painful, body trembling and scared of the night.

How can you leave me like this ? Was it so easy for you to say goodbye and forgot everything that we had shared ? Even when were just friends ?

Yes, you fell out of love. But am I that disposable that you chose to leave ? Did you think leaving will make it better ?

It has been a week and they say time heals. It does not. Not for me. The days have passed, but I am heading backward, revisiting the words we shared and the affections we showed to each other. I am heading towards self-distruction.

I can't run away from time. Every single minute leads me to you. Every hour has me wondering about you. Time reminds me of you. It feels like your presence has tainted the most trivial thing in my life.

I don't think I am lonely. If I am, I can just fix this by talking to anyone. I am heartbroken and alone. You broke me and made me feel more alone that I have ever felt in my entire years of living.

Not stuff like getting married and having a kid, but the common things. I wish I could go on a real vacation somewhere. I'd love to travel overseas, but I don't have anyone to go with. No, I can't do it alone, I would be far too uncomfortable without someone I trusted. I also don't go to many concerts or movies.

I yearn for a group of friends or at least ONE friend to do some activities or not necessarily an activity but anything. Why is it so hard to form a genuine friendship with someone like I'm trying but no one else is trying to be friends with me?

1749,x9x6qz,throwaway_loser1216,"Four years was the longest i ever had a friend. I helped him, i cared too much, i told him i would be there for him. All of these things pushed him away.

I was lonely and i needed him. I asked for conversation and time. It became too much work for him and he removed me from his life.

We both had issues going on in our lives. I didn't resent him. I missed him and i mourned the loss then, knowing i would never get to talk to him again. That was nine years ago.

And now he's dead.

I've had very few friends since then. I left all social media. I've been extremely reclusive. I've referred to this time as my ""hermitage.""

I've had a few ""work friends"" who had no desire to see me outside of work. 

I moved to another state knowing people are friendlier here. Still i've only made a couple friends, neither whose intentions or motives seem good. I guess it was me all along, i'm just not desirable to have in people's lives.

One woman's friendship began with her, a customer, hitting on me while i was at work. She practically admitted she wanted to ""fuck"" me. She found me much less attractive when i took my facemask off (height of COVID). She even laughed at me. I've only seen her a few times in the past couple years, and it's only when her parents say they miss me. My other current friend was a coworker at my previous job. He has only attempted to hang out with me when he can use me for a ride to get beer or play at the casino.

Then i met a wonderful woman online. I saw her in a music chat and complimented her drawing abilities. We got along exceptionally well. She asked a lot of hard questions, but i was completely honest with all my answers.

She has told me the sweetest things I've ever heard in my life. She said i'm amazing, i'm a great person to know, she's lucky to have met me, she doesn't understand why so many people dislike me, she thinks i'm extremely talented, she even told me i'm attractive. I don't know why, but i believed all of it. Nobody had ever told me i'm attractive before. Furthermore, this woman's morals and beliefs seemed to be closer to mine than anyone else i have ever met.

Well i fucked up. Now she's gone too. I called her darling, sweetheart, doll, and angel. I cared for her. I wrote her poems, sang for her, drew for her. None of these things pushed her away. Until i reminded her i dream i could be with her someday. 

I believed if i had ever reached out to my friend before he killed himself, he would have refused to talk to me. I don't know how much of that is true and how much is me hoping it's true to make his death less painful...

Based on what i know from my entire life, there's no way this beautiful, incredible woman actually liked me as a person, thought i was intelligent, enjoyed talking to me, found me attractive, and admired my ""art.""

That doesn't really make it less painful though. It was nice hearing those things for the first and last time.",2022-09-09 14:37:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662734016,3,/r/lonely/comments/x9x6qz/just_wanted_to_rant_here_if_thats_ok/,,0,0,"Just wanted to rant here, if that's ok"

It hurt when, last fall , I was sitting at the table and grandma calls me.

I was then told not to contact her at all because of some reasons I don’t remember so they were probably BS. I didn’t call my grandma back out of obedience to my mother. I hadn’t talked to her for a few years before that either due to illness.

I never got to speak with her. 

The last time I could’ve seen her was in fall 2019 for her 90th birthday that apparently was a big thing and I wasn’t told until last minute and (long story) because of my mother I couldn’t go. She was furious even tho it was her fault and I was really upset. I couldn’t see her then for her 90th, and it was a while time before then that I’d seen her as well. I feel robbed and I was so unwell at the time I had to live at home WITH HER (nmom).

Here’s the thing with my grandma. According to the stories from my mom, which I don’t know about anymore, my grandfather was an alcoholic who was physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive. He’d regularly get drunk and beat and fight with my grandmother. One time they were fighting in the pickup truck and he was driving and started beating my grandmother in the passenger seat and she had to jump out out the moving truck. She got paralyzed and was in hospital bedbound, my grandfather tells her “you better get out of that bed or I’m putting these kids up for adoption”. He would’ve. So my grandma works herself ALONE through physical therapy as fast and hard as possible so she could get home before he gave away her children. That’s just some stuff I can remember from her life, grandpa was long dead when I came and my grandma was really wonderful. He died of either alcoholism or smoking, I forget which. 

My grandma isn’t the best person in the world in her life, but during the time she was in my life she might as well have been. She always loved me no matter what and never bought into the family drama. She was the grandma who’d sit and knit you a scarf and watch tv. She’d bake cookies from scratch. She babysat me when I was a kid, my parents were separated (cuz of fkin nMom) and my dad was working breadwinner and taking care of me while nMom was IDK doing IDK.

She was nice and kind. Only thing I lamented was she wasn’t strong enough to stand up to my aunt/uncle/cousins and say to stop icing me out just because I’m my moms kid, connect me with the family or at least my cousins or something, but I don’t know if she could handle the fighting. I don’t blame her really for it, I never got the stories on the family histories or dramas, I just got outcast at some point. 

I wasn’t able to go because… in the same text about not going to the funeral my nMom grudgingly revealed me that she finished renovating her/our house, sold it, bought a new bigger house 8 hours away, and moved, all within the previous 2 months. She was absolute silence during that time prob because she knew she was wrong as she did it to run, and discarded me here (I’m on disability for MH issues from permanent pharma side effects from drugs she blackmailed me into taking, long story). Have no support here, nearest family hours away, I won’t make it long term.

Called my Dad and he said he didn’t know if he’d be attending. Wouldn’t drive me not that I really asked but he kinda outright said that’s too much. He was terrible at being supportive emotionally, didn’t seem to try much. It wouldn’t have been too much to ask for a ride because he’s done nothing of substance to support me since my suicide attempts and MH crash. And he’s retired now. He remarried so he’s got new family but he isn’t a narc I don’t believe, stepmother hates me so I’m ostracized from that side of the family too.

I’m tired of this life. Too many things in it I’m tired of. Health, MH, grandmothers death, ostracized / abandoned / pushed away by family, told I’m wanted and to stay alive but again unwanted by family. The more I think nowadays about my dad, the more I realize he’s never going to connect more with me and in all likelihood he just doesn’t know how to deal with an extra unwanted son there’s no room for in the family but he can’t abandon himself either so he’s stuck until the obvious grim outcome arrives for me. 

I never listen to country, but ‘Whiskey Lullaby’ for some reason came up on YouTube. Hit close, the pain and toxic coping until the darkness has consumed you. The darkness has consumed me, my life, not that this feels like one anymore. I need a lullaby because I’m tired of living this nightmare.

I recently ended things with a so called best friend because I felt neglected and he was acting like I was being unreasonable. Honestly, im still wondering if i really am too sensitive.

It hurts even more when I found out through a mutual friend where he said I ended our (me and his) friendship just because he didnt wish me happy birthday.

Sometimes I feel like I was too unfair too him because he isnt the only person that treats me like this. Ive been feeling lonely a lot and have tried reaching out to my friends, but they either only talk about themselves or dont respond to me.

1794,xa42yf,Brigxtte,"Hiya,  
Like the title says ""would I make a good partner"" if I where to find someone with the things listed below?  
This is NOT a post to look for a relationship, I'd just like to hear you're thoughts and opinions on the matter.  
I normally really don't like talking ""highly"" about myself since it makes me uncomfortable, and normally want others to do it for me, (also find that really wholesome!) but here goes nothing! :D

I'd like to say I'm a warm-hearted girl, I love giving and receiving affection.  
I'm willing to put everything on everything to make my partner happy, (I once offered my ex and vacation but he refused, saying he felt bad because it was ""too kind"", ppsstt: he was cheating"" and I'm willing to go to the deepest of lows for us to get out of it together.  
I like the say ""it takes two to tango"" meaning it has to come from both sides to make it work, (tango being a dance) something I learned greatly from from my previous relationship.  
Looks don't matter to me, (well a wee bit) I mostly love someone for who they are, I truly love someone I'll grow attached to that person, and will be blinded by their imperfections.   
I'm extremely loyal, once I'm with someone I'm truly theirs, I wont run off and I wont be shared.  


I think I can say I'm quite loveable, I'm very easy to get along with and have a great time with!   
I'm an open minded person and normally open for anything, There's a lot I haven't done yet and would love to adventure out!   
I'm really calm but I can be full of emotion at times, so a swarm of affection could be heading your way anytime!  


Now that I've told some ""good"" things about myself, now some ""bad""   
\[INSERT A THOUSAND PAGE DOCUMENT HERE\]  hehe  


I'm still somewhat emotional at times, have some mood switches that impact me very little, but still has some impact.   
Jealousy is a wee problem, and I want to do all sorts of things with you, is that a bad thing? take is as you like haha.  
Sometimes I'm a bit too much and need to dial it down, something I respect completely!   


Right! lets finish things up, this has been a question on my mind and was wondering what people would think, I'd like to be at the best of the best when it comes to loving/caring for someone, hence the post!   
Thank you very much for reading and have a pleasant day!",2022-09-09 19:21:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1661982657,7,/r/lonely/comments/xa42yf/18f_would_i_make_a_good_partner/,,0,68,[18F] Would I make a good partner?

I'm depressed for several years now and I'm taking anti-depressants for this. The only thing that could make me happy was my best friend. We knew each other for 10 years.

A few years later I couldn't bear it anymore and I told him. He said we could never be a thing (because he's straight) but that we could still be best friends. I told him a few times again (mostly when we were drunk) and I've got rejected multiple times and still couldn't get over it. 

The last few years turned into an unhealthy obsession from my side and now I really fucked up our friendship because I broke his trust. I haven't heard him anymore since our break-up 3 months ago. 

I'm currently almost 2 weeks in a mental hospital because since the break-up I drank too much and abused sleeping pills just to feel numb and feel ""better"". Because I lost the most worthy thing I've got, my best friend. Things will never be the same again and nothing makes me happy.

1816,xa65tj,AlbatrossAmbitious62,"Hello there, sorry for the text wall, but I want to share a piece of my life with you.

I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship with a girl (haven't even held hands), however it doesn't mean I've never been in love. Up to this moment I've ""collected"" a list of such ""objects"", and it was ok for 7ish years until one of them hit different.

This ""object"" is one who I met on the first day of university. For the last three years I didn't even try to talk to her, and was satisfied only by throwing a glance from time to time .

Now it's the last year of her bachelor's program, and though I'm pretty sure she will continue studying for the master's program, there's a feeling I'm losing my last chance.

To be honest, It isn't the first time leaving my secret love (the same thing was at school), but now a strong feeling appears that I have to do something with my unresolved situation.

I suppose this happened because I decided to deal with frequent masturbation (I used to do it up to 4-5 times a day, and now only twice a week), but still, though my ""instinct"" tries to push things forward, I'm too awkward to talk to her, as well as text her or add to the friend list.

I'm asking for advice on what people usually do when they want to get closer with somebody. Is it ok to just tell her about my feelings all at once, or should I act more gradually? I've heard many pieces of advice like ""just ask her over"" or ""have a small conversation"", but I have like zero social skills and don't know what all this means to be in detail.",2022-09-09 20:49:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1633881567,1,/r/lonely/comments/xa65tj/need_helpadvice/,,0,5,Need help/advice

1866,xaecl5,Boopblip18,"Hi!  This may be long but I need a bit of a vent.  What kind of topped it off today was for about the last week and a half my siblings introduced me to one of their friends they thought could be compatible with me.  We haven’t talked much so far but he seems like a nice guy and he’s kinda cute!  I’d kinda been looking forward to the weekend to go out ah but today I heard he got offered a job in a different state :/ I hardly know the guy so I’d want him to have a good job you know?  But I couldn’t help but feel super disappointed.

Like I’ve been doing dating apps since I turned 18.  And I’ll be 23 next month.  It was ok for a while, I’d been on a few dates but not many I felt like I clicked with.  I’ve only had 2 relationships, both under 3 months.  This year I haven’t had much luck on the dating apps and it’s gotten me really bummed.  I use the apps because I don’t really meet guys outside.  I even worked at a bar for almost a year lol (maybe the wrong bar to meet a decently nice guy 😂).

I don’t really have any friends either.  My messages consist of mainly family haha which isn’t bad, but I wish I had some kind of relationship outside of my family.  I wish there was someone I could text or look forward to texting/seeing.  I always feel like an extra, like people like me but wouldn’t be terribly sad if I wasn’t there.

I haven’t been in the mood to pursue like a real connection on the dating app lately.  I’ve just been disappointed so many times that I don’t want to get my hopes up again whether that’s waiting for a text or going on a date.  I’m tired of it lol.  It drains me and it makes me sad.

I did go to therapy like 2 years ago and she was nice!  She was more of a counselor so she encouraged me to try new clubs and meet people.  But now I think I need to go back to therapy just to alter my thinking.  I can feel myself becoming less optimistic, and when I get sad it takes up my entire day/night.  I know there’s like cbt and I think with someone encouraging me it might be helpful.  

The only person I really talk to about this is my mom.  And I know she feels bad for me, but I don’t think she really understands how this feels.  It just sucks.  I have so many hobbies I love and 3 pets and I just wish I could be more happy with the things I have and not unhappy about the things I don’t have.

1887,xag35m,Reach-Comfortable,"I’m 21 y/o and my husband is 20. Relationship of 3 years. Just until a few weeks ago, he was working from home so when I would get home from my job he’d always be there and we’d spend most of our time watching netflix, eating, window shopping, cuddling, etc. He recently got an on-site job and I also just started college again so our schedules barely collide. There’s days I only see him to sleep together at night and yet when I am briefly with him, I still feel lonely. We’ve struggled with fights on who does the dishes and other petty insignificant things. I love him to death, and when we are together, I’m in a terrible mood and don’t know how to control it. I get annoyed by the way he chews, sometimes what he says and especially his laziness irks me. We rarely have sex mostly because of me not wanting to due to childhood trauma that’s been taunting me vigorously lately regarding sexual abuse. He’s said that even though he understands I’m not always up for it or not always comfortable, he still has needs and it’s discouraging that we rarely have it and when we try, I get super distracted and he notices it. When we first started dating our sex life was great, I was always ready to go at it. This slowly changed when the situation regarding abuse got more relevant in my life due to police reports and my family turning against me for bringing out the truth of a pedophile. But anyway, this year has been the most blessed year I’ve had so far and yet the most depressing one. I’ve been through a lot and I can’t seem to feel anything real or express happiness or enjoy my days without overthinking on whether or not my husband will leave me so he won’t deal with my shit anymore or if he’s cheating because I don’t satisfy him or if because of my fault he doesn’t love me anymore. We get along very well in the good moments, we are definitely best friends with the same humor and our own dialect, this may sound cliché but I truly cannot live without him. Especially since he is the only family I have and the only person to truly know me for who I am, even this shitty phase I am going through right now. All I want to do is feel okay and myself again and hopefully that means him wanting me again. I wrote this because he got home from work at 11pm and I was building a desk for one of our rooms, I was so excited for him to get here because I really didn’t know how to build a desk lol. So I wanted to have bonding time too. Instead of that happening, he went to the gym. This ruined any but of enthusiasm I had for the night.

1917,xailo1,DisposableMale_98,"Obviously not my main account. But man I need to vent here.

So on another sub that involves relationship seeking (NOT the point of this post, mods) I reached out to a couple of women who claimed to be looking for a guy for very specific interactions. These will be W1 and W2. Both of them have been talking to me for just over 2 weeks now.

I also reach out to those on this and other subs who are looking for encouragement, support, or a kind word. One of which previously became a very close friend before drama ensued 2 years ago and I was blocked. This one has a habit of stalking the posts of people she finds interesting. For some unknown reason I am still on this list. Or was. So lets call this one Yan-chan. Well, she contacts me under an alt about a week ago asking about a post I made, we start talking again, and she is having a rough time in her life. I know her well enough to give some effective kind words and encouragement, and since I'm not a complete ass, I do so. We talk a bit more over the next few days and at least remain civil and pleasant.

So, last night W1 makes it clear she has been stringing me along and has no interest in actually pursuing anything with me, they just wanted to screw with someones head and heart for kicks. Which we all know happens. Unfortunately, this is also a bad time of year for me emotionally, and on top of all of that, it hits a nerve. Then Yan-chan shows up, demanding to know my intentions in encouraging her and asking if I was fishing for a relationship that was unsustainable. I asked if I guy wasnt allowed to just be kind to someone in need just for the sake of doing so, told her I wasnt trying to fish or sustain anything, and that if my kindness was unwelcome she could tell me and I would take it elsewhere. No response to that or subsequent messages. At this point I assume I'm blocked. Now getting strung along is one thing, but to be made the villain for actually being nice and supportive? Ya, that one got to me.

So I'm talking to W2, and after all this crap, I ask her to give me some kind of reassurance this isnt going to turn into 3 of a kind. She accuses me of lashing out at her for having a bad night, wishes me good luck elsewhere and blocks me.

I'm just stunned... the ones that claim to be looking for quick fun string you along, the ones that say they want conversation and connection ghost at the drop of a mood swing, and the ones that need a friend demonize and block you for being a friend. And its always the ""bad guy"", never the ""bad girl"", who is the villain.

1919,xaipgi,Vegetable-Nobody-224,"just for some context I am 19 yo man that moved to the US recently where the culture is totally different from where I am from. Before moving to the US I was a really an outgoing person, I went to parties and spent a lot of time with friends and wouldn't come back home till it was 2 am most nights and I really enjoyed the company of people but since I moved out I started to get less in touch with my friends( huge difference in time zones ) till I eventually only called them once every week to catch up then I stopped calling and stopped receiving calls (turns out people won't talk to you unless you talk to them so I stopped completely after the third month and I never received a call)and found it difficult to make new friends here so I spent 9 months going to college and straight back home without making any friends, without going out (only occasionally on some Sundays with my family) and I slowly learned to survive in the loneliness.

1951,xanc08,[deleted],"I can't do this anymore -

I have people I'm friendly with at work, we crack a couple of jokes and for the most part it's fine. But I have no idea how to actually make friendships. Everyone there knows me but also, they're at the age (same as me, 18) where they're out drinking, partying, clubbing, etc. I'm not gonna police anyone else's actions of course but I have never had a sip of alcohol in my life. It's not something I want to do. But this really makes me feel like I have no chances of making actual friendships with these people.

But then, my university is online because I can't travel far enough to get there physically 4 times a week. So no chance of making friends there.

Apart from that, I do not leave the house. I sit at home, playing games, watching YouTube or scrolling Reddit. I have absolutely nothing. I have no one I message regularly, I'm too insecure to open up to anyone due to past bullying (specifically for physical features I can't control - I have never allowed anyone to even take a photo with me in the background), I don't even know where to fucking start. It feels like, once I'm in a conversation with someone I'm okay and I'm not overly awkward. I can keep up conversations. But I have never really had a friendship. I can't take it further than friendly conversation. I don't know if it's okay to add people on social media after meeting them, and I feel people will think I'm just being creepy or weird because of how I look. But even the people I do have on socials, I don't get invited to anything because 1 - people know I'm not into drinking and 2 - I'm not close enough to anyone and - again - don't know how to be.

I know the standard response - find a new group of people. But... where do I even start? I'm WAY too socially anxious to go anywhere with people I don't know, I'm fearful of judgement from absolutely everywhere, I'm scared of genuinely just being perceived. The few times I go to the grocery store by myself, I speedwalk everywhere and end up forgetting 99% of things because I don't want to be noticed. I know it's irrational but this fear is seriously stopping me from doing anything. Once I get into a conversation with people at work, I feel like I'm fine. People generally like me, couple of jokes, just... normal conversation. But anywhere else, where no one knows me, I retract. I feel like I might just be scared of people getting to know me because of fear of judgement, but how do I get past this?

I can't afford therapy by the way.

Also, I feel like I completely lack any social confidence even with the people I am closest to (close is relative) because I grew up in the age of ""cringe"" culture. Where anything slightly ""abnormal"" or anything that indicated neurodivergency (I'm on the Autism spectrum) was ""cringe"" and you should feel bad. And now I have that same mindset.

I feel self-aware of my issues, I feel like I know what I ultimately have to do, there's just a massive fucking wall made of pure concrete that I can't break down. I've been trying for years. Heck, ever since the bullying started in grade 3 I have been completely incapable of making any friends. When I find people to hang out with, I just think they secretly hate me. And that makes me do stupid shit that makes them ACTUALLY hate me. And repeat the cycle.

I just wanted to vent. I'm 18. I'm in the time where I should be socialising but I feel like if I ever get this under control, it's gonna be too late for me to do anything socially, and I will remain lonely forever.",2022-09-10 11:44:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/xanc08/im_upset_because_i_have_no_friends_i_have_no/,,0,0,"I'm upset because I have no friends, I have no friends because I'm upset"

I cut off ties with the person who I thought i would grow old with. I only have my family now and I’m treating them badly. I hate how i changed into this kind of person. I have a bad temper and i would say shitty stuff when you piss me off. And i’m getting stupid day by day. If my 16 year old self see my situation right now she would be disappointed. I’ve been planning to kill myself since last year but i just have no guts to do it. Everyday i just lay in my bed and use my phone. Mindlessly scrolling on my phone. I would sleep so late and sometimes i would stay awake for 2 days. I get out of this box to eat and bathe and to communicate with my family lol. I do go out tho but not often. Everyday is repeating. It’s so boring. My life is boring. The only hope i have is uni. But my uni still don’t have full face to face classes so i’d be lucky if i take a class who has it. But yeah I don’t know anymore.

1976,xat4su,Big4a,"Hi everyone.

I used to be alone and went on this subreddit a lot. I recently got a boyfriend and it’s been great but weekends like this make my loneliness feel even worse. 

My boyfriend keeps leaving me for events both in the week and weekend. I love him and want him to do things but I just feel soo alone every time he leaves. 

One Saturday he went to a sibling night dinner, last weekend he went to a bachelor party at universal, this weekend he’s in another city for a bachelorette party, and on Tuesday he went to a concert with his sister. Every day he comes home but he studies for like an hour for his financial advisor exams. 

All these instances I’ve been alone and they are good things to be doing. I have no say in this matter because these are things he should be going to. 

But I’m at the expense every time. I’m literally now depressed because I’m just sitting in our apartment completely alone. I have no motivation to go and do anything and it’s so bad that my stomach hurts from the loneliness I feel. 

Is this normal and how can I pick myself back up? I usually am good within a couple Hours but this feeling doesn’t go away.",2022-09-10 16:10:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1627885386,1,/r/lonely/comments/xat4su/loneliness_even_worse_than_before/,,0,0,Loneliness even worse than before
1977,xatajn,deli_nymph,"Submitting to multiple subs because I don't know who to turn to at the moment.

I'm constantly worried that it sounds like I'm feeling sorry for myself, but I don't know how to express myself at this point. My godmother with dementia just passed away today, on her birthday, at exactly midnight, along with more coincidences surrounding her death which were incredibly strange. My therapist says that my parents are abusive, but my parents have been telling me that I'm crazy or that I'm a bad kid since I was quite young, so I don't know what to believe at this point. I was complaining earlier because I couldn't find the cap to my water bottle (stupid thing), and my dad got super mad at me, so I responded in a smartass manner, and he started audio recording me to scare me. I couldn't give you context for how my dad has done much worse things, and how my wonderful yet helicopter mom constantly defends him and tells me that it's my fault that he hurts me, emotionally &amp; physically. I've been trying to challenge my parents' manipulative tactics, even if what I respond with is manipulative, as well. I spoke into the recording app to bug my dad, about how that one time when I was eight, he slapped me so hard that my ears were ringing. I started singing loudly, too, so he wouldn't find any significance to the audio recording. I was talking to him earlier about how there's no communication in this house, because whenever I try to tell my dad that I'm sad or that I feel hurt when he explodes, he either tells me that he'll talk about it later (""later"" never comes), or that it's disrespectful of me to even tell him so, because he's the parent &amp; I'm the child. I am so mad that I get punished for telling my dad that I want to talk to him about how I feel. My mom then called my cousin to talk to her about my godmother, and then my dad started recording me with the camera, knowing VERY well that I have an irrational fear of camera lenses; it sounds dumb, but when I had anorexia at age twelve, my mom put hidden cameras in my bedroom &amp; bathroom, to make sure I wasn't puking, even though she knew I wasn't, but when I discovered them months later, that not only traumatized me but ironically, caused my bulimia which I have to this day. I was crying on the camera, telling my dad to stop, and he kept telling me to go to my room, which I did, but I had to get my stuff, and he continued to taunt me while I was on my way. I know what's going to happen-- he's going to send the video of me to his family to spite me and gain sympathy points. Actually I don't know my parents' true intentions when they discuss private matters with others, or blatantly tell manipulated stories to make me look like I'm their biggest burden, but I can assure you that's it's done waaaay more harm than good. It's insane that my parents think that they're helping the situation, when in reality, they're 80% to blame for the situation at hand, and they just keep contributing &amp; contributing, therefore my therapist tells me that I'm going to have to heal myself for ALL of my trauma until I leave my parents' house. I don't have too many friends, and none of them really feel the need to support me; I'm constantly fluctuating between hating myself &amp; hating others around me. I have been told that when so many people dislike me, it's pretty clear that I'm the problem, and I have to agree. I don't know how to feel. I don't feel much hope at the moment &amp; I feel like an idiot for bawling my eyes out. I don't expect everything to be perfect, but I wish that others around at least showed a bit of support. A lot of the people on Reddit who have directly reached out to me I feel only message me because I'm a sixteen year old girl, because they either say nothing relating to my post or they want to exchange Snapchat (and they're not even bots). I hate that so much. That said, again, I don't know what's real at the moment, and I feel so ambivalent that it hurts, and I dread the possibility than I'm an ungrateful brat. I don't know how to feel &amp; what to do.",2022-09-10 16:17:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622152029,2,/r/lonely/comments/xatajn/16f_i_dont_feel_loved/,,0,5,[16F] I Don't Feel Loved

We are just too ugly to be around people. We are sad and angry and hurt monsters just watching everyone laugh and spit on us like if we were some fucking gremlin. People stare at us just for amusement cuz they think we look werid. Yesterday at school this kid who i found out was a old friend of mines from middle school offered me if he wanted to play cards with some other people. I said “nah i’m good” I don’t regret it. I felt bad for that old friend of mines but the people he was playing with hated me back in middle school. I know if i played with them it would of ended up very badly and awkward. These girls from other tables joined in and wanted to play with them. They made a whole group and i was alone in the corner. I’m glad tho. I know they didn’t want some autistic ugly werido playing with them. Yesterday was also picture day, I just took my photo, no smile no nothing, while taking the photo i got nervous cuz this girl was staring at me and she stared at other people taking photos too. I creeped her out i think. I glanced at her like 2 times and she got weirded out and looked somewhere else. I didn’t mean to bother her. I got nervous and i thought the guy finished taking the photo so i got up and he asked in a rude tone “where are you going” and i said “oh i thought you finished” So i took my photo and i felt my body shaking and got nervous that the girl would be more creeped out that i was shaking hopefully it wasn’t noticeable and hopefully she isn’t in any of my classes..",2022-09-10 16:29:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600018886,3,/r/lonely/comments/xatklg/im_too_ugly_and_autistic_to_be_around_others/,,0,1,i’m too ugly and autistic to be around others

2010,xax1lh,eldritch_cookie77,"This is me waving the white flag. I give up. Let me give some context. 

I won't be disclosing my full name, so just call me D. I'm a 20-year-old living at home with my father and step-mother. 

I'm a Lead Sales Associate at my local Dollar General branch. I don't like it, but I have no choice but to keep going with it if I want to eventually buy a car and eventually get an apartment of my own. I was in college (community college) for two semesters. I have since dropped out because of my debt that I have over 1k to finish paying off, and because of Covid forcing me to take online classes that I was failing. 

I was an english major with a dream of being a screenwriter. Those dreams have since been thrown out of the metaphorical window. That line of work has a less-than-fifty-percent success rate given how competitive the field is, and I know that I'm no good at it. I've been writing since I was in Kindergarten, and when I finished my first feature-length script and shared it with friends back in my first year of high school, they all laughed. 

Since graduating almost 3 years ago, I have no friends. No one that I feel comfortable enough to turn to when I feel this way. When I'm not working or doing little things to help around the house, I'm at my bedroom desk. I try to muster up any inspiration to write or create anything, but I can't. That spark I had is gone. In my late teens I developed a passion for horror and writing and/or creating things within that genre. I even wanted to apply to Tom Savini's Special Make-Up Effects school. More recently I've realized what a complete failure I am at everything I do, and that maybe I shouldn't even bother trying to apply. Everything I create is a joke. I am a joke.

So what's the point?

I don't see myself being happy with my life down the road. I can't do anything right with my life. From simple things like washing dishes without leaving small specks of food that go unnoticed when I first do them, to aspects of my job. I'm always messing up, screwing up, dropping the ball in some way, shape, or form. I am the human embodiment of mistakes. If I were to go out on my own, I'd probably fall flat on my face, get killed, or kill myself. Now and again I think about ending my own life. I'm too much of a p\*\*\*y to do it in a way that would cause me pain, so I've been researching ways to painlessly do it. I haven't found much, but I guess beggars can't be choosers. It wouldn't matter either way if I stayed alive or died, so why not just ""pull the plug""? I'm never going to anything notable with my existence, and all my dreams are unattainable. 

I've had many different dreams throughout life. When I was little I wanted to invent the means for time travel after seeing *Back to the Future.* When I got older I wanted to make movies. Later on that developed into wanting to be a horror screenwriter. I've even thought about selling everything I own and living in a big RV or van and travel the country, and just living life as a nomad. Now I've come to terms with that I'm not smart enough, mentally or physically strong enough, or talented enough to do any and all of those things. I'm a loser. I'm just another nobody in the pages of this planet's story. So this is it. Life wins. I'm tired of always coming up short and being nothing. I'd give away my things but I have no friends to give them to. Maybe I'll donate it all to charity. I could sell it and give the money to my father as a ""sorry for being a terrible excuse for a son"" gift. Maybe I'd give some to my LDR partner,  which Lord knows could find someone more attractive. I mean, she's already got another partner, so what's the point in having me around if she has someone ten times better as it is? 

I'm sorry for upsetting any of you by talking this way, but this is how I've felt for a while now. I wish things could have gone differently. There's so much I wish I could have said or done differently so that I wasn't in the position I'm in now, but I've got nothing left going for me.

So, keep myself away from them and end up staying lonely and trying to console myself with things which I don't want and feel anxious most of the time. When I ask people to hang out with me they refuse but they hang out with others (who is also known to me) but don't let me in their circle but when they need some help I always help them out as I thought may be one day they will consider me.

Whenever I have such things I feel extremely anxious and end up feeling lonely too.

2026,xaz4ps,Omegaproctis,"I used to be with someone that I loved. My first major relationship, my first real love. Lasted two years and we even lived together. It was rocky but pretty great for a while.

There were some things that rubbed me the wrong way but I was always happy with her. She started to abuse me and eventually cheated on me. I was always the only one to strain myself by putting in all the effort to support us. To the point where I would sacrifice my own wants to support ours, or hers I see now.

I threw myself into that relationship and all of my friends came from her as well.

After I found out she cheated on me, I struggled to get over it until I eventually realized I didn't love her anymore. I ended things and in one move I lost my love, my friends, my home. Everything. All I have left is my minimum wage job which is also stretching me thin.

It's been about a month now since we broke up and I am in a struggle against my will to just give up on everything. Every person I try to connect with, I always fail to relate to. Everyone wants to party or work out or go on hikes or whatever.

I don't know why but I just fail to fit in anywhere and I am so miserable. I haven't been this depressed in so long. I don't miss the person, but I miss what I used to have. A best friend, a partner, a lover. Someone I always wanted to share my life with and they would listen. I miss feeling like someone thinks I'm important and valuable in their life. I miss feeling like I belong with someone.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It really hasn't been that long but I have no supports, no one to talk to, nothing to do, no one to do anything with. I am so alone and I just want to give up. 

I feel I have so much love to give all the time, so much support, so much cherishing and loving and everything. But nobody wants it. I'm not good enough for anyone and I don't know if I'm really good enough to just...be.

Hi 

Some people who feel lonely might also suffer from social anxiety which makes it more difficult to find friends and be in groups. It is good to know about social anxiety. 

We have free online Social Anxiety Support Group meetings, every Sunday, 3 pm EST(Toronto time). Everybody from anywhere in the world is welcome. Let us gather and discuss social anxiety, anxiety and depression and being an introvert. These meetings have been going on for the past 20 years every Sunday and many people have benefitted from them. 

You can find the Zoom link here:

2037,xb1dt9,[deleted],"You try your best to show love and support to your family and friends by trying to stay in touch with all of them. They are responsive and all but they don't take the time to reach out to you first by saying a ""simple, hi how have you been?"" That would be nice. It seems a lot of family only come to you when they need something... like if they want to borrow something that you own or borrow a little money (that they never pay back, that is).

Same thing with so-called friends. You try to keep in touch with them constantly so you can keep and hold their interest. They don't allow ya to do things with them unless you ask them if you could come along but they never invite you to anything. Like what I mean is that they never call you up asking you if you want to do something with them but instead they make you do that. Sometimes when you even try to invite a friend to do something with you and hang out, they decline and they use excuses like they're busy when it only takes a little bit of their time to hang out and do something.

Remember this, anybody that neglects you like that is not a true friend and you need to boot them out of your lives asap.

Reply / DM / chat me with your song suggestions and I'll dump them all into a Spotify playlist and listen to them tonight while I get drunk by myself and do jigsaw puzzles.

No judgment, no guidance, no suggestions, no rejections. Whatever you send me, goes on the list.

Thanks friendos! I'm also down for dad jokes and/or trivia questions, or like, whatever you feel like sending or talking about. :)",2022-09-10 23:05:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,,66,/r/lonely/comments/xb2qw6/24f_im_all_alone_on_my_birthday_so_help_me_make_a/,,0,75,"24F - I'm all alone on my birthday, so help me make a playlist"

2062,xb4998,ryan77999,"**Disclaimer:** I should probably let you guys know that I do have Asperger syndrome/""high-functioning autism""/or whatever it's called now. That said, it should not be an excuse for me, as I've heard of many on the spectrum who manage to succeed socially, and besides, I just want to be normal, so I don't want answers like *""This is normal for those on the spectrum, OP! Just accept your fate!""*.

As you can tell from the title, I was a loner all throughout high school, and I didn't know exactly what I missed out on until after I had already graduated. I keep thinking to myself *""What exactly was I doing that was so off-putting to others? If it's my fault for never 'putting myself out there', then how come no one else 'put themselves out there' to me?""*. I actually wish I had been bullied (I was never what you'd call ""picked on"", only excluded and ignored) because it would've helped me learn what I was doing wrong. It's reached the point that I feel there's no point in trying to make friends in university because I didn't have any in high school and that's all that matters; I'm a sucker for consistency.

My psychologist tried to help by saying ""When I was in high school around 30% of the kids I saw were exactly like you're describing yourself; you aren't alone"". Fine, but it doesn't matter that I'm not alone; I need to be part of the majority. I don't care that I'm ""not alone"" because of the fact that there are, at this very moment, 15-year-olds engaging in things like friendship, drama, romance, violence, sex, etc., and that *infuriates* me.

I told her how much i cared about her and how hard i’ve fallen in the time that i’ve known her which has led me to making this reddit post. At the end of the night it was 3 in the morning and i had spilled everything and felt this sudden relief that i can recall from being drunk. Bad thing is, i’ve known the entire time i have had feelings for her that she probably won’t ever have any for me and doesn’t see me that way at all, i just care/like this person so selflessly it’s kinda just tearing me apart.

So this is just me doing a little rant as it was the straw on the camels back as I've been trying to bury how romantically lonely I've been lately..

I always fantasised about being in a committed relationship. I love the idea of sharing inside jokes with someone special and talking about stupid crap into the late hours of the night. I love trying new things even if they're a little daunting or scary, knowing someone's got my back and there to hold me. I love the idea of having those special moments with someone that feel like only you two know about or when you get a cute text from them to let you know they're thinking about you. But the more I want to start a relationship with someone the harder it seems to be and I hate the idea that I'm becoming so emotionally distant from it. 

The worst part is my life isn't even that bad. I've got a decent job and live in a decent flat. I'm socially active and moderately fit and healthy. But when my friends comfort me and tell me how great I am and they're surprised I haven't met anyone already or that'll I'll meet someone soon it just feels like a slap in the face. I feel guilty that I just pretend to accept their compliments when I actually just feel like shit.

I want to try stuff like dating apps but being an average looking guy standing at a mighty 5'5 my odds aren't seeming too hot (from what I've read). I probably will when I get desperate enough that I overcome my fear but urgh.

Right rant over, thanks for taking the time to read this if you made it this far. Have a nice day.",2022-09-11 00:52:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1517503485,4,/r/lonely/comments/xb4yx2/just_feeling_a_little_romantically_lonely_today/,,0,0,Just feeling a little romantically lonely today

2075,xb5alc,Appropriate-Code6035,"Whenever I think of my own life all I can see is someone who is an outsider looking in at everyone else.  It's like I am a window reflecting whatever emotions other people want to assume I am. While I am stuck in place of neither refracting, or expanding my own light source into any other environment I am put into. I am totally stuck in place as a display objects. My only value is when people want to use me as utility to reach their own light. After I am discarded and left by the wayside as my perceived value has always been to them. 

I mean wanting to not be lonely. While also being a naturally reserved person it's a double edged sword that is slowly killing me inside. I have no inclination to put myself out there. But also a strong desire to connect to another soul from within. The contrast is harrowing and leaves me feeling mentally defeated. I struggle to see the point of anything sometimes if everyday is being alone. I don't know how I've come to such an isolationist stance. But reputation of fleeting days, and feeling aimless gets to the best of you.

Without social acceptance I see no reason to do anything.  I mean who doesn't want to be acceptance for who they are. In terms be loved for what they provide to another person. I wish my qualities could be seen from afar. But inside they're hidden inside my own shadow. I'd really like to feel pure happiness. But I've struggled for so long to even feel good. I worry this is my life forever stuck on Internet forms with other lonely people progressing nothing but sadness/despair. 

I've tried to put myself out there. But nothing has ever manifested. I always feel alone in people's company no matter what I do. I need positive examples. I need positive motivation. I need a role model who can inspire me to change. I have no motivation but to decline. Since I have nobody to motivate me to be liked. I feel unlovable. 

I wish I could use a crystal ball and travel back in time to warn my younger self of how much Adult life sucks. But he'd probably be too optimistic to see. As adults we are grown up kids as clueless as ever. But now old enough where the world is being carried on our shoulders. No longer can we be stressed free but stressed inclined. With that added pressure we become prone to meltdowns. I haven't had a mental breakdown in years but I feel it's coming.

When your stuck with so much emotions and you cannot find an outlet. Every time you meet someone they cannot fulfil your needs. So you isolate more inside you room suffering further. This existence is so painfully hurtful for me. I am so dissociated who with I am. I haven't had a friend in real life since high school almost 8 years ago. I am invisible in my workplace as an introverted shy male. I can't manage to meet anyone outside of work. So I live chronically online only suffering in silence behind my pc typing away long texts all day that no one cares about.

2084,xb5uga,Moonetica,"I’ve recently been talking to more people.  Been more social and it’s great. I’m actually not blending into the walls at school for once in my god damn life. For the first time in 3 years I had a genuine, long conversation over message with someone. But I can’t help thinking whenever that whenever that person I’m messaging doesn’t respond fast enough, when they leave the conversation after I sent them something, like right now when they haven’t responded I.. genuinely.. 

I loose. my. FUCKING. MIND.  Seriously. I keep thinking if there was something else I could have said that would have made them respond. That they won’t want to further develop a friendship with me. They will not find me interesting enough. That when I see them at school again they won’t even care. Like I lost my only ever chance at having a friend with the small slip of my fingers. I’m absolutely terrified. 

He’s probably just occupied with something or talking to another friend. Maybe just doing a hobby. But I worry to the point of tears and spiral down so fast. Will you ever initiate messaging with me again? Will you ever look at me? Smile at me? Laugh? Will I ever be in your head? 
Or am I condemned to WATCH. Just to stand on the side and see you and everyone with other people instead of being involved with that because I’m born to be alone? Is it just not the world’s plan for me? 
I think all of this in my mind because of something so MINOR and it’s insane.

But when you broke my heart that night, I lost a lot.

I think I died that night and I am no longer the person I was before.

You walked away, discarded me easily after saying you're emotionally invested in someone else and left me to deal with this pain alone.

I spent years to become the person I believed in. I was fine and happy. Then you came into my life, made my life better but then you destroyed me completely.

I was happy. I was happier when you were part of me. I was the happiest when  I let you be a big part of me. You are still a part of me. But you left and took everything of me with you.

So, I lost a lot that night. I am not sure if I want to heal and recover. If healing means I will be the person I was before meeting you, it also means I am allowing myself to get hurt again. I don't want that. I'd rather shut myself and just try to survive these dark days.

I never want to heal if that means I'll be the person capable of being destroyed again and I have to go through what I am going through right now, one more time.

I lonely!

The shut-in kind of lonely.

I strived for countless friendships… countless connections with many my WHOLE life. Some people I’ve scared away and some people I held nothing in common with. That’s the usual for me.

Tonight I went to a wedding as a guest with my mom. 

I’m 25 this month and have been living with her the last 5!

I am 4 days sober after an intense 1 month long alcohol bender (1 year clean after many years drinking) which ended with super painful withdrawal symptoms. Definitely making my emotional state hell this week.

Going to a social event like this was both stupid and extremely challenging. Especially an open-bar wedding with a cocktail hour. 

I saw these two people my age say their vows and be married. They danced and gave speeches. Blah blah blah. If you know you know. 

It made me feel so lonely that I made a dating profile. 

Then deleted it 2 hours later.

It made me realize that I don’t have that many interests.

I hate movies, I hate TV, I barely play video games anymore, I don’t want to dj, I hate making music. I just want to eat food and be stoned or have a panic attack and try to hurt myself. Watching the bride and groom reminded me of how it felt when I was in love. 

The music was happy and cheery but I literally just wanted to ball on the inside and go home so I can isolate in my bed stoned as FUCK.

I see a doctor and am prescribed medication that has definitely changed my life. I am just so stuck and overwhelmed with my dysfunctional and guilt driven relationship with my mom.

It made me realize how I’ve spent almost 6 years in this state that I only wanted to last for 2. 

Ask me any questions.

2115,xb8vvg,TensionNo6781,"My girlfriend and I separated a year ago. We had a pretty wonderful relationship, a connection both of us remarked on how striking, wholesome, and beautiful it was. She had some self described abandonment trauma and anxiety and a perfect storm of external factors caused her to leave quite suddenly. But, the month after we broke up we hung out almost as normal. September 2021 seemed to make it official, but the last time I saw her in person in October 2021 she said she was so depressed, thought of me all the time, and often wished I was around. I communicated I would do almost anything to preserve our relationship and make it work; as much or as little support as she needed. She remained in her decision to be separate. (She was 27)

This kicked off my year of depression. October 2021 I didn't really leave the house for 3 weeks, and then ended up traveling to central america to try to break out of the funk. I was hit with a tsunami of grief in December, and went back home for the holidays. I started seeing a therapist from mid Dec-February. I again, barely left my house or my room.

&amp;#x200B;

In february 2021 I moved to Canada -- as I needed to spend a certain amount of time here to keep my visa (10 months in total before August 2023.) I live in a big city now (&gt;1 million people) but I am still so lost and lonely. I lost my job in the middle of August, headed back to my hometown to sell my car/see fam, and found out she has a new boyfriend. I reached out in December and May. In December she sent a very interesting message, but didn't want to meet up or talk further.

I lost the woman I love and my favourite adventure partner ever. This whole summer I come home alone, there is no one at my side, and I hate being such a depressive sinkhole to my friends. Now, someone else is living the dream I had (and, I know that is me being jealous, at least the is happy.. but we often talked about a future together and her perhaps coming to Canada for a bit as well). I don't have many friends here and I often think that she was my last and best shot at real love, especially being 31. I cannot even begin to describe how natural, fun, beautiful, intimate, and special our connection was.

I have often thought about giving up. I know my friends and family love me, on paper I am accomplished, but I've been barely hanging on for the last few months. I am tired of life.. I had a good one, travelled to 30 countries, lots of experiences, 2 important relationships, fun and a high ambition. I have lost my spark and only dream of eternal slumber. I just want to go back to the amazing life we shared together, but that is impossible. I don't value the future. I have no plans and drive to do much anymore. I'll never met anyone as attractive or as wonderful as her and all of the memories and things we did, including being absorbed into her wonderful family and community. I love you Sav.

When I get really depressed I just stay home and try to sleep as much as possible, with the help of OTC sleep aids. I hate to be awake, intrusive thoughts, reminders of my solitary, sad existence.

2125,xb9r2h,dannysurrogate,"I think that's really the source of my loneliness.

Forewarning, this post kinda became a stream of consciousness. It's also a bit long, and not completely about loneliness, but I needed some void to about into. Also (19m), if that's relevent? I see some people putting it in their posts so figured I'd do the same.

I think it's harder to ignore this problem now that I've moved cities to a new college where I don't know anyone. Back home I had enough distractions and old happenstance friends that I could kind of ignore my lack of close friendships.

I'm pretty unabashedly open about most things. But I'm realizing recently it's only the socially acceptable things that I'm open about. Anything that I think would lead people to judge me or dislike me, I lock away and throw out the key. The only time I'm ""vulnerable"" is when I'm not actually vulnerable (e.g. an anonymous Reddit post). And I think that really fucks me over.

Namely, I never open myself up to rejection. There are plenty of people I've met that I probably could have been friends with, but never saw again because asking them to hang out would be ""too imposing"". Asking someone if they wanna be friends is me making ""too many assumptions"". 

""If I ask them to [blank], that'll come off as too desperate and I'll push them away.""

^ That dumbass phrase dings around my head, in various forms, constantly when I'm around other people. Leaves me not forming many lasting, or even casual, relationships with people. 

I don't know how to change it. Other than forcing myself to do these things. But fuck that's hard. I don't have much in the way of a support group to help me through it either. 

I'm on good terms with my parents, but they wouldn't really understand and I don't want them to judge me for having these problems. I could open up with old friends from back home but... idk that doesn't feel like an option for some reason. It probably is. I should do that.

The lack of authenticy/fear of vulnerability also really limits my self expression. Like, there are things that I want to do but I don't because I don't want to lose the respect of my family. 

Or if there's something I have a passing interest in, but it could be judged, I kind of just... suppress it. Like, that's awful, but I routinely do it. Probably as some layer of protection against rejection. That way I won't be impacted if somebody judges my interest because its not reaalllyy my interest.

That about wraps it up I think.",2022-09-11 05:01:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662869359,4,/r/lonely/comments/xb9r2h/i_dont_know_how_to_be_authentic/,,0,1,I don't know how to be authentic

I don't cook anymore. It used to bring me peace and joy. Cooking reminds me of you because we used to talk about recipes and cooking. You like to cook too. Now, the thought of cooking petrifies me. It has you written all over it and I am not capable of dealing with the emotions that will crash upon me.

I don't do things anymore. I shared a lot of me to you. I let you in and put you in every part of me and my life. Now everything is tainted.

I don't read books anymore. I shared that important sentiment with you. You love to read too. Now, looking at the books in my house makes me feel like I am living in pain. I am surrounded with books that used to give so much happiness - now, tainted, with  pain.

Remember we read The Plague together at the same time ? I gave the book away because I can't bear to look at it. It pains me too much. Beyond words.

All the things I love doing, I can't do it anymore. It feels bitter and painful just thinking about them. I allowed you into every part of me, and now there is you in everything.

You broke me. Now I can't do things anymore. I am just here, trying to survive the damage and the pain. It has been a week and I don't feel better at all. Even my own body and mind are exhausted.

You said you'd be here as I ""move on"" and deal with the aftermath of this disaster. But you left me. You abandoned me to deal with the pain you refuse to hold accountable to.",2022-09-11 06:15:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654610202,6,/r/lonely/comments/xbazkq/i_cant_do_things_anymore/,,0,1,I can't do things anymore

I have no friends at all except for one who flakes on me pretty often (they’re younger than me with a lot of mental health and relationship issues). I just got a new job, so I have no “work friends.” The only people on my side of the guest list are family, and everyone is least 10+ years older than me.

I’m getting married to the love of my life. This day is supposed to be for us, celebrating our love… Why do I feel like I can’t enjoy it? I’m having the party with dinner, dancing, drinks; my mom even brought up taking the “afterparty” to the casino. I don’t even have anyone at this wedding that isn’t obligated by blood to come.

2165,xbdgcy,Sensitive-Clue-2804,"19M. Originally, I had like 9 or 10 paragraphs about a different topic altogether, but I said fuck it because this is reddit, nobody would care or offer any useful advise.

I've been having a hard time keeping my lid sealed, blowing up into fits of rage because I'm just losing my mind the longer I keep living. I'm losing my fucking marbles because there's nobody to talk to, nobody can or wants to relate, nobody offers insightful feedback, It's just me. I can feel the loneliness dissolving the remaining tatters of my soul as I speak. I burst into sweat-drenched anxiety attacks in public because I feel everyone is staring, everyone's got something smartass to say, everyone is the enemy. Literally me against the world.

I have a few friends, but they spend most of their time with their SO's. And that's another thing; relationships, I hate them. It's probably jealousy, I don't actually know, but what I really feel is left out. Hanging with a good friend is great except when all of a sudden they gotta drop and cancel everything because their boyfriend or girlfriend wants to talk on the phone. I don't have anybody in my life that I put before all others. All the people I have in my life come first. So it just hurts when someone you hold dear just drops you when they get horny or some shit. You probably already guessed I've never dated, but that I really don't care about, it's just an observation.

I was a happy kid my whole life, maybe a darker sense of humor, didn't have the best grades, but I was happy. Until 4 or 5 months before my 18th birthday, I started experiencing my first bouts of actual depression. Felt nothing to get out of bed or go to school, eating was becoming a hassle, showers just seemed to take too long, didn't want to talk to anybody. Everything became so numb I started hurting myself because pain was the only thing I could feel anymore.

Turned 18, left school, went full-time, and got an apartment. Things felt fresh, different, something was going right. Only for a month. Then the symptoms came back like a train. 5 months on my own and I drank a bottle of melatonin and a bottle of Tylenol at once. Survived, and was doing good mentally. Only for another month.

Flash forward one year, where I am now. Can't find work because I can't stand people, blowing up on my friends and family, I just want to die. Nothing in my life has a purpose. I see all the people I went to school with, they're in college, happy, probably gonna start their family in 4 or 5 years. And here I am just slowly going insane wishing I'd die so I don't have to keep up with meaningless bullshit, up late at night pouring my already drained soul into this post that'll likely get washed out by the plenty of people with real problems.",2022-09-11 08:45:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609408333,18,/r/lonely/comments/xbdgcy/talking_to_people_is_just_as_useless_as_they/,,0,3,Talking to people is just as useless as they actually are.

2176,xbeujj,Necessary_Ad_5139,"The thought came to me yesterday. It was about love and whom I love. During mind storming I came to the conclusion that I don’t express love. I have my family, they’re mom, dad and older brother. They’re not bad, mostly good. Each time they say “I love you”, i say the same to response, but there are nothing like that inside of me. Maybe it’s because of social expectations and assumptions that every family member love each other. My brother moved away from our home a month ago, and mom had been telling me that i’m going to miss him. In the reality, i don’t. The most I feel is gratefulness, appreciation. They’re not warm, just as it is. I didn’t fall in love with anyone in 16 years of my life(i’m gay and I don’t meet other boys like me). I felt platonic love for my bestie this summer. Since then I frequently feel shitty after our encounters, cause she’s very sensitive(it’s not her fault, and it’s ok) and any mild stress lead to huge negative reaction. It feels like most feelings may overwhelm her easily. This kinda make me uncomfortable and i really don’t want to offend her. She introduced me to the most of my current friends and supports me.

Now i start from 0 in a foreign country, with language i don't even speak. I'm still in the process of learning the language, and will eventually find a job. I have a new boyfriend, who I am very grateful to have, but he's busy. We meet once or twice weekly when he's available.

Maybe I'm too spoiled, but when I'm alone and he's not with me, I haven't have any close friends yet, and there are days (like right now) when I still miss my ex. I don't wish to go back together with him, but there are too many good memories to simply forget. There are lots of things and activities that remind me of him, and of our good memories together.

Now I'm crying alone in my room, trying to call my family but no one picks up (even if they do, I can't tell them I'm sad because they will worry or laugh bcs being sad and crying is often funny and embarrassing)
Tried to chat my friends with no reply as well. These are the days I feel like the hardest. I hate being lonely, and I have abandonment issue from my past. I can't stop thinking about the future and what if I fail here. Can't stop crying and worrying. What a wonderful night..

Does anyone have any suggestions how to move on from missing my ex? My current bf knows how I miss the memories of my relationship with my ex, but most of the time I tell him not to worry and that I'm not crying, while the truth is that I cry a lot.

I'm doing all those cliche things that people say help from working out, to going on ""solo dates"" and I have other (solo) hobbies and interests that bring me joy. But it's during those moments after coming back from a solo date, or the hours before a planned workout or my hobby time where that loneliness truly hits the hardest. You know, you can't spend every moment of your waking life distracting yourself from your loneliness by doing all the things I mentioned. Eventually you have to exist in that in-between time.

I think a lot of non-lonely people view lonely people (especially those who vent online like me) as being in a perpetual state of wallowing in their loneliness, when for me, that couldn't be further from the case. I find enjoyment in my solace as best I can, and I do my best to live as fulfilling a life as possible in spite of that loneliness.

2201,xbl3ci,CumIzConcreteSemen,"Hi, I’m 23 and I feel super lonely. I am a severe perfectionist and an over achiever. 

I recently moved to a new country and I am struggling to make new friends. It’s not that I haven’t met anyone, it’s just that no one really “clicked” with me.

I am financially stable, I have everything I want but real love.

My past partners often blamed me for being too “broken” so I spent a lot of time in therapy to heal and now it feels like I am too “perfect”??? 

I hate that people think I am stuck up because I feel like such a loser. People just assume I have it all figured it out when it could not be further from the truth.

To fight my loneliness I started working on myself. I thought if I love myself enough I will not feel so lonely.

I bought few plushies to keep me company and learnt how to be kind and gentle with myself.

Now I can say I am comfortable with who I am. I don’t hate myself as much as I used to and I am really starting to love myself.

BUT 

I still have no one. I mean I do have few friends but they are all away.

I just wish I had someone to share my life with.

The only love interest that I have says I am “too good” for him so he rejects me because he is not on my “level” and I am like wtf? Ofc you are

So yeah I don’t know how to make myself more approchable than I already am.

I don’t want people to think I am stuck up when I just want to be friends.

Maybe I bullshit myself and I am a shitty person but even so I don’t mind facing myself to change.

2231,xbrc0g,parz01000101,"I'm very sorry for the long rant ahead:

My family is well off enough to send me to study abroad privately in the UK (from Bangkok originally). The thing is I wasn't so attractive when I was young so I could hung out with a lot of boys without them getting attracted to me. I had always been into computer and science, anime, and video games so I has always been able to get a long with males much better than female (unless they are very nerdy and kind). My mates are the coolest still, sadly, they are all in Thailand, whereas I'm now in the UK.

Puberty hits and I became that hot one, I joined the socialite circle in Bangkok (in my early 20s), partying and spending money away until I realised it was too emptied with stupid dramas. I went back into my shell and started studying my arse off because I really want to become an AI researcher.

I recently graduated with a master's in Machine learning.  I worked as a machine learning engineer and I'm about to start my PhD at the university of Edinburgh in AI.

People think I had it all, but I'm always alone. My Thai friends in London are socialites. I'm the only one doing science. Every time I'm with them it's like I'm wearing a mask, pretending to like what they say about beauty and fashion and gossiping, but in reality, would rather talk about philosophies and other intellectual stuff. I decided to fade away, and they now see me as a stuck up person. I wasn't, I'm just mentally drained whenever I'm with them. Most friends I grew up with are Finance and business people, so it's out of the question that they understand my passion for AI and cognitive science.

My friends in Edinburgh are Ph.D. students and I truly love them, but they came from different background. They couldn't afford my lifestyle, so I usually go with them, but when I really want to eat something nice, I have to do it alone. When I want to travel, I go alone. I play piano and do photography, so staying home for me is no big deal, but sometimes I wish I have friends with similar interests who could go dine and have afternoon tea with me, or drive with me up to the highlands whenever we feel like it.

The worst thing is, I can't make male friends any more. Every male friend I have made here ended up falling for me, or wanting something more, which makes me extremely sad. I can no longer just hang out platonically and be chill af. I still play dota2 with my friends in Bangkok and that's what keeps me feel a little less lonely, but in the UK, I'm extremely lonely, but I do not want to go back to Bangkok. I'm planning to join the philosophy and mathematics club at UoE to find some friends.

I usually loveeee being alone, but sometime I feel so empty. Without the passion for studying and wanting to find the answer to human intelligence, I think I wouldn't want to keep living anymore because I don't see any more value. I'm not depressed, I just feel it's all an empty loop and we are just all here to kill time before we die. I know I sound spoiled, so I'm trying to study my ass off so I can leave some value and knowledge for the mankind and not make my time go to waste. But god damn, I feel so empty.

P.s. I did have a rough and abusive childhood (me and my parents are cool now), which I'm assuming is the cause of how I can't really connect to people on an intimate level. I have been single for 10 years + now. I'm not sure if a therapist would help.",2022-09-11 19:29:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1542269647,13,/r/lonely/comments/xbrc0g/people_think_my_life_is_perfect_but_im_actually/,,0,5,People think my life is perfect but I'm actually dead and too lonely on the inside

I find that I can only really feel attraction for someone when I've known them for a while and they're one of my closest (if not my closest) friends of the opposite gender.

I wonder what it would be like to actually feel interested in people.

2243,xbss3y,JadedBeyotch,"Thank God for anonymity.

Anyway, today I feel a particular amount of shame and gloom as I sit home, eating way too many ice cream cones and half-ass binge watching television shows while everyone I know leave their homes to gather with friends and loved ones. I already know my soul is going to be eaten up if I dare thumb-scroll through social media so I don't dare open up instagram.  Even still, I feel like and I know I am utter garbage and I want to do and be better.

Ten years ago, when I was a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, hopeful puppy of a teenager fresh out of high school, I drew out (literally) this plan that I would go to university, party and make a ton of friends and connections, and somehow bag a boyfriend and my dream job. My high school years were so rough, I wouldn't wish them on anyone. I suffered from depression because of social anxiety (which I didn't realize was social anxiety at the time), family issues, and, yes, being one of the few black girls in a school that was 93% Caucasian had an effect on how I viewed myself. I used to eat in the bathroom and sweat so bad, I'd sweat through my clothes. It was incredibly embarrassing. Oh and not to mention, I'd say a good 55% of the pretty and popular white girls I went to school with had parents who were doctors and CEOS and shit. My mother wasn't working and had no education and my father was always getting and losing jobs. One girl in particular was very friendly to me but she was one of those people you just knew you could never be best friends with because her social status was already developed and thriving and I was like...nobody. She had her own clique called The Fab Five and they were the athletic, popular AND smart girls who were upper middle to upper class and filled their Facebook timelines with a shit ton of photos that would give them such positive high school memories and strong friendship bonds. She grew up to have a beautiful wedding and a baby and was recently featured in a bridal magazine.  Because of course, sigh.

By the time I was in my junior and mid senior year, I had a few more acquaintances, but it still felt like I was always left on the outskirts. I was never invited to any parties with them or to any of their homes, no football games or any other hangouts. Plus, I was too poor to even have any money to spend with them. I'd beg my mother for her credit card and she'd say ""You can only spend $5.00."" Well, FUCK! A few of my acquaintances would say things like, ""why am I just getting to know you? I wish we had talked years before"" but by that time, Junior year was ending and, unfortunately, in the middle of senior year I had to move out of state due to my parent's financial problems. I completed my final year virtually which meant I was alone for the most part. Once again.

After high school, I made this plan that I would NEVER be that awkward girl I was as a teenager. I would be a social butterfly, beautiful and popular when I got to college. I'd make grades like the Fab Five girls from high school. I'd be beautiful, popular, professional and smart when I landed my dream job too...whatever that was. I had to put high school contacts behind me because a) i was living in a different state anyway and b) everyone else was moving away too c) they were just ""acquaintances."" They never really wanted to hang out with me anyway. Even at the graduation, no one took pictures with me except ONE person. FUCK, man.

What transpired over the next ten years was brief homelessness, a series of shitty jobs (must have inherited that curse from my father...), a shitty degree I can't even use and shitty people who leave more often than stay in my life. Let me reiterate that its been TEN years of shitty people coming and going in my life as if I'm some sort of revolving door. I've developed a distrust at this point. Its like, ""why even be friends with me when you act like the only reason to talk to me is out of curiosity or because you want something and when you can or can't get it, whatever that may be, you stop talking to me?"" Fuck....

So now, nearly thirty, my life is just me and not filled with anyone else. I wake up before all the 9-5ers, I work, then I come home and eat in front of the television and just kind of...work on myself. I have more hobbies than friends, which I guess is to be expected, and I'm working on self-employment because I guess I'm thinking the best revenge on my shitty life is my ""paper"" (I mean, that's kind of what Beyonce said and it works for her anyway, so...). Tuh.

No one is beside me at night and if I died, only four people would come to my funeral: my mother, my dad and my two siblings. I am 100% certain of this. The pain and silence is becoming unbearable. I think that is why I have resorted to eating hamburgers, donuts and icecream cones for the last two months. Literally, it's been those three foods all freaking day. 

I am not pretty and I am not successful enough to be friends with the people I thought I could be friends with. In the last ten years I have been emotionally hurt by others I thought were my friends. I knew someone for seven years before I realized it was only ME doing the planning, calling or texting. So one time I waited just to see if she would contact me, you know, like THINKING about me 'cause thats what friends do. AFter several weeks, she did not and I felt anxious. I'd call her and apologize for not contacting her and she'd tell me ""Well, you get back whatever you put out."" Another time after I tried to wait and see if she would initiate contact, she texted me out the blue with ""are you my friend on my enemy?"" Eventually, I decided to just say fuck it. If she wanted to spend time with me, she'd put in some effort and I stopped being ""the initiator.""

In another instance, I was friends for several months with a coworker who I considered like my little sister (our age difference was probably like 6-7 years apart). We were planning to hang out when I received a text that said: ""Hey, I'm sorry but I can't really be friends with you anymore. I'm just really busy. Sorry and I hope you understand.""  I was STUNNED and cried but texted her anyway: ""its ok. I'm here whenever you need me.""

A few months later, I met someone online and we were friends for nearly a year and sent each other things in the mail, shared our dreams and encouraged each other through covid and shitty jobs until ONE infamous day there was a huge discussion on social media I shared with her and asked for her opinion about it.  Turns out we had differing opinions and she became really heated about the subject, so as not to offend her I just dropped the subject. It was late anyway so I figured we could talk about something else tomorrow.  I sent her a text about the Thor: Love and Thunder movie the next day or two and she replied. On Mother's Day, which was literally like 2-3 days later, I sent her an e-card via text and told her happy mother's day.

She didn't respond. 

I waited for a few days but she never responded to any of my texts after that. the days turned to weeks then months and then I realized she wasn't going to talk to me anymore over a TWITTER topic. Not to mention, in the past she has completely changed the topic whenever I brought up something she didn't like or agree with, but its a problem when I do it?

I've been stood up by a previous coworker with no explanation and in the case of another I was super close with, she invited me to her church and we would have lunch together outside of work but literally RIGHT after she got married she completely stopped talking to me. Again with no explanation.

Over the years friendships with former classmates, coworkers and people in general have faded and after so many times of people being like ""Yes, Bestie! I love you!"" then turn around and ghost me I've become so fucking reclusive and I absolutely hate it. So I tried to look over the patterns of what went wrong in my relationships and thought well, maybe I should have more male friends rather than female friends, but that turned into me experiencing nearly severe sexual harassment and for the first time almost being stalked by some dude I thought was like a brother to me. So then I thought, well maybe its the AGE of my friends, so I befriended a few individuals in their 40s and early 50s. That turned into me being scared I would end up old and stagnant as they were as they expressed their regrets to me and I felt they were also growing jealous of the fact that I'm younger and hadn't made too many serious mistakes (that they know of anyway...) and ""had plenty of time.""

I tried the whole online thing and found out painfully that women get seriously harassed by men and I also have this concern, due to experience, that the person I meet online might secretly be some sexual deviant or another stalker. One guy I met was a freaking drug dealer (!!!) and the other guy was extremely possessive. 

So here I am, ten years later, thinking what the fuck went wrong and how my plan to not be the loser who sits home all day, looking ""homely"" and being lonely, scrolling through instagram pictures to live through vicariously, completely fell apart. Covid and monkeypox made it worse but even still my social life has always been in shambles. My brother is surrounded by people and has the perfect instagram-like life and social circle and I just get so jealous when he talks about how his friends support him and invite him to gatherings. I look at simple things like tailgate parties, dinners, road trips and having house parties and be like....""how the fuck do you get those?"" it hurts me so bad, I just numb myself with food and television. I don't really cry about it anymore.

I am asking for serious answers only. If anyone would like to give some advice or constructive criticism, I'm open to it. I won't consider harsh attitudes or trolling. If you've read this whole story, geez, you are a trooper!

I hope the title isn't too misleading but it kinda means what it says. Problem is I don't have friends for years now and every now and then when I can't handle it anymore feeling extremely lonely my mind is just like 

""well yeah you don't have friends but you really don't have to wonder being as boring as you are. Everything you do basically is working, coming back home only to watch YouTube or play video games for the rest of the day and usually you even mostly play single player games on your own. You have no special interests or hobbies besides that and very few stories to tell so even if someone tried to talk to you it would be over really quickly since you don't know what to talk about. You basically have nothing to offer what makes a friendship or even a relationship interesting, you can't even comfort someone if he's sad since you're emotionally overwhelmed and can't talk from experience in most cases.""

Some would say this is extremely pessimistic but if you hit me with this even when I'm not in a low I'd agree because I think it's realistic.
I just cant image ever finding friends or even a girlfriend like that... I literally have nothing to offer except... Being around and caring more for the other person than the other person probably cares for me.

I don't want comfort... I just want to know if you think it's realistic for me to find friends like that or not.",2022-09-11 20:56:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654229121,64,/r/lonely/comments/xbthee/am_i_boring/,,0,110,Am I boring?

For the first week I was the only one who moved in and as ""lonely"" as I felt, having my own place was liberating. Coming back to an empty place was so peaceful. Whether or not my apartment was clean, up to me. Whether there was food to eat, up to me. Whether I had clean sheets and clean clothes, completely up to me. I loved that. 

But since my apartment-mates have shown up, being there just feels stifling. I don't even really enjoy managing my own things anymore because now it feels like I'm managing around other people.

Maybe it's cause I'm not close to them. It's not like there's really any drama or anything. My brain just can't relax.

My only thought is that maybe I sort of subconsciously police myself around other people and that starts to take its toll. Idk.

I even had more energy to force myself into social situations. I was striking up conversations with random people in my orientation group, I met up with some random people online to play a board game (I didn't follow up with any of them, but that's its own issue).

I’m so tired of not feeling wanted. I’m starting to feel like none of my friends really care about me and how I feel, I mean my one friend Hunter would ask me how my day was or if we’re calling he could tell I’m off and he would ask how I am but recently Hunter and his boyfriend Jason got into an argument about me because Hunter would apparently pay more attention to me but he was just caring for me because he knew about my depression and Jason being my best friend he practically told Hunter that he didn’t want him talking to me as much so he’s acting different and I feel like he doesn’t care about me anymore and I feel like I’m losing both of them.

Random note but Jason was my best friend first and then he started dating Hunter, when he introduced me to Hunter we’ve become really close and I could tell him anything and everything and we would talk 24/7 unless he was having private time with Jason which I would respect, so it really hurt when they started talking to me less.

Ever since they’ve got in that argument my depression got worse because before I would be on the phone with both Jason and Hunter but since the fight they’ve stopped adding me to the call and it really hurt because talking to them would make me happy and feel good. My depression symptoms got 10 times worse and I’ve been fighting it alone since I literally have no one else to talk to, I mean Jason and Hunter would text me here and there but it would be about random shit and there were some days when I wouldn’t text them first and I wouldn’t receive a text from them all day which would make me upset because to me it shows that they don’t care anymore but they would text me when they need me or to complain about their problems but when I do it, it seems like they don’t care.

EDIT: I’m sorry if some parts are random, not said correctly, or if I repeat things because I’m so bad at explaining stories.

2293,xbyxm6,moviegoer06,"(Sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes, I wrote this in a rush)

Back in middle school, I used to watch this art youtube channel. It was this lady who didn't really show her face, and all I knew about her was her voice, name, and hair color. I never had romantic feelings toward her. But then after a while, I guess because I was watching her videos so much, a younger version of what I imagined her to look like showed up in my dream. She must've been my age in this dream, and I guess she was my girlfriend. It was a weird dream, one where I was getting ready to save the world or something. So before I had to leave, we sat at this table, nothing around us at all, and I kinda laid my head on the table and she was just there, next to me. And I'll never forget that feeling of complete trust, and being so relaxed next to someone. Then I went to save the world, and I woke up. 

I remember being just so devastated when I woke up, because in real life I could never have something like what I just felt in my dream. I had to draw her as well as I could, and I wrote down the dream, to never forget her. That was the first dream where I believe I actually felt *love.*

And the second dream came to me last night. I wrote down what happened so fast so the story might feel rushed. And here's some backstory. Lately with rumors of a new paramore album coming out, I've been watching so much Hayley Williams and Paramore content. I have a huge crush on Hayely. So here's the story I wrote down this morning. I was making a band, at my Grandparent's house with my cousins. Then, the band was shooting a MV a my school, and out the hallway windows was a body of water. And Hayely williams was shooting the MV there. So I guess I made paramore. I looked out and she waved at me. I waved back. She made some hand signal. I gave her a thumbs up. The shoot went on, and later, she urged me and the band members to jump out the window into the water. Some other guy went first (no longer my cousin), and then I went. I said you guys have to save me, or something, because I was scared I would drown. I jumped with my tube. Pretty good jump. We all had fun. Then we climbed up a ladder, but me and hayley saw two tubes still up on the hall (which was no longer a hall), so she went to grab the closer one but I grabbed it first and threw it down, and it went in the water, not the shore. We laughed, and she went to get down the ladder, and I went for the other tube which was on the other ladder. Then I woke up.

This hurts so much because of my huge crush on Hayley, and because the laugh we shared felt so close to me but I know I'm the only one who knows about it. Hayley doesn't know about me, and even if she did we would never hang out. Because of the age difference. And I can't even meet anyone like Hayley, because I don't live in America anymore. So that was the second dream where I felt *love.*

The funny thing is, I really don't care about getting a girlfriend in real life. And I'm not just saying that as an excuse, I really don't care. I hate the people around me. I have never felt anything close to real love in real life. Just shallow crushes and attraction. The only place I can go, for now, is my dreams. And that kinda sucks.",2022-09-12 00:54:10,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645434572,3,/r/lonely/comments/xbyxm6/i_only_ever_feel_love_in_my_dreams/,,0,0,I only ever feel love in my dreams

2305,xc015l,SpiteFuelled,"Hi, I'm 19F living in the UK. My high school sweetheart and I recently broke up. Just before uni we gave each other promise rings, lost our Virginities to each other, but the long distance at uni was a lot harder than we thought. After a year of trying our best, and with no support from family who think we're too young to be travelling to see each other and getting distracted from studying, we decided to give up recently. 

I feel so empty and lonely like I can't speak to anyone. My life was him, I had many acquaintances but none I can reach out to randomly. 

Physical intimacy was already hard for me after I was assaulted once so me and my high school sweetheart waited for a while, and were friends for long before that. A male at university told me my expectations were too high and most guys would not wait at university if I'm not a virgin. Im so so so desperately scared of being used again (not my ex but because of the sexual assault) that I've completely withdrawn from social activities, especially places where men may try to talk to me.

This has made me miss my ex so much more, and I'm constantly remembering how sweet and kind and what a good person he was. I truly respected him so much and I'm so scared that this is it for me. I experienced all the goodness of the world when I was young and now I'm going to grow old and never experience anything like this again cuz I'm letting my fear rule me.

I thought reaching out to make friends online would be the best bet as I'd feel safest. I'm going into second year uni, I watch anime, I like cooking and im getting a little into the gym since signing up to a women's only gym near me.

TL;DR 

I hate that I still think about it but I do,   

I’m (25M) and I met my first love when I was 15.   I was really big into the whole “Scene kid” thing when it was just loosing popularity or at least that little branch that poped up around warped tour bands like Asking Alexandria, Sleeping With Sirens and bands like that that were popular around 2012/ the early 2010’s.  

Part of the fun in the scene was that everyone was just now getting hyperfixated on internet culture in a time where MySpace was dead and people kinda wanted more options to meet people online other than Facebook or Pre Snapchat/ Instagram or anything like that.  I didn’t have a lot of friends at school that were into the scene or friends in general.   

I grew up in special needs classes because I was on the spectrum and I always felt like I couldn’t be myself around people because everyone kinda looked at me like I was weird or annoying so meeting people online that were into little niche community’s was a godsend.  

Meetme/Myyearbook was the main one I used and I would post on there pretty regularly.   It was really easy to be my normal wierd self on there and I felt like most people that were in the scene kinda had a “hyperactive internet kid” vibe that I really clicked with.   Everyone was pretty over the top and the fashion behind it kinda reflected that.  

There was definitely a underlying code that if you dressed like a scene kid or we’re into The bands you probably we’re pretty hyper and a lot friendlier to talk to than anyone I went to school with. 

(I’m from the south, everyone down here fits into that typical right wing redneck church conservative stereotype)  I ended meeting this girl whose username was a reference to one of my favorite bands Isetmyfriendsonfire. 

I thought it was really cute so I shot her a message and we clicked pretty fast. She wanted to be a cosmetologist and she always had a really ironically reactive sense of humor that I liked.  I’m a pretty Himbo “Say stupid shit to make people laugh” kinda guy   (If anyones Into MBTI I’m an ENFP and I fit into the stereotype pretty hard)  

At the time I would do that a lot because I want to people like me but she would always react to it as if it was the funniest thing she’s ever heard but in a “WHAT THE FUCK, THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING IVE EVER HEARD” kinda way.  Kinda like the whole Cosmo &amp; Wanda dynamic thing.   She was the first person that ever thought I was funny or quirky and not wierd because I was very obviously autistic.  

She’d play along with my jokes, I use to say typical dumb scene kid shit like “RAWR XD IMMA STEEL YOUR CHICKEN NUGGY” and she’d come back to it with something like  “NUUUU Imma Bonk you on the head with my fries if touch my nuggies :c”  
Cute shit like that, A big part of me misses when people talked like that on the Internet, it was really fun for 15 year old me especially with the whole *Does___* rp trend thing going on.  

I’d had girlfriends before but mostly those Early “we met in math class and I think your cute you wanna hold hands &amp; kiss in the hallway for like a week” kinda “relationships” but this was the first time I ever met someone I really connected with beyond being in the same school/ friend circle. First time meeting someone that liked the same things as I did, And the First someone ever told me they loved me.  

I’m from AL &amp; she lived in AZ so we’d always talk about how we wish we could be together for real and not just over the phone/internet.  
A lot of my friends made fun of me and joked that she was probably a pedo because we didn’t FT or Skype so she made a video for me to post on my Facebook of her being like  “Hi I’m *Insert name here* aka *insert scenekid nickname here* I’m a real and I love *insert my name here* with all my heart so yeah suck on that”   

She gave me a call one day and told me that she had talked to her mom and she said that if we stayed together long enough she could come visit for the summer.  We started talking pretty regularly about our plans for life, bands we wanted to see and what we do the minute we saw each other.   

I had it pretty rough in school and Id talk to her about how alone I felt pretty regularly and she’d always comfort me and tell me to “wait for summer”  Eventually she calls me and tells me that when she comes to visit she wants to get emancipated and run away together.  

I asked her if she wanted to get married and she said nothing else in the world would make her happier.   I started saving my allowance money for a plane ticket and spent most of my time convincing my mom to let her live with us.  

Definitely added a lot of stress to our relationship and I could tell that things getting serious like that was starting to feel “Too real” for her.  She started not texting as much and being kinda distant so I got really suspicious.  

I started snooping around and talking to her friends and found out that she had been telling them that I was just some “Wierd dude on the internet that “thinks we’re dating” and that she had a reputation for doing that with a lot of guys because she got swarmed with dudes online telling her how “In love with her” they are and she didn’t wanna “Break their hearts” and that she was “dating them as a joke” She said I was the worst and me talking to her about my problems like bullying or depression or Autism was “me trying to make her feel bad for me” so that’s why she stayed.  

When I found this out like any other 15 year old kid I was pretty upset and I blew up and said a lot of extremely hurtful shit because I thought I was justified. 

She blocked me and I spent about a year crying over it processing that everything I thought was real wasn’t.  I was angry, depressed &amp; just generally heartbroken.  

I thought I met someone that really cared about me but I found out she was just pretending to love me.   Eventually we reconnected and it was as awkward as you’d think, I felt bad for the way I reacted and I kept telling her how sorry I was but she never did. Not once.  I wanted to stay friends but We grew apart  and lost contact.   

I saw her pop up a few times and tryed reaching out to see how she was doing, she told me she didn’t wanna talk and that was that.  

I haven’t spoken to her in years but I still see her pop up every now and then, I try my best to ignore it but a big part of me always wants to look her up and see how she’s doing.  

I never stopped thinking about her. I don’t love her anyone and I don’t wanna get back together.   

But I’ve thought about her every day for 10 years, compared every relationship I’ve ever been in to her.  I’ve been in better and worse relationships since her but nothing compares.  And it makes me feel dumb for still thinking about it when I don’t want to.

2316,xc1ci8,emotothextrem0,"Hey there! 22f aaaaand this sad story is my first ever post to Reddit lmao. 

Lately, I’ve been feeling such strong emotions that I haven’t experienced in years. This includes low self worth, unwelcome and unwarranted anger/rage, depression, and thoughts of unaliving myself (not sure if the big S word is allowed). I’ve also felt that everyone in my life dislikes me or thinks of me as a burden. I know this can’t be true. I have a supportive family and a loving boyfriend who I can turn to if needed. My boyfriend and I are long distance, which means we mainly communicate via text or phone call. I’ve spoken to him about my feelings a few times, but no matter how often he reassures me, I just feel empty inside. I don’t want to be an emotional burden to him. 

I’m in a very rigorous college program and have clinicals 4 days out of the week, work the other 2, and have one day to myself that I truly use to catch up on homework and studying. I just feel like I have no time for myself. I don’t even have time to enjoy hobbies I once did or even relax and watch netflix. If I happen to have time, and give myself those precious few hours to myself then I suffer from debilitating academic guilt and won’t even enjoy myself. 

Unfortunately, with my busy schedule I haven’t had time to be a good friend to anyone. I can’t have my phone at the clinical site so I’m MIA most of the morning and midday. When I do have time to reply I feel as though I’m always rain-checking or plans interfere with my already busy schedule. I feel so shitty about that, and I miss seeing and spending time with my friends. I managed to have a weekend free a while ago and went to the lake with my best friend. We got in a massive fight over some personal topics. Things haven’t been the same since which really fucking sucks because I truly only have one close friend besides my boyfriend. I cannot be solely reliant on him for attention and friendship. He also is an introvert and sometimes doesn’t have the social battery to speak as often as I’d like. 

I just feel so lonely and unbalanced, and I don’t know what to do. I understand sacrifices are made for higher education, but I feel so isolated right now and I’m afraid of my current emotional and mental states deteriorating even more than they already have.",2022-09-12 02:50:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650454626,3,/r/lonely/comments/xc1ci8/in_search_of_balance/,,0,7,In search of balance

2322,xc2278,105654,"Some time ago I finally felt brave enough to confess to my crush. I had a plan, we were going to see the Batman movie together, then have some ice cream after. Well, the ""date"" was great, we had a few laughs, saw a good movie, had ice cream and talked like a real couple, except my anxiety didnt let me express myself, so I ended up not asking her to be my GF like I wanted, but it was ok for me, I loved that night, and so did she (at least she told me).

The next day, we were late night texting, and I ended up confessing for real, I was so...nervous, my heart was pounding and I knew I was sweating, the 4 mins she took to answer were the longest 4 mins of my life...then...she answered...

She said that, even tho she thought I was messing with her, she indeed liked me back, she said she had loved me for some time. And that night, my friend, I felt so happy, I felt like I was floating, I was smiling alone in my room, like a dumass. Later that night, she said she needed to sleep, so I said good night.

Next day, I texted her first thing in the morning...but she only answered 3 days later, then I replied immediately...and she took 3 more days to reply....and it kept like that for 3 weeks, until she just stopped replying in general...and its been 3 months and still no reply.

2329,xc2kpx,tenebris_deus,"If she were born 10,000 years ago things would have been very different. In those days she would have been part of a tribe and there would have been a place for her and little time for self-reflection and introspection. Civilization changed all of that in the cosmological blink of an eye. Almost overnight, millions of years of evolution were replaced with corporate deadlines, emails, text messages, and confusing cultural rules and regulations. 

It wasn't enough just to survive to see another day. That didn't even rise to be an afterthought. 

And so she found herself alone in the prison of her own mind. Unlike her ancestors, she had no tribe with a shared mission to survive and pass on their genes. It was mostly strangers adrift just like her with feelings of confusion and self-doubt. It didn't occur to her that she was fine tuned for another time and another place. And that cultural changes that came alongside agricultural and technological innovation didn't consider the biology of humans or the sad girl sitting alone in front of her computer in an apartment. 

All she wanted was to be loved, and it was this thought that drove her to madness.

There were things about her to love: the desperation in her voice. The tireless persistence by which she sought her own self-destruction. It was like watching a suspenseful hostage negotiation where the victim and perpetrator were the same person.

“You deserve to die.” She would whisper to herself at night. “I’m just waiting for the right moment.”

I wanted to rescue her and let her know that most of her feelings were a rational response to an incredible amount of change in a short span of time. I wanted to tell her that nobody really fits in and we’re all simplifying these transformations down to base levels and that the need for love distills it down to the lowest common denominator.

In her hostage negotiations with herself she only had that one demand. She could survive without purpose and meaning, but she could not survive without love. 

I sent her a scripture verse that reminded me of her, “If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn’t love others, I would have gained nothing.” I Corinthians 13:1-3

In a perfect world the words would have been spoken by someone holding her hand and looking into her eyes, but the world was so far from perfect that it fell upon a stranger. And so I wrote to her, “You’re loved. I love you. If I didn’t love you I would never have gone to this effort to reach you. It’s because your loved that I am here and that I write this story.”

And when she read those words she wondered if they were truly meant for her. Did the universe really hear her cries and reach out to her? Or was it all just a crazy coincidence. 

“Goodnight sweet princess.” I said out loud and typed directly into the story. And then went to bed, thinking of the girl with the lonely heart.",2022-09-12 03:53:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1662949516,5,/r/lonely/comments/xc2kpx/the_girl_with_the_lonely_heart_by_howl_house/,,0,0,The girl with the lonely heart.

I grew a beard because of some insecurities about my jaw highlighted by some ex friends in June - I practically unhinge it at all times now, giving myself perpetual migraines. It’s been weeks since I’ve talked to someone outside of an academic  context. My family told me that it was unbelievable that I wouldn’t shave daily, telling me I look sleazy and unprofessional, and I know that in my career path I likely can’t have it if I plan to live another decade. Unfortunately I can’t shave it now, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to.

Writing this, I can see how pointless it all sounds, but to me, my entire waking existence hinges upon it. I can’t go 30 minutes without ducking out of the lab to stare at myself in the mirror and frantically adjust myself. I can’t go 30 seconds without yet another thought piercing through everything else in my view. The best I can do to resolve the stress is a myriad of drugs, which I suffer from greatly, but I look forward to using each and every sober moment I have (9-5). Biggest side effect is intense shame, but I guess I consider it a trade off. That’s a whole thing on its own.

I’ll stare long enough that I turn into a faceless nothing. It’s agonizing. I envy people who don’t ride a perpetual loop in their mind.

My names Jared, I’m 20 and I’m from the little island known as New Zealand
For the past 4-5 I’ve been really suffering with depression and anxiety with this year being the hardest. It’s this year that I attempted to take my life, but it didn’t work. Since then, I haven’t had my issues reach that limit again, but I am still dealing with wanting to end it, scars on my wrist, and major depression. My parents are here for me which I am happy to have but I feel horrible whenever they have to stop doing what they are doing to help me, I always feel like I’m making everyone else’s life harder. I’m taking antidepressants, a different one this time as the first didn’t work. At least my psychiatrist said I have major depression and anxiety. I’ve always been quite a shy person, I went to an all boys high school which was hell, everyone there was a bully, and they were ruthless aswell. I’m currently unemployed, I did have a job but had to leave due to its environment being too overwhelming, I’m not good in large crowds, I tend to have panic attacks whenever I am around one. So I usually stay at home, in my room alone and bored. I do have a few friends that are understanding of what I go through but I don’t hang out with them much as they also work. I’m always thinking about how lonely I am. Not in a romantic way, more as I just don’t want to be the only presence in the room. But everyone I try to talk to either ignores me or is mean. 
I’m sorry to be talking about this but I just needed to get it out, and when I found this subreddit, I thought maybe I could meet people who are similar, I don’t judge people, I like to be there for people when they need it, like me

2380,xccj4x,RedditAccount1811,"I (M26) grew up being bullied and with very strict parents that didn't really allow me to socialize much. I used to escape from the world by playing video games 12 hours a day. 4 years ago I landed a good job and moved to a new city. I took this opportunity to attempt to turn my life around and start living in the real world.

For the past 4 years I have worked so hard on myself with a goal of becoming happier and achieving a fulfilling social life and a girlfriend. I started working out 5-6 times a week, eating healthier, picked up new hobbies, working hard on improving my social skills and reducing my social anxiety.

4 months ago I finally built up the self-esteem to try dating apps for the first time. I had some good pictures taken and felt confident going in. The results were sadly not good and I went 3 months with barely any matches and no dates. But 1 month ago I got a match that actually messaged me first! It was like an angel sent to rescue me, she was actually interested in me! We talked daily for about a week before I built up the courage to ask her out. And she said yes! Keep in mind that this is the first date I had ever been on, and I was a kissless virgin.

The first date was great, we spent 6 hours doing various activities around town and the chemistry was good. 2nd date was the week after and I got my first kiss. A week after that I asked her on a 3rd date at my place. I picked her up on Saturday and expected her to go home that night, but she decided to sleep over (no sex) and stay until Sunday evening! We spent the whole weekend cuddling on the couch, laughing and going on long walks while holding hands. It was like I was in heaven for a weekend.

Monday came around and it was like I had woken up from a dream. She seemed more distant while texting and took longer to respond. I kept it chill and only texted 1-2 times a day. I didn't want to seem desperate or like I put her on a pedestal. The next weekend was approaching and I asked her out again. She first gave me a cryptic response, before finally telling me that it wasn't going to work out and I wasn't ""her type"". I asked kindly for a better explanation, as I really thought we were doing amazing, but she wouldn't give it.

I was crushed and still am. I finally thought that I had found someone that cared about me and actually wanted to be with me, only to have my hopes stomped on. 

I feel like I'm the main character in a ""The Truman Show"" type setting, but everyone is told to keep the fuck away from me. I really do not know what I'm doing wrong or what vibe I'm putting out that makes it so hard for me to attract girls or get (close/good) friends.

2385,xcdktk,venting__machine,"4 years ago, there was hope. I was lonely but I had hope. I used to be around people even if I wasn't close to any of them. I thought maybe one of those people I would become close to; maybe have a girlfriend as well.

Now, I don't know what I want. I hang out once in a while with friends, just like what I imagined back then. I'm not close to them but its isn't like before when the only route I took was to school and back. But I'm not happy. I guess it's because I know what will happen in the future after I graduate from college. These people I hang out with, will forget me. I would be again a miserable person who sits in his room the whole day with 0 friends. Then, I'll probably look for a job (not that I have a hope of getting one), or maybe go for further studies, and the cycle will continue. 

The last time a girl said she likes me I noped out by ghosting her. I didn't want to drag someone through this miserable road. I regret hurting her.

When the hope of a pretty future started to disappear, I thought maybe I can do good in my academics. Maybe I can become a professor in the subject I loved. As a side effect, I probably would be around people as well.

2 years later, I am struggling to study. Loneliness has eaten up what I love as well. I don't see anything in the future. I don't know what I have to do to make the pain go away.

2392,xcejgs,water_war,"I am an average-looking, Asian man living in Europe. I have good hygiene, and a successful career. I am hard working, respectful, caring and kind person. But I am average looking and have an average personality.

From the outside, my life looks pretty normal. Nobody can imagine I will be so lonely or so struggling. But let me tell you nobody wants anything to do with me when it comes to love/sex.

Number of times I had hookups in my whole life: **0**

Number of relationships I had in my life: **0**

I am never good enough for anyone. I feel totally like an outcast. The city I live in is infamous for its hookup culture. Since I am average looking, my friends think I might be getting some action. I also travel a lot as a digital nomad, so they only see the nice thing about my life, but never how depressed or lonely I am. Many of them want to trade lives with me because they think my life is so glamorous.

But they don't realize how challenging dating life is. Nobody ever sees me as a potential partner. I just hate it so much. I feel I live in a parallel society. My life is so different from everyone around me. I just wish to join society and experience love/sex/life. I don't want to be an outsider forever.

Like what I did to deserve it. I don't understand why everyone is so repelled by me. 

I am working on my personality, grooming and whatever. I don't intend to get plastic surgery (I don't approve of it except in extreme cases), but I promise to take revenge on this world by being the best version of myself.

So I've been thinking a lot and I've realised that i don't even need a girlfriend. I'm not even lonely coz i enjoy solitude. The only reason I was so down bad to be in a relationship was because everyone else around me is in one or has been in one before. The truth is i never want to be in a relationship bc of the commitment and responsibility. Ig i just wanted a reason to blame someone for my own failure of not being motivated enough to make something of my life.

2417,xcibcu,SnooApples5457,"  

This is more of a rant I think, but let’s see how things go. I see a lot of people talk about loneliness post some event, be it moving or a breakup or friendships dying down. While I think there is a lot to be said about that style of loneliness, it’s not often that people speak about the loneliness of life in general. For those living an ordinary life, working a 9-5, ect. When you wake up, you go about your daily tasks of starting the day. Shower, eat, maybe watch the news or a Youtube video. When you are on the bus or Subway, you’re surrounded by others who are also going to work doing something similar if not the same thing as you. While you have this in common, what meaningful conversation is there to be had? You don’t lose anything from conversation, but you also don’t gain anything, so it becomes something that happened. You had a conversation with a stranger on the way to work about something. Afterwards, you leave and arrive at the office. A coworker talks about something their kid said the night before. Someone mentions their new puppy. You mention chatting with the stranger. It all feels like idle conversation to pass the time. Then outside of work, you go to a barbeque your neighbors are having. People talk about events that have very little meaning or impact in the grand spectrum of life. You come, eat, socialize, then leave. Nothing really gained, but nothing really lost either. 

When viewed in the lens of “this is a one-time event” there isn’t an impression of loneliness. However, most things are like this. The popular movies coming out have overwhelming style, but they don’t feel personal. They’re made for most people to enjoy, like someone talking about what their kid said or what their dog did. It’s entertaining to hear that Jim’s dog named Bill walks into their room at 6 AM every morning and jumps on Jim to wake him up. Then the conversation ends and you move on with your day, maybe chuckling when remembering Jim's story or maybe not. You watch a movie, think “that was an entertaining movie” and then go home and go about the rest of your day without really thinking about the movie again. So many things feel like it’s just passing the time. There isn’t a real tangible connection, though. There isn’t some sort of strong feeling towards another person of “This person means something to me. They bring value into my life.” Maybe surface level relationships are enough for some, but I often find myself questioning that. Is it a waste of time? Energy? Is it worth the effort to come up with a story others will find entertaining for a few seconds then most likely forget? If you need human interaction, is this type of relationship going to satisfy that need?

I know relationships are something you create and build on over time, but how do you know that in x amount of time your relationship will be deep and meaningful? Are you in a position where you can risk using all that time and energy only to fail in the future? I think this may be my fundamental reason for being lonely. It isn’t that I have nobody to do activities with. It’s that relationships that are common offer no substance, making me wonder why I am putting in effort when nothing is being received in return. I’m not even entirely sure on what I mean by nothing is being received. I guess I just don’t feel like I’m getting anything out of the relationship. Enjoyment is something, but since it’s not unique to the relationship is that enough to keep the relationship going? Maybe I'm not seeing this correctly or I think about this too much, I don’t know. Anyone have any thoughts or something to add?",2022-09-12 17:08:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1598023872,1,/r/lonely/comments/xcibcu/all_style_no_substance/,,0,0,All Style No Substance

But this is happening more and more often and every time I'm forced to look at this world outside of my hobbies I feel so empty and don't see any reason to go on.

Now i have got a bunch o friends by i got only two that are closer to me. My fear is that when i will finish my school i will be alone with no one to talk to.

But still sometimes i have feeling that tells me that im nothing I'm gonna die alone i will have no friends and no soulmate,(i was with girl like a month and then she broke up with , she said i haven't spoken with her much and it doesn't work) the thing that intensifies that feeling is that i don't have got too many girls in school for example in my class is only one girl and she is not in my type. And about the work im worried that my only life is gonna be work that im gonna go back from work very late and will never have time for myself and for friends(if I will have any...)

The world is not to blame for your problems. You have your problems, and those issues are challenging. But you are responsible for those problems, not everyone else. Being sociable is a learnable skill, being friendly is not hard, and being shy is something you *can* overcome. Fake it until you make it, if you must. I’m lonely too, but I’m also actively trying to do something about it, and I’m able to recognize that this is a me problem. I’m 2200km from all my friends, I have no one here. I have a job and I try to make friends there. There is no failing without trying, and there is no success either. 

Also, to speak on conventional attractiveness, just because you aren’t attractive in the way society deems you must be, doesn’t mean you’re unattractive. You’re worth more than what you think, and as hard as it is to believe, you’re also responsible for those feelings of worthlessness.

He said ""If you had just agreed to take a break, I wouldn't have to dump you. I don't miss you and I want space"" But he'd already withdrawn for months and it was too painful to continue.

He was ambivalent for weeks and at one point had texted me in early Sept saying ""Can we talk? I want to work this out I love you"" but then on the phone said ""I just don't want you to hate me."" He had DM'd me twice and sent his brother to text me as well. Felt like he was just checking my temperature. I told him he can't just dump me and come back and he said ""I don't want you back, I just don't want you to hate me."" He told me he ""couldn't be committed to me anymore in the way that he used to"" and that ""I'm telling you this because I love you, you make men feel trapped and no guy is going to want to be with you."" He also said ""I was already over you a long time ago, I just stayed because you can't live without me."" He said ""I want to live my 20's and I want a relationship that takes up less of my time. All of these words hurt me very badly on top of the devastation of realizing my efforts to save the relationship all summer were one-sided / in vain.

I have been maintaining no contact because it's too painful to risk his responses (they were very cold post breakup). I removed him and all his associates on social media (I blocked for a few weeks so I could get some distance without risking more flying monkeys, then unblocked and am leaving it like that, not pursuing further contact).I left him a very loving final message last week after he texted me at 1am saying how he loved me. He never responded to my message. I spoke along the lines of ""I didn't want this, but I hope you are doing better now. I really want us both to be healthy. I'm sorry for how toxic I became, I was reacting to your withdrawal and it broke me. I love you and I believe in you. Don't give up on your dreams for your life,"" etc. Nothing back. I accept it. It's been a very hard month for me, but I love him so much and I want him to be happy even though I can't be a participant in his life anymore.

But this past week, he called me at 2am on Friday night (probably after an unfruitful night at the bars). I desperately wanted to talk to him (he knows this, I tried everything to fix our communication at the end of our relationship) but I never reached out the next day. I figured if he wanted to reach me in any real way he'd reach out again, not at 2am, or he was just calling to dump on me some more.

We had a toxic 1 year relationship where he repeatedly disrespected my boundaries and was increasingly emotionally unavailable as things got more serious from my end and I fell in love with him. The beginning of the relationship he love-bombed me so hard, said I was a soulmate and he could marry me, made me fall in love with him and then once he had me, he gave up.

Can anyone offer some insight on what's going on from his end? Is he going to reach out again? Was he just stringing me along post breakup while he sows his oats?

I had a dream that we finally found each other and start talking again. Just like friends. As if the whole ordeal never happened.

I woke up with a heavy heart. I feel terrible and empty. It is painful - too painful - and I am scared of having to go through the day with this feeling.

I tried going to sleep again but I could not. Not in this restless and anxious state. I wish the dream was real and I did not have to wake up to this awful daytime nightmare.

I wish I never had to wake up anymore. I'd rather live in a dream where we still talk like we used to.

Sometimes I wish we'd stay the same - friends. And no lines got blurred. Well, I wish your feelings were true or never changed.

I am increasing the quality of my life and the quality of others just trying to share a message of lets bring kindness back, smiles are free for EVERYONE and it doesn't cost anything to make someone smile, well it shouldn't at least. I am on a mission to distribute smiles to the broken hearted.

I know people think I live in a fairy tale land but I do believe in the power of ""pass it on..."" So that's what I am trying to do. Just make people smile. A smart person once said, ""A smile is the curve that you need to turn around your day"". I am just trying to make peoples day, again with the people pleasing...

You may see it as a bad thing right now but there may be a day when you recognize its not such a bad thing... Happiness is just a chemical that you have to learn how to hack yourself, because what works for me necessarily wont work for others I get that. And to be honest I am doing what's best for me...

So somebody smart once put this message together and I want to pass it on to you and I hope you pay me back by passing a smile to someone else, because I believe this is a message worth passing on...

""Here's to all the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble makers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see the things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And some will see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.""

Please if you wont do it for me, do it for your loved ones and if that is not enough do it for your self make some one smile today by passing on this message. This will give you a little dose of dopamine that you are looking for.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So much and at the same time so little has happened in the past 5 years and i am almost going crazy.

I was born with social phobia, so it was always extremelly hard for me to talk at all, i literally would freeze out of fear of interacting with people and that ended up making me fall behind in basic socialization skills.

In high school, i had a crush on the popular girl who was very talkative and happened to like me being very silent. She used to talk for hours everyday and i loved listening to it every bit. For every single story or anything at all that she had to say, i would be there to listen attentively.

Of course i could not ask her out, not only because of my social phobia, but also because i simply wasn't the guy for her and i knew that, so i used to help her and be a good friend instead. I helped her feel better when she got dumped, and eventually also helped her choosing a nice boyfriend.

Of course all of that ended up making me incredibly upset, i was literally helping my crush to go out with somebody else. On the last years of high school i was very sad and was not being able to function very well. We ended up losing contact after high school, and perhaps for the better, since she was my crush and all.

Though while in high school, i ended up being left behind and abandoned a lot. I have been forgotten twice in birthdays, and not my birthdays, which nobody ever remembered, i was forgotten on other people's birthday. I helped paying to make a small party for my crush and the girls that organized the party forgot that i even helped. On another girl's birthday, someone was supposed to pick me up at a place and we would go together to the party's location, but that person never came.

I was also left behind many other times and i was always the ""Great listener that you will talk to when you have nobody else to talk to, but will abandon as soon as you see anybody else"".

I always tried helping other people first and being the good person you want to see more of, instead of simply waiting for it. Even when i created this account for Reddit, it was supposed to be for ranting and asking for help, but i ended up helping a lot of people before i even took a day to write this.

The next few years i spent pretty much learning how to talk, since social phobia put me so far behind everyone on that regard. I tried going to college but it didn't work at all, it simply didn't. A mix of studying being completely different, to being around brand new people who i didn't know, but knew eachother made it very hard for me to keep up.

I then gave up on college and focused on my career. I wanted a job that i enjoyed and didn't feel like hell everyday. I managed to actually switch jobs from working on a supermarket to working on e-commerce, which was a insane jump. Those years i matured a lot more on responsibily and being a good professional, although my old phobia would sometimes bring some trouble along the way, i always managed to get over it.

Throughout my life i never really had a dream job or anything like that, my only goal was to have a nice family and live day by day, enjoying the little things, but dating never really worked for me. Not only nobody was ever really interested in me, the girls that i actually was interested into and tried to reach out for, all decided to ghost me and leave me behind.

The only girl i ever dated was a girl that actually noticed me and paid attention to me. She would message me everyday and i loved to chat with her. Sometimes i would simply watch her paint and draw for hours and just enjoy the time we got.

That ended up badly as one day she decided to cheat on me with a close friend. The result: I lost both my girlfriend and my close friend with that. Yet another trauma to add to the list.

I have lost count of how many times i have created a family on The Sims and actually felt happy by having a girlfriend on a freaking computer game, only to then lose all of that warm feeling because that girlfriend doesn't exist.

On the past few years i also tried working on being social and meeting new people, even made a social media account, which i never had in the past. Problem is, even though i want to talk to people and meet new people, they really don't seem to want to know me and who i am as a person.

I don't mind talking about something i don't really have that much of interest or know much about if i see the other person likes talking about it, but when it's the other way around and i am the one wanting to share something, nobody ever really wants to pay attention.

Recently i have been to a psychiatrist and they suspect i have borderline, which makes a lot of sense when i think back to it. I do not fit borderline perfectly on an outside perspective since the ammount of self control i have to have everyday. Even if i feel bad, i will not bother other people with that since it's my problem, not theirs.

I have learned that nobody likes the person i am, but that is not something i can change. I am introverted, i like to listen more than talk, i like very weird and specific things that nobody else really minds that much, and that's who i am, there's not really anything i can do about it.

These past few weeks i have been having so much anxiety and even done some self-harm. I wanted to just disappear since i wouldn't be remembered anyway.

Sometimes i wonder that even if i keep improving and becoming the best version of myself i could ever be, if that would even matter in the end, since i will still be a quiet, introverted guy with weird tastes.

Even with my old traumas, with my social phobia, though weak, still active, and my personality disorder, i keep taking steps forward and trying my best to improve.

I am even starting to go to the gym, so yet another improvement in my life, but will this matter? I have improved so much in so many ways i can't even explain, yet i still don't matter and i feel like going to the gym will not end up any different.

I got to thinking about what that was like, just a few minutes ago. A whole room full of people pouring out their love and memories that they cherished with this one kid.

2506,xcuyna,bleepbloopbloopy,"I (F) have been working at the same place for over 5 years now. I know everybody and everybody knows me. I am still pretty young and so are my co-workers, except for my bosses. This summer I was working a lot, having fun with my co-workers and after the long days we would always sit down and have a drink before going home. Usually chatting about the day. 
During this summer a few of my co-workers held a lot of ""parties"" after work. Just at someones home with some alcohol and party games. Most of the time it was a certain group who went, which I didn't belong in. So I never really thought anything about it. I wouldn't say that I have a bad relationship with any of my co-workers just casual. Like most of us have with each other. 
So in the last weeks of summer these parties got more often. Still it didn't bother me. Until one day. 
One of my co-workers was annoucing a party at her house. She went to talk to most people at my work that day about it. I still didn't think much of it because I knew there were some people who never really went to one of those parties either and I was sure she wouldn't speak to them about it. Because like I said before it was always a certain group. Except this was not the case. She literally talked to everybody about it (details, adress etc). It even got to the point where my other co-workers started asking me if I would come too and how late I would he there. 
I just replied with, ""She hasn't spoken to me about it yet, I am not going to invite myself haha."" I had a 8 hour shift that day and the inviting started when I was only at  work for 2 hours. I was assuming she would ask me too later on since I don't have a bad relationship with her, just casual like most other co-workers have too. 
Skip to the last hour and she still hasn't spoken to me about it. I was kind of feeling upset about it, because hearing about it all day actually made me excited to go (I was sure she would invite me too, since she invited everyone). So after finishing up everybody went outside and she did a last check up asking literally everybody ""You are coming right?"". Well you guessed it except for me... I ended up going home alone crying while everybody else was at her place. I just feel so left out. I am starting to wonder if they actually don't like me at all... I don't think I am weird or different. We always laugh and have fun. Do you think she just forgot about me? And if yes does that make it any better :(

I’ve had the craziest ghosts of all time after every sign was shown &amp; I’m convinced love is not for me. I’m not mad or sad that my life wasn’t meant for love but more like confused… like why can’t I find it again, what did I do to not deserve it?

I treat everyone close to me &amp; who earns it like it’s their world and I’m just living in it. Literally I do the things I do so I can treat the ones around me, very selfless &amp; humble. i love making someone’s day or surprising them or even just helping someone.  It’s something you find out about me after knowing about me, &amp; it’s dumb how I can’t be nice until I’ve been an asshole first, we live in a sick twisted world that has our generation brainwashed by social media I just wish I was born 30 years earlier, I feel like all my problems would be solved.",2022-09-13 02:03:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605854195,2,/r/lonely/comments/xcuz96/i_hate_it_here/,,0,1,I hate it here

But I’m so scared that I will be rejected, ignored, ghosted or something else like I always am when I’m even just trying to make a friend. (I have no friends.) This will be my first date in a LONG time.

I’m also scared that I will be weird, socially awkward, boring, negative or any other number of undesirable things. I hardly even interact with people and haven’t for quite a while now.

And then there’s the anxiety around getting naked with her on the slimmest of chances that things go well and she wants to do that. (One in a trillion chance, I’m sure)

2512,xcvpsp,Lightninroll,"Title says it all. Whenever there’s a dynamic, rowdy conversation, I never know how to get in or what to say. Oftentimes, I don’t have the strong urge to say anything at all because a lot of conversations rely on hypotheticals that I can’t relate to and/or can’t form a decent opinion on. Essentially, I don’t know wtf to say. I’ve heard some say that just stating what’s on my mind is a start, but that would not pan out realistically (often because I’m thinking about how much I stick out with my quietness, or how to join the conversation, etc.). Even when I listen to conversations without these thoughts, I find myself drawing a blank, and I feel like words can go through one ear and go out the other. With all this to say, I don’t suffer from actual nervousness when I DO have to speak. I’ve been told numerous times how good my voice and pronunciation is, and I can project fairly well. It’s just that I don’t have the material to back that up. I’ve been thinking about getting into reading more so I can build upon my repertoire of conversation maintainers, but the problem is, a vast majority of my peers don’t get their information or conversation topics from sources like that, but rather from online media (which I’m currently trying to curb for addiction reasons). So now I’m left with the dilemma of doing as the romans do. Man idk why this shit is so complicated, and I wish I could mesh in as naturally as the other guys in my dorm do whenever we have group stuff. Maybe I’m near  the wrong crowds for me personally, but at this point I’m not sure if I’ll every vibe with any crowd. Should I set a certain amount of online time where I try to get news and information, in addition to reading? And does this ultimately boil down to a lack of experience? (For around a year now I’ve been pushing myself out of my comfort zone in terms of social interactions, but I feel like I haven’t made any progress).

College separated those friends and my boyfriend. I still do hybrid or full online courses and I'm isolated unless I have work. My friends are too busy to call and my family have friend groups of their own. Most family calls I make only last 20 minutes before they try to leave.

I tried to call him two times in one day, something I would've never done before because I was so lonely. He said he wanted to be left alone but he loved me. I believe him. I'm just scared and alone most days and the area I'm in is unfamiliar, I walk most places but the farthest I'll go is a mile. I don't have a car so that limits me.

2516,xcw4ia,Lightninroll,"Idk anymore. I always feel like there are barriers between me and other people, and try as I might, I still don’t feel like I’ve broken through them. Well, there are ideas of tact and prudence—these are things you’ve gotta have, right? Without a reasonable filter, you will forever be the wackjob, ostracized (similarly, if you don’t get the water running to begin with, people will look at you like you’re a broken faucet, which is more so my case). Where is the line drawn between following conventions and being totally yourself? So far, I’ve come to one conclusion,  that you need to fine-tune the degrees of both of these measurements in a way that maximizes your potential for self expression while also catering to the general public/good. But man, that’s a helluva process. One that has no easy end in sight, and to be frank it’s very forced and inorganic. On the other hand, I’ve been thinking that maybe it’s best to maximize being present, and allowing natural development and change by way of immersing in the present (and thinking about the human condition, this is likely what has worked for our earliest ancestors). This seems to be the more organic (and less stressful) approach, but I don’t know how effective it has been for me so far…maybe I’m just not present enough, and the fact that I’m worrying like this is already ironic lmao. But I feel like I need some sort of success story or affirmation that present-ness can lend itself to results by virtue of the act itself, even if it’s over a long period of time. I need to know whether there’s more to it.

2518,xcweru,Own_Discipline2351,"Coming to terms with being a single mom at 28..never did I think I’d be here, but here I am. I’ve posted before about my sons dad cheating ect. But he also has a drinking problem that I didn’t even know existed until we moved in together. After the realization, a lot of his actions started to make sense. Now that we don’t live together it’s easier for me to put it out of my head but it’s also easier for him to do as he pleases in regards to alcohol. I’ve given up trying to help, I grew up with an addict so I know that my pleas are falling on deaf ears. Im just sad for my son. He’ll be 5 next week and for the past 3 months it’s been a struggle to get his dad to call and check on him, he was only seeing him one day a week because of his job. he’s been kicked out of his parents house so the only time my son gets to see him is when he gets a hotel room (or I get it for the two of them) or if we meet at a park. He’s become so lazy in my sons life and it pisses me off because they were really close before the move. Part of me feels bad but the logical side of me can recognize that he wasn’t going to change if I stayed. instead I was becoming bitter and I didn’t like that. I was the only one paying rent, buying groceries, cooking, cleaning and tending to our child during the day until it was time for me to work overnight. And then I’d do it all over again. The goal was for him to get on his feet to help me but it never happened. So here I am. And it’s not fair. 

In regards to dating I don’t even know how to navigate that. I’m sad because I feel like I’ll be alone for a while because I have a kid. The stigma against single parents just really sucks. Most nights I find myself pissed of that I let my life get like this. But at the same time seeing how happy and content my son is on a daily let’s me know that I’m doing something right.

So I (16M) am in high school right? I think most people know who I am because I’m not a total loner or anything, but outside of small talk, or saying hi to people in the hallway, I really only have one other person in high school that’d I’d call a friend. I sit next to him at lunch with another dude. The thing with my friend is he has a kind of social anxiety and he never wants to go to events or anything with me. (Football games, Parties ect) It sucks cause I’m trying to be as outgoing as I can but so far I’ve had little success. I am just bad at initiating conversations and I can’t talk to some people without feeling awkward. I used to be homeschooled up until sophomore year so I didn’t really know many people. I follow my acquaintances on instagram but a lot of them don’t follow me back. I just want to be a part of a friend group lol. I just kinda feel like a background character. One other thing, I used to know this girl who was also homeschooled until freshman year. (I was gonna go public school as a freshman, but my parents thought doing a homeschool program would be better because of the pandemic) I thought I was pretty good friends with her, but once I started school as a sophomore, she literally didn’t say a word to me the whole year (we somehow didn’t share any classes but still), and when I tried to say hi she walked past me. Honestly, she might not have heard me because I have trouble speaking up when talking. I can’t believe I’m asking Reddit of all places for advice, but beggars can’t be choosers.

All throughout summer we would swipe up on each others stories, have a lot of conversations. She added me to her Close Friends story on Insta and her private on SnapChat. I reciprocated. And I mean we talked a few times a week. 

The next semester starts up and I ask her to hangout, she wants to go to Starbucks off campus. She drives, we seemingly have a great time. Sure it was like an hour together but it appeared we both enjoyed it. She talked a lot and I listened attentively. I asked questions, responded, the normal stuff. I was as respectful as one could be, I opened the door for her, offered to pay etc. It’s only an hour. I even complimented her. At the end of the hangout/date I ask for her number and she seemed excited to give it to me. I asked her two days later if she would want to hangout and she said she was busy. Then I tried a few days later and similar response. I waited nearly two weeks, mainly to see if she gave a fucking shit about me since she appeared interested for the past few months. Nothing, so I asked her if she’d be down to hangout and she once again said she is busy for the majority of the day. I ask if a movie later in the day would be good and she seems very very uninterested.

2547,xczn5m,[deleted],"I am on the autism spectrum. For the first 20 years of my life, I was completely alone.

Things started to change when I moved to another state for university. I (now 24F) now have a lot of people I could hang out with. I would like to say I have friends, but I think a better description would be ""close acquaintances"". I'll refer to them as ""CA's"" from now on.

I see my CA's regularly, especially since most of us go to the same church. I've known them for 4 years now. I hang out with them outside of church. They typically respond to text messages. 2 times out of 3, I could count on them if I was in some kind of crisis. (For example, one of my CA's recently drove me to and from the ER, and paid for my tylenol). I could also have deep conversations with them.

But if I ask them to come over to my hometown, they look at me like I'm crazy. Yes, it's in a different state, but I mean, we've known each other for years. It's not like they'd be traveling with a complete stranger. Also, they would talk to me at group events such as church parties, but I am excluded from more intimate events. For example, my CA's, Ashley, would say there is a ""little pool party"" at her parents' house, and invite other CA's, but not me. They would then say something along the lines of ""We'll have to hang out next week, That-Anywhere-6977!""

Additionally, I never seem to be anyone's priority. I tried to invite my CA's to my graduation, only for them to tell me that they'll come if they have nothing else going on.

I am confused. I am glad I finally have a group of girls to talk to. But it seems like they see me as more of an acquaintance than a friend. And this is NOT limited to just one group of people. I seem to make CA's wherever I go, whatever activity I'm involved in. CA's everywhere!

Is there a way to make some real friends, and get out of the acquaintance zone?",2022-09-13 06:02:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/xczn5m/getting_out_of_the_acquaintance_zone/,,0,1,Getting out of the acquaintance zone

So, at the time of writing/posting this, it's 7 days away from the 1 year mark of my dad passing away. It's also 5 days away from the 1 year mark of when my most recent ex left me. The two events did, in fact, happen within two days of each other, so yeah, that fucking sucked. Since that time last year, there's been several really big things that happened with me and my family, and my dad isn't here to see any of it. I've also been abandoned by nearly everyone, and I don't exaggerate when I say that. I think the only person I truly have left is my best friend and we can't even hang out anymore. The fact that I quite literally have no social life (not by choice 🥲) weighs on me pretty damn heavily every day.
All of this is made worse by the fact that I've been trying to get a job for 3 FUCKIN' YEARS and still have never even had one. I have tried over and over and over but I just can't seem to get a job anywhere and I genuinely do not understand why. Every night, I sit outside in my backyard and just kind of die for an hour or so. I usually either vent to myself or just sit there and think. I just want someone to be with me through this but I can't even get as little as that. This incredible sense of loneliness and isolation are gonna be the death of me if it goes on for too much longer. 
I've been abandoned by everyone and everything and now I'm just clawing in the dark for some sort of foothold. Of course I don't catch anything except more darkness.

I worked so hard at it that I am normal, but deep down I will never fit in or have that special feeling of being akin to anyone else. I do not lack esteem. The thoughts, ideas, and feelings I have I share freely with anyone I might think be interested. I admire and respect all others and their ideas to the point that I do not compete with the world anymore. I play it safe very well. I do not have any friends so there is no one I may hurt unintentionally and there is no one who can use me or betray me to hurt me either.

All that has happened to me in my life, all my past actions, all that I have witnessed, all I have endured... is who I am. It didn't happen to anyone else and I should not expect anyone to understand, nor should expect that I should understand anyone else by that same logic. I have completely reconciled all those things in my life. I know exactly how they make me who I am. I put myself in a situation where I can help people, strangers, but not to make friends nor a situation where I am too responsible for too much for another in helping. I have even curated very specific experiences for others, just do not ask me how I do...it never ends normal. I tried letting my freak side show hoping to find someone who understands and that always ends in absolute disaster. I know that who I am and what I have learned in my life has huge import, has care, and has answers to many questions. I have a good memory for all of it and tend to forget anything that is not important or relevant to make room for all of it. I have met no one like me and I should be proud.

My family is almost six thousand miles with a 13 hour time difference so I don’t get to call them often.

Over time I noticed things starting to change loving messages started to get void of any emotion and response times got longer and longer. So as anyone would do I asked her about it after a long conversation she told me she still had feeling for her ex and didn’t know how to tell me. It completely crushed me to the point I was willing to be with her knowing she had does feelings because I legitimately fell in love with her. After a day or so it was called off and my depression hit an all time low. I had no support system no one to confide in I had to do this healing on my own.

2582,xd5760,Aaliyah1226,"So 17F here and i guess i just need a place to vent because i am tired of always ending up alone. I don’t even want to meet new people because i know that eventually they’ll leave me too and i don’t want to be hurt over and over again.

Since i was about 4 i never had any friends at school i was constantly the target of bullying even by the older kids becuase  my mum was very ill and poor so i didn’t quite have the same neat presentation as the other kids. When i got to about age 7 a girl in my class started a rumour saying i had head lice, from then up until i left primary school no one sat next to me at lunch or even in lesson and would scream ewwwww if they were made to by the teacher. Things at home were rough too with my mum always in and out of hospital and my dad an abusive asshole i never had anyone to talk to . In my last year of primary school i’m sad to say that one of the head teachers who was known to be nasty decided to join in on the bullying. She would sometimes have me miss lunch for no reason and would shout at me to the point where i’d be in tears and tell me it was my fault no one wanted to be friends with me .

I thought things would be better in secondary school and they were i did make actual friends and although the slight remarks i was never really bullied and was not popular but everyone knew who i was. However i had issues with friends at this time now . I noticed that my so called friends would often pick on me for no reason. I was quite slim but my friends were all really skinny and they bullied me about this to the point where i ended up with anorexia and would spend weeks at hospital from starving myself. Of course those girls wanted nothing to do with me and when i came out as bisexual the rumour got spread around school and lots of people didn’t want anything to do with me. This carried on with a new friend group i made who then bullied me about how many people i slept with when i was about 15. Yes i did sleep with a lot of boys at this time but  i always thought that for me having sex was a way to not feel so lonely for a short time. The bullying spread around school with people shouting “slag” in the corridor whether i walked by and not a single person was speaking to me by the end of secondary school.

I then started college and i was hopeful that as id moved away i’d have a fresh start. And i did! i really glowed up when i reached 16 and i became really popular at college and was doing well in my studies. I made lots of friends who i hanged out with a lot and who made me feel like they cared about me . However i’m not sure exactly why but i started to develop an issue with alcohol perhaps because of home life.  in just a couple of months it became such an issue that my friends would have to take care of me or let me spend nights at their houses just to sleep it off and i got suspended for a while from college for being drunk in a lesson. Needless to say this pushed a lot of my friends away from me which i cant blame them but still one of them stayed and we started a romantic relationship though as i remember a lot of it was him taking care of me when i was drunk or throwing up and trying to make me feel better. My parents kicked me out when i turned 17 due to this behaviour and i went to stay with a mutual friend of the boy i was pursuing as his mum had offered. Things with the boy i was with started to break down after he told me had a girlfriend and i was just his side piece and i fell for the mutual friend i was staying with. Things were good and we were friends with benefits until he get a girlfriend  and now neither of him nor his friend were talking to me. I made a new friend group after this and left his house to stay with another friend but the constant judginess of these friends and the fact that it’s like they don’t care if i’m around or not makes me feel a little unwanted. i just started my second year of college and although i’m still popular and i have my new group of friends i don’t feel like i fit in and i get hateful  stares and comments from all the friends who used to care about me last year including the boy i was with are. It’s too much to deal with  and it’s my second day back today but i have decided not to go in because it hurts too much to sit there alone like i used to when i was younger.",2022-09-13 11:39:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650963328,10,/r/lonely/comments/xd5760/in_the_end_i_always_end_up_alone/,,0,2,In the end i always end up alone

2586,xd5sy0,Would-Be-Superhero,"Captain's log, day... I lost track.

""My search for a companion continues, as my hopes decrease more and more with each passing minute. I continue to daydream of a future in which I will hear a girl tell me she loves me and feel her arms around me in a warm embrace.

But every hour that goes by brings a greater sense of futility and despair. Thoughts racing through my head remind me the things I have heard my entire life, namely that no one wants me and no one will ever want me.

There's still no sign of a potential partner anywhere in sight, and the circumstances of my life seem to worsen, as if to fuel the fire from which the demons tell me that all my prayers to God are in vain.

I crave female companionship; I crave cuddles and kisses and conversations about our future together. I started to hate falling asleep, partially because of the nightmares and partially because I know that I will wake up either in the hell that is my life on this earth, or in an even greater hell in the afterlife.

This seems like madness and only something supernatural could hold me from collapsing.""",2022-09-13 12:09:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1650541207,1,/r/lonely/comments/xd5sy0/captains_log_day_i_dont_even_know/,,0,0,Captain's log. Day... I don't even know.

I don't know how to fix this, because clearly I can't use rationality to change my irrational thoughts. I've acted on the irrationality before, to try to be around people, but I always ended up alone again, so now I'm trying to ignore it and rationalise my way to a different thought. I think it's working, but I'm posting here, mostly as a vent, but still I'm posting. In any case the problem is that the thoughts are still there and are there quite often. This is a problem because the irrational thoughts cause hope if they go long enough, and when that hope is intercepted by the rational thoughts, which are grounded in reality, it's a disaster: the mood drops and there's nothing I can do. And then the irrational part says that the rational part is irrational and that makes everything confusing because I don't know which one is real.

I became tired of everything, even the smallest things made me exhausted.

I used to have two friends I hung out with last year but one of them dropped out and the other isn’t talking to me anymore. Idk what happened, last year we were together all the time but now she basically ignores me and only talks to her other friend. 

The thing is, I don’t mind being alone most of the time. I enjoy playing video games and watching youtube by myself. But whenever I see people having fun with their friends, I feel like I’m such a loser being alone all the time and having nobody to talk to. I have two roommates, one of them has an actual social life and is always out of the apartment with her friends. The other is introverted like me, but she still has people she hangs out and studies with. Both of them call their friends every night while I lay on my bed watching YouTube, it just reminds me how much of a loner I am. They probably think I have no life (which is true tbh) because I’m at home all the time and I have no one to call/text. 

I’ve had social anxiety my whole life so I’ve always struggled talking to people. I’m too scared to initiate conversation, plus I have zero social skills so it dies within ten seconds anyway. I’m fact, it feels like I drew the short straw when it comes to social skills in my family. I have two brothers, younger and older, they’re both extroverted and have girlfriends and have never had a shortage of friend groups. Whenever I’m home for holiday or visiting, or whenever they talk about their gfs, my dad makes a point to ask when I’m going to get a SO. I have to act like I’m not jealous and it doesn’t bother me when it actually does. 

I actually did have a friend group in highschool, but I’m not as close to them and they don’t talk to me anymore unless I say something first. At the end of summer I suggested meeting up one more time before college, and they said “mmhm”. Two weeks later they post pictures in the gc of them hanging out without me. It’s always felt like every friend I have has someone else they care about more than me. Everyone is always texting, talking, or snapchatting their friends, and they have a billion notifications on their phone. My phone is drier than the Sahara desert. I can’t remember the last time someone texted me. Like I said, I enjoy being alone, but when I’m around people like this I feel ashamed being so lonely, and I feel like other people are judging me too. 

I didn’t expect this to be so long lmao, thanks if you actually read this far. It’s very disorganized cos I can’t orient my thoughts but I just wanted to rant about it.",2022-09-13 15:48:52,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663080821,3,/r/lonely/comments/xdb33m/feeling_lonely_in_college_incoherent_rambling/,,0,1,Feeling lonely in college + incoherent rambling

What is wrong with me?

I am a guy. I am 29. I have a job. I have a car. I mainly wear polo shirts nowadays. 

I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Aspergers since I was 5. Perhaps the first thing wrong is I was born with mental disorders that regardless of how much I try to make jokes. Share funny things. I would hope I’m approachable. I get people to laugh all the time. My co workers seem to like me. My boss as well. I have my days my depression, sadness, stress and anger leaks out but I try often to contain that because I’ve always been told nobody wants to be around anyone like that. I’m so fucking lonely.

I a handful of friends nowadays. 2 co workers. Only 1 i actually hang out with and he stopped being a co worker where I work but still works within the company I work for. 2 online friends. 1 I barely keep in touch with anymore. 1 I try to regularly talk to but I feel less and less inclined to open up to her for various reasons.

All my friends I feel distant from either by how they make me feel or they themselves do so. 

Fuck having friends at this point. I have been single and lonely for so long. I fucking despise dating apps but it feels like the ONLY FUCKING way to meet anyone. Even THEN it’s always about sex. I genuinely want a real, loving, caring, give and take relationship. 

I don’t think I’m ugly. I have gotten compliments. I wish I was a girl because then I could be like one of my co workers. Changes her Facebook status to single and literally gets so many messages. Like I get it’s not the wanted kind of attention but Jesus Christ it’d be fucking nice once and awhile. If I had the option to simply press a button just to get some level of attention I’d do it regardless of how shallow. Yeah you won’t a deeper connection and I want that as well but fucking hell I can’t even get the surface level. 

Dating these days is fucking gruesome. Getting fucking dating advice from one of my friends, who married his high school sweetheart, and who agrees dating sucks these days feels tone deaf. Not to mention his fucking views on women piss me off but he is one of the few friends I have. 

I am so angry today. I am so lonely today. Im getting tired of wanting to end it all because living on my own is depressing. It’s NOT like I don’t enjoy my alone time. I literally go to fucking movies by myself; sad as that is. Try to invite anyone to anything and you get “im sick.” “Thanks but im busy.” 

If my mother calls and notices “I could come to the movies with you so long as there isn’t any cussing.”  Being loved and cared about by religious parents is like a backhanded compliment. Worse; it’s offered out of pity. 
Makes me feel so much worse. 

Brothers? Sisters? Cousins?

My brother just likes to game. I used to game but I can’t muster the drive anymore. Even though I miss it. Not to mention he plays on a separate system with games I don’t like to play. It’d be nice to hang with someone whom I don’t have to make concessions for JUST so I can hang with someone and not feel lonely. 

My sister get along like oil and water. Occasionally we get along but just like oil and water we are best separate. 

I’ve reached out to my cousins. “Hit me up for a game maybe. I’m down. Maybe some DnD?” 

Lots of empty offers.

I wanna cry. This sucks so much. I’m trying so hard. I’m trying so hard to use my coping skills. Distracting myself with my hobbies. I’ve planned to go to the movies today after a hellish work week. I’ve been reading the Hobbit that my friend lent me. I’m trying so hard. Trying to keep it together because I want someone to want me. I don’t feel like I’m worth anything but it seems like other people see the value in others and I just feel like a pebble amongst pearls.

2650,xdgmum,TheIinINFJ,"Hello, does anybody else relate to me?

You see, I'm not alone. I have group of friends from all my previous schools including now. People usually say I'm friendly and they do hang out with me. It's just that, I can feel that when push comes to shove, I wil not be able to lean on any of them. Not because they are weak or uncaring, but because they won't know how to respond or they'll just brush it off with a ""hey, you can do it. It's you after all."" These words of encouragement turn into uncaring words once you get sick of it. You needed help but everybody just assumes you don't actually need it.
Also, I know I'm not anybody's first choice. I'm nobody's favorite person. Yeah, I'm close with some people. But I know, I'm not the one they would could as the closest friend. I'll never be one. I grew up having a lot of people around me, being friends with me, but not once, did I have someone understand me deeply. Whenever I try to open up, they seem uninterested. So I can say that, nobody knows the real me. The whole of me. Not my friends, my close friends, my best friend, my family, not even my parents. They don't know I get anxiety when I'm in an unfamiliar crowd. They don't know I panic when someone calls me without giving me a heads up. They don't know I like wearing skirts and dresses too. They don't know I would like to be pretty too. They don't know I hated the fact that I'm called the 'ideal girl' coz I'm smart but no one's ever said they liked me. They don't know that I feel insecure whenever they point out my physical flaws like I don't know them in the first place. They don't know I liked a lot of guys but never said so to anyone not even my close friends coz I'm scared they might think I'm aiming too high. They don't know I loved writing down stories because I never showed them my works for I'm frightened of what they might interpret from it. Nobody knows how I really feel, what I actually like and what I hate. But they act like everybody knows who I like, where I prefer to go and why I do things. It's frustrating, that I can't say to them, I feel lonely. Just because I'm not even alone, doesn't mean I don't feel lonely.

So, I guess, cheers to those who feel the same way as I am. The greatest loneliness is when you feel alone within a crowd, like you don't belong. 

To those who were never first, never the favorite, never understood and never liked. Cheers!",2022-09-13 19:45:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663095559,1,/r/lonely/comments/xdgmum/not_alone_but_lonely/,,0,0,Not Alone But Lonely

I’ve always feared being alone but now that I don’t have any friends really just brought all my fears to the surface. The gnawing pain knowing that I haven’t made a true connection like I had hoped for, and the only thing I could do to make up for it is to constantly work myself till I’m exhausted to the point where I just want to lie in bed all day sobbing my heart out. 

Well I was scrolling through TikTok per usual and I came across a reddit post and decided to give the app a try so here goes nothing. 

If anyone would like to be friends and make a connection please message me. I can tell you a little about myself. 

I am a gemini so I can be a wee bit emotional, I enjoy playing sims a lot. I occasionally watch anime from time to time, my favorite cartoon of all time would be Steven’s Universe. I enjoy the simple things in life too, such as taking walks in the park and admiring nature.

i grew up hating myself, the way i looked, the way i was. everything about me was so repulsive and i understand why no one has ever wanted to be around me longer than a day. 

now i’ve developed an awful physical illness and i feel even more shit. all the hard work i did in my first year of uni has gone to shit. everyone i worked so hard to “befriend, aka get enough courage to talk to” ghosted me within seconds of seeing my rotting corpse of presence. 

i worked so hard to overcome my mutism but the impacts still remain. i had to learn all the social skills at age 19 that everyone else learns in childhood. i’ve always felt such a fundamental lack of belonging. i’ve never met my extended family because of their abusive nature, and my parents are simultaneously distant and overbearing. 

i spent my 20th birthday alone.

I have been spawned in the hard server as someone else commented once, i have no hope of having friends or a wife or anything.

I have nobody i can ever talk to, i'm mentally ill but i'm medicated so idk, fine i guess on that part.

No friends.

No personality.

Nobody that i fucking love or care about.

Nobody would fucking notice if i'm gone, i've lived my whole life alone and i'm sure i'll die alone, i'm so fucking frustrated and bitter about everything in life right now.

I'm not depressed that i wanna wallow up and die i want to blow my fucking brains out to stop the fucking shit i'm feeling right now.

It's not that i can't try and get friends, i've been so fucking unlucky to be born in a place where what the US call conservatives are basically progressive leftists where i live, i unfortunately for me have been westernized and think like a liberal but such thoughts are so fucking dangerous to have or to voice around here.

I can't leave this place because leaving is so fucking expensive for me, at best i can travel but that'll only serve to make it worse, i'll go somewhere and realize even more how much misery i live in and get back.

I understand that the west isn't heaven or whatever, i realize you guys have a lot of shit to sort through, but what you guys call shit is a luxury sometimes in here.

I'll never have any friends, i'll never have anyone around me, i have been crying myself to sleep for so fucking long and i have nobody to talk to or that cares.

This is just so frustrating and if i wasn't such a fucking pussy i would have taken my life so long ago.

And the suicide line doesn't work in here so there's that lmao, if it does they might hang up on you or tell you to man up, this isn't an option.

2788,xe03aq,HotLeafJuice444,"I’m a 20 year old dude and I’ve felt an underlying sense of loneliness ever since I graduated highschool almost 3 years ago.

The weird part is that I have friends from hs and some new ones from college, but everytime I hang out with them I feel a little disconnected and when it’s time to part ways my loneliness comes back.

Back in highschool, I had friends that I could confide in and just be real with but they all moved on with their lives and go to different colleges. And now in college I can’t seem to make close friends like that. The few friends I’ve made are mostly to play basketball with or do hackathons with or study for classes. I don’t really have a friend that I can just call when I need help moving my things or if I’m just feeling down and want to grab a quick lunch or something like that.

I think that maybe the void in my life is from not having a girlfriend? I feel that I want more intimate friendships but I can’t seem to find that with traditional friendships. It seems that intimacy for me is harder to find in college than it was in hs. 

I think my psyche is telling me I need a girlfriend too. Ik this sounds sad asf, but whenever I have a genuine interaction with a girl, I think about it the rest of day and regret not asking for her number, if not for romantic reasons than for platonic ones.

I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years but he's more of a roommate and I've even told him so. I just don't think we work together at all. I don't even have any friends to take the edge off with. Just me and him as long it's never anything together of course. 

I'm sick of coming home and he will tell me something about his day then it's my turn to speak and his attention is all on his computer games. Fucks me off. Exact same thing happened yesterday when I got home I turned around while brushing our dog started talking with no reply, looked behind me and boom fucking headphones on face deep in a game. It had barely been a minute between him speaking. I find it so rude. 
Another example that makes me mad is that we bonded over game of thrones years ago and have started watching the new one. Every episode so far when it gets to the mid point he will start watching videos with the sound on. He doesn't have to watch it with me if he doesn't want to but what's the point in ruining it for me? We are both gamers and even play the same game but never together as I'm not his skill level. Nice. 

He's started more and more with speaking to me in a derogatory way. Every time I bring an issue up its like that moment didn't exist and I get no response.

Everytime I consider just closing my eyes and being normal, it feels really wrong and I get all panicky. I've had a couple issues with dissociation in the past and it feels like I lose myself when I do that and it scares me.

2810,xe5ay0,guhuggafugga,"I'm a 28 year old male. My partner (31 y/o F) and I have been married for almost 4 years. Our oldest child just turned 3, and our youngest is turning 1 at the end of September. I work night shift as an ICU RN. I love my wife, my kids, my job ... but I feel so disconnected from everyone. It's as if I can't truly allow myself to accept the love of my family; or be proud of my accomplishments as a husband, father, and nurse.

I have been dealing with depression and OCD since I was in high school. Whether I am in therapy, taking medications, or none of the above, I still feel the same. Some days are good; I feel energized, motivated, proud of myself. Other days I am constantly drained, can hardly separate myself from my phone, and I am so quick to anger. I never used to get angry, but this has become a huge problem for me as of late. Panic attacks, bursts of yelling, exasperation at the slightest inconvenience ... I feel like such a burden to my family. 

I am a dreamer. I make plans like books I want to read, house projects I want to complete, recipes to try, exercise routines ... Rarely do I do any of these. I pour what little energy I have into imagining a life where I think I'd be happy. Oddly enough, I dream about a life with partners other than my wife, at a point in my life where my children are in school or independent enough to not need me every moment of the day. I feel like such a horrible husband and father, not only for the life I've been imagining but for my short comings in this life.

Maybe it's the sheer volume of dreams that make them feel so unattainable. Regardless, I've become paralyzed with a fear of failure and an overwhelming feeling of unfulfillment. I feel gross, unattractive, untalented, awkward; but I also feel pretentious and selfish for even having these thoughts and feelings, let alone expressing them. I am constantly apologizing to my family for my faults, whether real or perceived. 

My family showers me with love, affection, and attention. As I write this my oldest son is cuddled up on my lap. Sometimes he just randomly kisses my cheek, then rests his head on my shoulder. My wife is nothing short of supportive, patient, and kind; but for some reason I translate her love as pity. She is constantly walking on eggshells around me to avoid having me misintetpret the things she says that would otherwise send me into a panic attack. What do I even do for her? I just want her to look at me like I'm desireable, like I don't need fixing, like I make her happy just by being around.

I know I only seen him for a not even a month but I gave him part of me that I never gave anyone else.

You see I can be secure on my own dating just triggers my trauma and everything in it not only that I don't end up liking a lot of men theirs always that one person I end up having a spark with and ends up hurting me.

No matter how many breaks I take from dating or giving myself time the trauma with meeting a new guy always comes back.

I wish I did have a guy who was serious about me and that I don't have to fight for him I don't have to worry about mutiple dating and honestly I'm too indecisive to mutiple date anyway.


I just wish I could get to the place in the relationship where I can relax I can finally feel comfortable and fall into his arms and not feel afraid anymore.

I never get pass the talking stage I never do. I'll take another break again from dating and learn but I know every single time I take a break it takes a very long time for me to like another guy again like years. Not only that I'm going to be 23 next month and I've never been in a relationship I've only had situationships and my first kiss was with this guy. 

As a person with sexual abuse trauma this experience just retrauamized me. Now I gotta put up more walls... and every single time I take a break and because I'm not attracted to a lot of men it makes it more difficult.

Not only that because I've never been in a relationship either it's so so difficult for me to even know what to do or how to even get to that stage because I'm not physcial enough with them and I end up getting screwed over and hurt because I'm not okay with being physical with them within a week.


If your gonna ask I've tried the being friends route too once and that ended up with me being more heartbroken because there feelings never really ended up changing to romantic either. Because that only works if they liked you in the beginning.


Guess I'm taking another break but this part of my life love is rare and I've been burned too many times and too many situationships that just re trigger me over and over again.

Would love to chat with any locals or just people from all over the world! My interests include travelling, nature, running and triathlon, I have a bit of a geeky side too and enjoy binging YouTube documentaries and playing the occasional video game when I get time.

I’m not looking for anyone in particular, just someone to converse with - I love Asia but have never been so someone to teach me about that culture would be great as well.

No family or friends left at all. Since I stopped reaching out theres been nothing from them all. There’s one or two acquaintances that reach out but it’s cause they need something. I try to make plans with people a lot and they always fall thru 

and now 

I find out that even my s/o doesn’t wanna hang out with me.

This hurts so much. Whats wrong with me? What’s the point of anything? Why go to work or eat or care about anything? For what? So I can be around if someone may need something?

The fucked up part is without a passion/purpose I feel like a waste of space and so stupid and useless…

So I’ll continue to be vulnerable and work on being a better me than I was the day before and try to not care about anything and be available for others at their disposal.

Being human is bullshit.

Get money. Fuck bitches. Do what I want.

2851,xebj8e,spiritus_dei,"  

I grew up in the Protestant Church and for me miracles are what happened thousands of years ago. You read about an active God in the Bible and it seemed like an alternate universe -- where was this God that turned water into wine, healed the sick, and caused the Red Sea to divide so that the Israelites could escape Egypt? 

Over the years I became an expert on the Bible. I memorized passages and read Theology books and I eventually became a pastoral major at a well-known Bible college. Along the way I became disillusioned -- it happened when I was in a preaching tent and large numbers of people were giving their lives to Jesus Christ. I had never been in a preaching tent and the only reason I was there was because the person who was assigned to the tent didn't show up (it was during Halloween and there was a special ministry). They asked if anyone else was a pastoral major and I raised my hand and I got the job. 

I had always dreamt of a moment like that and I was surprised at my reaction. I had a pit in my stomach. The two girls that were assigned to help me were in tears as people surrendered their lives to the Lord. Meanwhile, all I wanted to do was throw up. 

That was a turning point. If that was what it was going to be like to share the good news then I had to throw in the towel. I didn't really understand the source of my angst but I knew I wouldn't be a missionary and I eventually left the Bible college to pursue secular interests at a much more prestigious university back home. 

I went from wanting to be a missionary to working in the film industry in Los Angeles. Just like Jonah I went in the exact opposite direction toward the heart of darkness. I stopped praying and decided to just focus on being a ""good person"". What I didn't know is that separate from God it's impossible to be a good person. It's like trying to head ""due north"" without a compass. God is due north when it comes to righteousness and without God as your compass you will inevitably end up spiritually lost -- irrespective of your best intentions. 

I found myself lost. I was living in Beverly Hills at the time. I was alone and desperate. By this time I'd surrounded myself with a lot of talented friends and acquaintances who worked in the film and music industries and they were equally miserable. I was also working at my dream job and they were all miserable too -- it didn't matter that Oscars were being won, they were incredibly famous, and they were dating beautiful actresses – everyone was tormented. 

I told myself that if I ever had that kind of success that would really make me happy, but I was nervous that perhaps achieving a personal goal wouldn’t give me solace. And then my friend committed suicide. He was extremely talented and had a large following of people. He had a beautiful girlfriend. None of it mattered.

I actually had a dream of him the night he died. I thought it was strange since I’d never dreamt of him in my life. He just showed up out of nowhere. And that morning I received a call that he’d jumped off a bridge.

I knew he was tormented even though he’d never mentioned it. It’s like driving drunk – you don’t have to tell the police. They can see you swerving or driving 15 miles too slow. When you’re in a hopeless situation it’s obvious to anyone around you who cares. 

I suffered with some guilt years later since I didn’t offer him any help. At the time we were both drowning in our sins and I could barely keep myself above water. Once I met the true God I forgave myself since I knew that God didn’t fail him and he was sending in the special forces units to minister to him even in my absence. 

We assume that because someone is wildly successful that they’re content and at peace. It couldn’t be further from the truth. Often it’s a desperate chasing after false salvation that drives people in the entertainment industry. “If strangers love me then I can finally love myself.”

They’re half right – someone loving you can resolve the problem, but it’s not fallen humans. God loves us and he can rescue us. If we seek and receive the affirmation of God we can be healed.

So what about miracles? I’d never seen one, but I needed one.

Spiritually I felt like I was looking down at the rocks below where the contorted bodies of my friends had all fallen. And I was wondering why I hadn’t fallen too? Why wasn’t I another casualty? Why was I still alive? 

I prayed in the shower of my apartment in Beverly Hills, “God, if you’re out there… please rescue me.”

In that moment I was rescued. I was taken from the ocean of despair where I couldn’t see dry land anywhere and placed on terra firma instantly. I knew in that moment that I was going to be okay – the spirit of God had entered my life.

I had spent so much time looking down at my friends that I never looked up. The whole time God was there preserving me for reasons that only God knew. 

But I was still an unrepentant sinner and being rescued didn’t change my attitude toward God. I was thankful, but I was not going to serve Him. However, I no longer wanted vain glory. I was never really interested in the approval of others. I really didn’t have a good reason to be working in the film industry.

Years passed and I moved from city to city. I no longer had cosmological sadness, which is how I described the feelings I used to feel that were in no way connected to my situation in life. And strangely I knew that God was still with me, patiently waiting.

I had started numerous businesses. And one day I said, “That’s it. Today’s the day. I’m serving God.”

Up to that moment I’d served my own selfish desires without limitation. Whatever I dreamed about doing – I went ahead and did it. And none of it brought me any happiness or peace. I called up my business partner and said, “I’m quitting. I’ll stay on the board of directors for awhile.”

He was shocked of course, “Why are you quitting? The company is doing great.”

I told him it didn’t matter how well the company did since it would not give me what I was seeking. I finally just came out and said it, “I’m quitting to serve God.”

There was a long silence. He wasn’t a Christian. In fact, he grew up in China and was an agnostic. I used to jokingly accuse him of being a closet Christian since he always defended Jesus whenever anyone said anything negative about Christianity.

He was probably the smartest guy I’d ever met, but our road had finally come to an end. 

And then he surprised me with his answer, “I want to serve God too.”

I told him that wasn’t possible since he wasn’t even sure if there was a God. We never discussed God, but I knew he didn’t know God. And then he said, “I’ve become a Christian.”

Every day he and I were together working on businesses. And he had never once mentioned a desire to know God. And I brought this up to him and he said, “You don’t know everything about me.”

And so to my surprise my journey would not be alone, my best friend would be coming with me. 

I assumed I would be like John the Baptist and living homeless. In fact, that is what I was fully prepared to do. The first slap in the face was that I didn’t know anything about God. I only knew my own voice that overpowered anything God had to say.

I had memorized a lot of scripture verses, but that’s like memorizing the rules of basketball and never playing basketball. I tell people church for me was like being in a football stadium and acting like I was on the team. I was a fan of God in my past, but I’d never been on God’s team. 

God was never my coach. 

I went out into the world to “serve God” and just kept serving myself. I held a video camera for three long years assuming that God had called me to do a documentary based on my impressive resume from my years in Hollywood. 

I didn’t know that there was a personal God with a very specific plan for my life. I had been so busy writing my own script for my service to God that I never thought God had spent way more time on it and had a much better plan.

I shot a lot of videos and nobody watched them.

It was disheartening. A lot of effort went into the videos and I was expecting that they would set the world on fire for God. 

And then one day I received a call from a stranger. He said he’d watched one of my videos and that he knew he had to talk to me. I thanked him for watching the video (very few people had watched them). 

And then he said, “The reason I’m calling you is because God has called me to do a video.”

That is not a great feat, but he told me he worked in the oil fields of North Dakota and he’d never turned on a video camera in his life. For some reason he thought I was an integral part of this plan.

He added, “I know this is going to sound crazy, but God told me millions of sinners are going to watch this video.”

Millions? Most of my videos didn’t even reach a few hundred people. Fortunately, I knew enough about God to not laugh in his face. I actually gave him the correct advice, “If God told me to shoot a video then that’s what I would do.”

I wasn’t sure what he thought I could do for him so I added, “If you shoot the video I’ll post it on my YouTube page.”

For some reason that got him really excited. And I never thought about him again for a couple of years when he called me. He had put together a small video production team and traveled the United States shooting this video. 

It was a video of children conceived in rape and their mothers. It was so good. It was much better than anything I could have done. I was quite surprised given his lack of previous experience.

I posted the video on my YouTube channel and just like my videos – nobody watched it.

I knew he was disappointed. I am pretty sure he thought that all he needed to do was have me post it and millions of sinners would flock to the video.

At least a year passed and I received a text from him. He asked if I remembered him which I thought was amusing. Did he think I received a lot of calls from strangers on a mission from God? How could I forget him?

And then he asked if I remembered what God had told him: that millions of sinners would watch the video.

I confirmed that I remembered. And then he sent me a YouTube link. 

It was the same video, but on another group’s channel. And it had millions upon millions of views with thousands upon thousands of comments from angry sinners.

He called me on the phone and said, “The group who posted it isn’t Christian. They took the video without my permission and posted it on their page.”

And that’s when I knew how much God loved me. The message was very clear, “I don’t need your videos, your YouTube page, or even you. You’re not required, but if you’ll listen I will still use you. “

God took a man with no experience from the oil fields of North Dakota to do a great work. If he had taken me I would have received most of the glory – it wouldn’t have been a miracle. God used the YouTube channel of sinners who were against Him to reach the angry mob of sinners. 

And so I put down my video camera and for the first time asked, “Okay God, what is your will for my life?”

And I couldn’t believe the answer. I’m still coming to terms with it. It is a miracle.

But I’m not special. God loves all of his children. And before you throw in the towel consider a conversation with a God in heaven who loves you and has a plan for you.

I've been alone...well basically forever now, but I have not succumb to despair or self-harm. Instead, I started to do as my literary hero, The Count of Monte Cristo, did. I started to use my prison as a school. My goal was to eliminate any possible thing that was keeping me from finding someone. I lost 150 pounds. I worked on my career and pulled myself out of a dead-end job. I'm studying for entrance exams to finally get my degree. Most of all, I have studied fashion, grooming, etc. All I could wear was circus tents before I lost the weight, but that's changed.

Has any of this helped? Not yet. Obviously I'm far from finished. The goal of the challenge is to be the most magnificent beast I can be.

trying to communicate with others, i always try my best to be there for them, even if they dont want to return the favour. and after being used up by others, they just throw me away like a cigarette stump. used up, people got their high off of me, disregarded in all ways. college was the worst time for me, 3 years of eternal suffering each day, getting up, feeling awful, going home, procrastinating and then sleeping for 3 hours just to repeat the cycle.  


im so alone irl, i have nobody, tried for so long. nobody likes my company. im rude, abrassive, disgusting as people said. ive gotten so introverted that i hate talking to people, i hate my own voice, i hate myself. deep inside i just need somebody to just say something like ""its going to be okay"" while resting my head on them. i know its something that is sugarcoated, but itll comfort me for a bit till i eventually rot away. ive tried so much, using all my energy to try and get a hobby, try new things, do what i previously enjoyed, i just get burnt out so much. i just want this suffering to end honestly.",2022-09-14 22:06:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626162277,2,/r/lonely/comments/xeet2v/im_sick_that_i_grew_up_being_selfless/,,0,0,im sick that i grew up being selfless

I(M24) don't remember being happy since childhood. I don't mean I have never had happy moments. I was bullied in school since I had better grades than my bully. He used to hide my bag when my bus stop comes, hit and run, and do many mean things which I don't even feel like remembering. I changed bus and after I changed even my school which I think was the best decision in my life. I had some good friends and finally started finding some happiness. I always used to be the funniest guy in class. Most teachers though annoyed with me during class liked me. (The only happy part of my life)

As puberty hit I started taking care of myself.  I was always used to be me made fun of by my friends about my looks. Even my cousins made fun of me. I started hating to go to places where people know me. I started being more and more self conscious. I didn't find the courage to talk to girls. I felt worthless because of how I was treated always. Whenever I looked in the mirror I felt sad being me. So I decided to go to gym. I got massively changed physically. From 5'1 I grew to around 6'2 now. Puberty hit me hard. Even though I grew into having a really good body I was always made fun of my face. I still go to gym. I eat healthy. I take care of my hair. I do everything that's in my control. I still feel like being called ugly. I smoke and drink occasionally. I know many of my friends who don't even care about eating healthy or put half the effort in themselves and still be happy and look good. I feel like I'm fighting a lost battle. 

I started avoiding people that now I ended up so lonely in a different country without anyone to count on. I am having social anxiety now more than ever. Even if people approach me to talk I just smile and be weird. I feel like I ll make a fool out of myself if I start talking. Since I'm tall and have a decent body I get approached by people thinking I have made in life. Little do they know that I am living a miserable life. I try to put a smile and avoid eye contact whenever possible. I feel so worthless. I push people away now. I don't think anyone really cares apart from my mom. She's the reason I still feel like living. My mom is a really kind soul who will sacrifice anything for me. I feel it to be a burden that someone is loving me. I don't want anyone to love me. I had a gf last year ( she initiated the relationship). She thinks I don't like her cos I don't take her out. Reality is I don't know why someone would love me. And I fell like she could have got someone worthy. I don't go out with her often because she is beautiful and I'm ugly. I tell her to not love me. She thinks I don't have emotions. Anyway she left me now. I feel like dying and starting as a new person.

This country is so violent towards the queers. But maybe I'm just making excuses, sometimes it's hard to judge myself.

I have to write my pain out constantly just to not throw myself into traffic. I try to see the good in things but maybe as usual I am not doing enough and I'm tired.

My days are a cycle of endless nothingness, I clock in and never quite clock out. I do what I know and know what I do. Excitement is something of a rare treat, rather spontaneity is the word. I see life, I know what it is and somehow in my own dark fortress that is my mind I know how it feels. How it feels to really live. The exasperated freedom of carefree everything, I don’t know how it is, but I know how it feels. My life is a game yet I’m not a player, a cheerleader or even an amazed fan. Not a commentator or a referee. I guess I am the Stadium, the entity which harbors life inside that is contained by mere walls. I often think what is my purpose on this earth, to make money? To fall in love? To be happy? I don’t know, I don't quite think I know anything at all. I know life, I know what it is. But it doesn’t know me, it doesn’t acknowledge me from sunrise to sunset, but only for that small quiver of time that passes by every other living thing, where the universe seems to stop, I am whole and alive. My existence is nothing but a feasible presence to others, when I disappear to my beige cycle I cease to exist to the world. I'm lonely, yet I’d rather be truly alone, a state of individual collectivism. A world where I can see, where the only thing that can be heard is the ringing of my own mind. A world where I know and love myself.",2022-09-15 02:02:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1625535305,7,/r/lonely/comments/xek335/just_a_poem_i_wrote_because_im_in_my_feelings/,,0,1,"Just a ""poem"" I wrote because I'm in my feelings"

It took me my entire years of living to fall in love with someone for the first time, let my guard down and not be that ""strong independant"" person when I was with this person. I allowed him to see every part of me. 

Then I let him break my heart. Shattered and scarred completely beyond repair.

2921,xekkmw,Optimistic_Corner,"I feel lonely, some days worse than others to say the least. Haven’t had a proper irl friend since..6th grade? (Currently in college rn on my 3rd year, mainly been online). Was in love with socializing and still have a love for it but more just people watching now or meeting new people.

I use to have days where I’d just cry and stare at the moon for comfort as cheesy as that may seem. Use to whine my mom’s ear off about wanting friends. 

I’m at a place where I have an online friend, we exchange texts quite often. But when I or they wanna progress in doing stuff like voice calls or simply playing games together. I run away anxious and nervous and turn to this unconfident pile of confusion. It’s apart of the whole social anxiety thang I guess.

I’ve gotten use to texting anyone remotely near a friend. I get these highs when I wanna progress away from texting but then I shut myself out. Getting in my head. 
I’m working on it…I think.

I don’t have a want to go out with friends and get stressed out/nervous talking to anyone I’ve known longer than a week.

It’s annoying, on one hand I can stay in my house a month straight living life happily. But then there’s that loneliness creeping in my shadow, depressing me. 

I’m not fit to have friends, I just don’t work well in that dynamic. 
In my first semester of college when I had those temporary freshman pals (first time experiencing irl friends in a while), I’ve had a pal tell me “hey why don’t we go out” I go “what do you mean?”, she says “I mean outside of school, off campus”. I mentally malfunctioned for a sec and awkwardly wormed my way outta it, saying something like “I’ve havent done that sort of thing since I was a kid”, and proceeding to (theatrically) jokingly tiptoe away from the topic.

Idk where I’m at. I think I’m at a place where I should just have someone to text back and forth with? Wait until I get opportunities like a job or when I go volunteering to drain my need to socialize? I don’t wanna go out with friends, go over there house, it all stresses me out, and makes me die out of anxiety on the inside.

2923,xektmt,PsalmoftheSad,"It happened this morning, actually. 


A few months ago I met a girl through work and we hit it off real well in the beginning. Shit, we even went on a few dates together -- something I never thought I'd **ever** get the chance to do. I guess I did something wrong along the way or she just didn't like me as much as I thought she did, because slowly and surely the conversation started dying. When we first met it used to be a daily thing where we'd text each other. Nothing sentimental or mushy shit like that, but it was sure nice to hear my phone *ding* at work when it wasn't just my service provider texting me to let me know my plan was refilled for the month. 


I think it started to fall apart after the second date. We had dinner together, she *insisted* she'd pay -- we spent a few hours just talking in the parking lot. Hugged a few times and I choked at the very end when I was supposed to kiss her. I didn't because she made a comment on the first date that if she was interested in someone she'd make the first move.... Which she didn't. Still kicking myself that I didn't just go for it, though


I dunno what I should've done, but either way that's neither here nor there. I messaged her a few days back asking her why we don't talk as much as we used to, and she replied with ""I kinda just drifted away from everyone I don't really know"". I replied with ""Does that mean you want to stop talking? I'm confused""



No answer. 


So, this morning around 11AM I sent her the final text I'd ever send her : ""Right.. Message received"" 



I'd like to think I was the one that ended it but that'd be lying to myself. She's clearly not interested anymore and the worst part is I couldn't even tell what made everything fall apart.

She kept me going while I was in bootcamp the kinds made me feel  lost. I started to just being to myself more stopped eating for a while then just started to eat less.

I think its because of the over expectation. We're all sick of school, want to go to college, but we all see these parties and people smiling and we all think we'll have that and it'll be great but it doesn't feel the same.

I can't stop thinking about people back in high school no matter how hard I try, it's like every time I go to people I get the same response, it gives me a boost but I fall back down. I think having really good friends makes you focus on the past too much, makes you insecure about the future.

Like it's weird, I don't think I deserve the college degree that I'm shooting for, I don't know why I feel this way, but maybe it's a self esteem issue.

I think I let too many things carry me because I just.. I'm weak as hell and I can't handle words even if they're said through a text or something, it hurts.

So I’ve been out of my relationship for 3-4 months now and I had been feeling very low now for awhile. But today I decided to return my ex’s items and let me give this some context. she moved out and doesn’t have $ to drive and get the rest. So I ask a homie of mine who’s been there for me before I dated her, we went on numerous double dates with each other and dope trips! So I load up my car and we hit the gym first to get rid of any anxiety I had about this before going. We finish up around 10pm and make the trip down to her parents (where she lives now idk if that need context either lol) we start to pull into her neighborhood and let me tell you the pain in my chest and suffocating feelings rolling through me were loud. We get to her place and guess who is casually walking in front of there house yup my ex gf, so I pulled away and turned out of her neighborhood saying “why is this shit always so complicated”Steve(random name for my friend) tells me just pull up don’t say anything and leave it on the drive way. So I compose myself and we do just that. As I drive off he sees her walking back to her house. Later on the ride home he lets me know that my relationship was really abusive towards me. And now that I’m home and laying down I do feel some kind of inner peace. It’s actually a really nice feeling.

My most recent one was so vivid, it was her and me, under a bridge at sunset with a river in front of us. We were just there, cuddling, talking about nothing, watching the sun go down and before we knew it, the stars were out and we were just there, staring in silence and enjoying each others company and presence. It’s always a mostly faceless girl, no one specific, but the thing I always remember is just how beautiful she is and how comfortable and in love we are with each other. 
On the one hand, I love them, it’s the only thing that helps me fall asleep at night, but on the other hand, I hate it because I know it’s just a dream and something like that would never happen to me. Who in their right mind would want to spend time with me romantically? Let alone together by ourselves? I could only imagine how creeped out she would feel at the thought of it. It happens during the day and it just kills me to the point where I consider them intrusive thoughts, I can’t focus, it kills any happiness or feelings of hope I have for the day.

2997,xevm0h,Jurez1313,"If you don't know what I mean, well I sometimes have these dreams where I'm in a relationship. I've never been in one IRL so I think it's my brain's way of coping, giving it something it feels like it needs the only way it knows how. Typically, the only thing I remember from these dreams is a specific moment or feeling. Hugging before a dinner date, holding hands in the car, laying next to her in bed. Sometimes it gets lewd but most of the time what I remember most is the positive feelings of just being in ""her"" presence. It's never a real person, either, or at least no one I truly know IRL.  

However this time, the dream and situation was incredibly vivid. It was Christmas morning and I woke up next to her. I ""knew"" she was my girlfriend, and that our relationship was fairly new but we were for sure exclusive for lack of a better term. She was already awake and we just looked at each other and held each other for a while, kissed, had a shower (separately), then opened presents with my family. She got upset about something and I consoled her, held her close, and just felt the stress melt out of her body as she let herself relax up against me.  

That is the longest stretch of that kind of dream I've ever recalled. And I can remember exactly how it felt. The emotions of relaxation, contentment, and just genuine joy about how lucky I was to have her in my life. The physical sensation of her body pressed up against mine. The way her eyes lit up as she looked at me. How she turned to me for reassurance in a moment of stress.  

It's honestly a painful realization to know that it's all not real, and at the rate my life is going, it never will be. I know that it's an idealized snippet of a relationship, and being in one isn't *always* like that. But even if a relationship is like that *sometimes,* like, a few times a year? Where everything just feels right and I feel loved and at home? It'd make all the garbage I deal with in my day-to-day worthwhile.  

Sadly, I just don't believe that it will ever happen for me. Between my appearance, my incredibly boring personality, and my inability - or really unwillingness/lack of discipline - to make any changes to those two things, I can't see why anyone would want to enter into a relationship with me. Sure I'd be kind and loving and supportive, I'm a good listener and a great hugger, with a finely tuned sense of empathy and a knack for putting others before myself. But I'm also boring, lazy, irritable, and forgetful. I'm not physically healthy or attractive, nor am I truly mentally healthy either. Yet like I said, I lack the tools, motivation, and willpower to fix those things that are wrong with me, to become a more well-rounded person who someone might actually want to enter into a relationship with. Specifically, someone I also find attractive. Maybe that's my biggest flaw, my inability to find people attractive as a romantic partner if they aren't immediately attractive as a sexual one. One that will keep my alone until the day I die.  

Sorry for the long as fuck post. I rant too much too, yet another flaw in a long list of garbage traits I've picked up over my long and miserably boring existence.

3004,xexek3,Irregular_Topography,"Rubbish way to start my life on Reddit I guess posting here, but hey, here goes.

45/m - Separated for around 19 months now, got a 3.5 year old daughter. I live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment close to her childcare centre so I can collect her a couple of days a week and she stays over here/we do Saturdays together. I love her to bits, and whilst I've found being a parent insanely hard on my brain/mental health I do really love the time together, and when she's here I feel a bit more alive.

When she's not however my life is an empty shell devoid of any purpose or meaning, and I literally spend it trying to do my job / sitting on the couch / browsing the internet / writing code - all very much alone. I don't have friends I socialise with - 99% of them have moved countries now, and the one friend I do have is a parent also and we catch up on Saturdays when I have my daughter, so whilst it's nice it does nothing for the other times.

Today things really hit the fan - I'm planning a trip with my (ex)wife back to our home country over Christmas (which is hugely awkward but you get that), and my parents emailed today to tell me not to bother coming for any Christmas celebrations as it doesn't mean anything to them anymore (it does, they're inviting other family over). So now I'm left with my ex+my daughter having Christmas and inviting me out of sympathy (to hang out with all her family who quite rightly aren't fond of me (the split was 100% my fault)), or sitting very much alone in a foreign country wondering why in heck I flew half way around the world not to see my parents on what is a very special day for me - I haven't seen them in 3 years due to covid.

So... I'm a mess. It's gotten so bad that I've hired sex workers to come over and then just asked them to sit on the couch and talk with me - literally the only adult conversation I get other than the one friend - I'm not wanting to do any hobbies or such where I might meet people, and back when I did the only way to keep meeting those people was keeping the hobbies up - they were never friends but only acquaintances anyway. I used to think I was a nice person but the reality is I'm a lying cheating pile of crap - and so I have no right trying to get into any future relationships because I'll probably just do it again, right?

Been seeing a psychiatrist (different ones, over time) for years, been on all sorts of meds, currently on mood stabiliser/anti depressant/ADHD meds - but I've realised that it doesn't matter how much you medicate someone, medication can't provide hope, and I have none of that left anymore. I'm locked in this existence, suicide isn't an option as I have a daughter to care for, so this is where I'm trapped forever. I'm fully aware of ""this isn't forever and will pass"" ""just try doing a little bit of something and the good feeling you'll get from that will help you do more"" ""what you've done is forgivable you just need to forgive yourself"" and other such fucking annoying cliches but the reality is what I've done is unacceptable, it's torn a family apart, robbed my daughter of a family to grow up in, and that's hammered home every time I see her because she is now old enough to tell me she misses me and asks why I don't live at home with mummy. So I'm really over this. I've tried and tried and tried again with the mental health stuff.. but it's hopeless.

I just want to not feel so damn alone, but it seems like nothing helps and there's nothing I need/want that would make it any better.",2022-09-15 13:51:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663246311,5,/r/lonely/comments/xexek3/needless_wantless_and_feeling_incredibly_alone/,,0,0,"Needless, Wantless and feeling incredibly alone"

3008,xeyzts,YannisGoldoloupos,"When I was younger, I would never really get what people meant when they were talking about loneliness. I always had friends in school, I have a good relationship with my family, but I remember, one time when I was visiting my older brother after he started going to uni, he told me that he never knew what it was like to feel like you belong somewhere, but that he finally felt that because of his peers. At that moment I realized that I never noticed that I had always been feeling lonely, because it was simply my baseline feeling my entire life. I realized that I had never felt that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit older now, and the same way they say that tinnitus gets louder when you listen for it, I feel increasingly more lonely. For a long time I thought it was simply because of corona lockdowns. But since I actually started physically going to uni, I noticed that this feeling didn't go away, despite me meeting people and getting hired by the university as a tutor, which resulted in me being much more around others. I am a very outgoing person and I feel that I have a very easy time getting people to like me, but I haven't had the feeling that I have actually made a friend, since I was a teenager. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky enough to have a wonderful girlfriend, who is everything to me, but the feeling that keeps nagging at me is the one telling me that I will never belong. She has introduced me to some of her friends and they are all really nice people, but they aren't \*my\* friends. I always get the feeling that, although they do like me, I have just been brought along as the boyfriend and although I find them to be sympathetic people, I don't have any desire to ever befriend any of them. I find that that has been a general trend in my life lately; that I meet loads of people, but never have the desire to seek out their friendship, although friendship is what I most want.",2022-09-15 15:00:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663240423,5,/r/lonely/comments/xeyzts/is_anyone_else_here_feeling_lonely_despite/,,0,2,"Is anyone else here feeling lonely despite thinking that you ""shouldn't be"" given your circumstances?"

I already do most things alone, I don’t mind being alone, gotten very used to it, I like it, but not all the time. I’ve always had trouble with feelings of loneliness, but I’ve never been this physically separated from literally everybody I know. I’m tired of missing out on things just because I have no one. I’ve already missed a lot. It’s been like this since high school, I always go alone and then tend to just meet up with classmates but I don’t know any of my classmates here. Nobody. I miss out on so many things just because it depresses me to go alone. This is more specifically about events that are almost always very social, something EVERYONE attends with a loved one. This has been on my mind a lot lately, but what prompted this post is the county fair in my town this weekend, I want to go. I want to have fun like everyone else. I don’t want to sit alone on two person rides (sometimes u cant), or stand in long lines by myself. It’s painful. It’s painful to see. It’s not even that I care what other people think about me, I maybe do a little bit but it’s really much more than that. It’s a deep rooted insecurity that goes back years. It’s mainly the fact that I can’t get past this depression. I know I’d start crying right in the middle of the fair. I don’t know what to do, I just want to be loved but I think at this point that might be too much to ask for, maybe even just seen, fuck I wouldn’t even mind just being used at this point.

I try to eat less and do stuff but I have bad depression and a binge eating problem which makes it very difficult. On top of that I'm not really good looking anyway. My hair is thinning in the front and it just doesn't look good I don't want to shave it because I've always loved my hair and kept it long. 

I'm also very mentally ill. It was a very hard life growing up and it's led to a bunch of issues. The aforementioned depression for one thing I have horrible obsessive compulsions I wash my hands constantly and carry a spray bottle of rubbing alcohol with me. And I'm probably on the spectrum somewhat but I've never been diagnosed. Adhd is also suspected but again not diagnosed. Probably codependent too I never learned to take care of myself but I somehow also grew up too fast having to be there for my mother throughout life. Crippling social anxiety too i never go anywhere alone. Life time of issues that are going to take a lifetime of fixing 

On top of that I don't have a good personality. I never went outside a lot or had any friends because of the issues I mentioned before which started young and have only gotten worse. It's almost painful attempting to interact with people. 

There isn't anyone out there who could or would love someone like me and I can't keep pretending that there is and that everybody deserves that. Not everyone deserves a family and not everyone deserves someone to come home to at the end of the day or hold them at night.

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

3063,xf90cd,Tunaaaaaaaaaaa,"Hello,

I think this is my first post but I just needed to talk to someone who would listen. Today is the anniversary of the first time I tried to kill myself as an adult (I tried as a child once but didn’t know what I was doing). It’s been a really hard day for me and I was hoping one of my loved ones would want to spend it with me. 

But it feels like nothing has changed this past year, I’m still just as lonely as before - honestly even worse now, most of my family treats me like an annoyance or inconvenience and it just feels like the rest of the world has moved on and I haven’t. All of the people who said they’d be there for me or would change their hurtful behaviour didn’t. And I guess it’s not up to them but up to me to change who I surround myself with but I really just want even one person, just one who wants to be there for me and doesn’t just do it out of obligation. 

I don’t want to beg for love or friendship or acknowledgement anymore I’m too tired

Honestly I’m just so tired, nothing helps not medication, not therapy, not ect, nothing. And I’m just so tired of being so cripplingly lonely.

I haven’t heard from him in a month, and I feel completely alone and abandoned. 
For 10 years I’ve been surrounded by friends and I don’t know how to cope without having anyone near by. I’m trying to work on hobbies and throw myself into the job hunt but there’s just this ache of loneliness that I can’t get rid of. I feel on the verge of crying almost 24/7. I have a therapist and she always tells me “we have to learn to be our own support system bc people are not always reliable” which makes sense but at what point does being so isolated become unhealthy and unhelpful? And I of course have my parents but I do not have a great relationship with my dad and I feel on edge around him more than anything. And I just need someone closer to my age. I got my hair done today and was telling my stylist how hard it’s been. She said something about me joining her and her friends when they go out. Which would be awesome but I feel like typically people end up not following up.

So on paper my life is great. I am 26, have a good job; just became a homeowner; have a fulfilling life with hobbies and interests and goals.

But there is a hole. A hole due to not having a partner. I have not had much success; some chances for sure but nothing went anywhere. Luck wasn't on my side here let's say.

I try to live my best life and I encourage everyone. Focus on other things and make yourself proud. Heck feel great and hope the one who rejected you will come to regret it. 

The downside; well the more you bring the more you'll expect from a partner. But that's fine; I rather be alone than settle for someone i don't want to be with

I didn’t get to go to college and I have no desire to do anything with my life and even if I did I couldn’t actually get anywhere.

3099,xffqoh,JVM_,"""We'll find something in common"" has been the end of many arguments over the last 17+ years. 

It's probably all related to her ADHD, she's just happy doing her own thing and she forgets I exist until she finds a problem she can't solve or needs my help with. Once the problem is solved she goes back to doing her own thing.
Basically she's immune to FOMO, she just doesn't think about what others are doing, she's a true introvert (but looks like an extrovert when others are around).

My wife and I don't have a mental relationship. No favorite foods, songs, memories, games, activities, tv shows, places to travel to, weekend activities to do, hiking trails, exercises to do together. 

She never come to ask what I'm working on at work, or what I'm up to on my phone or asking what we should do together, those ideas just don't occur to her.

She's not good at remembering things we have done together and doesn't like making plans for the future. I think she's time blind, the past is hard to remember and so is envisioning the future.

We share a house, but ""home is wherever I'm with you"" definitely isn't true for us.

3102,xffz4t,Llorion,"Tonight I went down an internet rabbit hole that brought me to a song I used to listen to by Chicago called ""Will You Still Love Me?""

I recall listening to their 1984-89 greatest hits album on a portable CD player in bed, sometimes crying myself to sleep, at 17/18 years old.

It's 25 years later, and here I am listening again with all of those feelings coming back like a hurricane.

I still yearn for the true love that this song always drew out of me.

I think I may find her if I start using my head. I now realize that the feeling this song describes is what comes after making a smart decision in a partner and not going by looks/feelings as I always have in the past.

This song, to me, is an ultimate guy wants girl song. I always wanted to feel/think that ""I can't go on"" without her. I just hope I can still find her and am smart enough to know it when I do.

3112,xfgg3s,SouthsideRapGod,"22M here, got in my first ever relationship with this girl a few months ago. Things were going great, we made so many memories and things were moving so fast. We ended up living together after two weeks of knowing each other. Anyone who’s gone that fast with a person knows it usually only ends one way. 

Not to say I was free of blame for the relationship coming to an end, in fact I’d say I AM to blame for it officially coming to an end, but this girl was the love of my life. I had never had someone reciprocate feelings of love and happiness around me. I thought she was the one. So I gave her everything. Anything I could do for her, I did. I treated her like an absolute queen, and she must have got spoiled by the treatment I suppose, because she was never appreciative of any of the things i did for her, even if I spent the whole day helping her family, or bringing her all over the place to do things, etc. 

Well obviously you can imagine I got tired of my efforts not being recognized/appreciated. We began to get in fights damn near every day, and I would always end up having to apologize or do something to make up for it, or “earn my spot back” basically as if i was a piece of shit that she picked up off the side of the road and called her own. As if I didn’t deserve her, and had to prove myself every waking moment so she wouldn’t run off with the next one. 

So I eventually blew up on her, got really mad and got all in her face. She ends up calling the cops acting like I was a crazy person and I was gonna hit her, well let’s just say that’s the last time I’m ever gonna allow myself to fall head over heels for somebody ever again. 

All my life I’ve been betrayed and abandoned by those closest to me, and this is once again no different. Trust issues on 1000, just a damaged heart trying to learn how to cope with things I never should have had to deal with.

I miss her so much, but she’s long gone out of my life, and every day I still dream about her, and have to remind myself she’s gone for good. My heart is on the floor, but I’m just trying to pick up the pieces and keep going. 

Honestly I’m kinda looking for a new person to either try to love again, or even just as simple as a rebound, and ik this is probably the last place to go to look for people lol, but fuck it, lonely females HMU 😂🤷‍♂️",2022-09-16 03:36:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597689449,2,/r/lonely/comments/xfgg3s/trauma_after_breakup/,,0,0,Trauma after breakup

3125,xfi3an,Fresh_Hat8834,"I'm studying secondary 4 in a Singaporean school. Ever since i could remmeber, i was known as the popular kid beacuse of the fact that i talk to anyone and everyone. I practically have friends from every class and talk to many of them on a normal basis. 

I've been feeling this way for a while now but i think it would be easier to underdtand the context. I had a bestfriend in sec 1 and sec 2 which was the same girl and i considered her my bestfriend. But in sec3 we changes classes so we split up and we started talking lesser so we eventually drifted. In s3, I had a best guy friend. We called everyday and facetimed and studied together. I used to tell him everything. He then got a girlfriend so we also drifted. (I also caught feeling with him before he got into the rs so it didnt affect the fs as far as i know but just more info.)

Basically i have many different cliques, up to 3 but I don't have a bestfriend. Like someone to text everyday or share stupid embarrassing things with. Everyone that I am friends with have best friends and I also don't really click well with many people especially because of the facf that I am very outspoken. 

The other day i was in class and all of this information struck me. An I couldn't help but tear up and my teacher asking me if i was ok just made it worse. So i went to the toilet and cried twice. I've felt the same for about 2 years now so I tried to get used to being alone. But my love language is words of affirmation and I don't have anyone who affirms me. I kind of feel like I'm losing myself and I get angry at small things. 

I also don't have a boyfriend and I constantly complain about it beacuse I think that it is less pathetic to complain aboyt having no boyfriend than to complain about not having a best friend. I know that this is annoying to some people but I really just need someone by my side. It doesn't matter how many people greet me at the hallways f I don't have friend.

There was a point in time where i found prace in being alone but it is slowy getting to me. I feel like I'm going crazy by bottling up my emotions.  I am ending school soon but I'm afraid that this is going to continue in the future. I don't know what i did wrong and it really hurts.

3128,xfib7s,rcavictorman57,"I've been dealing with a lot of issues, lately. I have social issues, I am beginning to have separation anxiety, I've been thinking nasty things, I've gotten into porn, and constant masturbation, which thankfully I've greatly reduced, lately, and so far, I've entirely removed the porn from my life. I'm also depressed, and my mind's in a haze. I can't focus. 

One might be inclined to believe that it has to do with my ADD. No, it's not like that. I've been psychoanalyzing myself, lately. I've been thinking a lot about my terrible actions, things I've done, the reason I'm becoming a bitter asshole. Of course, these are all actions, and of course they are my actions, therefore they're my fault.

However, this doesn't mean that the loneliness hasn't brought me here. The bitterness is because I'm truly unhappy alone. I'm happy with myself, all things considered. Yes, I still have issues, but they stem from loneliness. I'm a complete asshole because I'm lonely. The porn/masturbation addiction is from the emotional bonding that I haven't felt in half a decade. I don't care about sex, though. I am only human, so of course I can't live without it, but cuddling, and her simply just being there is just as good in my slightly wider eyes.

The separation anxiety... I'm so lonely, that I get excited every time I come close to a possible date. All of them have been attractive, fit, and very sweet young women. I get excited, things work out, and then I get disappointed when I creep her out with the constant texts, and the ""I already love you"" nature of them. I'm the monster, and the reason I can't get a date, not women. I used to blame them. No, it's me, I'm just lonely, and that's my problem. 

Thing is, I'm happy with myself. I've enjoyed my time alone, and I enjoy my hobbies. I'm doing great, in the grand scheme of things, but I just have an empty void in my heart, that I want to fill.

I’m laid back, open minded, great sense of humor and love to laugh.  Huge sports fan, and knowledgeable about cars. History buff, love music, and I’m a well rounded kind of guy! Now, throw in an adventurous nature and freaky mind, and we could have lots of fun! 
Do you like Puerto Rican food? Have you thought about trying it but aren’t sure? Well let me introduce you to some. My favorite is white rice and beans with roast pork.  Amazing……but if that’s not your thing and prefer BBQ, or a great steak, we can do that too!
So what am I looking for?  Someone in a similar situation that isn’t getting the attention she deserves at home and is feeling unappreciated.I love women. All women. I do prefer maturity because to me, experience is attractive.  While I’m not able to devote a lot of time to a relationship (kids you know) I would love a friend I can share benefits with. Let me take care of you…..
Feel free to DM me, I’d love to exchange pictures if we connect.  I hope to hear from you soon!",2022-09-16 05:38:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653687998,0,/r/lonely/comments/xfit2g/42_m4f_se_wi_feeling_neglected_alone_and/,,0,0,42 (M4F) SE Wi. Feeling Neglected alone and Unappreciated

And to make matters worse I do nothing like I’ve sent 1 email all week. This job has nothing for me even when I beg for something to do. So that makes me even more lonely and bored.

3147,xfjm7h,a_summer_waitroom,"- This is a really long read and I apologise in advance to those who will care to waste their time with my nonsense, I've no one to say these things to so please let me speak my mind in here -

I've been having a terrible time more than ever the past weeks. Got cheated on and what little self-worth I managed to gain through these years from trying to heal from a past trauma -- all went down the drain. I'm barely functional and it's like being on an endless tunnel; I know it's hard but I didn't expect it to be this ultra difficult to traverse.

I've been on wild trains of thought, from self-pity to rage, to suicidal ideation, to trying to accept what happened, and to breaking down all over again. I cried and cried and stopped eating. Overworked myself and finally got myself physically sick from all of it. 

Just a day ago I suddenly felt an odd sense of calm, enough to stop all other thoughts that have been plaguing me for the longest time. 

I realised that I am alone. REALLY ALONE. 

Nobody will ever look after me and protect me and care for me. There's only me. And so my self-loathing needs to be the first to go.

Today I did lots of rumination on how I think of myself, how I really feel about being lonely, and what should I do with the rest of my life. 

I imagined myself 30 years from now, probably looking grumpy, ugly, and alone in a hospital with loads of health issues. Probably nothing left but cynicism and hate for everything and everyone.

Realised I would hate to end up like that. I'm in my early thirties and I know I can still do measures to start becoming healthy as I can. I'd rather be on an idyllic place living my last days away and actually be able to enjoy them without being in some physical pain and being unable to eat properly. I think I deserve to have that atleast. 

While on the issue of my health, I also started thinking about my current physical and emotional state as well. Even if I grow old to be alone, I'd probably still want people not to feel sorry for me too much and instead think ""She's still so fit and looks a little young for her age. She's kind too. Wish I had a gran like her"" kind of thing.

It's painful but I've given up on finding love. I'm messed up and with the kind of relationships I've been through it's clear I'm not the kind that people take seriously. I'm very plain looking too and all my traumas don't really help atleast make my character attractive. 

But while I've accepted I won't have someone love me for who I am and that no one would actually like me or be attracted to me, I still would want to atleast like what I see in the mirror. I'm trying to live with myself after all. 

I've never really used makeup and won't start using now. I'd rather have clear healthy skin even if I'm not beautiful in a conventional way and so I have resolved to take steps in achieving this. Lots of water. More veggies and fruits. Proper sleep. More walking. Skincare. Supplements. I might even try intermittent fasting. Maybe. 

Funny because I was looking at myself in the mirror too and noticed lots of unattractive things I can actually work on. I discovered I have kyphosis and it's bent my neck making my posture look terrible and with it I have double chin when I'm not even overweight. I have round shoulders too and I've been binging on YouTube videos for exercises and stuff that will help mitigate my condition or improve my posture again. If anyone has tips on improving my condition please drop a comment, I'll appreciate it so much.

I've also decided what I'd like to do with my life now - I'll save what I can and try and get myself to countries I've always wanted to visit in the next few years. Just me and myself seeing new lovely sights. Even just one other country would be nice to save for. 

I'll eventually leave this city I'm in and move to the countryside. Just in a tiny cozy home by myself, planting flowers and veggies. Maybe adopt a cat. Find nice little trails to walk through, read a book beside a brook, sleep under a tree. Sounds like complete fantasy but I'll take what I can to have a reprieve from spiraling back to thoughts of doom. 

Better to be alone and have nobody's nonsense and their emotional baggage dragging me down. It's best to live this way, away from toxicity and shallow affection. 

These are all just thoughts and plans for now. But it's a start. I'm going to start living for myself truly from now on and I'll work on making it worthwhile atleast.

If someone out there can even remotely relate to something from my post, I hope you find healing and you find yourself again, and it's okay to start from somewhere again. One day at a time.",2022-09-16 06:24:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1663248239,9,/r/lonely/comments/xfjm7h/today_i_realised_im_stuck_with_just_myself_until/,,0,3,Today I realised I'm stuck with just myself until the end anyway so from now on I'll try and make it a little better to live with myself.

3172,xfonxy,SawEdge,"I've seen it over and over again especialy on ""friend making subs"" and It's absolutely disgusting how little awerness there actualy is about mens issues on here. It's not just women it's men too though because a lot of them will never admit to you they feel this way or even understand their reality in the first place.
I've seen lots of posts from girls claiming that guys on these subs are looking for girlfriends and are mostly creeps. The reality is that most men are so emotionaly neglected that over time they become muted. Hit with an emotional club until they realise their emotions don't matter. Like putting a matress over a pea, It's there but you can't really feel it. They are only left with anger and a bit of happiness from time to time that can shine trough the cracks. First because anger is inherently an emotion that can not be unlearned and secondly because happiness is not an emotion they are generaly reprimended for too much. The neglect makes us long for an emotional outlet and the only people we can really connect with without being looked down upon or getting genuine sympathy not the watered down version we feel because of our neglect are girls. It's so easy to start having feelings of affection for a girl when she is the first person to show you sympathy in your life and firls will often abuse it as well and make guys give them money. That's usualy when you will get ghosted because "" you are getting creepy"". I'm not really asking for any change with this post, all I really want is some sympathy for men.

3188,xfsh08,psumaxx,"From age 18 to 25 (I am now 27) I have been in the Hare Krishna cult/Iskcon. After a serious mental episode (not directly tied to the cult experience) I realized that they were indeed a cult and that I was a fanatic follower, so I left officially. I founded the group exHareKrishna on here.

But many aspects of hindu culture still stayed with me and help me every time in times of depression. Many of my interests are still tied to it, although I don't want to visit a hare krishna center nor associate with their devotees anymore. 

In the cult, they had strict rules for devotees who wanted to be considered as serious, such as no intimate relations outside of marriage. Even dating was looked down upon. The most ""pure"" way would be to contact the elders and for them to help arrange an engagement with a devotee of your choice. Or their choice. I followed this, never got to the engagement stage though.

Anyways. Now I am 27, I have been on dates after leaving the cult but felt like, even though the people I met up with were really kind and genuine, I just couldn't really relate to them.

This has gotten better as the years went by but still, when it comes down to shared interests... I just don't really share any with people because in the cult they urged you not to engage with the ""materialistic"" world, and so I am naturally not fond of movies or clubbing or drinking, even after leaving those mindsets.

I am starting to seriously consider going to a different, hopefully more open minded, hindu temple, but I am not really religious anymore either.  🥴

3222,xfxpbc,Harry-Is-Dead,"So at the end of the year 2021, I got into a relationship with this girl I know who is my soulmate, she is my happiness if I must say.

Now I’ve had a friendship group of eight of us for 10+ years, we mostly communicated through our computers as it was our gaming devices. when I first got into the relationship I would still go on but for smaller amounts of time. Because the games that was out didn’t peak my interest. I still invited them out for plans over the months but they was constantly saying “Can’t make it” or say something has came up.

Two months ago my girlfriend and her family went on holiday for a week and I went on my computer everyday to play games with my mates as we haven’t done it properly in a while and everything was perfect, our jokes, humour, gaming, etc.
After a week went by my partner returned and I still went online the day after but they’ve all became blunt with me and started disappearing out of the call one by one and started hanging out in private calls without me. I eventually called them out in text and they only responded “lol, salty?, be mad” and this went on for the past two months. So I stopped going online unless I went on for a couple hours now and then to play a single player game.

Fast forward last week I asked if they wanted to play the new Call of Duty Beta Next Weekend in our social media groupchat  and they completely ignored me but then continued to talk about it with each other saying how excited they for the new mechanics, guns, gameplay.

Today at work I decided to check discord and saw that I was removed from the discord group and I instantly went on our social media groupchat and asked them why? Their response was “you forgot us when you got with your S/O now you want to play the call of duty with us?” And I briefly explained to them that I was new to a relationship and wanted to spend most of my time with her and not constantly sit on my computer. I also mentioned to them that I always made plans and asked them to play games but they would sit in the private calls and ignore me, But no they wasn’t having it.

After this I said to them “ but Steve (FN) has done the exact same as me, he hardly goes onto the computer anymore to work on his life and spend time with his S/O” and they completely ignored it.

Me being an incredibly socially anxious person just feels so lonely now, my partner can tell I’ve been feeling down for the past couple of weeks and has been comforting me but I don’t want to tell her because it would seem pathetic but it’s so hard for me to make new friends and I just miss them frankly but they think so little of me now because I got a partner.",2022-09-16 17:36:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1522470880,3,/r/lonely/comments/xfxpbc/my_friends_have_fallen_out_with_me_because_im/,,0,2,My friends have fallen out with me because I’m happy and have a S/O.

3248,xg19ui,ze-us26,"I(22m) have been lonely all the time but I had made my peace with it. When I had broken up with my gf(last year) I had a coping mechanism of feeling denial of what happened. One year has gone by and loneliness didn't hurt me. I did not bother her at all. I tried my best to be the good person. I really loved her and didn't want to hurt her in the future. Though I thought I had moved on, I hadn't. I couldn't imagine a future at all. I could not date another girl, not even think about another girl.

I don't drink or smoke, I have zero addiction to any kind of drug. But, somehow, i tried some whisky yesterday, felt a little good and called her to let her know that I have moved on(I expected to get the closure i was craving). I thought she would be angry for disturbing her, but she was happy that i called. Listening to her voice after an year overwhelmed me. My coping mechanism is broken now and I am feeling anxiety.

All the memories came rushing in and I just don't wanna remember it. I don't want to remember the time being not lonely. I want my peace with loneliness back.


WeWe met today. I heard about the guys she dated after me and how she is single now. On the other hand i couldn't even approach another girl because I felt it would be wrong. I was addicted to loving her, even when we were not together. I feel like she has moved on, but I hadn't. I feel left behind. The loneliness is crushing me. I feel like i am one of the guys she dated, while she was something special to me. I know this is irrational thinking, but I can't stop it. Our relationship was 4 years long, with the one year break till now. My mental image was that it was good while it lasted, but now, i feel like that ""special"" feeling was an illusion. I was never complete and never will be.

Please stop putting so much empathesis on your birthdays, especially if you have been alone on them on the previous years. 

Celebrate yourself alone, treat yourself with something nice. **It is YOUR day. YOUR day**. No one has to be there with you. No one has to buy you gifts or make you feel important but yourself. 

If celebrating it alone bothers you, get up and go out. head to a restaurant, invite a friend to watch a movie with you, go to a bar and celebrate with others.

&amp;#x200B;

**In many cultures around the world, you should treat others on your birthday. You gift others a dinner and thank them for coming to celebrate with you.** 

**If no one remembers your day, you remember it, celebrate it, and have fun.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Personnally I don't celebrate my birthday. MY family use to go crazy over birthdays, then they stopped which also did a mental number on me. I always felt like people were suppose to remember my life and date of birth. I use to call people at 12am to wish them a happy birthday, buy cupcakes, or small gifts to people who were important to me. No much was done in return. Doesn't mean I wan't important to them, **our values were different**.

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting.

- Women Primary Controled
- Many Women Are Aware of This
- This can cause a significant portion to become toxic because they know men will have to settle
- People in my age range either has already settled, have physical attributes or personality attributes that are unfavorable and/or do not want traditional relationships (ie FWB, one night stands, ect), this applies to both genders
- People tend to ghost or more appropriate ABANDON others, which contributes to long term mental health issues
- People who want traditional relationships and have good qualities such as myself cannot find a partner, yet again contributing to mental health issues

3343,xge2kl,OldCrustySock23,"I feel like my first time was with the worst person. I consider myself a smart guy but I'm very impulsive and just really depressed, lonely and insecure. I try to hide it all the time and put on a facade and sometimes feel like I have high functioning autism. About 5 months ago a woman started working with me and she was classless. Tattoos on her hands, legs.. would subtly flirt with every man who came through the store, plenty of red flags. She was 30 but behaved like a teenager and wasn't bright at all. Had three children to two ex's who she kept in contact with and was very overweight although she was pretty and curvy. She began flirting with me and treating me like I was special. Bringing me gifts, calling me handsome, sending me love messages, etc. I ended up falling for all of it and lost my virginity to her in her car. I knew she wasn't the right person but I was impulsive and wanted the experience, and she was making it easy. We hooked up 4-5 more times at her place and she was very loose, letting me do whatever I wanted. She quit the job out of nowhere about 2 months into it and started pushing me away. I asked to see her one last time and we did but after that it's like she just lost respect for me and found out how I was. Either that or became bored. I was her boytoy but I caught feelings and now it's torturing me. Three months after seeing her the last time I'm so depressed and going in circles. I feel so worthless that I still try to text her and I've fought for the truth and answer to why she dumped me. I know the answer is obvious but I'm in denial. She strings me along and calls me silly in a flirty way but will only say just enough to keep me guessing. She lied about changing her number and she blocked me from her snapchat stories but still continues to keep me desperately guessing with minimal effort. I feel so stupid and worthless and can't believe this is the person I had my first sexual experience with.

3352,xgeomz,fishstickhamburgers,"I'm onto my senior year of high school and god it's awful. There is so much work to do and I don't even get to see my friends half the time due to timing conflicts with classes. I can't even spend the weekend with a single friend or even my boyfriend because everyone's so goddamn busy. Every day is starting to feel the same, I wake up, go to school, go to practice, go home and repeat. It doesn't even help that I don't have any close friends on my team because I'm new. 
What hurts most was finally having the hope that I would be able to go to a hotel this summer after graduation and to literally relax and destress with my boyfriend or at least a single friend. But no. Everyone is either gone or fuckin busy. My bf promised me we'd get to see each other more often now that we'll both be 18 and not have to abide by our parents rules/expectations but I don't even believe that anymore. He's recently stated that even after graduation he still has to listen to his parents... I'd have to wait even longer til he gets a dorm so literally that start of college and he said that there would be plenty of us time during college because what we're majoring into is easy...but it's not. :(
He said this last year that there would be more time for us but I honestly see no time ever. Why is it that I'm not so freaking busy like everyone else. My mental state is literally like my friends who are cramming in all of their work and studies. 
I kinda just want to give up. I want to give up being positive and finding a glimpse of hope for the smallest chance to hang out with someone. I guess I'm just more sad about never getting to see my bf ever, which then makes me seek out my friends but they're all busy too.

3357,xgf6a5,MakeItFast2020,"I’m in my late 30s, divorced with a kid, and honestly I could do a lot of work to improve myself physically. I wouldn’t say I’m exactly a catch or what anyone probably sets out looking for. 

Thing is, it’s impossible to even know. I work in a field that is predominantly women. Somehow, every single person I come across has a boyfriend. And usually not just a boyfriend, but one they’re living with and have been serious with for several years. Those are just the ones who aren’t already engaged or married. 

I met a woman recently who seems like she’d be the perfect fit. Pretty, funny, into a lot of the same quirky and nerdy stuff I’m into. We seem to get along really well. I doubt she’d give me a second look anyway, but who could ever know? Because surprise, she’s engaged! At least if she was single and turned me down I wouldn’t have to wonder “what if?” 

Women I come across on dating sites start out fast and then fizzle out just as quickly. I’m starting to think that’s not really the place to meet people for a real relationship. I’m also starting to think that all the good ones get partnered up in their 20s, and there’s nothing left for an old washed up loser like me. 

Is anyone good and normal still single!? Is there the remotest possibility I could meet someone when I have such limited free time as it is!? Or should I just accept that love didn’t work for me, and resign myself to being alone for the rest of my life?",2022-09-17 06:43:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606800385,2,/r/lonely/comments/xgf6a5/why_is_nobody_single/,,0,2,Why is nobody single!?!?
3358,xgf9ci,Ok_Rough_5662,"All my life I have had a group of friends. From elementary school through college I always had a group of roughly 4-7+ friends who I hung out with regularly on the weekends, texted and talked to during the week and could rely on to talk about problems and drama that might be going on in my life and vice versa. I have been through 2 long term relationships, one 1y in high school (semi serious) and one roughly 4y(very serious) that ended right after college. I bring this up to show additional context to my utter lack of loneliness throughout my life. 

Everything changed however when I went home from college during COVID (this is not an anti lockdown rant). I graduated 2020 and we were all asked to leave a couple months before the semester ended. I went to college on the east coast but grew up in California. My parents moved to a new location I have no familiarity with 7+ hours away from where I grew up and went through school. So when I went home to live with them, despite the fact that many high school friends were rekindling old bonds and meeting to some degree or other during lockdown- and especially as quarantine began to lift, I could only see my old high school friends on the rare occasion I decided to make the 7 hour drive to see them. My friends from college live mostly on the east coast or have gone back home and regrouped with their old friends from high school. 

My problem has only become worse as time has gone on. Although the market was rough in the beginning I finally got a decent paying job in my field (62k year) and can now move out of the house and hopefully somewhere I can meet some people. However, it’s fully remote and I have no opportunity to meet anyone I work with. I slowly am losing contact with my friends from college as we text less and less, and have had no social life for two years and running.

I go to bars frequently to try to meet people but it’s always nothing more than chatting and a few games of pool. Never anything that becomes an actual friendship where we would hang out for fun or do anything outside of share a drink at the bar. Ive gotten a few girls numbers and made out at the bar a couple times, but nothing comes to any level of seriousness or intimacy, which isn’t surprising since until recently I have had little to no money and live with my parents. I joined a jiu jitsu class, but again nothing becomes an actual friendship, we just roll- shoot the shit and go home. I try to get a few guys together to do something after class, but since most of them are college students they already have school friend groups and I suspect hanging out with a townie a few years older than them is not that appealing (although I’ve had a couple brief successes). I also go to the gym frequently and talk to a few familiar faces but nothing more than that.

Im so lonely I can’t stand it. I don’t know what to do. Even though I can move out anywhere I want I have no idea where I should go because I feel like this problem will just follow me. I have no real friends and do nothing but stay at home in my room all day.

3360,xgfj0j,No-Lizards,"I guess I'm writing this just to get my thoughts out there. I (17F) have been alone for as long as I can remember. I only had one or two friends in elementary school, then in middle school we stopped talking because we no longer shared classes, and I've been alone since then. I have very bad anxiety and autism that makes it hard for me to make new friends, so I went through all of middle school, high school, and now I'm a freshman in college with no friends or anyone I know. I have a few online friends, but even they don't seem to care about me much.

Now, I've used social media before, I'm semi-active on Twitter and Instagram, but I mostly follow accounts regarding my interests, like games, fashion, make-up, etc. I caved and downloaded Tiktok a while ago, and it's definitely made me feel much worse about myself. I see so many people my age and younger living happy lives with their friends, significant others, and family, and I start feeling awful because I never got to live that life. I feel like I missed out on so much because I never had friends growing up. It makes me feel more alone and empty than I ever have been before.

I'm doing a course that I love and have high hopes for my future. I have good friends that I can always talk to and a loving family that always has my back. But despite all this I feel lonely, I mainly feel this way when I have nothing to do, like right now. I basically have a 3 week break from now until I go back to studying, I dont feel like playing games, I dont feel like going out, I dont feel like watching a show, if im being honest I just want someone to talk to other than my friends or family. I want a meaningful relationship with someone who I will love and will love me back. 

I feel like the only thing missing from my life, is a relationship. I've talked to my best friend about this for years and even though he gives me advice and tells me that I'll find someone I still feel hopeless. I have told him this, but I am envious of his relationship with his SO, and the same goes for many other people my age who are in relationships. I just feel like everyone else seems to be able to find a relationship easily while I'm here with nothing. 

I'm a quiet guy and I feel like this puts a lot of women off. I don't have a problem talking to women, I lived with my mum and sister for half my life and have had female friends throughout the years. But when it comes to flirting or trying to get to know someone in hopes of a relationship I jusr can't seem to do it. I also feel like most girls my age don't want a relationship, most just want a one night stand or go for guys who treat them like shit and leave them 2 months down the track. 

I've tried dating apps (tinder, bumble, hinge etc.) with no luck. I get a few matches and talk to them for 5-10 mins and then never hear back from anyone. I don't know what it is but I try my best to talk over text but it's just not the same as it is in person, half the girls I've matched with have nothing on their account and don't reciprocate any energy I give in texts. 

I can only blame myself really, I don't go out enough to meet people and when I do I'm always reserved about talking to anyone. I'm just scared that if I continue this way I'll never find anyone.

I had one good friend who is now my roommate but Everytime I think about how our friendship only exists because I put in the work , how if I make plans she never shows up ,how when we had our 2 month vacation she never could find 5 fucking minutes in 60 days to call me back or reply to my texts but was on call with her bf for like 8 hours ever day,how she never remember s my birthday,how she never even gives 2 shits or even notices if something is wrong with me, i start behaving very toxic.

I have given my everything to every friendship I made but iam never ever a priority for anyone. I made excuses for them , thought they were busy or had a bit of social anxiety like me but I see them doing everything for thier other friends but can't do basic shit for me and I realize its ME.

3381,xghiz2,TalkingTapeCassette,"You might be in a spot in life where you think people are better off without you in their life and that you only make things worse, but there are people who value you and they might be closer than you think. A lot of people feel anxious around others, and don’t want to be perceived. I used to feel like this actually. Choose to be patient with yourself because of all of these thoughts and emotions you have and your loneliness. You’re only human.

I used to see myself as next to worthless and thought I didn’t deserve to exist because everyone else is a better person than me. That’s actually how I found this sub 2 years ago. I was feeling so alone because I thought people didn’t understand me. I haven’t visited it much since. 

All of this is to say that yea, we struggle in life and we find it hard to connect with others sometimes and sometimes we are hurting a lot but remember that you matter and it’s okay to feel emotions even if they’re negative. It means you’re alive. Maybe everything won’t be okay and maybe bad things will happen to you for no reason but know that there's people that are here for you, like me.

Anyways, it’s late where I’m at and I’m tired so hopefully everything I said makes sense. If not, that’s okay.

The past two years are really hard for me. I tried for competitive exams to do my post-graduation, but didn't get a expected results. I'm a introvert &amp; I didn't have much of friends. Actually had two friends in my close circle, both of them had their rough patch and I was there for them. But when I go through my hard time, they didn't care. I even tried to call them couple of times, but the response was not great. It's like I have been watering deed plants. I know they have their own life..own battle, but i really cared for them, talked to them when they needed me most, all I expected was the same. Because of this , I started to think that people uses others to get what they want &amp; ditch them. Nowadays I thought it's better to be alone than to spend time with these selfish peoples.

These very same women demanding a 6'4 tall guy would date a guy who is 5'4 if they met him at a wedding. That short guy you see with a partner at the store? He is very unlikely to have met her on a dating app. It is probably at a mutual friends party.

3394,xgjum5,Chewbacca319,"Hello everyone who stumbles upon my post. Although I can't speak to every single one of you directly this post is for you, all of you.

Personally, I want to thank you for existing; for waking up in the morning and continuing to let your heart beat. You have no idea how much value you have. I know that life hasn't always been easy or kind to you. There are so many things that are traversing your body, mind, and soul that unfortunately you have to burden. I know you didn't sign up for this, I see you're alone, exhausted, sad. Despite all of those things, and all of the experiences you have had to face up until this point, here you stand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything about you, all of it that makes you uniquely yourself is nothing short of beautiful. Your smile, your laugh, your mind, your body, your interests, hobbies, ambitions, everything that makes up you, is priceless. You may have your doubts, or not feel valuable at all, whether that's from external factors or internal. Regardless the reason, I am sorry and I hear you. You're not to blame, you're not at fault. I may not know what's going on in your mind, behind closed doors; know that you are not alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It brings genuine joy to my heart that you are here today. Please do not ever stop being you, I love who you are, you're as perfect as perfect gets. All of those voices you listen to or hear that make you think otherwise are wrong. If everyone was the same, there would be no individualism, no contrast, no vibrancy. The light you cast radiates awe-strikingly.

&amp;#x200B;

Know that you are loved, that you matter, forever and always. I hope for your safety, for your happiness, for your fractured heart to heal and pump faster then ever. Thank you for giving me your audience, I notice you, I hear you, I validate you, and most importantly, I love you.",2022-09-17 11:19:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1527662657,41,/r/lonely/comments/xgjum5/dear_rlonely_thank_you_for_existing/,,0,7,Dear r/lonely. Thank you for existing
3395,xgjyqx,MiserableAd1310,"This is my first time posting here, so sorry if the content isn't a good fit.

I'm going through what feels like a break up for a relationship that never even started.

I'm 28f and I've had plenty of past relationships and this person is 26 and has had no relationships. He thinks very poorly of himself for not having a job even though he is in school, busy working on a career for himself and taking care of his mom. He started talking to me just intending to be friends and we realized we have an absurdly high amount of common interests and similar communication style and values etc. 

You can all judge me for this if you want but I was still in an abusive relationship when I met this guy. I know that not everyone understands but I have had to come far enough to learn how that abuse affected me and even though all my friends and family had told me to leave that relationship of 7 years, I stayed and kept pouring myself into it at my own expense. It was awful for my mental health and I didn't realize till very recently but I was living my life half asleep with very little sober awareness of what the future entailed. Its not uncommon for people to react this way to long term abuse.

I know some may wonder what was so horrible about my past relationship and if you want to know I can get into it but its not really that important to the post and its quite convoluted and hard to reflect on, so if you want to read some of my past posts, go ahead, or you can ask me directly but I don't want this post to be too drawn out.

I initially broke things off with this guy because I started to notice that I was really falling for him after he was there for me in a really horrible situation. I saw him deal with conflict well and he showed me kindness when nobody else did.

After telling him that I had to say goodbye he said he hopes his future wife is a lot like me. I was really apologetic about the whole situation but he said that it made such a positive impact on his confidence. I loved hearing that because he is such a badass and he's hilarious but serious when its appropriate. 

At that time I was still intending to work things out with my abuser but it really didn't work like it used to because I finally started to sober up and start retaining the patterns of his cycles and realizing how badly I needed to get out. I felt like I was dead inside, pushing myself through life was such a chore just to get through the days. I was talking to a therapist who actually suggested we maybe shouldn't work it out, and that helped me see clearly as well.

I eventually did break down and start talking to the guy that I was falling for again and told him how I felt that he awakened dead feelings inside of me and I missed him so much. He was shocked that I hadn't gotten over him yet and he comforted me through what I was experiencing. After talking to him I felt like everything was gonna be ok and I didn't even know or care why. It gave me the strength to finally face my abuser and end my relationship.

It wasn't long before I started grieving the part of me I left with my abuser and I was in a weird place trying to figure out why I felt so empty and alone and it drove me to act very needy with this new guy.

I think as much as he liked me, the experience probably left him feeling a huge weight on his shoulders like he had this expectation to live up to now. We only know eachother long distance and it was for a short period of time then suddenly I'm leaving my relationship and wanting his attention all the time. 

I felt him pulling away at that time but I didn't really know what to make of it because he told me that his goal was to make me happy in a healthy home because I deserve that and he said it in such a positive way like that he felt good about himself and his desire to do that. Around the same time, he had told me that he is really careful what he says to me because I've had a hard life and he doesn't want to hurt me. He said that its like I entrusted him with my emotional investments and he doesn't want to betray that trust. I told him he can just say how he feels to me and doesn't need to be afraid of hurting me.

That stuff didn't really match up with how much he suddenly started pulling away from me in my head, so I spent some time feeling that scarcity feeling like ""oh no, what if he leaves?"" I was torn between just breaking it off with him and the idea that I only have one shot and I can't mess it up. I tried to just give him space but of course I just smothered him instead. 😅😔

I couldn't really blame him at all but I had to bring it up because I needed the truth, if he really still felt the same or if I was making him uncomfortable.

I really don't think I interpreted his response correctly at first because he just kept saying how special and amazing I am but just that he can't be the man that I need. I really didn't consider that he felt like he was supposed to immediately move me to his state and start taking care of me because I actually take care of myself just fine and it will be easier now that my abuser won't be leeching off of me. 

He kept saying that I need someone who is there physically, not some ""loser man child who is between jobs."" I just explained what I want which is basically already what he was giving me besides the fact that he was pulling away, and I asked him what he wants and he just kept saying that I'm everything a guy could want. 

I told him I was really confused and I tried to explain to him some positive traits I see in him that he should not be so hard on himself for. I told him I wasn't going to argue with his decision to say goodbye but it was weird that he was trying to tell me its what I wanted. 

He left and came back to this conversation with several hours in between twice, so I was starting to get a bit ticked off. Finally he explains that he knows he will screw up his first relationship and doesn't want it to be with someone so special and I started to get it.

I told him it just sounds like he is saying I'm a wife material girl and he isn't ready for that yet but can't see me another way. 

The next morning he agreed and said he will probably regret this if in 20 years I'm happy with some other guy but his decision is final.


I don't want to try to get him to change his mind because I have more respect for myself than to do that, but its hard to feel like this person who just broke my heart broke his own heart too. I don't blame him for wanting to be alone. When I replay everything I honestly can't see him feeling any other way, but I'm just not sure if I should say that I get it now and its ok or if that gesture would just come off like I'm pestering him at this point. 

I would appreciate some advice as my relationship skills are pretty much all based around my childhood wounds and now I've got some new wounds too so as much as I would like to trust my gut, I know it either gets me too attached or I fall into the complacency of just letting emotional manipulators own me so that I won't be alone.",2022-09-17 11:25:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644729931,8,/r/lonely/comments/xgjyqx/should_i_leave_him_on_read_forever_or_tell_him/,,0,5,Should I leave him on read forever or tell him how I feel?
3396,xgk95x,Wazz-Flama,"21 M here, every time I try to make friends with folk it’s always one sided. I’m always the one trying to contact people to hang out, always the one asking people how their day is going and if they need anything. I always ask questions when they tell stories and get interested. I even tell jokes and make up stories to get people to laugh and have other reactions. Is it that I am just boring? I don’t understand why it’s so hard for my “friends” to ever contact me back. It be nice to have them one day ask how I’m doing out of the blue, y’know?

I try to be interesting. I’m into writing, sketching, painting, reading, videogames, and weightlifting. I try to keep up with current events to talk to with folk or topics that’ll interest them. I’m trying to not be lonely anymore, it’s fucking killing me. The severe depression, the schizophrenia, all the bullshit illnesses I gotta deal with on a daily basis doesn’t make it any easier. But I’m fucking trying to be normal, I want to have a small handful of close friends and even find a gf. It’s just, whenever I’m trying to be social, no one shows the same amount back. I know that relationships don’t work if someone isn’t the one to start a convo, it just would be nice if they would keep up with me too. 

If I just stopped contacting them, they would never hit me up, never ask how I am, nothing. It’s like I just don’t fucking matter to them despite them telling me I’m their friend and they wanna hangout and chat but they never do. If that’s the case why don’t they just tell me to leave them alone? I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. Sometimes I feel like just giving up overall on people and staying alone because what’s the point if no one wants to stick around.",2022-09-17 11:40:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1551710265,5,/r/lonely/comments/xgk95x/no_matter_what_i_do_no_one_wants_to_be_friends/,,0,2,No matter what I do No one wants to be friends.

3398,xgkgbf,rainfallmice,"I don't have any reasons to why i am still alive. I have suicidal thoughts and urges every single day. And although I dont act on them. The urges to hurt myself are so so strong. 

I have never self harmed (well as far as i have never cut myself). I have feelings about self harming but I dont.  

The last time I had an suicide attempt was at 14 (took 16 paracetamol but got really sick and have not attempted since.    

Also havent done this in a few months &amp; probably doesnt count as a real self harm. But some days I used to not drink anything for days on end in an attempt, the longest I somehow went was 8 days without drinking anything? Dont know how I am still alive. 

Anyways some reason I always gave up &amp; got scared and ended up drinking something so I did not die of dehydration.

All day everyday I fantasize/daydream/wish that some accident would take me out, that someone would kill me or that I would get seriously injured. I feel I deserve pain and to die. 

The only reasons I'm still alive is cause i guess I am scared of dying. (Even though I have suicidal thoughts and feelings literally every single day, I am still really scared to attempt again)
I mean its stupid. My mental health is only getting worse every day but I am still here.  

Well I dont really want to die but I dont want to be alive at all. I wish I was never born / never existed in the first place.  Dont know if that makes sense. 

I guess I'm scared of death/dying. I mean I feel kinda some comfort in the fact that I could just be dead and gone from the world at any time if I wanted to.

And when it comes to actually tryng  I cant get myself to for some stupid reason. I have suicidal thoughts everyday but I'm scared of death if that even makes sense.

Every day I wish bad things will happen to me. I genuinely need to be hurt, tortured, abused, bullied, hated. 

I always wish/fantasize/daydream 
about the worst most horrible things to happening to me all day everyday. 

Like getting hit by a car, being stabbed/beaten up, breaking bones, being abused &amp; r*ped &amp; tortured, being bullied &amp; kidnapped &amp; attacked, getting into fatal accidents, anything that hurts/causes pain &amp; trauma.  

Really I should suffer the worst pain &amp; worst things imaginable. 

Its not like I enjoy pain but I feel I deserve it because of how I lash out on others, they dont deserve it of course. 

I need to be treated like shit. I am just a worthless piece of shit. I dont deserve to be alive or to be happy.

Lowkey wish someone would hurt me &amp; kill me. I deserve to die &amp; be killed &amp; tortued in the most guresome, painful, drawn-out, horrific, way.

I hate myself so much for how I have treated other people. 
I really dont desvere to live, trust me when I say, I really am a horrible unstable disgusting person. 
 
In the past I have blown up on everyone around me (as in as recently as a few months ago, i blew up again). I hate myself so much. I am so fucking disgusting and repulsive. I have ruined every relationship I have. Anger issues &amp; lashing out over nothing. Fights with people close to me. All I do is make people miserable so why should I be happy? Exactly I shouldnt.

NO this is NOT a joke edgy troll post. &amp; If you say that I will block  you.

I am girl &amp;18.I have no friends. I have never had a boyfriend/never been on a date, still a virgin (obviously), never been asked out, no one has ever liked me or has a crush on me, never even had a kiss yet. 

I am not even good enough for a relationship. There is really nothing about me that is good or interesting. 

I am EXTREMELY ugly &amp; unnattractive. I  I always look really sick (even wearing makeup &amp; dressing up - my face still looks deformed and I still look like a corpse). I am beyond hideous. 

I have no hope dating because I always look ugly - no matter what I do my face ruins everything. I am so unnatractive. I am really ugly so I know no guy is going to ever like me. As much as I want a boyfriend, I cant because I am so ugly. 

I dont even have a good personality either. I am so boring, negative and annoying and stupid. There is NOTHING good about me.

And I am a loser. I have no purpose in life. There is literally nothing I'm good at &amp; anything that I enjoy. I have no motivation to even do anything. I have no skills or no social life. 

I have no purpose. Every day is the same, it feels like i am stuck in a loop but I dont even have motivation to fix it. Im too depressed to do anything.

Also I have experienced nothing. All I do is stay at home all day everyday. I am patheitc. I’ve experienced pretty much nothing in life. I am a pathetic loner and loser. 

I dont talk to anyone. Literally all day everyday I am by myself on my own. I have nobody. I feel like a waste of space and a burden. I don’t even have friends no one to talk to. I cant even talk to people online cause I am so awakrd cant hold a conversation or find anything to talk about.

3410,xgllkz,Nassssty6824," I made a post on r/AITA but i figured i just vent here. I made a post abt my dad who wont pray for my succession because i want to quit my rugby club (their prayer are pure as they took care of us as a child). That incident was long ago and i got through it. I changed my mind a week later because i think the next month we got our  selection for a runner for my school sports day. Well there were faster runners than me and i didnt get selected. Anyways, also at that time my friend who is very tall handsome and fast told me i shouldnt quit my rugby club. During our sports day selection, he wasnt there as my school were competing with other schools in like running so... yeah. Our school got 4th place out of 47 schools. He didnt come to school for a week as he was competing. Right after he came to school, he got selected for sports day at my school straight away. After that, he became popular, had girlfriends, friends from another class and became really fucking popular. Then sports day come and he competed against people who were less faster than him. At the end of the sports day he was the mvp. Then he didnt look at me (im not gay)  talk to me or even making small talk at me. I was devastated. Well he left me to be friends with bad people who vapes. So i left him too. I cursed behind his back and start to hated his guts but i still cant move on like that part in The Notebook were rachel mcadams told ryan gosling to leave but she didnt meant it. i felt like that.

3412,xglr17,DiogoSN,"Hello everyone.

I see a lot of posts and comments in this subreddit about people having bad results with dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble and whatever else you can use. I'd like to throw my suggestion into the ring: don't use these applications and uninstall them immediately if you're not getting any results. Don't even bother burning money with any of their premium services.

This post is mostly aimed at the male perspective of the issue as this is mostly affecting the male user base. Studies made to these dating applications show that about 20% of the male userbase actually get results with 80% of the female userbase. The rest do not. There are many factors to this but mainly because of photogenic reasons, high confidence, genetic lottery luck, social connections, photo editing, and app algorithm manipulation.

So, I don't know what's everyone's specific situation in this subreddit when it comes to dating apps, but I can tell you my experience. I also don't get any results from these apps for one reason or another and that radio silence feeling is awful because it makes you feel undesirable completely. The premium subscription didn't really help either. So here's my recommendation: if these dating apps do not work for the first 5 days or less, then forget about them completely. It is worth not getting this horrible radio silence feeling rather than not.

The unfortunate truth is that this will not be the way for your to get a romantic companionship going and you will need to take initiative in other places be they physical or online. It sucks and I personally gave up on the notion of dating, but if you so wish for companionship, then this is not the way. You have to take the initiative as bad as it is, I'm sorry. No one will care unless you highlight yourself.

Have a good one everyone.",2022-09-17 12:53:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1384373979,78,/r/lonely/comments/xglr17/tip_about_dating_apps_dont_use_them/,,0,77,Tip About Dating Apps: Don't Use Them
3413,xgm3xi,Kiwiland2001," 

My name is Kav. I am 21 years old while writing this.

I’ve been living in England since the 21st of July 2022, exactly a month after my 21st birthday.

I’ve been struggling to make any connection, any friendship since I’ve been here. I didn’t think it would be this hard. I didn’t think it would be almost impossible to find someone that could care for me as much as I could care for them. Something I’ve realized recently is that for a year or so I slowly stopped caring about myself and cared too much about what others thought. I slowly began to hate myself without even realizing it, putting up a facade of being this sort of martyr that wanted to help others while being the most hopeless person I could ever be.

If I recall correctly everything started when my ex girlfriend, Eva, broke up with me at the end of march 2021. It broke something inside me and only in the last few weeks I started to get over it even though I thought I had got over it during the summer of the same year.

Before the breakup I was starting to get better. I lost weight, I was active, I was running and working out. I stopped eating excessively and was following a caloric deficit eating all the delicious things that my mother prepared for me with love and care. I also stopped smoking and drinking alcohol in that time frame before falling a part and starting to go back to those toxic and unhealthy vices that plagued my mind and body for quite some time. After the breakup I had many setbacks, I was doing worse in school, I never studied, I skipped for almost a week and it was easy since we were in lockdown and I gave stupid excuses to my parents saying I was studying more while I was wasting my time in bed, endlessly scrolling through social media trying to cling to any type of attention that people gave me. I didn’t talk that much about what I felt with anyone and I think that was a big error because since I stopped talking everything got worse and worse. I was overeating, smoking and drinking, I was on the brink of tears many times and kept feeling sorry for myself. 

That same year I failed my last year of high school, it was my fault because I never tried hard enough, I never showed any interest in anything and overall I was feeling empty. I was a total disappointment for my family, I was a total loser but had some little support from my close friends.

Something clicked in me that summer because I started to draw again, I was making a new drawing every day without stopping, I started to work in a bar and spent quite some money on manga and a couple of books. I was feeling truly happy but it was just a facade that I was putting up to cover my wounds without actively trying to heal them. They did a little but still I wasn’t addressing my pain, my weakness, my sadness. I was putting everything under a rug trying to not look again.

The year 21/22 was better, I was doing decently in school, I was having a nice relationship with my parents and I also finally got my driver’s license after almost two years of procrastinating.

Everything was going well. I thought I was healed, I thought that I was getting better but I still haven’t come face to face with the fact that I never liked myself, I hated who I was and sometimes I thought about doing something but no, I didn’t budge. I was going to be this way until now.

The time I spent alone here made me realize how many faults I have, how miserable I am, how pathetic I can be sometimes. I’m always running after people like a puppy without ever being someone that loves himself before loving others. 

What is my point writing all this stuff? Well the main reason is to create some order in my mind retracing the steps that lead me to this point where I feel as someone who doesn’t deserve any love because I’m not giving any to myself. 

One other reason was to write this stuff down, read it again after some time and look at how much progress I’ve made. Because deep down I know I’m not the failure I think I am. I know I’m worth something, I know I can be someone who could lean on when everything is dark and I don’t have anyone.

I hope you, anyone that reads this, found something relatable, heck, even got a little inspired by my short story I just wrote down. I hope everyone’s having a good day, wherever you are don’t ever forget to love yourself. I shall remind myself as well.

We spend time online and hang out when we can. But I am romantically lonely. And I am not sure what to do about it. My friends can't really help with this. I don't know if anyone really can. I know I am also going through a depressive episode which of course doesn't help. 

But as of late I have been sad and lonely, I have been rather obsessive of my ex. She was an amazing person and we didn't work out and I ended it about 2 years ago. But due to my mood I can't stop thinking about her. She made me the happiest I have been in years and I want that happiness back, at this time I want her back too but I doubt that would be a good idea and its likely just the loneliness talking. She broke me out of my depression and helped me leave a very abusive relationship after years of neglect and abuse.

Honestly, I just don't know what to do. In all other aspects my life is going well. I have a new career with a good salary, I am able to do more things with my friends, I am picking up more hobbies I have been wanting to do for years but didn't have funds/drive/confidence. But I can't get over the fact I am alone. Its depressing, I should be happy and excited but I can't stop my brain from focussing on this one situation. 

I do have mental disabilities (ADHD, Autism) So perhaps those contribute more than anything else. I guess really, I just want to stop feeling like this and writing about it helps a small amount so, if you read this. Thank you.

3442,xgqj3w,ThrowawayJ10112,"I was relaxing and playing some PC games mindlessly this evening, nothing special - when I got a call out of the blue from a friend of mine who was hanging out with their own group of friends and getting high together and hanging out. This friend called me to help them ‘stay steady’ for lack of a better term since they were tripping on acid at the time and said that me talking to them would help. So I stuck around and talked for a bit.

The longer I stayed on the phone though the less I wanted to be there. I was on speaker talking to other people there too but as the only one not there in person and also not high, I was the odd man out. And whilst they all insisted they wanted me there to ‘vibe’ with them, I couldn’t shake the feeling I was killing the mood for them too.

I stuck it out for over an hour on the phone but afterwards it kinda killed my mood and I don’t really know why. It’s kind of like, it made me realise that other people are living fun lives and sharing these experiences and I’m holed up here just on my pc again.

I think it similar to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. I was in blissful ignorance just going about my evening but now I’ve seen my friend have other friends, and have fun with them, without me - and I kinda just wish they didn’t call at all. It’s not like they could’ve invited me, since this friend lives in a whole other city. 

I know already that all my friends have other friends and have fun without me, but I was a proverbial fly on the wall, just sitting at my desk and participating in an event I was not actually part of, and it just felt hollow.

I wish I could’ve been there but instead I was at home on my pc, again. Just like every other night for the past decade or so.",2022-09-17 16:11:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1411756601,3,/r/lonely/comments/xgqj3w/hearing_other_people_have_fun_killed_my_mood/,,0,3,Hearing other people have fun killed my mood

Here's a little game, it works like this:

We start at 500.  If you are a boy/man you just say 501. So boys count up and if you are a girl/woman then you count down so if a boy said 501 then you have to say 500 and then another girl has to say 499 etc.

Boys/men count UP and girls/women DOWN

if the boys/men got to 1000, the boys/men won, but if the girls/women got to 0, the girls/women won...

We live in the same country but different cities and we met in Discord, hes been keeping me company as the pandemic started. And since school started we havent talked in a bit.

I enjoy talking about anything and everything, and listening to anything and everything! If you have something you'd like to talk about, come to me! I'll enjoy listening, and adding on to the convo! 

If you're curious about what I look like, I do have a picture of me in my favourite dress. However, I'm a bit too shy to share my face at the moment!

3482,xgv8d1,DeliciousMadame84,"Several perpetrators collectively took away about a decade of my life. Today is the first month I've finally gotten to live a 'normal(ish)' life as a survivor.

I started uni and submitted my first last-minute, bs essay for one of my courses. I finally get to live the procrastinating, broke student life. I cried a little when I realized I'm actually back where I left off.

I ordered some yummy delivery yesterday to celebrate, and I'm looking at Etsy artists to create a custom medallion to commemorate the amount of time I've lived my life on my terms as a survivor. It'd be inspired by the AA medallions (which I discovered a week ago), and I'm thinking of having three keywords on the medallions: Resilience, Reparation, and Reclamation. I'm still thinking of a slogan to surround the keywords and a quote for the back of the medallion.

If you want to celebrate with me, I'd love to be friends (20+ only)! I'm slowly, but surely, developing a social support network of friends who will support each other emotionally, in esteem, with information, financially, and/or in companionship. I'm a curious, nerdy, genderfluid foodie who enjoys learning and reading.

3483,xgvbgl,SufficientAd1194,I started college about a month ago. I was very excited to start a new chapter in my life. I had always felt stuck in high school. I had some close good friends but I never felt liked I was valued or wanted in the group for various reasons. I also was dating a guy in the the group. I had had a crush on him for years prior to is actually dating. Once college had started we had been dating for about 1 year and half and decided that since we are only 10 minutes from each other’s colleges we would be able to make it work. I thought we were doing a really great job. We texted when we could. Only talked on the phone if we really had nothing else to do. We weren’t keeping each other from starting our lives at college at all. Within the first two weeks of being here we had only seen each other once. However about 3 weeks in he abruptly broke up with me. I didn’t get an explanation or closure. I am sad to have lost him as a boyfriend of course but due to little issues we had had in the relationship I knew it was probably for the best. However I’m more devastated about losing him as my best friend. I have had a rough time meeting people at school and none of my high school friends have made much time to see me.  I also found out my aunt that I’m very close with has cancer about a week after the break up. Things felt like they were getting a little better but then last night I had invited my high school friends who all stayed in the area to celebrate my 19th birthday with me. I hadn’t spent a birthday without my ex in 5 years and my aunts diagnoses has been hitting me hard so I was really looking forward to having some company and a little piece of home with me on my birthday. However they all canceled yesterday just hours before they were supposed to go to dinner with me. I ended up at some party last night and drank by myself. I’ve just never felt so lonely in my entire life. I feel like I can’t catch a break.

I've had periods of loneliness that drift in and out but recently it's lasted for longer and so much more painful.
It feels like my sadness is irrational and the stuff that triggers it isn't even that big of a deal. An example. I joined a drama class at my high school( which is a big step out of my comfort zone) and it was alright for a while until we had to create a skit with a partner. And I just froze. I knew a few people in that class but as I looked around I realized everyone automatically had their partner and I was the last one left out.

I just have these thoughts in my head everytime I see someone I like of "" you are too ugly she will just find you creepy"" , "" don't approach her its weird "". It sounds all so stupid and I know if is stupid and it really is holding any prospect of a love life for me back. 

There is a back story to this, I was heavily bullied as a child from 12-16, and my confidence has been shot ever since. I also was bullied mainly by the girls because I liked a popular girl at school so that meant I had to be bullied for it. It was a horrible time, and now when i see a girl I like it sounds dumb I think she is just going to bully me or her friends will again. 

I do have interests as well, I like to cook, work out, rock climb, run , read, play guitar and more. It isn't I don't have stuff to talk about, it's I can't get over that mental hurdle of talking to the girl I like without thinking she is finding it creepy.

Whether it be irl or online. You come across someone you admire in some way but realize they appear so talented or funny and you feel inadequate as a person. Putting yourself down. Feeling you wouldn’t have a chance with them. 

For me, I’ve been exceptionally lonely as of late. A few days ago, I see some short in my YouTube feed that I watch. I liked it and figured to check their other content and see if I should sub. And I had this moment that this person seemed so admirable and wonderful. I could tell they were smart and funny and even creative. Not to mention she could sing. I’m such a sucker… I feel pitiful. 

It made me think that if I was to meet this person in real life I’d have no chance. No way, no how. 
Reminded me of all the times I ever felt that way when I met people in person. 

What do I have to offer? I would hope I’m funny. I know I’m smart. At least I’ve had folks say so instead of it being my opinion that I’m those things. 

This wouldn’t be the first time I’ve felt that way. Admiring people online, thinking about what if I meant this person in real life and would I even make them have a second thought about me? 

What impact do I have? Here I am wishing for love so much. Desperately wishing and wanting that it’s discouraging to remember that even though you may find someone you connect with but worrying if they like you the same way. If you are worthy… 

Because look at all these amazing people who can sing. Dance. hobbies. They have something about them that makes them magnetic and I’m just… not. They stand out. 

I’m just me. I wish could sing. Hell, I try in the car… 
And something about me I don’t tell people is that I often imagine myself dancing when I’m listening to music. Feel the rhythm and beat but I can’t see myself performing anything remotely spectacular. 

Of course there is more than just singing or dancing. Or play an instrument. But that’s all it took to rope me …",2022-09-17 22:57:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1500857751,4,/r/lonely/comments/xh08dc/do_you_ever_come_across_people_you_like_but_they/,,0,1,Do you ever come across people you like but they seem so wonderful that you feel you’re not good enough?

....Anyway, I am trying to find the courage enough to ask this person out but I don't know how to yet, I'm shy scared and mostly don't want anyone in my business in person, but the reason I'm can't stop crying is because I like this person i think they're cute, and funny. 

 it's what the person said back to me when I ask ""are you okay today, just asking how are you doing, you seem off"" and my crush response to  ""im fine."" ""What"" ""oh you want the whole truth, I'm depressed, I hate my life and I want to kill myself "" 

I literally couldn't even bring words into my mouth I wanted to say something but I couldn't tell if that person was joking or just didn't want to hear me speak, or was serious it just mad me feel sad and hurt, I wish I could tell that person how I feel but and need em' know I be for real and really care, which is why I asked and that I go through the samething too ""correction gone through once before""

3605,xh6rh0,[deleted],"When I was younger in university I was pretty popular - but mostly because I had the best notes. Now that I'm working a white collar job, everyone else is trying to climb the ladder. Nobody really needs notes anymore - they're looking for notes on you to throw you under the bus.

 I don't really open up to strangers because of the stigma against having invisible disabilities. I basically appear normal on the outside but I cannot drive a car for medical reasons. I'm not sure if I ever was popular with women, but I had no trouble getting the first date in uni. But the moment the girl starts asking me what kind of car I drive the convo gets awkward and I don't ever hear back from them again. I'm kinda worried about not being able to start a family and raise kids because I do want to have a support circle when I'm old, and I love children. My bosses love my performance but my team hates me because I make them look bad. They've been isolating me and not inviting me to the bar to spite me (not that I would drink with them anyways). I

I also don't really appreciate the ableism from some progressive types in the big city because of my race and gender - I am of a demographic that seldom graduates university and seldom works full time. It's like my struggle is invalidated and all I am is a paycheck. I have to treat exercise, diet, and sleep in a ""religious"" manner and cannot even drink caffeine for medical reasons. Everyone sees me as some toxic gymbro freak.

Life isn't so bad. I am introverted so I have been spending the last year in doing calisthenics instead of lifting as a new hobby. I recently learned how to do a handstand press and I got a raise at work so there's that going.

3619,xh7juw,Own_Discipline2351,"I’m 28 with a lot of unhealed childhood trauma (like many of us). My mom was addicted to pills before opioid addiction was really known/talked about. 

As a kid I just always assumed my mom was sick. I just didn’t know what exactly was wrong. She would have baskets filled to the brim with different prescription bottles. I really didn’t have any reason to question it.

She was also bulimic around that time and would throw up all over the bathroom and then pass out. (Guess who was left to clean it..) And at 12 years old I started being a mother to my 9 year old brother and my mother. 

I remember waking up covered in pills and her nodding in the corner mumbling about not being able to find a certain pill. The very first day of middle school she passed out while painting my nails and I ended up missing the bus because she never found out where the bus stop was, her solution was asking a RANDOM women to take me to school. ALONE. At that time she met a random man at a gas station and somehow got him to move us in with him the next night. We weren’t homeless but she had free range to do what she wanted if we weren’t living with family. So that was her solution. And it didn’t happen once it happened TWICE in the same neighborhood. The first guy was in a wheel chair but would come out of his room every night to watch me sleep(we slept on the living room floor). I would wake up to the smell of cigarettes and as soon as I’d open my eyes he’d be there. I told him to stop and his response was (you’re too beautiful when you sleep.) I later found out that my mom offered sex for us to live there and when she wasn’t giving I. He’d set his eyes on me. He grouped me, at 12 years old. The second man was a Vietnam vet and his as was CRAZYYYYYYYYYYY! Like pulled a knife on us crazy. He would call us stupid mother fuckers, and again my mom was offering herself to him. Why do I know that? Because she woke me up out of my sleep one night high as hell and told me all about it. I was 12!!!!

I can write a book about it all, from making me drive an hour to “hang out together” only to be made to drive to her plugs house, being in cars with drug dealers she couldn’t pay and genuinely fearing for my life. Her lying to the guy we both went to for weed and saying I would pay off her debts and never telling me she was saying that to them, so when I’d go they’d be expecting a lot of money from me. Her calling me stupid and randomly beating the shit out of me because she’s also bi polar. 

In a nutshell. She was never there and when she was she made my life hell. I remember in 10th grade she called me at school just to tell me she didn’t want to be in my life anymore. When I was pregnant I freaked out and wasn’t sure if I wanted to keep the baby and asked her to keep it a secret until I told the dad. My family and extended family knew all about my situation the next day.After doing all of that she disappeared until a few weeks after I had my son. She almost dropped my newborn on the floor because she nodded out mid sentence. The next time I saw her was at his 2nd bday where she showed up 30 mins before the party was over. She was nodding out and trying to cover it up by talking to my co workers and friends WHILE NODDING OUT! 

I cut off all contact after that.  3 months later she got someone to put her into rehab where she got clean and stayed clean. My sine is now 5 and has a close relationship with her. And I love that for him. She goes to the park, cooks for him plays with him and does everything any devoted grandmother would. 

I guess my inner child is trying to come to terms that I’ll never know what that feels like, I got non of that growing up. My brother did but never me. I was called fat, asked gIve up my dinner most nights because she spent most of the little money we had on buying pills but my brother still needed to eat. 

It’s hard because I know she’s sorry and people fuck up and she’s clean now, but I still struggle so much as an adult and parent. I’ll catch  hugging my kid and thinking “ I never would have gotten this from her” 

I feel guilty and want to let go of this jealousy because I know it won’t give me a new childhood .

3622,xh7u1d,Embarrassed_Duck_434,"Over the past 7-8 months after I had an episode of psychosis, I’ve found myself becoming more distant from others. I frequently avoid social interaction and honestly get really nervous talking to others even if they are familiar faces to me. It infuriates me that sometimes it feels like a strenuous task to hold a conversation with others and I have such negative internal dialogue with myself. I want to be better, to associate myself with others, and actually put myself out there rather than being alienated from the rest of the world. I am comforted by the numbing effects of my phone, the senseless scrolling, and my television. I really only speak to one person consistently and I don’t really like the way that this particular person treats me. I don’t really set boundaries and friendships/intimate relationships aren’t exactly my area of expertise. 

Prior to my psychotic episode though, I really only struggled with depression and anxiety, had substance abuse issues (which unfortunately led to my psychosis), and had behavioral issues.

I have a best friend, but they have so many more people who are important to them. I have a friend group, but they are all so much better friends with each other than me, and it sucks.

I used to have a best friend. Things happened with her personal life in the past year and I wish I could just know that shes having a rough year and maybe thats why shes distant but I can't. We would do everything with each other and were ride or dies. I was there for her. I was always there for her but when summer started she decided that she didn't need me anymore. I asked her what was wrong and I never got an answer. Not a real one anyway, the most I got was that I was invading her. She basically ghosted me and wouldn't even talk to me really. Seeing my best friend hang out with other people and not talk to me sucked ass. I wish that she still loved me like I love her. I wish she knew how much I need her and how much I love her. I wish she would let me be a part of her life again. 

Its been 3 months since then, and though things are better its not great. I spent time with the group last night, and she did talk to me in a positive way, but it was still awkward. For context we are all on a team together, and in a specific group where we are all a friend group. There is another girl there who I talk to about everything, and she talks to me and when we are just texting things are great and she makes me feel seen and appreciated. But when we are actually with other people its like she forgets I exist, she only wants to be around the other people.

They hang out with each other without me, they have a group chat I'm not in but still know about, and it hurts because I used to be such good friends with all of them but now that they have found better people, its like they don't need me anymore. When we are around other people in the group its fine, but when it gets down to me and the other 5 of my main friends, I become invisible. I wish I was invited to things, and I wish that I could just get my best friend back. 

I wish I felt like I wasn't invading every conversation I'm in. I wish that people texted me. I wish that our families were friends so I could actually do things with them. I wish they invited me to hang out with them one on one like they do. I wish I had real friends.

Now when i entered the class most people were already at there seats and i was kinda the last one to sit down so i don’t take it super personally but other people who weren’t here that day chose to sit in another empty seats instead of me when the empty sit next to me was the most closet to them and now i’m the only one by my self. It litterally feels so awkward. The worst part is that there’s like 2 people there that hate me and i bet they use this as proof that i’m a sore loser with no friends and they probably tell other people that i got no friends cuz  i’m “rude and werid and creepy” when that’s litterally not true cuz i did nothing to be rude or werid or creepy. Now In history class i sat infront of someone and they moved to another seat. This same shit happened to me like 2 times last school year… People even sat a seat away from me before as if they didn’t want to get close to me. Another time a girl sat a seat away from me when waiting in line. This is just fucking sickening I feel like it’s because people spreaded rumors about me but it’s also just because i’m ugly.

My parents divorced when I was 5 so I had plenty of time to get over it but today, it's kinda hard, my friends are having a slumber party without me and I can't talk about a with my mom so I'm venting here 

My parents divorced cus my mom cheated on my dad I never felt any type of hatred or anger towards them.
Today I had an intrusive thought about an incident where my dad destroyed a photo of me during a heated moment regarding the ownership of the house he bought when he married my mom, she gained my custody so he had to give the house back to my mom. He didn't want that so the police was called and they get him and his new wife out. 
I wasn't present at that moment but I know the story cus my mom told me. 
After that happend my dad disappeared of my life until I turn 17 to either give him back the house or sell it and divide the money.
He said that it was my mom fault and stuff but that wasn't true cus my mom try many times get him to visit me but he never return the calls. But I had no interests in the house so I just gave it to him of course with my mom conditions, he had to pay for my college education until I finished not until I turn 18.
And that small intrusive thought make think about the bigger picture, like 
-he paid 3000(like 80 us$) pesos in child support and still try to make it less.
- after he lost custody he stop visiting me.
- he only came back to wanting to spent time with me when it was time to give back the house at 17. (He said things like ""I'm gonna make another room in the house so you can visit me any time"")
-he never apologized for vanishing when I was 6 he keeps saying it's my mom and grandma's fault.
I used to justify his actions a lot cus I thought ""he was deeply hurt by mom so its ok""
-And now I'm in my last semester in college and he stop talking to me again, we where in good terms, I thought but it's been 6 months and he's gone again.
It's not much but the impact of keep being abandoned by him it's kinda hard? I don't know how to feel, I feel like I can't be mad. The worst part is that I been in therapy for this but everytime he comes back or disappears he brings just empty promises and takes a big fat dump in my self stem.
My family from my mom side never talk badly about him until one time that he called me out the blue when I was 14 and said he wanted to drive me home from school but I told him that he needs to tell my mom for permission and he said ""no I can't talk to her, I guess we won't do that"" and I came home crying.
I feel like it's a lot of stuff and I can't talk to my friends cus I'm supposed to be the one who has her shit together also don't wanna ruin their fun and I don't want to bring with my mom cus I don't want her to feel guilty for the photo story I feel isolated, I can't talk about anything to anyone cus they will think I'm weirdo with daddy issues and will lose everyone like in highschool.",2022-09-18 06:33:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622965147,3,/r/lonely/comments/xh97fx/is_my_dad_a_good_person/,,0,5,is my dad a good person?

Alcohol was something I wasn't addicted to but I was always relying on it when I wanted to distract myself and be more ""sociable"" and open without considering me as a person who was an introvert and who actually wanted and need time alone to learn to love himself.

Nicotine was the same thing, I always had a vape between my lips, always puffing and I got tired of what it did to my mind. It relaxed me and made me nervous at the same time. My heart wasn't physically doing well and I always felt fatigue when walking the stairs or doing anything physically demanding.

I stopped looking for sex, for affection, the desire for things that makes you more miserable. I still masturbate but I don't go looking for sexting, to people to interact with desperately because it just hurts you even more.

3669,xhesl3,tarotaurus,"I'd say in my first two years of college I struggled a lot with loneliness and depression. Now it's changed to where I'm still alone most of the time but now it doesn't make me feel sad. I do get bored though. I'll look at social media and see people know doing fun stuff while I'm just at home. Currently I have 3 jobs, am a full time student, and involved in a few clubs but I still feel periods of boredom somehow. I gave up on forcing myself to socialize and I think that's why I'm not sad anymore. I put my energy into hobbies such as art, playing instruments, shopping, and going for drives with my camera. For some reason it feels wrong though, like I'm supposed to have a friend group or else I'm not really human.",2022-09-18 11:59:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1586232216,2,/r/lonely/comments/xhesl3/alone_most_of_the_time_but_not_sad_anymore/,,0,5,alone most of the time but not sad anymore
3670,xhg7ux,Springroll_asia,"I have been in a relationship with this guy for about 10 months and He triggers my suicidal tendencies. I have been admitted to the hospital 5 times in the span of our relationship.

From the start I have already told him that I have ptsd and whenever it triggers, i trigger my eating disorder. I have been diagnosed with these and do monthly check ups with my psychiatrist. I have disclosed this already to him from the start yet he said he can take care of me and can understand my situation. 

3 months were great. He was truly understanding till i did not know what happened. He changed, he would still try and talk to me everyday, that has not changed but he became lazy.

He would easily get mad at me and raises his voice when he gets too jealous over little things. He always makes a fight and it triggers my ptsd. He gets mad when i cry or when i go to the hospital cause i attempted to kill myself. 

He promised to changed but he still stayed the same. He cant do any small requests I asked. But if he asks something, even if i am uncomfortable. I do it cause I thought it might make him change. 

I haven’t been happy anymore even though i still held on to that promise he said he would changed but it has been 10 months and when i do try to talk about break ups with him, he would not accept and keep bothering me.

and since this year started, I'm feeling even more lonely than ever.   
Friends are turning their backs on me and don't hang out with me anymore and everywhere I go, I'm just alone. Playing Games by myself, watching movies alone and listening to music all day, cause there is nobody to talk to.

 Since I'm 14 I had this distressing feeling, that people don't actually like me, but some years later I just shrugged it of, because everybody told me, the opposite was true.   
Now I just sit in my room, hoping I get a text back.  
I have a terrible problem talking about my real feelings and this might push people away, when I only talk sarcastically and make jokes about everything.I don't know how to win this people back, cause i have probably damaged everything so bad, that there is no going back.

3683,xhjcp8,DavidClarkeIsINNOCEN,"As a man, I envy not only his looks but his demeanor and personality. It's something I could never have. For looks: I have forehead lines, receding hairline, high eyebrow ridge, I'm skinny at 50kg and only 175cm, a soft voice that does not sound manly, and an asymmetrical face.

For personality: I used to think I am not a boring person as I feel I have a lot to share, but the more time goes by I realize people just fade away from me- which makes me think I am not that interesting as I thought, especially with someone like Cavill. He has so much to say. I think even if he just talks about a dog he'd get women so excited and immersed.

I'm often seen feminine, I suppose. I don't have very manly features, my personality is pretty laid back too. It doesn't help that I have long hair (which I cut recently) and have to wear glasses because of myopia.

Well as for self improvement, I've been working out for a few days now and drinking protein shakes. I don't know if it'll help me gain weight which has not been easy for me throughout my life.

PS: To the people telling me to accept myself and that I'm just different, I don't know about that.

3691,xhkub1,Doubtingcynic,"So i don't know how long its been, 4-5 years i think, or rather the day i left six form I've had no friends. 
My life consists of 'wake up, work, family, bed' and with my days off its just rest. 
I can't vent my emotions, I've always struggled with that since during my teens. 

But now i desperately miss the feeling of having friends. People to talk to and have fun with.
I feel like I've forgotten what it feels like, how to even make friend or what friends do. I feel like I'm just too desperate to even attempt to make friends. 

The only people i talk to are complete strangers online, and even then it takes quite alot of energy to find online friends and maintain them. In most cases they just ghost and never come back to respond, other times i get involved in roleplays where after sometime the same thing happens. At this point roleplay is an escape from my boring life, where I can be someone I'm not. Its pathetic i know, why don't i just improve myself right?

I find myself constantly and literally talking to myself when ever im alone and I've done that for what feels like my whole life. 
I fear I'm self destructive about making friends yet i don't know if its intentional or not. I just despise this constant feeling of being alone. I've got enough problems as it is... 

I don't know what more to say or how to convey myself. I just feel awful, i just start to cry and breakdown and then nothing. I just feel dead inside and i don't know what to do. 
How can there be soo many people on earth yet im alone. Soo many people are lonely too!

To make things more complicated i suffer with depression and social anxiety. I never got the proper help growing up and i am constantly battling the two on a daily basis.
I've tried apps, meetup is pretty useless where i live and the good ol fashioned way of making friends just seems impossible.",2022-09-18 16:16:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1507674440,3,/r/lonely/comments/xhkub1/young_adult_struggling_and_not_sure_how_to_make/,,0,1,Young adult struggling and not sure how to make friends.

3705,xhnt6p,becharvi,"Istg i (21f) have a very sad college life. Up until year 12, I was always very involved and popular(school president in year 12) but I was always sort of lonely. One of those popular loners. Everyone loved me but not enough to hang out with me or make and include me in plans. I always hoped this would change in Uni/College as I would find like minded people or just get to start over since no one would know anyone so I could start fresh. My first year of college began in the pandemic (2020). I was supposed to go abroad for my graduation but that didn't work for me financially, thanks to the pandemic. I was already bummed out about not being able to go abroad and I wasn't able to make any friends in this new institute. Everything was online and I didn't know how to make online friends. I finished my first and second year and now finally, in my third year, I begin college (June 2022) with lots of hope that I'd make friends and have a group of friends that'll be friends for a long time. I live around 2.5 hours away from college so my parents were also super kind for renting me an apartment closer to college so I could make the best of my last year and have a great social life as well. Well, now I just feel like a loser. None of this happened. I'm once again, the popular loner. Everyone knows me, people say hi to me in hallways but I'm always alone when I'm walking in these hallways. I'm also always sitting alone in classes. Teachers love me, the clubs I'm in love me but no one loves me enough to have me around for longer. I have no one to call my friend, forget best friend. I'm not seeing anyone and given how I look I don't think anyone would ever be interested in me. I just feel so... alone. I go to college, attend my lectures, attend all my extra curricular activities, come back to my apartment around 2pm and sit all alone with my thoughts till it's time for me to fall asleep around 12pm and follow the same drill the next day. I want friends, I want an S/O. I don't want to be alone but I think I always will be. I know I always will be alone. I'm going to die as the lonely dog lady.

Firstly, thank you for all your suggestions and inputs. I have tried some of them out and they haven't come into effect immediately but I can see them working. I have also resumed running (to the person who suggested it to me, thank you!)
I have been introspecting a lot ever since this post. I have come to realise that this pattern has persisted throughout my life and there is definitely something in me or the way I behave/am that's causing this.

I guess it’s because me and my older brother stopped talking for years and I replaced him for a older sister figure I met on discord .

3730,xhqmh0,Cyberdarkness_Dragon,"Hello, lonely people. Yours truly is here to make you feel less lonely. I was shy and reserved back in my 13-14 days, and no one was there for me offering a hand. Now I'm here and I realized I need to use my social skills to know much more people, hear their stories, make them the most comfortable they can possibly be and being a good friend to them.

If you wanna barge in, feel free to DM me! Here's some info about myself:

I use Reddit and socials a lot, but mostly for my own business rather than socializing. I like doing things to improve myself and curious activities, but I seriously lack new people online. I talk to the same ones since 2018.

Let's start: i'm italian. From Rome. My country is very particular culturally: I study communications and I can see how much different we are compared to British people or American people. This has caused me to have a bit of struggle initially, but I think I got used to the habits and the culture of the languages I write/speak. It's like having 2 personalities lol speaking of I'm ENTJ 1w9 sp/so, for anyone who knows about Jung and MBTI stuff PLEASE dm me asap.

I love eating, I think it's the best thing in the world next to videogame music and people. Yup. My favourite triad: people, food, videogames. That's all I really need in my life lol

Let's then list my favourites of each category: I love carbonara, it's my favourite dish ever, also have a strong preference for Ragù and tuna. Just writing about them makes me hungry.

My favourite videogames are Pokémon, Ace Attorney, Professor Layton, Fire Emblem, Zelda, most of Mario and GTA series, Saints Row, Isaac, Hades, Omori.

I love beat-em-ups (I suck tho at FighterZ and JoJo ASBR) and open-world games.

As for people, I like gentle and passionate persons: someone who has a lot of willpower and creativity and truly makes themself dinstinct enough for me to consider it a special friend. And someone who can respect my spaces. Would love to talk about really everything... except for emotions and soccer. That's not my cup of tea.

If I managed to convince you with my little poem feel free to message or DM me in chat! Could take a while to answer but please don't leave, I promise that it's just for the first times :)",2022-09-18 20:06:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1651155168,1,/r/lonely/comments/xhqmh0/your_friendly_neighborhood_extravert_ere_to/,,0,0,Your friendly neighborhood extravert ere to befriend lonely people

Then the lady in front of us starts talking to us for some reason and asks how we are and gives us advice and I just remember the lady asking my old crush something. She responded that we have a past. Then she gave us more advice and then it became less awkward and we exited the movie theatre and we held hands and she squeezed my hand hard. 

It made me remember how I didn’t ask her out to the movies when I should’ve. Regret filled my morning. Fuck.

3736,xhriis,jenndar111,"I don't use reddit much at all but, life has been rough to me recently, and I just have nobody to go to, I need someone to vent to, and this community seems kind and accepting so I felt it would be a good idea to write down my thoughts here and how I've been feeling and hopefully someone will understand me, I've tried talking about it to the few friends I have but they don't really seem to understand all too well, which isn't their faults of course

There's a lot wrong with me. I'm a teenager who is practically a shut-in, I have no in person friends, my only friends are on discord, I get jealous way too easily, I have mood swings that occur multiple times in a single day, I'm not confident in myself, I'll have a mental breakdown if I even slightly suspect that someone I know and love might like me less or might end up leaving me. I feel like for these reasons are why all my relationships go terribly, and I feel pathetic for it. The thing that makes me feel the most pathetic is the fact that I cant stand not being the most important person to someone

Like this one person I know. He's treated me so special for months and we were practically romantic with each other even though we were never officially dating but I was practically the best person in his life and we did a lot of things together normally done in romantic relationships, he's stated that he likes me in that way but because of circumstances we couldn't, and that we could eventually. And then he found someone he likes more. After so many months of all that, it feels like being cheated on, even though we were never dating in the first place. I don't hate him, he feels bad for this, he wishes things could go back to normal, I do too, but what can be done? I've broken done crying multiple times over this, but literally nothing can be done. I feel alone again. The loneliness was gone for months and it just suddenly comes back again because of this specific reason, and now our relationship is ruined because I can't stop having mental breakdowns over this

I'm not asking for advice on that whole relationship thing, there's other subreddits for that, I just wanted to say an example or vent about it I guess

I just want someone who likes me more than everyone else, someone who tells me they love me the most and they care about me, just someone to make me feel less lonely, because when there's someone better, it makes me feel replaceable. If I were to disappear, would it matter? They have someone better to keep them happy, I'm not needed

I wish some of my friends would understand this, they can't do much because they're all online and they can't do anything, but I wish someone could at the very least understand, I would try to talk to my therapist about this but I'm just not comfortable with it. I want someone who loves me, lets me know that, and understands me. That's all I need to feel better.

There's so much on my mind but I'm just ending this here, I'm mentally exhausted, I feel pathetic, and I just have nobody to go to anymore, nobody to understand, nobody who can tell me they love me the most anymore. I just want to be happy again.",2022-09-18 20:43:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1469681717,6,/r/lonely/comments/xhriis/the_loneliest_and_most_pathetic_ive_felt_in_my/,,0,1,The loneliest and most pathetic I've felt in my life right now

Being at home is awful, I hate my mom's behavior and her actions that harm me and my life. I hate to prefer being at school or in the hospital rather than at home.

I'm constantly having anxiety attacks, I have big attachment issues and I can't fully let go of people no matter how hard I try. If she knew how much I keep looking at the chat hoping she says something, yet knowing that it's better this way. 

I lost the person I loved the most almost 3 months ago now, and I realized I'm still not over it. I still care about her the same as the day she left, I still want to go back to those days even though I know everything wasn't perfect.

I feel like the only thing keeping me attached to this world is the pain I'll bring to the people close to me. And I'm starting not to care anymore. I'm scared because I don't want to do it but I don't see any other way out of this.

3788,xhwueg,GhostlyGrifter,"I have a great family and had plenty of friends growing up, but I've always been very partner-oriented. I've always just needed my person.

In high school, my first serious girlfriend treated me like garbage in front of her friend so they could laugh together at me. She also cheated behind my back.

I got married to a woman who emotionally abused me for years, cheated on me 20 times that I know of, and loved making me feel sad. I'll never forget the very specific grin she got whenever she said something so unexpected and awful that I wasn't able to hide the pain it made me feel on my face. She loved that little, telling wince I'd make. She got off on it for 15 years. I spent all my energy for years on her. I didn't have anything left to spend on my friends, so I lost them all. They don't hate me, they just aren't really there anymore.

Eventually I got up the strength to leave her, but now I'm over 40 and very, very alone.

Nobody I've ever been with has ever shown they care about me at all. They've never gone above and beyond in any way. It was always very transactional. They'd return my ""I love you""s , return my affection, they'd get me gifts when they were supposed to, and that's all nice, I like all that. But they'd never do anything on their own to make me feel like they really care about me. I'm not talking about moving mountains. Unprompted kind words would be totally enough.

Recently I had one exception, I saw a girl for awhile that wasn't great at communicating her feelings, but one day she thought of me so she bought me a cheap, novelty tshirt. The proof that she cared enough of think of me, even a tiny bit, when she didn't have any kind of obligation to do so made me cry a little bit, but I hid it from her to keep from looking like a total weirdo over a $7 gag gift shirt. She made me genuinely happy for the first time ever. I felt really content.

But she left me, and now I'm alone again. 

I'm a bit weird. It's hard for me to relate to people, and it's hard for people to relate to me. On top of that, dating after age 40 is a hell of a chore and half the people I meet up with either I'm not interested in them or they aren't interested in me, and the other half are just completely bonkers. Like, clinically rat shit bonkers.

So I'm 41, alone, and I don't know if that will ever change. Having a partner is such an innate desire for me, it's hard to really envision my life without someone by my side, and without someone whose side I can also be by. I keep hearing that I need to learn to be happy being by myself before I can get someone else. But I'm 41, I'm not made of time, I've gotta skip that part, apparently, because I never quite picked it up and it's looking like I'm going to be dead before I do.

God, this is longer than I intended. Maybe they just leave me because I'm so goddamn wordy.",2022-09-19 00:30:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646777466,3,/r/lonely/comments/xhwueg/ive_had_girlfriends_and_even_a_wife_but_nobody/,,0,5,"I've had girlfriends and even a wife, but nobody that ever cared about me."

3798,xhyhy0,tobelove,"I know this title sounds pessimistic. But I also don’t want to invalidate myself either. This is probably going to be very difficult to type out. And I’m a very private person for the most part, for example, I hardly go for “help” or post on social media. In person, I can be a social and talkative person, very talkative actually haha. I just like to laugh a lot and have fun by making conversation or people seem to enjoy making conversation with me. 

But this post isn’t about that. 

Today, I recently just got fed up by my now ex best friend. When I needed her most, she simply wasn’t there. This time around, I vented to her about some turbulent stuff going on into my relationship. 

And a week later, she texts my boyfriend drunk, telling him she always makes him laugh and hopes she finds someone like him. Him and I have had our ideas and suspicions, mainly him because he didn’t like the crowd this ex best friend of mine was following. You see, I texted her about now wanting to do anything for my birthday and I want to be alone on that day. I have a tendency to get real depressed the month leading up to my birthday( my birthday is on the last of September so I basically wait a whole extra month) 

And she told me she didn’t want me to regret not doing anything on my 21st. During her birthday, we went for dinner and stayed at a hotel/ate muffins while she was tipsy and my boyfriend/I took care of her for the night before going to our room.

I feel pretty devastated. I lost so many “best friends” and the friends I do have, I only talk to from time to time and we end off not communicating until years and years later to catch up. So for the most part, I have my siblings and my parents. But my parents have been abusive to me growing up. And the loneliness of not having anyone to call or vent to grows. 

So today on the way home, I had a heavy feeling in my chest… started thinking of when the “Birthday month madness” started and it basically was memories of the parental abuse, it would get so bad around late Summer to mid-September. I can still remember my mom telling me to kill myself two weeks before my birthday. And I had attempted on the day. Blew out my candles, cried and hugged my baby brother and kissed him on the cheek. 

Went to my bedroom closet and hanged myself with a brown belt and just “let go.” 

My arms were flinging and hitting the walls and I could just see white and feel light headedness. The belt loosened from my body moving so hard, and I went out of the closet and breathed so hard on the bed, fast and panicked. I ended up with some bruising on my neck and hid it for a week at school. 

Ever since then, birthday months have been hell. This year hasn’t been good and last year I went through panic attacks everyday/dropped out of school from it. 

So with these memories while driving. I went near a bridge almost, a road above the interstate.No cars passing through the roadway but yes, below traffic. Looked over and I knew I wasn’t going to jump during sunset with some daylight. 

I walked away and went back inside. A car came ahead of me passing by as I drove away onto my lane. I just started crying. I cried and wailed repeating to myself how I don’t want to die.

3809,xhzwho,_Mad_Gear_,"I have been struggling to get over a girl that I went out with senior year of high school. I met her freshman year and I got to know her very well, I think we certainly hit it off and she agreed to go on a valentines date with me after 3 1/2 years of me waiting for the right time. After that she wanted to spend so much time with me and I think we were so happy. I hope she felt the same at the time but after a few months she seemed to get bored of me. When we were together she treated me like I was the only thing on this planet and I did to her the same. But when texting she took hours, days sometimes to reply and I know that might seem selfish of me (and it was) but I felt so lonely when I wasn’t talking to her. I felt like maybe she was talking to someone else however thought she was above something like that. Anyways she moved away for college  after around half a year of dating and I was heartbroken but couldn’t leave since I was living with my parents and didn’t have enough money to move out to where she was going to college at the time since I didn’t have a job, but I wanted her to pursue her dreams so I was happy for her and was happy to be unhappy for several weeks. We wrote letters to each other and face timed but as soon as it ended I would feel a pit in my heart, I had never felt so lonely… I knew we had each other but she was so far and I missed her touch and the warmth she gave me. I was planning on marrying her when she got back from college since we were so good for all of high school and finally I had met someone that said they loved me. I was her first kiss and she was mine, high school lovers, it seemed like a movie. She told me in her last letter she had found someone she had a class with in college, And I guess he was better off money wise than me because he came from a higher class family. Anyways they got married within two months of dating and she never talked to me again. It’s been three full years since that and I have never found someone quite like her. I can’t sleep some nights just thinking about how her hand felt in mine. How she could leave me after we knew each other for almost five years for someone she just met? I guess the money was the prime reason so that has made me ask myself if any of that was even real? What we had, was it even real? Lonely isn’t even a word that can describe what I’ve been feeling now. I don’t think I’ll ever feel like that for anyone ever again. If it was real or not for her, it really was for me. I feel devastated and sometimes make it worse by looking at her Instagram and seeing that they are on some trip to Italy or other country, and I just cry because I never would be able to have given her all that. And it’s bitter sweet because I am left all by myself but at least she’s happy.",2022-09-19 02:53:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632162149,1,/r/lonely/comments/xhzwho/need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,,0,0,Need to get this off my chest
3810,xhzydg,bergbruh,"I’m in a healing process and it’s going pretty well. Unfortunately I had to leave behind some toxic friends and my ex bf. It’s good that I’m focusing on myself, but I find myself alone and sad often. Although I enjoy my solitude most of the time; sometimes it sends me into a spiral where I think I may never date/make any new friends again. I’m craving human connection. It feels weird to just go out alone and sit in a coffee shop, surrounded by strangers who I really can’t randomly go up to and start chatting without it being weird. I’d go on tinder but it’s honestly just a swamp of people wanting to hook up. I don’t know what to do here. I’m becoming depressed more than ever. I’m tired of being sad and have nobody to talk to. Does anybody want to talk on here?

I live at home. I’ve never done anything with a guy. Why? Cause I’m scared of coming out. I have strict, conservative, religious parents. I know they would disown me if they knew.

I lay awake wanting to have what others have, a chance at a relationship, a chance at love, a chance at something normal. So instead like a coward, I go on online looking for attention and love in all the wrong places. Can anyone relate?

3829,xi1kpf,I_h8_mods,"I'm in my 40s (M). I've spent almost my entire life alone. I've had very few meaningful relationships my entire life. Despite this I  love being alone. I work lots come home late and no one cares. I have a bunch of great hobbies, I come home from work and I can woodwork, pull out a telescope, go camping/hiking build a 3D printer, maybe a combination of my hobbies, whatever i want, my time is mine! Even the odd relationship I've been in, friend or romantic knows that the best is to leave me alone if i say i want space. I like people just fine, but I don't like to be around too many at one time, so I mostly keep to myself. 

I bring this up as when I was in my late teens/ early twenties I felt alone, and I was miserable, I would try desperately to be in a relationship, I'd get in one and be more miserable as not being alone wasn't a cure for my loneliness. Something clicked when I was stuck at some boring work function, I realized I could be away from there doing whatever I want. It wasn't easy at first, my mind would wonder to lonely thoughts but after a short while I just became more interested in what I was doing rather than thinking about being lonely. It's OK to alone, it's OK to feel lonely, but remember when you're alone you're completely free (some legal restrictions apply). Do whatever you want, treat yourself to a movie, build/grow/create something, learn something new, do a happy dance, whatever makes you happy and/or fulfilled, you're a perfect little unicorn that can be happy without needing anyone else.

My mind is always a scrambled mess. So here I am doing this again. Tapping away letting whatever comes be put to text. Meaningless or meaningful is up to post processing. But I feel doing this is me in my most natural thought. That is without thinking too much. Just natural lack of hesitation. 
What is there to say? I’ve been scrambled for months. Rereading my old notes it’s clear that it’s been like this for years. Except for that one time long before basic. I acknowledged life felt good where I was. I was happy with the people around me and even with myself. And there I was letting go of everything that could’ve been good. Do I do this intentionally? Not letting good things be good? Because I don’t believe I deserve anything good? Am I always holding my real self back as punishment for existing? Knowing that if I were never here my family would literally have had better lives; more money for them to fulfil their wishes and goals easier without my ever existing presence. I knew at a point that I had the chance to make their lives better. By taking myself out. The money would’ve gone a long way to let them live the way they wanted. Nothing of matter would’ve been lost.  
Well I’m still here yea? Struggling along for strength or the ill. What keeps me going? Why haven’t I pulled the trigger? I don’t know what my value or values are. I don’t know what I live for. I’m just here. A dreary apathetic mess that’s lost all warmth of life. Things physically hurt. My body aches for the cold that warps me. My mind pinches of cloudy pins. I want more than anything for it to end. Somehow. Anyway it can. I wish the colour could come back. Maybe an embrace that I haven’t felt in way too long. Touchless. Loveless. Careless.

3850,xi3phi,Trick_Enthusiasm4633,"I've made a lot of mistakes and bad decisions in my life. Each and everyone of them has bitten or just full on kicked me in the ass but I'm working on moving forward. To shitty reality of it is that the people around me don't think that I can change. My wife of 9 yrs does not believe that I will ever truly change my ways and be a better man no matter how much I progress. She still believes that in some way shape or form I will just find another way to mess up my life, her life, and the life of our children. To be honest.... I'm kind of used to that now since it's been going on for years. At least in that time I've had a best friend who has been by my side through my ups and downs and has encouraged me to keep pushing forward. Until tonight that is. After a busy day celebrating my daughter's birthday I made it home and gave my bf a call just to say hi and see how she was doing as well as to hear her voice. The conversation started off well but shifted to a darker tone as it progressed. By the end of the conversation she had revealed that although she has egged me on and motivated she never really believed that I would actually make the changes I needed to better my life. She said she knows I'm afraid of change and doesn't hold it against me but maybe I should just keep doing what I'm doing even though she can see the toll it's taking on me. Gotta say I'm absolutely crushed I thought that in all the world this person would always be in my corner but I guess I just haven't done anything to significant to get her to see it. ⁶",2022-09-19 06:10:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1629757900,7,/r/lonely/comments/xi3phi/i_wish_there_was_someone_who_had_faith_in_me/,,0,1,I wish there was someone who had faith in me.

Just his height alone will make people on dating apps swipe right to him. And he definitely is a looker.

I've never really had much luck meeting decent people and I'm not someone people would notice. The only thing I know that could even be remotely considered valuable about me is being faithful at all costs, much to my detriment.  

I'm basically nothing and can only resort to posting vents and rants like this online to somehow get things off my chest, I'm beyond broken and there's no hope for me.

3859,xi4kxt,purpledonkeypunch,"For a few years now I've put down the needle and tried to live a different life. I live with my sibling and her hubby and my niece and nephew. I used to not really be focused on relationships because I was high on heroin, I just didn't care. But now being sober all this time certain feelings come back. Ive managed to curb them with down low relationships, it was easy to find a girl looking for more that didn't want to lose years of a relationship, especially if you see them every day at work, and that's what happened in my case. I'd work with girls around my age every day, sometimes the sexual tensions would come to a rise and we'd quell them.  But eventually I started to want a partner of my own. Granted, with my experiences in this area, I came to think true monogamy here was impossible. My sibling moved a girl into the house, my siblings hubbies co-worker to be exact and I found her attractive to say the least, I decided to try and pursue her but the reason she was moved in to begin with was because she was getting out of a abusive relationship, so she wasn't looking to date anyone. I guess this was just me but I was trying to make eye contact when I noticed her looking in my brother in laws* direction one night (sisters hubby) and a few days later I thought I saw her pretend to trip so she could fall onto him, I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me though because I mentioned it to her And I came off as accusatory she took offense to it and told my fam a week later. When I found out I walked home from work 7 miles so everyone would be asleep by then and I wouldn't have to face them, I didn't eat for three days after that because I was so depressed. I committed self harm. I liked her and I called her a homewrecker basically. My family knows and they hate me for it, needless to say ive been rejected but this is a new low..I want to just OD and rid both parties of me at this point.

3885,xi9e1f,SoleWayfarer,"Went to bed early then I just started thinking, the loneliness becomes overbearing, can't sleep, I just can't stop myself from crying, I had finally fixed my sleep schedule and now it's 4 am, now I come here to vent I guess because what else can I do. 8 months ago I had even made a post about leaving this sub not out of success but out of resilience I guess. Always the same, not the first time and not the last. It's the same for you too isn't it? always you making the effort and remaining hopeful, people are dishonest with you and themselves, turn away at the slightest inconvenience instead of meeting halfway, they just use you and shelve you when they're done. I've fucking had it... I wish I could ask for support and relief here but we've all done this countless times, what suggestion haven't you heard before, you can always find a comment to relate to, a listening ear, yet the temporary safety of a random shoulder to cry on slowly stops giving comfort. In the end nobody stays and it's not anyone's fault, nobody gets to owe you the loyalty or commitment... I can't afford the heartbreak anymore, I just can't anymore, please no more heartbreak. I just want to love and be loved, give and receive, be met halfway. I should stop whining and suck it up I guess, others suffer more than me. I know tomorrow I'll carry on strong, normal and resilient until I bend and break again. I can't really see myself in any future, it's not like I don't try to, so how long will I keep doing this...

 A year ago this day I promised myself that this year it would be different that I would not spend my birthday alone, hoping that it would be better that I would find someone who would care enough for me to celebrate with me.  3 people remembered to send me wishes, (progress) but when I asked two weeks ago if they would find time to celebrate, they said no. Maybe they really don't have  time or maybe it's too much of a sacrifice for them to do something nice for me.  there is great envy in me.  because I'm kind, caring and funny and nobody cares but people who are toxic and horrible seem to have lots of friends.Why is their friendship worth more than mine?  I'm extravagant, lots of people say they like me but none of these people want to go from being colleges to friends, what's wrong with me?

3896,xicbzx,D4rk_Reddit,"I've been on a self improvement journey. Started working out, improved my confidence and mental health, but I feel like I've been not in touch with my emotions as much as I used to. 

I just lost my very best friend less than a month ago. She was the only person I could truly open up about my feelings. I think it's mostly my fault, I keep trying to cut her off (Still trying to improve on that) and we both mutually ended our friendship because we parted our ways in life. 

Even though, I have lot of friends from school, they're not the friends that I would really share deep emotional connection with. It's not that I don't trust them, I just feel like me and them are in a different wavelength when it comes to our personal feelings, from observing their behaviors and opinions on things.

Although, doing little good things like helping a random person help me not become a heartless person. I still find it not enough to satisfy my emotional needs. I'm afraid I might lose my soft side or emotional part of myself because I'm too busy thinking about like my studies or going to the gym. I keep searching answers online on how to deal with loneliness but all I get are mostly ""just make yourself busy"", although it helps in the moment but once I'm not doing anything, the feeling of loneliness comes back at me.

Most of my life I've been alone. I don't trust my parents enough with my emotions because of reasons I won't go into. I had fake friends who would take advantage of me. Adults that I thought I trust did things that would traumatized me till today. I broke up with my ex a year ago, although, we weren't compatible for each other, I'm still glad she was a part of my life. I just can't help but to think ""am I destined to live life alone?"", I feel like no matter what happens I would go back to being alone again. 

This feeling left me keep wanting someone that would stay with me until the end. Someone I could love, that would reciprocate my feelings, that would take care when I'm sick or when I feel vulnerable. I wanna be in a relationship, I want a girlfriend.

I don't really have anyone that I would care about right now, except for my crush. Our relationship is complicated, long story short I confessed to her and I think we were in a ""talking stage""? (I still have no idea what that is) but then a few days later she told me ""we should just be friends"". Maybe it's because she's not ready for a relationship?. I don't want to paint a bad picture on her because she would listen to me when I'm venting (Not much), she would even take care of me when I told her I don't feel well. I'd be lying if I say I don't have feelings for her anymore, but I'm hopeless in ever getting into a relationship with her, which makes me feel more lonely.

The question that keeps bothering me, whenever I try to find answers online. If I feel like I want someone to love and loves me, does that mean I don't love myself?

Man it feels really hard and lonely here

Breif- I am an introverted guy.. I need to meet a person 2-3 times to get comfortable I have always been like this but I had a good amount of friends in high school and good social circles because my best friends were very extroverted so I made friends through them 

However here I am having difficulty making friends because I really don’t know how to approach people or can’t connect with most 

It’s been 2-3 weeks now and I did find 2-3 friends but not more …. The friends I found mostly like to play games or sit in dorms which I do not want to do in my college life 

Here many people have formed groups and I see people having fun the more and more I am waiting to talk to them the more difficult it is getting for me to approach people here 

The thing I had quit a good amounts of friend in high school and here I just know few people makes me feel miserable …. Also didn’t have much female interaction 


I am a students from different country so I find it hard to connect with people here to because there are less international people in my college 

However I love the studies and activities here but I always want to enjoy my social life college I don’t want to sit in my dorm room when I have nothing to do ….



Can someone give me tips if poss

There was a time when I felt like I didn't need a relationship- that I could be happy on my own- but then some life stuff happened, I met some people, lost some people.... and now I can't stop thinking about it.

What sucks though, is that I'm about $8K deep in car repairs, stuck at my parents place until I have enough money to leave again, and I'm pretty sure my job is gonna tank within the year.
Long story short, I'm not in the best of spots right now, but I can't help but feel this overwhelming urge to seek out companionship. Maybe it's a way for me to try and cope with the stress? I dunno.
I wanted to wait until I could put my best foot forward, when I my life is a little less chaotic, but... Should I just go for it?

3933,xiichq,pinkgarden113,"There’s a lot on my plate right now (f27)- but one thing’s for sure is that I realized that I’ve been trying to cover up my past traumas to “feel better” but deep inside I still feel broken.

When I was a child, my brother molested me. I didn’t understand what happened. I was too young (maybe around 10 yearsold?) sometimes whenever my brother’s around, i would feel anxious, my senses are tensed up, and sometimes even nauseous. Sometimes it would replay in my head how helpless I felt. My mom knew about it, so does my dad. But I told them not to confront my brother anymore because he’s gonna get married soon (I don’t wanna cause anymore family dramas and shit like that because my mom’s a cancer survivor and stressors might just trigger her health) and what scares me the most is that he might forgot what he did to me. Maybe sometimes I just want to hear him say he’s sorry. (He hasn’t touched me since then. It’s the trauma that lingers).

Another trauma I’ve been trying to heal from was from my past relationship (with a girl) - i was used financially (she owes me thousands of dollars, used it on her and her friends gain) abused physically (got bruises, was jabbed straight to my right ear, got punched), emotionally (curses at me like i was some inhumane person, she cheated 3x, gaslighting) . Never did I ever thought I’d experience something like that. It really broke me and it makes me scared of commitment tbh.

Remembering these things make me feel fear, anxiety , sadness, trauma. I thought I’m already okay but it lingers sometimes.

*Reads chat request*

Them: Hi.

And nothing else. Like how the fuck are we suppose to start a conversation with just that? That gives me nothing and often times I have to play detective to see where they come from.

But everything just feels forced. No matter how many DM’s I have, no matter how many people I force a conversation with, I feel so lonely and empty inside because it isn’t those two guys I was closest too. Day by day I’m getting worried that I won’t find a bond like that ever again, and at the same time, have began having existential crises about the future, like what am I gonna do after uni, when am I gonna find a gf, things like that. Which was a common occurrence prior (I’d overthink a lot) but now it’s gotten to the point where I hyperfixate on so much stuff, and can’t even feel any joy or happiness in things I liked before, such as hitting the gym. And Even things like playing PS4, before I’d at least have that little bit of communication with my friend who is studying abroad, and I. Didn’t realize upon the group split how much we used to talk, and how sane it kept us both to have someone to jus talk about our days with, or jus have random banter. A part of me deep down keeps wishing that eventually they can maybe message me and we can all start talking again, that’s the only hope I’m holding onto in real life. Even friendships I’ve made outside of school like at the gym, make me feel so empty as they don’t fill the void of losing out on 2 people I’ve known practically for 6 years (from grade 8- grade 12). And I’m not a suicidal person, but everytime I envision the future I don’t see myself in it, basically playing a background jar after in my own life because I’m living in my head and not the real world constantly sulking on what has happened. And seeing other kids have groups that go out weekly, or just hang out makes me feel so empty and defeated because I don’t know if I’ll be able to find that again without feeling like a tag along.

I am a teenage boy who has practically no friends. The one and basically only true friend I have in real life is always busy on weekends, scouts, football etc., but I never am, I never leave the house. He also shares practically no interests with me, we don't chat outside of school. This used to really bother me but after 1 whole year of not going out unless my family went, or I had work or school, I just stopped caring, Deep inside -- it really does hurt. I am an extrovert by nature. I want to go out, every time my sister goes out (not even that often) it really hurts. My heart sinks in a way, anyone feel that way too?

These should practically be the best years of my life, no worry, no care and I should just be doing dumb shit with my friends, but instead, I'm stuck inside all day. I used to cry to sleep over this stuff. The people I have tried telling have their own friends, they go out regularly, they don't understand how much of an actual loser I feel when I tell them that I don't go out.

But, it wasn't always like this. I used to have friends, we went out regularly, but my ""friend group"" used to be of 5, 2 moved country, got new friends, we didn't necessarily lose contact but they sure moved on. 1 moved to a different friend group. I am practically lonely. The friend group I tried getting in this year stopped talking to me after this dude that really hates me went to hang out with them and told them shit about me. I don't know what, but it was clearly enough to be excluded.

Whenever I'm not venting about it, I remain fine. A few things manage to make me cry in my life and loneliness is one of them. I just want friends. I wanna do dumb shit. I wanna live life. There's a life outside of a computer screen, but I can't access it. I'm writing this through tears. But, I remain over it, mostly. I just wanted to see if others are like me.

I tried doing sports just to get his attention but since I wasn't as good as my brother then I never got showed as much.

Now if my room is messy or I do a slight inconvenient thing he blows up on me and just starts saying how he ""doesn't want to treat me like a kid"" but he never let me be his kid.

I can't maintain a steady relationship either because he always finds a way to get involved (he's a pervert and I wrote about this in r/whatshouldido ) and I am always being blamed for things either in the relationship or in my day to day life. And it's just made me hate myself more and more.

I get that he wants the best for me now, but now I don't want anything from him other than to leave me alone like he did before.

3980,xipzsb,MyNamesIsMarc,"So I've suffered with mental illness for the past 5 or 6 years. My social life is non existent, I haven't had any relationships and I'm just very lonely.

On Saturday night, I went with my two brothers to a nearby town to watch a gig and had some drinks. It was the best time I've had in a long long time and was the first time in a while where I've laughed, smiled and genuinely felt happy.

When I got the train home that night, as I was walking home (it's a 10 minute walk), I was attacked at random by two guys. They didn't ask for money or my phone. They just jumped me out of the darkness and started to beat me up. While I was on the floor and they were kicking me, one of them shouted at the other to stop. I took this opportunity to run. They gave chase for a short while but I managed to outrun them and escape.

I hid in a dark driveway and called the police. However, they told me there were no officers nearby to help me. I managed to get home, with my nose and mouth still pouring with blood, and just collapsed to the floor crying.

Even the one evening of happiness I get is ruined by me getting attacked. What did I do in a past life to deserve this? I've lost all hope now. 

Sorry for the long post, and I appreciate it if you have read this far.

For context, this happened at around 11:30pm in the UK on a Saturday night.

I’m 17 M and have struggled with mental illnesses for around 4 years now. Gone to doctors countless times with worries and constant fear of everyone around me. In the past 4 months i’ve struggled to keep my food down out of anxiety and therefore resorted to it being a coping mechanism. Because of this, i’ve managed to use it as a way of escaping guilt from any circumstance. 

I have 2 very good friends and i love them. Recently things sort of collapsed over a situation but I salvaged them and made up. I don’t think they realise how much they mean to me. I’ve always been an introverted kid, bullied in secondary school. So opening up to anyone at all is hard but super helpful for me. 

Recently i’ve just hit a wall and have had enough of pretty much everything. I cry every night without fail even if there’s nothing to be upset about. 

I just need someone to say anything to me really, doesn’t need to be advice. Just want people to acknowledge i’m here.

We had all of these deeply personal conversations, but had so many just comfortable and lighthearted conversations. I was so completely comfortable around him in a way I haven't been around another person, possibly ever. He was gentle and caring, gave me forehead kisses when he thought I was sleeping, and was happy to spend a night cuddling on the couch, watching whatever. He met my friends, and I met his. Then when it came down to it, he avoids telling me he doesn't want to commit to me by just stressing that he's having fun, and thinks I'm really cool. What he didn’t actually say said it all. He just wants someone he can get the emotional and physical intimacy of a relationship with, but still sleep around and leave as soon as he finds something better. I'm absolutely crushed.

4017,xiu6af,Bazookabonk,"I’m in school which is “supposed” to be the easiest and most fun time of your life but from what I’ve experienced it’s complete and utter shit. For the past 3 years I can confidently say I’ve not had a single real friend group. Started when I moved schools, I used to be really popular had a nice friend group but for some reason I just didn’t stay in touch with any of them because I was far away from them. Somehow when I went to this new school my social skills just crumbled, I was quiet, insecure and just lonely. Around a year ago I was sort of comfortable with a few people which I could call a friend group and I went go karting with them a single time and said to myself “I finally have friends” only to find out a month later they all talked behind my back and majorly excluded me from everything. That small slither of hope that I wasn’t going to be lonely for the rest of my teen life just disappeared and just like that I’m back to being that kid that sits by himself in the canteen. Every day I dread going to school, I’m sleeping all the time that I’m not at school, I don’t feel a natural connection with anyone, hearing people talk to their friends about their weekend plans makes me tear up and even my online friend group is drifting apart. I just want it all to end and all I hear online is that adult life is the worst ever. Im scared I’m going to waste my life as a teen and every now and then it gets so bad I want to take the easy way out.

This world isn't for me and I yearn for this place I see in my mind. This imaginary world I haven't visited. It's a forest full of lush, vibrant hues of green living oaks and pine as tall as the eye can see. It's tall hills and mountains encompassing miles around your peripherals, yet I always see this one particular sight in this ""happy place"" of mine : It's a sloping hill with the same pine trees I was just discussing. There's no further context behind it, but hot damn do I wish I was there. 


Part of this whole -- whatever the fuck you'd call it -- I'm there with a girl I knew back in high school. She's married today, so this whole thing doesn't really make much sense.  This world I wanna be a part of, it has **seasons**. Something you don't see down here where it's just fuckin hot 24/7/365. There's snow in the winter and orangey brown leaves in the fall. There's fuckin CAMPFIRES when it cools down at night and you lose yourself staring into the flame because you're not used to beholding such a beauty that's commonplace. The water flows in rivers and it's a clear blue, never stagnant and always has fresh salmon stocked should you ever need it... Or, more accurately, there for the bears. The majestic beasts that have been made friendly due to both the peace you bring with you and becoming used to seeing friendly humans.

I claimed i had a huge crush on him when in reality i was forcing myself to like him because I couldn’t accept that I’m actually gay. Anyway this guy and I had an interesting friendship. On good days, he was all flirty and gave compliments and say comments that made him seem like a feminist. On bad days though, that’s when I’d be called a bitch or annoying or even the n word and he was not black… Anyway i remember when other girls tried to talk crap about him, I would be the first one to defend him. But what other people didn’t know was that on the side, he not only gave me confusing treatment that I mentioned before with the good and bad days, but I also would get sexually harassed by him as well. He would try to feel me up in class as i would say no or stop and treat it like it was nothing. He’d also send unwanted nudes and pressure me for them as well “as a joke”. and anytime i would say no or show obvious disinterest he would show attitude to me as if i did something wrong. And it doesn’t help that the year prior when he tried to kiss me, that wasn’t great either smh. I wasn’t interested so i was leaning back as he was leaning in, and instead of this just being some cringy middle school experience i could have looked back on, it took a turn once i realized his hand was at the back of my neck pushing me forward to try to kiss him despite me resisting , but thankfully i dodged out the way.  But anyway it’s been 4 years since this experience and I still don’t like when people, specifically guys, touch me.

4047,xiyj6u,thomasthehipposlayer,"For background, I was happily married since 2017 to March this year, before it ended abruptly. That story is beyond the scope of this post, but the long and short is that my wife left me suddenly because she wanted to make some lifestyle changes. Despite how deeply I loved her, I was able to get over her quickly, much faster than I expected.

But since moving on, I’ve come to realize increasingly that my chances of finding love again are slim. I’m a pragmatist with an extremely analytical mind, and while I know love can find a way, I also know that my odds are slim and only getting slimmer. 

- I don’t want kids. I would be miserable with them, and it wouldn’t be fair to me my partner or the kids. This is the biggest dealbreaker. My church is important to me, and I want someone who shares my values, but the overwhelming majority want kids. For many, it’s their singular goal in life. I’ve already shot down my chances with several girls by being upfront about not having kids. As time goes on, the number of girls who don’t already have kids is only going to drop.

- High standards. I might be lonely, but my standards are higher than they ever were before my marriage. I won’t settle for a girl who isn’t way out of my league, and there’s no reason to think such a girl would settle for me. I know I could find someone I lowered my standards, but that’s not worth it to me.

- Asperger’s. Pretty high functioning even for high functioning autism, but I’m still on the spectrum, and I struggle to connect with people on a meaningful level.

- Dwindling opportunity- I’m 28 and graduated college. Honestly, the avenues to meet and connect with people my age are dwindling. The best girls are increasingly taken. More and more have kids.

So basically, I need to find a girl who absolutely rocks my world, shares my values, doesn’t want kids, and is compatible with my socially awkward ass on top of all that as time slowly shaves away my already slim chances.

Nostalgia is an extremely sad and depressing concept. The times when I feel the most Nostalgia for the past are the moments when I'm feeling at my lowest with no hope for the future. I think this is evident in society as a whole as well. I think people or more nostalgic than ever and also more depressed then ever. There's a palpable feeling of anxiety that permeates everyone's actions and as the older generations get older and closer to their end they long for that nostalgic feeling. Nostalgia is the absence of hope and at least for me it drives my depression even more. 

It feels like a double edged sword, the more events that fill my life with joy the more things I have to feel nostalgic for looking back. Every failed relationship, every joyous occasion just makes me feel even lower once it's gone. I'm laying here now thinking about how much fun I had recently at my best friend's wedding and what an amazing time it was, but I realize that it's gone. That was in the past and there's no way for me to go back and relive it. The future is uncertain and I have no way of knowing when or if I'll be that happy again. I want to create more happy memories, I want to be free from this paralyzing fear of what could've been or could be but I don't know how to move past this.

We decided to add each other on Disc and get to know each other. We learned that we both lived pretty relatively close, and just got to know each other even more the day after. 

On the third day, I woke up to not having her added on my friends list, being blocked on both Discord and Valorant. And for some odd reason it has just been affecting me and really stings. Even though I barely met that person, I really felt a spark in those moments that I haven't felt in years. I haven't dated nor made any new friends the past 4 years and I thought this might be my moment to finally meet someone new. She had similar interests and similar humor with me and even pointed out how we just sparked together. I knew she was interested in me because on the second day, she told me how she couldn't stopped thinking about me and even skipped working out to play video games with me. It all ended, when she said she had to go drive. She said she would talk to me soon twice and I told her I would be waiting but then it had all gone away. 

The fantasy that I wanted to live in had disappeared in a second. I'll never know why she decided to block me when we were interested in each other and just starting to get to know each other. I know for a fact I never said anything wrong or inappropriate. The hardest part is moving on, and I just can't seem to do that. If you have any advices on how or why I should move on that would be great. Also any insight as to why she might have blocked me would also be great. I don't know if had a boyfriend as I never asked, but my guess is that even though was into me she didn't want to be attached and decided to cut me off before she got too hooked.

4085,xj5blx,Efficient_Sorbet_700,"touch starvation is becoming too much to handle

(tw for mentions of alcohol)

hii, I'm a 18 y/o girl and I've been going to therapy for years for different reasons, but I can say the feeling of loneliness is the root of a lot of my problems/behaviours.

I'm not gonna list all the reasons I feel lonely cuz that would take way too much time and it would be going kinda off topic, and this is not therapy so it is not the correct place. 

Anyway, going about the topic of touch starvation, it is literally making me go crazy. Like, to the point it is becoming damaging. 

Now that I finally recognized and accepted the fact that I'm touch starved I'm learning to deal with it but I don't think I'm doing it the right way?

Tuesday night I was with this close friend of mine, we were alone in my car and I just started crying out of the nowhere because I suddenly felt extremely overwhelmed, and I asked him to hug me and stay with me for a while and I even asked him if he loved me (platonically). And he stayed with me the whole time, he held me and reassured me and it just felt so nice to the point it was addicting. Literally. 

The problem is that even if this was kinda healthy - I told him what I wanted instead of using toxic behaviours to gain attention - I felt so good now I'm literally craving for more. That was literally my first time in my entire life someone I cared for cared the same way for me too, got what I was saying, and even hugged me and I trusted him the whole time.

The problem is that I don't know how to ask for more and if I can. 

Like, yesterday night I was out with him and another friend of mine (let's call him B) and we went out drinking, and I drank a lil bit too much. We even had a shot of tequila, salt and lemon and that was like the final blow I think? I wasn't even REALLY drunk but I'm not really used to drinking and I didn't eat anything before so the alcohol made me kinda lose my mind a bit. I knew what I was doing but I was still drunk enough to blame it on alcohol.

I drank lemon, salt and tequila from him (the friend that stayed with me on Tuesday, let's call him A) and then I just started kinda blacking out. I know it was me talking but I also know that the only reason I could be so honest was the fact that I could blame it on alcohol. 

I started crying like a lot. Really really a lot. And again I asked him to hug me and he just did for a something like a whole ass hour, and at the same time he started asking me questions, shit like ""sweet or salty"", ""trees or bushes"", ""black or white"" to keep me distracted and not fall into my spiral of negativity. 
You would be wondering why I went to him instead of my other friend (B) - it's because I've got something going on  with B, he's got his own issues and he's becoming kinda obsessed with me and it is stressing me out so so so much so I didn't feel safe going to him. 

I've been feeling so so so disconnected from my friends lately except for A and another girl who's really close to me (but she doesn't like physical touch so that's why I've been not going to her in this case I guess).

The problem is that all of this felt extremely nice and I'm scared I might break down again in front of him next time we're gonna be alone. 
The truth is I don't know who to ask for a bit of physical touch and I cannot even stand being alone anymore. It makes me feel extremely bad and affects my mental health so so much. 

But I cannot keep breaking down in front of him. I just feel extremely overwhelmed and I don't know why I just start crying and literally ask him for physical touch. I just do.
And he always reassured me telling me he doesn't mind and understands me, but I obviously cannot keep breaking down, I understand how stressing that can be for him.
It's just that it feels extremely wrong to ask for physical touch, like I'm being a burden, and so I use breaking down as a way I think? And last night I used alcohol.

I've been living without any type of physical touch/affection for literally my whole life and now this is hitting all together and all of a sudden.

This post is extremely long and I'm sorry for that, but I wanted to explain everything. I just do not know anyone with the touch starvation problem irl so I went seeking comfort on here. I hope it's not too much.

Was left completely heartbroken by a previous “best friend” who broke my trust. I spent a lot of years wondering what was wrong with me and why no one valued my friendship as much as I valued them. 
And then I got close to my now best friend. And she is everything I could have ever wanted in a friend. Always there for me when I need her, I will always be there for her when she needs me. Goes through all of the same things that I do so we both relate to each other more than anyone ever could.
We are long distance friends and I never imagined I could ever desperately look forward to the company of someone, other than my spouse, than I do with her whenever we make plans. 
She makes me feel appreciated and brings so much joy to my life.

4122,xjcg07,IllustriousClaim8883,"I'm on vacation for the next two weeks. The first day I stressed about what to do, now is the second day and I kinda should visit the gym especially as I got time to spend.

I would rather just sit in front of my PC, play video games, feel connected in an RPG, or watch youtube videos of friends playing together or a documentary about animals. My body does what it does every time I have a vacation: Everything hurts after doing nothing for 3 days. Not because I'm sick or anything, but because tiredness finally catches up.

Yet, there is also the loneliness that catches up. I'm often lonely, I'm 32 and have just a handful of friends. I have more business numbers on my phone than people I know from my hobbies. I have just one hobby, the gym, which connects me with others. Every other hobby I have can be enjoyed alone, most if not all hobbies I have are relaxing BECAUSE I spend time with them alone.

But vacation is different. Because there aren't the 10 hours being in the office which distract me from loneliness. These times I have 24 hours for myself, I spend the first few days catching up on sleep, being physically tired, but that also means I am way more energized and am awake for far longer. 

I can think about how I am at fault for being alone. How it's my own fault for enjoying hobbies alone and rarely spending time with others. How it's me that capsules myself into a safety bubble instead of going out.

I would love to overcome the urge to do this, I would love to have the courage to break out of this cycle. But to be honest, I'm so tired that I don't want to. I had too many heartbreaks, too many disappointments, too much backfiring, too often messing up my chances.

Or I just overthink it, and I just need to relax, maybe it's currently also the stress catching up, Because if I think clearly about it, currently isn't as bad as it may be the last times. Maybe something comes up and I don't have to stress myself anymore.",2022-09-20 15:52:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660498457,3,/r/lonely/comments/xjcg07/i_hate_vacation_because_i_get_reminded_of_how/,,0,0,I hate vacation because I get reminded of how alone I am.

By all means I think I’m a really decent person. Most people think I’m funny and nice and say that to me genuinely- yet I’ve dreamt about having a big friend group since I was around 12/13. But this is less an issue for me. In the least conceited way I could say it, I’m pretty attractive. Most men want to hookup with me and I wouldn’t consider myself “easy” either ( I’m saying this because I don’t think this is the issue ), No one has EVER wanted to date me. No one has ever asked me to be their girlfriend or taken me out on a real date. No one wants to spend time with me that’s not sexually. I’ve spent every morning of my life waking up alone. I’ll admit I didn’t know who I was as a person in high school and was too insecure to really talk to guys, but it’s been three years since I’ve basically really wanted to find someone, and everyone just wants to hookup these days. It makes me so sad I wake up everyday and my chest and face feels so tight that I have to resist the urge to cry. All of my friends are in long term relationships and I’ve “gone out” with all types of guys, I’ve tried dating apps, and none of it has worked. Literally no one has stayed. It seems like people just want to use me for my body and then leave me and it’s starting me make me feel like I’m going to be alone forever. Literally all I want is for someone to want to be with me. And I don’t think I come across as desperate either when I’m dating. I genuinely think I’m not meant to find someone and it kind of breaks my heart. Every man I’ve ever met has left me. My dad left, both of my brothers left, my mom is abusive.

Please be willing to move off app

Also local would be awesome 


Also just started playing osrs again so if you wanna play on that it would be cool. 

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

My entire life I have been unable to maintain friendships and I have not been able to make a single girlfriend in my life. I am 27 now. I feel like I have missed out on life. 

Think about it logically. There are other people who ***ARE*** able to make friends and relationships. In the US, most people by my age have had a girlfriend and friends. But, for some reason I am unable to get these things. Just think about it logically. ***There must be some explanation for this.*** Why are those people able to succeed socially, but not me?

I just feel like I am completely worthless. I have no value. I am not important at all. 

It is possible that I do something that is off-putting to others. I do struggle with mental health issues, (anger issues, trust issues, insecurity, and clinginess) so, I think it is possible that these things are what drive people away. Unfortunately, for me, fixing these mental health issues is hard. I have tried to fix them for a long time. 

I just don’t feel normal. I wish someone understands. I desperately want to be normal, but how? What is it that is so bad about me that makes no one want me? Is someone here able to see something about me that could be causing this?

Meeting people in real life becomes more and more difficult, you spend most of your life studying, working or commuting. Resulting in being too tired / not having enough time to do other stuff where you could meet people. (Not even talking about the past 2-3 years with the pandemic and it’s lockdowns)

Media show us these super popular people that have plenty of friends, romantic partners, … (that also seem to never work and have plenty of time to do anything) while I get the impression that we are getting less and less connected to each other people.

Some super popular people (streamers, influencers, …) get a lot of attention online, while the rest of us are the quiet anonymous majority online. (And even for them it’s not always easy as people are often more interested in these popular people’s popularity / position / physical body rather than them as a person)

Why are you not interested in figuring out what you are apologizing for? Do you even care about my feelings? Am I not worth the effort once things become unpleasant?

I can understand acknowledging having made a mistake but dont say sorry and then excuse your wrongdoing by putting the blame on me!

Why do people say sorry without knowing what to be sorry for?

Why do people say sorry just to continue pushing the blame onto the person they have just apologized to?

I am seriously questioning my current friendships right now.

I have been giving my friends all the emotional support I can give. Giving them positive reassurance when they talk about things that they can be proud of. And never making this up. I mean what I say when I tell you that you have done a great job! I mean it when I say that you can be proud of yourself!

Assuring them that things will be alright even if things may be going south for a while. Sharing stories of myself when things have been going south for me.

Telling them that they matter not just in general but also to me.

I am no longer sure if I have been giving them more appreciation than they deserve or maybe right now something is wrong with me that hinders me for seeing the good in them.

I have been listening to the things that made them worry or upset.

When someone mistreated or disrespected them, I have been telling them that it is not their fault and that they didn't deserve the mistreatment.

Maybe something is wrong with me and I don't notice what it is.

I don't know if these are one-sided friendships or maybe Im out of my mind and dont see the things that made me appreciate my friends.

Do I have to put up with everything silently?

Am I a bad friend if I express my displeasure when a friend treats me disrespectfully?

I am considering cutting ties to these friends but I am afraid of becoming more lonely and I am afraid of losing friends that I haven't appreciated enough.

Never has any of these friends legitimately apologized to me... Or have I forgotten?

I will likely feel different tomorrow or maybe in a few days but right know I cant stop feeling like I am cheating myself with that plan.

*Have you been feeling down or depressed recently?*

*Have you lost interest in your regular activities?*

If you said “yes” to either of these questions, you may be eligible for a new treatment study at no cost to you. You must be over 18 years old and live in Massachusetts to participate. 

This study is testing a new smartphone app-delivered treatment for people who are feeling depressed. The treatment is called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants will receive free access to the app as well as support from a CBT therapist through brief, weekly virtual appointments. CBT helps people learn new skills to reduce unhelpful thoughts and behaviors, and improve their mood. We hope that this new smartphone-delivered treatment will help more people get access to this treatment.

Even if you don't want to be friends, you'd just like to talk for a bit or vent, then that's fine! I'll happily listen :)) 

My parents are rather strict, and don't allow me to actually have social media. I'm also being homeschooled, which means I can't talk to anyone. I'm being a bit rebellious, but I really want to make a friend!

If I try to stand up for myself, they get angry with me for “having an attitude”. I’ve been threatened with homelessness for trying to stand up for myself and my needs. 

My mental health is is disabling. I can’t function well anymore. I have so little energy. I don’t even enjoy many of my hobbies anymore.  I only do things just for the sake of having something to do. Being on the autism spectrum doesn’t help me either. It’s hard for me to trust many people because of all the abuse.


I’m so tired of the gaslighting and guilt tripping. I’m so tired of being silenced.

4191,xjnlfh,KookyKanadian-,"I'm simply not anyone's favourite, nobodies go to, I am always always a bench option, and well after so long on that bench it's only a matter of time till you're long forgotten. 

My friends back home only talk to me, only involve me when there is no one else, the only reason I've been around with them this summer is because their friend group split and it's already piecing itself back together. They always keep me at an arms distance, always giving me just enough to think I want to stay, only ever talking to me online, only inviting me when someone else drops out.

I can't stand the constant talking about things they did without me, the inside jokes, the stories it's like a secret language I'm not privvy to. I'd move on but when you know people for 10+ years it's not easy at all. I mean me and my four best friends haven't all been in the same room at the same time once, and again to them I am an afterthought, a backup for a backup for a backup. 

When that's your role in every group you've sver been in you live to please. My entire personality is that I'm kind and yet that isn't enough, I've simply never been good enough for anyone I've met, maybe I've been close at times but after so many people it has to be me. My personality, my looks, my mannerisms, there has to be something fundamentally wrong. I guess I wasn't built in the right way. 

So off to university and yet that's even worse. My friends from first year have long abandoned me, I see those 5 out partying, hanging out and having fun without me. I am forgotten and discarded. One only messages me when he needs help with our course, and like parasite I leech onto that because all I can ever do in this world is offer meek help. That group didn't even try to hide it, we looked for a house during last christmas and yet I live alone in an empty campus accomdation by myself while two live together and the other three are together every day. My accomdation is empty, there is no one. I'm not even a fresher and I have no friends, I feel ashamed, I feel embarassed and then I just feel nothing. 

I tried, I joined a sports society and that has been a constant spit in the face week after week, nobody has the patience for the worst player on the team. I thought maybe I could try get on the comittee to at least contribute away from the sport if failed every time we played but still that wasn't enough. In the elections I was forgetton with no votes and my ideas stolen and used by others. I'm the only member the team's official accounts don't follow back, they know my instagram and my twitter so it's intentional. Do you know how hurtful that is? I already feel left out enough, nobody wants to associate with the worst player, bonds aren't made when one fails and everyone else succeeds. They get frustrated, they get annoyed, they get angry. I am alone at the bottom, the great shame of the team. 

I think the worst thing is I know people who are just better versions of me. With the same interests, the same kindness and yet they just are better at everything in every way. When there are literally better versions of me it makes sense why I'm forgotten by my friends, I can't offer enough for real friendship and inclusion.

4200,xjopz8,MasterJack555,"I have recently started my Junior year of high school and I fucking hate my school. Everyone is so different from me, their interests are so vastly different I have a very hard time finding things to talk about other than school, and you can only talk for so long about school. The only people I can truly connect with at school are some of the history teachers who are all over 40! Nothing wrong about being 40 but it is so fucking, cripplingly isolating to have virtually nothing in common with people my age.

Let me give you some examples of what I mean:

Most kids in my school like a variety of modern music, I like a little bit of modern rap and such (a very small amount) but mostly I listen to a variety of music regularly varying in date from the 1990's to the 1600's! Yes you read that right. The closest thing to rap I've listened to in awhile is modern major general, a patter song from the 1879. I listen to a lot of classical music, plus lots from  the 1920s. Hell I have an original 1915 copy of Long Way to Tipperary that I listen to on the reg.

I love history and science and learn about it endlessly on my own time. Watching videos, reading papers, hell I'm even designing my own engine! I thought there must be some other people like me at school so I joined a club for rocket science and there was only one other guy who I now run it with. But I cant be friends with him because he's so much of a bloody introvert. Not to mention that despite extensive advertising not a single other person has signed up. NOT ONE!

Back on to history though, where one guy I know plans to go to school in a tight body suit for Halloween and the girls are obviously looking at all the sluttiest shit imaginable I decided months ago to go as a 1st world war solider. Like an accurate one, I purely because I find it so interesting, have spent months earning money to buy original ww1 gear and a reproduction accurate uniform for my own interest and to wear to school as a Halloween gag. Of course as usual I suspect the only people who will get any kick out of it will again be my history teacher friends. Oh yeah I've been interested in politics since i was prolly 10 and I enjoy learning about the latest in geo-politics sort in a similar way to someone watching Monday night football.

I desperately want to get a girlfriend. Its not like I have any trouble talking to women or anything (although I cannot flirt for the life of me), I've made many acquaintances with women, but everyone male or female seems to get bored and stop talking to me. I can't seem to forge a strong enough bond to keep a friendship going past the first month. Keep in mind that this ONLY seems to apply to people my age! I can form much stronger bonds with older people. Some of my history teacher friends i haven't seen on a daily basis for years, but I talk to them multiple times a week of my own volition cause were (or at least the closest i have) to friends.

One of the hardest things for me, especially recently has been my cultural identity. For context, I live in the US. I am a citizen and have lived here since I was around 6. I am also British, born and raised in London and I remember it well. Thanks to my love of history I managed to hold on to that identity and consider my self slightly more British than American, or Anglo-American if you will. Anyways, as I'm sure you all know a couple weeks ago the queen died. That hit me harder than most of the family deaths I've had to deal with so far. I was grieving mourning, whatever you want to call it. The problem for me was that I had nobody to really discuss those feelings with. It didn't matter if they were an adult or a counselor or a teacher because they wouldn't truly understand. How could they?! They're Americans! Trying to share that kind of grief with most Americans is like trying to talk with a Hindu about how much you love big macs. So I had to just keep doing school work and bottle it all up inside which sucks.

All of these things and more have left me feeling so bloody alone. Totally isolated from the rest of my age group. I used to be so out going and friendly but after years of this deafening indifference, not liked enough to befriend, nor disliked enough to be hated, I've become what some refer to as a bit of a wounded extrovert.

I'm gonna be honest, the thought of spending another 2 years with this group of nit-wits and assholes is quite frankly daunting if not terrifying. People say you'll find your crowd, so far finding my crowd has been like the Spanish looking for the fountain of youth.

I'm sorry if this is a bit disorganized (my brain usually is) but I truly appreciate if you read the whole thing, or have any advice to offer. And if there is anyone out there to whom this sounds just like you, please feel free to pm!",2022-09-20 23:53:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1553971952,4,/r/lonely/comments/xjopz8/17mthere_is_absolutely_nobody_at_school_who_is/,,0,6,(17M)There Is Absolutely Nobody at School Who is Like me.

4204,xjox6p,720pGamer,"I never really grew up knowing who I was. I've come here, and to other places all for the same reason. Not for others, not for myself, but for something much bigger. An answer. I wanted an answer. To know who I was. Growing up, I had people near me, and pets I loved. Days passed as I grew older, and I lost more and more of them. 

The grief was something that nearly consumed me whole too many times. I tried telling anyone I could, but ended up saying nothing. They left. They always do. They always will. Everyone has a threshold, a point. Then they leave. It could be for many reason or none at all.

No one says goodbye. No one checks in. No one's home. There is no home. There isn't even any illusion of structure anymore. After school, there simply was no structure to life. And I happened to have graduated at the exact worst possible time. 2020.

As if the stress of growing up was enough, knowing I'd have to find a way to exist in the world, but still have help on occasion, now there was no world, and those faces that once were going to help aimed their gun at me. Betrayal. I had no choice but to leave, there was no convincing them. Leave now, or die.

School wasn't exactly smooth either. Being an autistic child with ADHD, told to sit in a room for hours on end is torture. When anywhere but where you are is freedom, you know what you are. And when your freedom is a privilege, more so. But when out there is a polar opposite to what's in the harsh pale walls, you'll condition yourself into believing you're better off inside.

Boxed off from the world. Where no one will hear you scream, and you will move when they say, sit when they say, eat when they say, and shit when they say, or you will die. And you will suffer needlessly. Conditioned to believe structure is life. When life has no structure. And school was only designed to make you dumber.

You are whoever they say you are. Or you're dead. And will be made an example of. And no one will ever believe you, especially when you tell the truth. The only thing you are guaranteed in your life is death. And after school throws you to the wolves, there is no return. There is no structure. And life falls apart.

Faces fade, then places, then memories, until all that remains is you. Only you. But when you take everything away from a man, he has nothing to lose. And nowhere to go but up.

If you're reading this, thank you. I tend to go on, and I never really was the best at being direct.

I love telling stories. So much so, that I tend to forget where I even started. I don't expect to be remembered. In fact, if I did my job right, no one will ever know I existed at all. And no one will ever believe you or I, especially when they have no reason to lie.

I never knew who I was. But now, more than ever is the best time to find out.",2022-09-21 00:02:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1524008329,11,/r/lonely/comments/xjox6p/after_school_there_was_no_structure_to_life/,,0,2,"After school, there was no structure to life."

Now I'm  single again and I feel like I'll  never find anybody   ever again.   I just feel so forgotten  about and so uncared for.   It's  hard as hell being a lesbian, women are not easy at all.

I feel like I'm  a good person with good intentions  and I just want to love and be loved.    But this is proving impossible.   Everyone is like get a hobby, busy yourself with menial things.

I do everything  alone. Go to the store, sleep, eat, walk, drive, work and it's  always  only me.  Just me doing everything  alone.  This just  doesn't  feel good.

Every time I think I've made a real friend they leave. They suddenly stop talking to me as often, they find other friends, and they forget about me. I know people have their own lives to live and I can't expect people to want to talk to me all the time, but if we're friends, I'd at least think they'd say hi or start a conversation maybe once a week or something. I don't know.

When I moved into my home no one in my neighborhood came to meet me. I tried waving at my neighbors and they just ignore me. 

My coworkers never talk to me and then my boss says things like “why don’t you ever interact with the team?” Gee maybe because I’m introverted as hell and no one gives me a chance anyway? 

In any group situation I’m always the odd one out. Unless I force myself into conversations no one bothers to try to include me

And then of course whenever I bring this up people are just soooo quick to blame me. “Well you can’t expect EVERYONE to start a conversation with you”. I don’t. But 99% of people don’t, and I feel like that’s an anomaly. After years of trying to start conversations and getting shut down or literally ignored/talked over I just gave up. 

I’ve had friends tel me they didn’t like me before they got to know me. I asked why and they’ve said “your voice is annoying” or “you just like unfriendly”. I’ve had a supervisor at an old job tell me I need to be more expressive because no one can read me. People always called me a robot in school. The thing is, I try to be expressive and I guess it just doesn’t show 

I’m rambling at this point but seriously this fucking sucks. There must be some reason it’s so much easier for me to make friends online than in person.

Coming back from college, I saw an old middle school friend of mine. My first instinct was to just say ""Hey mate, how you been?"" and catch up since middle school.

But I just couldn't, because I knew he and everyone else back then were out of my league. He was in a soccer team while all I do is college.... I then began to have small heart palpitations and began to have dark thoughts.

""He stopped contacting you after middle school for a reason!""

""He never reached out to you in highschool despite going to the same one.""

""What have you accomplished in your sad miserable life, nothing.""

""Your gonna approach him in that outfit and haircut?""

""Leave him, he has more important things to do.""

I just couldn't bring myself to talk to him, especially since he had another friend who I didn't know.

This isn't the first time, I've seen other middle school peers but never approach them because I'm trash compared to them.

Sorry for the rant, I probably sound like a fucking idiot. I have chances but refuse to take them then I get mad that I'm lonely.

4262,xjvqww,bundlesofme,"i am tired. it is hard to articulate the true weight of that phrase.

in the places that life has corroded me, fatigue has cemented itself into the gaps left behind.

at first it was tender. a bruise. an ache so dull and gentle, alike to the lingering soreness of massaged muscles. the kind that reminds you that you are capable of feeling this, and little more. the changing colours were intriguing, even. others noticed, and asked for the story. they listened with their thumb pressing into the wound. unless someone brought a mirror to it, it was easy to forget it was there.

these bruises healed, and fresh injuries replaced them. this, of course, was clumsiness and poorly placed obstacles on the ground, or particularly sharp corners on tables and counters.

it was funny once. it was light and it seemed common-place.

what was funny once, then twice, and then again, slowly lost the crowd’s attention. a tangled wire crossing my path was no longer a question of laziness on the behalf of the person leaving it there. no, now it was my own carelessness for looking away from my footing, or not having caught my fall. at the same pace that the sun rises and falls, my own balance would betray me again. it hurt, oh it hurt. bruises became skin. it was not healing any longer, they saturated and never faded, for they replaced the soft, rosy flesh that i once felt at home with.

this was long ago. the memory has not distanced itself, only gathered more days lost among the other grieving parts of me that it holds.

now, i can no longer separate myself from the hurt. my bones are placeholders for an unshakable weariness. it makes no difference on the surface, though it has tried. rock bottom is a solid rock bottom, and it will hold my body up no matter the wear and tear that lays underneath. the structure still exists, my life checks the boxes of having four walls and a ceiling. i am employed, educated, pursing post-secondary education full-time, exercising, sleeping, eating. these four walls are no longer home, though.

i have tried it all to rebuild, and tried it again, tried it differently. i have walked amongst neighbourhoods filled with homes having these very same walls. i brought housewarming gifts. i offered my shoulder to cry on, my food to eat, my presence to accompany you, my advice, my time, my knowledge, everything i could have ever offered of myself. yet, brief relief from this isolation only existed within the doorways of people’s love and attention. when the wind was blowing too much cold air into the house, or the hand got tired of propping it open, the door closed again. a friend made and a friend lost.

i knocked at other doors, too. i’ve spent hundreds of hours in therapy, cognitive behavioural, dialectal behavioural, accelerated resolution, acceptance and commitment, any flavour of modality you could think of. many different medications. days, then weeks in hospital. months in outpatient day treatment, and more months of follow-up services. i have reached out to old friends and braved myself to strike conversation with those i did not know. i tried to sit back, watch, and learn the art of making friends. i read books about the careful skill of communication. completed worksheets. sought feedback, and acted to solve the issues raised. i have found new hobbies to venture into, more places to volunteer, more art classes, fitness groups, support groups. i have reached out in person, in writing, over video, text, stories, captions, replies, comments. i tried it all in english, and then again in french. twice the opportunity and twice the loss. no matter how far i reach, the gap does not close. it widens and swallows all that sits at its edges. i have been swallowed whole by loneliness.

i am tired of waiting. i think loneliness is tired of me, too. i have tried to escape its hold on me. i have climbed out of dark places and moved forward aimlessly for miles in the fog. the other side of the hill isolating me from the world may be a land of beauty, but i feel i will die on top of it, my shoes too worn from the effort of getting there. the trail is overgrown, and it is raining. it's still raining. it’s cold, and sweaters that were once soft and warm are now heavy with water.

i suppose this is me hanging that wet sweater out to dry, along with all my other dirty laundry. this is, mostly, metaphorical bullshit because i can’t express my emotions or experiences in plain words. this brain just doesn’t do vulnerability that way. so, don’t bend over backwards trying to make sense of my disorganized analogies. it’s okay for it to be confusing. i don’t need the world to understand, i just want the world to know. to know of me, of my presence and my skills and my love to give. until i can share those stories again, no longer in the form of faded memories, i will put my hurt out into the universe and hope that it will hold it. anyways, here i go again with metaphorical bullshit, sorry about that. thank you for listening, and have a good day my friend.",2022-09-21 05:17:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1628651319,3,/r/lonely/comments/xjvqww/my_experience_of_being_alone_also_known_as/,,0,1,"my experience of being alone, also known as analogical rambling and metaphorical nonsense. hope someone enjoys the read"

I've dealt with depression in the past and after years of work on myself, therapy and medications I finally escaped that shithole of mental state. I made new friends, I graduated from high school with decent grades and I am currently in college trying my best to get a fucking psychology degree.

Everything was doing fine, everything IS fine, but I'm not apparently.

I gradually started reverting to what I was: lazy, insecure and most importantly inept. I would like to say that I'm trying my best, but in reality I'm not doing anything at all. I passed the last months procrastinating everything I had to do in life hoping to at least find some enjoyment in my hobbies, trying to recharge my mental batteries to get back to work as soon as possible.

I passed the last months between my pc and my bed.

I was and avid (although amateur) cinephile, I used to binge movies and tv series like a baby sucks profusely on his mother's tit. It was so natural to me, it was my passion.

Now I scroll the Netflix catalogue and tell my self: ""I don't wanna watch anything, might as well go to bed"".

I used to like videogames a lot too. I previously started the Witcher series and I basically devoured the first and the second game. I looked constantly at the wiki to make sure I didn't lose anything, not even a sidequest (I got so fucking angry when I discovered that I couldn't complete my romance cards collection from the first game because I didn't give a bouquet of flowers to a random npc in the first village).
I started playing The Witcher 3 and I absolutely loved it, but I didn't finish it, I wanted to but everytime I opened the game I told my self: ""I don't feel like playing, might as well go to bed"".

Nowadays I try to find anything that gives me pleasure or anything resembling joy but it always ends up the same way: ""I don't feel like doing anything, might as well go to bed"".

I guess my bed is my new best friend now, even tho I'm starting to feel less and less emotions and sometimes I go to bed trying to sleep but because of the amount of hours I've already slept through I simply stare at the walls trying to remember the days I used to have fun.

I'm numb the majority of my days.

My aunt recently died and I feel nothing.

My sister is pregnant, I'm about to be an uncle... But I feel nothing.

Sometimes I wish I died in the sleep, but I'm worried about my cat. She's the only thing I care in life, I won't leave her alone. So I guess I'll stick around for a little longer.

That being said I hope you have a wonderful day, full of enjoyments, ciao.",2022-09-21 06:40:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642091609,4,/r/lonely/comments/xjx96r/hi_im_kid_and_i_lost_all_my_enjoyments_in_life/,,0,1,"Hi, I'm Kid and I lost all my enjoyments in life"

She had short curly black hair, she wore glasses although she hated them so I barley saw them out , nice brown eyes and a smile that made you feel happy and warm. As time went on we got to know each other and I kept falling in love with you. It had been a while since someone hugged me and I apologized because I didn’t know what to do. We’d both understood I wasn’t hugged as a child so we agreed to work on that. I found that funny and sad. You didn’t see me that way and that’s why we’re not friends anymore. What hurt more was that you would admit you made a mistake not dating me. I’m sure you said that to make me feel better but who knows. We parted ways and the first few months hurt so bad. Everyday felt like a year gone by but overtime as I went to work, went to school, and started going out to do things by myself it kind of went away.

I see pieces of her in passing - Some characteristic will catch my attention, like long, thick, dark curly hair with a slightly golden sheen. A whiff of perfume in the air.

4291,xk0c2s,PoleKisser,"I have this thing where I have difficulty recognising and/or remembering people's faces.

I just failed to recognise my neighbour YET AGAIN. She probably thinks I'm a total bitch and the rudest person in the world.

I've been feeling really low lately and this did not help one little bit. My neighbour from across the road works in a supermarket. This morning I went to said supermarket to do a bit of shopping and ended up paying at her till. And I didn't recognise her. We have been neighbours for nearly seven years. I am mortified. As I was paying I looked at her name tag (my brain went like this: familiar name, work uniform, vague physical appearance: FUCK!!! I know this person) and only then did it click but it was too late to make amends so I just went on my way wishing the earth would open up beneath me and swallow me whole.

No wonder people don't want to be friends with me.

The other day I walked by my other neighbour and looked  straight at her without saying hello because I thought it was just a random woman walking down the street. Then she swerved towards her house and said hello to me and it dawned on me who she was. 

I am already a socially awkward and anxious person and I find it really difficult to make friends (and to keep them because of my ADHD), so this condition doesn't help one little bit. The world feels so lonely.

I have had trouble recognising faces since I was a child. I used to be fairly good at drawing portraits in my teens and can still draw a bit but I can't even draw my own children's faces without looking at their picture while doing it.",2022-09-21 09:45:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1658229035,5,/r/lonely/comments/xk0c2s/does_anyone_else_here_suffer_from_face_blindness/,,0,3,Does anyone else here suffer from face blindness?

4298,xk1um6,CannaBud69,"I(24M) have been alone for most of my life. I was sent to a boarding school when I was 6. Came back when I was 13. Tried making new friends but nothing like a true bond. 
Went to college at 17. Dropped out because i realised that’s not what I wanted to do and I wasn’t good at it either. Went to a different college at 19. Covid struck. Completed everything from home. 

I have a ton of people who like me. They only do so because i know what to say and when to say it. I learnt that it’s easier to survive if people in general like you. I manipulate situations so that I’m comfortable and when I can’t do that I lose my shit. 

I have had suicidal thoughts for the better part of 3 years. A few months back i decided i won’t succumb to my feelings. I even got a tattoo(;) to remind me that i’m stronger than I think. Only 2 people know about that tattoo. I should not have told 1 of them. 

I always feel alone at night so i hop from friend to friend carrying weed (they welcome me with open arms because of it). I smoke my lungs out every night because if i’m alone, the thoughts come back. 

I’m always the one to check up on ALL my friends. Never do I feel like they care. No how are you texts or what you doing calls. I only matter when they need something or they want to smoke. It’s partly because i don’t trust them enough to tell them about my life. 

I asked a friend out who i’ve been in love with for years. She said “not right now”. How tf am I supposed to work with that. I took it as a no. I don’t want to be someone’s last resort. We still talk but it’s heartbreaking for me. She has no obligation to say yes and it just kills me knowing we’d be perfect for each other. 

My parents are loving people but in fits of rage they say stuff that shatters me inside. They can never understand what I feel. We should be  well to do off. We can spend money on anything but my dad has this habit of giving everything to his siblings.  We have come down to living on basics (apart from things we already owned, no new expensive purchases). I dont hate that i have to survive on basics. I hate that my family took advantage of my dad. That they guilted and stole from him and he can’t stand up for himself. If i bring it up, he makes sure to tell me how much he spent on my studies but won’t hear how his brothers and sisters stole 100x that amount from him. 

My so called best friend (her words) goes around parading how i’m always there for her and she’s very grateful to have me in her life. Her mom says” I wish you never leave her side”. How do I tell her she’s a bad friend. That she only remembers I exist when she’s going through a tough time. I get all her grief period. Her boyfriend get’s all the happy times. Why am I supposed to help her out through tough times and always ask whats worrying her. Why can’t the roles be reversed. She casually mentions how she takes a break from people for a while and see who texts her for general welfare inquiries. She never texts me asking about how I’m doing. I hate it. 

Lots of other things i wanna vent. Friends dont remember my birthday. They borrow money from me and never pay it back. They borrow electronics from me and damage them and take no responsibility. Just because i hate confrontation they take advantage of me. Everyone wants to ride in my bmw but nobody will ever care for my car. They will bang the doors. Leave cigarette marks on my interiors. I banned smoking in my car but they forced me into allowing it again.  It’s just too much. 

I feel I’m alive only for the  sake of others. I have no real motive in life apart from making sure my mom doesnt have to struggle for affection and help in later stages of her life like my other family members. 

I get up, go to work (6 days a week, have my own company) come back, smoke, sleep. My life is mundane. If I take even a day off midweek, my dad is on my ass saying i’m a lazy fuck. The only real happiness I get is when I’m higher than mount everest. Then everything takes a back seat. I did shrooms quite a few times. The last time i focused on what my life is for. I could only see my mom and dad. Is that what I’m here for? 

I have no idea what I should do that makes me happy. 

I don’t want suggestions. Just wanted to vent to strangers who can empathise. Tell my story.

4315,xk5pzw,Patinopecten,"I’m 24. I’m a reasonably attractive dude. During high school I was one of those kids who could drift between the different social groups at a surface level. I live in a small town, my parents were born on the same day, same year, and at the same hospital. My dad was essentially abandoned at an early an early age. My mom and her two sisters are survivors of abuse emotional abuse by my grandparents and sexual abuse by their uncle who is still alive 😡🤬. 

I have a lot of childhood trauma. My parents divorced when I was 3. I was an attempt to fix a broken marriage. I grew up alone with my anxiety ridden, depressed mother. I still live with her and her formerly alcoholic and abusive (too me) boyfriend. 

I’ve been on dates with girls, and, in retrospect, had the ability too have sex with them. I am able to charm most people I come across and am able to maintain moderate level friendships for a few months at a time. There comes a time however, when I come to feel that people grow tired of me. This process happens a lot faster with women. 

Women really intimidate me. I’m attracted to them yet I feel totally undeserving of any compliments, praise or love from them. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that I have some amount of misplaced contempt for them. 

I’m I just so lonely. I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard living in a house where I’m under the constant control of two people who hate me and to work a full time job. 

I just I had someone who wanted to be on my side. I feel really under appreciated for everything I do. As a result we argue to the point of screaming almost everyday (Being yelled at makes me go full great white shark mode 🦈. It makes me want to bite your head off and I’ve quit several jobs over it.) I really just wish I had someone on my side. Someone who could just listen and be accepting of me for the human I am. 

I’ve been to therapy. It honestly helped take a lot of the despair away and gave me some great tips on how to manage some of my social anxiety and depression. Exercise helps to an extent too. But how do I live being alone, unwantable, and unable to even love myself?

To feel like no one actually likes you, or wants you to be a part of their life in any way. Ghosted messages, left on read, never texted first, never invited to hangout when clearly there is a hangout or events. 

I feel like a used wet mop. I'll do anything for almost anyone if I am able to do so. Not because I'm hoping that will create friendship, but because I'm a helpful person. I'm kind, thoughtful, funny, and a safe place. 

It just sucks to have thoughts that people would intentionally make fun of you, or blatantly not like you for some reason. 

Even sitting out at a pool while kids swam. Another couple were talking with us and they are our friends. Talking about how long hair would look good on the other person's spouse. I said I tried it and like it, but it just didn't work for me. Mainly because the back part of my hair won't cooperate. We laughed. Then a minute or two later it was said ""I'm not sure it would look good"", of course that's what I just said. Then they continued on ""not saying you look good, or not good, but you know what I mean"". I really didn't. It's little things like that which make me feel unliked, fat, and undesirable. 

It's tough, life can suck sometimes. Like I want people to say I look good or handsome. I want to hear people say ""I like him"". Working from home sucks sometimes since I can't meet new people.

4356,xkbssz,UpbeatReturn5593,"VERY LONG POST: tldr at bottom

Background check, I’m 17f , from the UK have always been very social I’m an extrovert not that i’m obnoxiously loud or anything I’m actually quite calm and collected but I enjoy socialising and get a real buzz from it and after I end a gathering I just want to talk to more people but I’m finding maintaining friendships very hard at the moment. 

About a year ago I made the decision to leave my old school and start at a new one (a sixth form college) to further my education and prepare myself for the future and that side is all going well but in terms of friends well…

My new school is massive around 1000 pupils in my year and I’ve met lots of people most very surface level mates but I made closer friends with some other people.

One girl I’m close with we’ll call her Lucy she’s so nice to me and we get on and it’s great but she’s very antisocial and if we hang out it’s always alone, we never go out or even call text outside of school but she’s a great friend to me so I can’t complain. The problem is she’s dropping out soon and I’ve only got this other group left.

The other group consists of a couple of girls that’s i’m friends with they’re super funny and we get on but I don’t feel close to them as they all seem like best friends and often leave me out. They used to make plans in front of me about going to each others houses and once it wasn’t until three conversations later about this specific hanging out one girl turned to me and was like ‘oh I mean you should come too if you’re free this week’ and she said it genuinely and nicely but I’m sorry but you’ve been planning the entire time and didn’t think to ask me even though we’ve been ‘friends’ for a year. I declined because I know where I’m not wanted but this seems to always happen with them. Also they recently forgot my birthday and it’s not a big deal I’m older now it’s not that deep but throughout the year I wished them happy birthday even got them gifts. I know my birthday happened during the summer while we weren’t really talking but still. Another girl in that group has a birthday after me but they still wished her so it’s like???

Now quick background during the whole of last year I was borderline depressed I hated practically everything so I didn’t feel the need to make meaningful friendships or anything which I regret now So I didn’t mind that they were excluding me cause in my head it was like as long as I don’t look lonely it’s fine even though I felt very lonely on the inside. But now after the summer I feel so much more me and see my worth so much more. 

I’ve started ignoring them I haven’t hung out with them but they haven’t texted me either to ask if we want to sit together and friendship is a two way thing you know.

Do you think I’m doing the right thing dropping them even though they’re the only people I’m close to at the moment whenever Lucy isn’t here I’m often alone doing my work as I have so much of it but it really makes me sad.

What I am hopeful about is the fact I am like I said before pretty social, theres a new girl in my form that I’ll definitely try to talk to and this girl a couple seats away from me in one of my classes that I overheard taking all of my subjects so I might try my best to talk to them next lesson it’s just we’re at a point there school is almost over and not many people are looking to make new friends I just don’t know if I want to spend the remainder of that time miserable.


Tldr; feeling lonely with friendship group slightly ignoring me, am I doing the right thing by dropping them or should I try and make the friendship work again?

Edit: if you want to be friends text me, I’m always open and kind of need it😊",2022-09-21 17:48:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1607459284,1,/r/lonely/comments/xkbssz/am_i_doing_the_right_thing_my_friendships_seem_to/,,0,8,Am I doing the right thing? My friendships seem to be going all wrong.

My other classmate and i made a plan over the transit routes because due to rules I'll have to stay in the transit country for 2 days for RT PCR (48&amp;24hrs), I have no other go but to choose the route with least transit places and the least expensive one, and it seems like from the place i chose there's a direct plane too so i was overjoyed and made a plan 
 ( i literally don't want to become a burden to my dad and i already have a huge Himalayas size guilt that I'm already a burden) .


 I haven't put up the application for visa Nor booked tickets to the go to the visa centre all i did was tell him this is the outline we have thought till now, he legit shushed me . I was seriously so excited about it he could have atleast listened to it or given his suggestion i would have been so much happier that he actually tells me stuff , my classmate' s parents were legit like we should book the tickets now for the visa centre. 

Like i dont want my parents to be this enthusiastic but atleast showing some interest would be nice , i... Really just want to like disappear from this world for a while and comeback when i see it like a better place ,

4366,xkdb2z,MusicalMiddleFinger,"I've always had this issue where my friends always start off saying I'm a cool person and they wanna hang out with me a lot, but after a while they just kinda... lose interest? And start spending less and less time with me, they stop initiating contact and just slowly fade away from my life despite my efforts to keep in contact 

My newest friendship is ending up like this again. She won't try to sit next to me in class anymore, she's barely asking me to do stuff with her. When we're about to head home after lectures, she'll always say something like 'I have to talk to X, go ahead' and she's just spending more time with others in general. I guess I'm just that boring to be around, huh. Or others are just that much more fun.

I get that I don't go out drinking often because it's expensive, I get that I don't always have a lot to say to things people say because I'm autistic and conversations sometimes take heavy turns when I'm around. But why not say ""hey, could you stop X/do less of Y"" or just straight up say this is over? It's so fucking humiliating and painful trailing after her like a lost puppy and being shot down constantly by being ignored or told to ""go ahead"" because her other friends are on the way. It makes me feel so ashamed to receive the awkward polite smiles whenever I try to join in on a conversation and be included. 

I've always felt out of place. I don't feel like I belong in this world. I'm always too much, too little, too awkward, too different, not normal enough, too boring...

I have a wonderful fiance who I will be getting married to later this year, but outside my family I don't really talk to anyone else. He is wonderful and I love him so much, but he doesn't replace the friendships I use to have.  I've tried making a few friendships at work and keeping in touch with friends I used to have, but none have really worked out. If I'm not the first one to reach out I never hear from them.

It's my own fault I don't live close to my family, but moving back isn't really an option due to my career. I love them so much, but I also wanted to be out on my own in an environment I thought I would love, but it has just turned into nothing but my job and making me doubt my future. I have missed out on so much of my younger brothers life (who just turned 2) and it has really upset me too.

I thought I had made a friend with someone at work. We talk outside of work about various topics, and so I invited them to my wedding. They seemed so excited to get it, but they told me they couldn't come today. I felt kind of lost because I was sure they would come, and thought that I had finally found someone who was or I thought was my friend. 

I'm going back to school next year to try some new stuff but it all seems so pointless. I am so tired of trying, and I feel like I don't have the extra time I did to keep making the effort with the people I thought were my friends (who won't message me if I don't them...for 2-6 months so far...)

I don't want to come off as the annoying person who thinks there is more friendship than there is, but I am so tired of feeling alone all the time. I've confided in my fiance about this, who encourages me to try new hobbies and meet more people, but then those don't get back to me either, or don't have many people my age that I can relate to.

4395,xkiit6,Ye_Dave,"Returning from a business trip last week  I (36M) realised it didn't matter to anyone that I was back that day. 

Went straight to the office; no one there (because it's a Friday post covid). No one in town for dinner or drinks (because it's a Friday post covid). Stayed after office hours ended just catching up on e-mail and sinking a few beers. I didn't want to go home. 

I live on my own in a great place and have done for a decade. Grew up with some abuse issues and always wanted 'a place of my own' to be safe and happy with my own company and invite friends. I should be content. 

But Covid broke so many of my connections. My partner ended our relationship and I found myself more alone than I'd been. Friends had moved out of town, had kids and moved on with their lives. I had not. I felt desperately alone, That day I'd landed back in the wreckage of my life and I was buried by despair. 

Now I'm trying to dig myself out and I know you can too. 

Hard as it is we can nurture and cherish our relationships and friendships.  We must make new connections, volunteer, take on work projects that get us to new places.  We can also ask for help. 

In the US and the UK our shit neoliberal societies deprive us of community and connection. That's why we're forced to seek companionship in 'romantic' partnerships and nuclear families. But it doesn't have to be this way and it wasn't for much of human history. 

Build communities, build connections. Join a political party, go to church, help out the nice elderly and listen to their stories, buy your doorman a coffee and chat. If you have friends with kids (and I know, sometimes this is so hard and it hurts) go and hangout and help. 

I'm HUGELY privileged to live in a major metro area and have a reasonable job. I know that isn't the case for all of you but there are connections in even the hardest place. You can BE that connection. You can convene it. 

You can find your community. You can find your tribe.",2022-09-21 22:03:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611876647,1,/r/lonely/comments/xkiit6/lost_connections/,,0,0,Lost connections

4407,xkkw55,Ivosorio,"Hi
Well today I have finally reached the peak of friends being able to accumulate the round number of 0

I have came to the conclusion that the more a person is respectful of others the less they like you (a little strange I know but what is the other explanation)

This is getting a little annoying you know, in 23 years the longest friendship had 6 years and just ended a few hours ago out of the blue, like 2 months ago excited to talk to me, today its not you it's me I think our friendship doesn't make sense anymore 

So my life that was pretty lonely just got on other level, not that before my social life was anything good and know I think that is so hard to make friends at list around my age I have finished my studies so no more school to socialize and started working but my colleagues are all much older than me (40,50,60 years old) I can build a relationship with them but it's not the same thing. 

Specially when we are younger we don't really realize the path that we taking, we just saw when it's to late because there were lots of red flags: I was never invited to a party, never really maintained the friendships, never really integrated whith others, passing 1 year to consider someone as a friend, never been whith anyone outside of school. 

I know that I am a little demanding about my friends, like people that think that are better than others, or make bullying whith others, or people that are complete arrogants but isn't that like common sense 

Is it that hard to make friends we see every day people connecting with each other, why is that is so hard for us?

4457,xkq1nv,butterflykiss86,"
Im hurting and i need to rant.

I was raised in abuse. I grew up fatherless and my mother was a drunk, drugged out whore who didn't give a shit about me.  Never knew my family bc my toxic mother stayed away unless she needed something.  Ended up moving out at 15 raising myself and working  2 jobs in HS. I had a car at 16, an apartment at 17. I graduated and went on to more school. I met my husband @ 20 and we've been together for almost 2 decades. We have 5 kids together. 
Here's the thing. I have so much responsibility, always have. I've never been able to connect with anyone besides my husband because we both came from hell and wanted something better. His hell wasnt as violent as mine but it hurt him all the same. He was dirt poor his whole life. He was raised in an rv. His parent rarely gifted him on birthdays and holidays.  If he did get nice things they went to the pawn shop at some point never to return. His senior yr of HS his teacher helped buy him clothes bc he was still wearing the same stuff from freshman yr.  He was embarrassed bc the teacher made sure to get underwear too. Underwear are essential but kids don't think like that, he was mortified. 
Anyway, I have my children and it's been hard unlearning and dealing with my trauma trying to raise them. Like I have no mentor type examples to pull from bc no one loved me when i was growing up. No one nurtured me or showed me anything. I was just baggage.
I feel so alone. I feel guilty for feeling lonely bc I'm married, I have kids, I have a career, I'm an RN.  I live in a nice house, drive a nice car. I'm well dressed and so are my kids. My kids are well taken care of without help from grandparents or family bc they are nonexistent. 
I just feel like I've had to overcome so much and work so hard all my life.
 All the abuse I endured from the very beginning of my life as far back as I can remember  which is about 3. My mom hit me, pulled my hair, yelled constantly,  left me with random women and men. She married 5 times before i was 15 and i called them all dad! I didn't have consistent food or shelter. I was abused almost every way imaginable. My face is scarred from cigarette burns and other injuries that required  stitches. I got 37 stitches in my face and 9 staples in my leg before i left home. All this has left me unable to form relationships.  Like I'm good enough to fill the space but no one wants to get to know me. I present well rounded, helpful, and kind but inside I feel lost and alone. I feel like a freak. 
Many times I've thought about taking my life. For several years I drank so much, like a pint a day, wanting to die. No one knew besides my husband and older kids because i kept on with my responsibilities inspite of being a drunk. I don't feel like I want to die now bc my kids need me. I have a really good relationships with my kids. But they are my kids. I can't share everything with my kids and a lot of times I pay the whole bill when we go out. 
I'd like to have friend. A real friend. A genuine down to earth gentle friend, who can be a bit mischievous.  Id like to be invited to a bbq, bonfire,  movie or something for once. 
As I approach 40 I'm starting to think that friendship isn't in the cards for me.

Upon going there it's quite remarkable how everyone else gets along so easily, of course I haven't gotten along with anyone but I didn't expect to nor wanted to. All the sudden one day this guy who I'm working with for a group project said she was going to walk with me to the parking lot, wow, we were walking, and talking, and it was quite nice actually. Naturally I immediately get a crush and she is all I think about, I mean, who does that? She smiles and tilts her head at me, there's no way this is normal right? Anyway the next I go to sit down and start working and this peer I walked pass waves at me. Pretty much have 0 history with her, but I didn't think too much of it. Not a few seconds later another girl who I don't even have a single class with waves at me too! This one especially caught me off gaurd. Why would she do this. As I sit down this other girl in my math class starts making small talk with me about a test yadda yadda. Now I can't help but think that maybe everyone there have made a collective agreement to try and interact with me more. Honestly it's not that unlikely considering this new school, there's only like 100 students and they're all the same age, they all sit at 1 large lunch table talking while I'm sat alone doing work. They all seem to be friends with eachother and are genuienely good people who are just concerned for me. Honestly it's kind of unsettling, now I don't know if people are actually engaged in a conversation with or are just worried for my mental health. And worse of all, I can't shake the feeling that the girl who walked with me before has no interest in me. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this is case, it's quite upsetting. You've heard the tale before of people trying to make ""the shy kid"" feel better by sitting with him or something, but ultimately making things worse. I'd much rather you prefer to not attempt to help in that way. The way I see it, it's just straight up lying to me, an absolute lie, no you are not actually interested in my personality at all, you just want to do the right thing, and now I have a false impression that you have any sort of admiration.

Sorry if things have bad sentence structure, grammar, etc . It's basically a rant

When I got home I told my dad about it and he said he was proud of me.

While he was making dinner he asked me if I had to make any changes to my life what would they be anything?

I told him that I’d wish I would change my social life, and my motivation to eat healthier and workout lose weight.

One of the things he told me specifically about my social life was “Well your 19 now your young you’ve got time, I’d say you’ll be flying round town at all hours having fun by 20, 21”

I told him that’s something i kinda have to remind myself about a lot about how much time I have. I told him about the lesson I took from the hobbit.

“Bilbo’s story taught me that adventure will come to us we just have to have the courage to go on it.”

4465,xkrbnp,TippyToes68,"Been crying off and on for the last couple days.  I feel so hurt and rejected yet also angry and defensive. And confused. 

48 hrs ago my online world was rosy. My 2 ""friends"" in game and I did some guild dungeon runs,  got a few achievements....but one noticed that my heath bar had less than another member despite being of the same level and spec,  and even though my gear is much higher level.

A conundrum that the 3rd ""friend"" was sure they knew why...my gear, while good was last season.  Seemed simple so I went and got new pieces,  leveled them up and equipped them... only to find no change in my health levels like I was expecting. 

From this point the night spiraled out of control and I'm not sure how.  I realized that I wasn't increasing my health with the new gear because the gear was literally the same type and level (though I had chosen a different main characteristic, ie haste rather than crit sort of thing). The one who told me the issue was my gear was so adamant that I was still using old gear couldn't or wouldn't understand that I actually had the current season of gear and we were both getting a little frustrated. 

They kept telling me to compare my gear to theirs... and I could find no difference, same name, type, season etc despite the difference in what stats it was buffing for (and that mine were leveled up-ie: upgraded-higher than theirs) ... and I guess I was just as adamant there was no difference so that couldn't be the reason for the health bar amount differences.  

Side note: if the gear I had just bought was 'out of date' it would not have been able to be upgraded,  yet that was the gear they kept telling me was outdated. 

I guess they took it to mean more than intended as they began to say whatever, I don't care, you act like I'm trying to take something from you,  I see how are... and immediately started removing their toons from the guild.

Side note 2: in one of the apologies I said I didn't mean to hurt their feelings and their response was 'feelings,  I don't have' ... ??

Flabbergasted I begged them not to go, apologized twice... and finally just told them if this was such a big deal then I'd go, since they'd been there longer,  knew the gm personally... and got no argument. 

So I did...crying all the while and yet mad too. Which is where we started this post.  Hurt, confused, feeling like a petty arse and like I must be real childish to do the whole 'no no you stay,  I'll just take my ball and go home' thing.

And to top off this self pity cake ... the other ""friend"" hasn't said a word. Not in game or out. So I guess I know where I stand. 

I'm still butthurt about the situation and wishing I hadn't argued about what I saw as mistaken information and just dropped it ... but am starting to think it makes no difference in the end. 90% of my game time was alone anyways due to different time zones and work hours. 

I don't really know what I wanted from this post. To vent certainly. Validation maybe, that maybe the other guildie overreacted ... and fully expecting confirmation that I did as well. Hoping for sympathy, I guess. 

Sorry for the long post. If you stuck it out to the end, thanks, regardless of you opinion of the situation. And if you are wondering why the post is in this topic ... it's because I don't really have anyone in my life that I can say these things to.  Alone,  lonely and sad.  Sigh. OK I'll shut up now.

4472,xks7pv,AltLight000,"So I’m just gonna go straight to the point and say that I’m really bad at talking to new people, specially women. All my life, I was that weird fat kid that didn’t have many friends. In elementary school they weren’t really good friends and I don’t know from them nowadays. That changed afterwards and now I have 3 friends who talk and support me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful for their companionship, but lately I’ve been thinking it’s time I got a girlfriend. 

I downloaded Tinder and It’s been going pretty well actually. I matched with 3 girls, but none of them have responded to me so idk if I did something wrong, but it makes me feel frustrated. It’s as if I’m some sort of ghost. I honestly don’t know why. 

I’m tired of being envious of people who have a meaningful relationship. I’m a 22yro virgin who probably will never have such a thing with a woman. I can’t even cry about it at this point tbh. I can’t even watch porn without having the constant reminder of how miserable and alone I am. I just wish a girl could give me a goddamn chance.

 I apologize if this is all over the place, I’m just writing down my thoughts as I go, but yeah idk wtf I have to do. Thing is I’ve been going out to try and mingle, but I can never find an opportune moment to connect with someone for x and y reason.

4475,xkswqi,valpurgustghnacht,"It's coming up on one year since my friends left me. 

As the title states, it's coming up on a year since my friends left me. It was October 20th of last year. It was all of our senior year, and I had been going through a rough patch because of somethingg that had happened to me. 

I'll call them O and C. 

O I had known through my sophomore year about. We met in the GSA at school and had one class together. When quarantine started we were like brothers. We played games together all of the time, like fortnite, apex, anything that happened to be either free or included in game pass. Summer of 2021 C joined us, and I don't know why but O got tired of me. 

As background I have diagnosed BPD, and every so often I would catch them two playing together without me. Looking back I see the signs of them drifting from me. I'd like to think that the group me and them were in was one of the popular groups aka, I had a ton of friends. I didn't feel alone for the first time in my life. Everyone in school liked and knew me just about. I guess I was the punk of the group too lol. 

O was a gay cisgender man, C, a cis girl, and me a transgender man. C would say things about transgender men and people with bpd and other mental illnesses that were hurtful to me, and I would call her out for it. O started saying those things too. And then they decided to not be friends with me because I was calling them out for things they said that hurt me. I would go into specifics about the final conversation. But yeah. 

I'm still not over it. I left my senior year with no one. Which, being alone wasn't new to me and still isn't. Doesn't make it not scary or petrifying. 

But O was like my brother. The one person I trusted with everything, and he trusted me with everything aswell. We would read each other's stories and help each other with art or whatever projects. It still hurts. 

But on Oct 20th specifically, I had asked them if they wanted me around. They both said no. I was going to kill myself. They were all I had. I still remember how we were supposed to call and talk about it right when we got home from school, but O cared so much he fell asleep right when he got home and forgot about it, and C was so adamant about me being a terrible person she blocked me on everything. 

I have a wonderful long distance boyfriend now but I can't help but feel so very alone. Especially when I see everyone else have other things to do. Have friends to talk to. And just have people to hang out with in general. I hate being alone. 

I hate it so much. I haven't been in the same room as someone who isn't family in so long. My body hurts so much whenever I imagine my boyfriend holding me or kissing me. 

I know that this is ridiculous. I know I am being irrational about being lonely, but I have been so my whole life. 

I remember when I got pulled into my high schools guidance office to decide what I was going to do after school. My counselor told me I was number 295 out of 297 seniors. 

When I told O and C about it, they just told me about how they were both in the top 20s. I guess the only thing going through their heads was how I would just hold them down. I don't blame them. I will not ever do anything good for the world, or anyone. I was a failure all of high school, not because I was going to kill myself, but because I thought someone or some event was going to do it for me. I wish I did it myself. But I'm here now. The kid who cried in the corner in world geography actually graduated on time.

I miss my friends deeply. I still don't know what I did but I'm very sorry for yelling at O on the phone that day. I was sick. I didn't know what to do and I still don't. I want my brother back. I would do anything for another chance. When we graduated I sent him an (admittedly tipsy) congratulations text on Instagram and when I deleted it he blocked me. I miss not being lonely. 

I miss when people who promised not to leave actually went through with their promises. Or rather, that people would never promise such a thing.",2022-09-22 05:49:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600411053,1,/r/lonely/comments/xkswqi/i_have_no_friends_after_senior_year/,,0,0,I have no friends after senior year

They say they love me but I never felt it, the world can see and feel the love have for each other so it sucks to be me. My family has their own lives and me trying to involve myself is only useful if I'm doing a favor. 
The whole family is religious so my sexuality already makes them liking me whole impossible. 
With friends they give the bare minimum but I keep them around they do have their own lives as well so I try to be understanding. 
Never had a relationship just get used for sex and blocked so I stopped having that when I caught on.
Have a therapist that's so shitty that I got angry after the session.
I have the worst luck I'm young suffering hair loss and always have so that gets me no where, nobody respects me even when I beg, set standards or distance for 3 months-1 year

The mutual friend is a guy but I’d like a friend that’s a girl that’s only mine and not shared with my gf. I can’t drive and mostly just stay in my room all the time if I’m not going to class or work. I’ve had an eating disorder for half my life now and it makes me feel unworthy and gross. Every best friend I’ve had has abandoned me. The last one was my best friend for almost 7 years and it’s too traumatic to recount considering this post will probably get buried anyway. I’ve tried Bumble bff with no luck, and my job is at a senior home where my gf, our friend, and I are the only people under 30. I’ve tried to become friends with someone this past year and it almost worked out until a series of unfortunate events ruined it. I ruined another potential friendship by sleeping with him during a failed open relationship idea. I just feel so lost and alone, I wish I had somebody other than my gf to talk to.

4496,xkwygs,be_kind2eb,"Hi there,
I'm so sorry to read about all the tragedies you are experiencing and often have been experiencing for many years. I've noticed for a while now how prevalent loneliness is also amongst young people and how detrimental it is to one's well-being and mental health. I'll therefore write my thesis on loneliness and would like it to be a helpful contribution to raise awareness and help find solutions. Therefore I' br really grateful for your input and experiences!

∆ What does being lonely mean for you? (is it the feeling of being disconnected despite being surrounded by people, is it the lack of close or romantic relationships or is it the lack of people you can talk to in general)

∆ What would help you get rid of your feelings of loneliness? (Do you need opportunities to meet people, is it self-esteem and self-worth to uplift you, is it social skills that you need to form meaningful connections or do you think changing your mindset in any way would help you feel more connected)

∆ Do you beat yourself up for feeling lonely and not having people who care about you, do you tend to feel sorry for yourself or do you have understanding for your feelings and show compassion towards yourself and your experiences?


I really don't mean to sound blunt here, but I know loneliness is experienced and dealt with very differently by everyone and I would really like to know how people here relate to it. So if you are willing to share your experience either in the comments or dm to help me make a meaningful contribution I'd be more than grateful!

Ps: please don't give up on yourself or your life. You're enough, you're worthy and there is always someone who wants to be there for you and can help you to make things better, for example hotlines, organisations and other professionals. It's no shame to ask for help!",2022-09-22 09:50:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644136752,2,/r/lonely/comments/xkwygs/whats_it_like_for_you/,,0,5,What's it like for you?

4537,xl4h5i,NotBorris," I hate acknowledging this, but we absolutely live in a reality where looks matter. And when it comes to guys who are unfortunate to not meet the standards, we still have some things we can grab onto. Weather it's each other and we can form a brotherly bond or to learn to accept ourselves for who we are or improve so that we can like ourselves better. But it seems that women who are not seen as attractive don't have that opportunity, or are not even given the time of day to express their feeling without guys pouncing on them to keep it to themselves or to send them picks.  I'm not saying that men don't have it rough, but for the most part it just seems that the guys don't want to have a partner, they just want to get laid.  And there really isn't anything wrong with that, so long as you admit it to yourself.

Now I have never been with a woman, nor have I ever been a woman, so I'm not going to pretend that I fully know what I'm talking about. But from what I've seen from movies, social media and the like, it's usually men that are given a pat on the shoulder and told that everything will work out in the end. But I don't know if the same applies for women. What if a girl has also been rejected numerous times, or has never had the self confidence to enter the world? Would she be given the same support as guys would? Would someone be willing to let her cry her eyes out and explain why they are so scarred or ashamed and actually listen to what she has to say.

I say this because I was looking into the MGTOW movement, and I was almost sucked into it.  I'm like their prime demographic, and I do agree with their self worth and self improvement speeches.  But their outlook on woman was way to obnoxious for me, it seems that they absolutely refuse to  acknowledge that woman do have problems, and for the most part it seems that they are all just bitter men who had their hearts broken.  Like, I'm sorry that happened to you, but you need to take a chill pill, my guy.

And it irritates me when guys keep saying that a girlfriend will solve all problems, what if a girl does have interest to improve your situation but you don't find her attractive, or she's not up to the modern standards, then you'd be singing a different tune.

Then there are other groups I joined where people will dominate the conversation and when I get to say something, there isn’t much reaction its like an “okay, great anyways”. Guess a reason for that is all I talk about with them is roleplaying while the chats are more so about irl stuff but my irl side is so boring and depressive that I just don't want to tell people that stuff. Or that I don't have the best social skills to make the chats with people entertaining. I join groups or talk to individuals with that we have the same hobbies like roleplaying. Then it's me getting upset and leaving then I have to search out people again. 

I try to keep an open mind when I join these groups and not let my past experiences dictate my potential interaction but it's so hard when I haven't seen much change with other people. Just have been meeting with awful people. Hope I can find a decent group and start making meaningful friendships. I've been lonely for so long.

But in high school through 2 years ago, (I’m nearly 30) I thought I had a small and loving group of friends who cared about my as much as I cared about them. Long story short, my two best friends (who are sisters) had been verbally abusive our entire friendship. I tried to have a conversation about my concerns with this friend when it reached a point where I wasn’t going to take it anymore, but they just screamed at me and said horrible things. 

So, we’re no longer friends. Her sister, who I was still planning on being friends with as she was less abusive then her sibling. She ended up ghosting me despite discussing how we can still be friends. This was two years ago and I went through a long period of grief that had me feeling suicidal ideation (I would not act on those feelings). It still hurts today, but not to the degree it did in the immediate after math. 

Looking back, through reflection with my therapist, I realized most of my friendships were abusive, and I was never myself in these relationships. Obviously, this as another level of pain that I felt. While I’ve been working through it the last two years, I’m still feeling despair over my lack of connection with people.

I recently moved to the country and I love it here, but making friend is incredibly difficult. Not only because of the area being rural, but because I have social anxiety and feel scared to trust people and be myself. I have major depressive disorder, so that doesn’t help either. I’m honestly just desperate to connect to another human being. I’ve been crying for days. I really value authenticity and vulnerability with others… it’s just not happening.

4596,xlfdsp,deviouslylicking,"Provided its a good one of course. It gets pretty annoying seeing all different kinds of advice that basically tell you being in a relationship isn't that big of a deal and not really a necessity as if it isn't one of the main cornerstones of a healthy, meaningful life (yeah, I know there are some people who aren't wired this way, but to my knowledge most humans are). 

You can make the argument that its bad to be ""looking for love"" or that you can find other ways to fill your life, but have you considered that maybe the person who has nothing going on for them wouldn't find at least mild improvement in their life from having someone to talk to every day and be cared for? Sure, there's a ton of caveats to situations like those too, but speaking from personal experience, its a lot easier to come out of bad situations like that when you have people start liking and caring about you. And what about people who seemingly already have everything aside from a good romantic relationship? Are they wrong for wanting one now? Is it still bad to be looking? After a certain period not having dating success, don't you think its understandable to start getting a little irritated? No, being desperate is bad.

I could word all of that better but it'd probably turn into an essay. I'm really just in a funk from a shitty time at work over the past couple weeks and now that my coworkers (the ones I get along with well at least) are gone for our days off, hanging with their partners, I'm stuck alone with a ton of awful feelings and no one to seriously talk to about them. I started thinking ""Imagine how nice it would be to come home and just have someone there to talk to. Or maybe I'll just be so happy to spend time with them that work bullshit stops mattering so much."" I've also recently started getting serious about dating and of course there's tons of failures involved in that so I'm a little down from that too.

I don't even have bad friends, they just, understandably, want to hang out with their SOs after being at work for two weeks straight. We still have our own hangout sessions and we all care about each other. It's just times like these when I don't have anyone to reach out to. I'm not about to vent text friends when their out having a good time trying to get away from work.

I have pretty good friends now and am on a good career path for me, getting money saved up, some hobies, all that good, fun shit.

I'm getting older (but not too old, only 39 still) and my parents are pretty old and I just don't want to put it on my mom's shoulders and my dad isn't really somebody I can talk to. I don't have friends I talk to about stuff anymore. I do have a long time friend, but she's usually the one dumping her issues on me. So I don't even bother her. 

I feel like I have too much going wrong to be a good person for anybody to get involved with. I'm not a bad person, just have lots of stuff going on. I'm in a crappy situation for now and I just feel drained. 

But I'm still so lonely. I cry every once in a while bc I feel so stuck and lost. I did start seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, so I'm trying to get help for how I feel. I found out I have a somewhat serious health issue recently and sometimes I feel like times ticking away way too fast. Like you never know how long you have left and you don't wanna waste anymore time just in case. 

Somehow I haven't given up hope that one day I'll be ok and I will be a good person to somebody. At least that's what I want. I like most people, but I rarely click with anybody bc I'm a bit of a weirdo. I have respect for everybody though, as long as they respect me or aren't horrible people. 

I'm just venting I guess. It's probably pretty sad that I have nobody in my life to talk to about this stuff. I only get so much time with my therapist. There's so much going wrong, I can't even list it all here. I keep feeling like I'm shutting down and just bottling a lot up bc what else am I gonna do with it?

When I talked about my interests or what was going on in my life, I was usually ignored, but when someone else said something, they'd respond within a minute, all while I talked about their interests and things they liked, because that's what friends do.

4635,xljw7y,galaxygkm,"I haven’t had friends since I was 11, and now I’m a teenager in high-school not so far from college. Having social anxiety definitely contributed to my loneliness, because I used to have friends, and now it’s even harder to make friends at school irl as I’m getting older since people tend to only take interest in those who can hold up a good conversation and not be awkward. My social anxiety has gotten better, but I’ve still never been able to get someone to like me, genuinely like me enough to be willing to be friends with me except online. Everyone says that I’ll find the right people eventually but I’m impatient and tired of waiting. I’ve done everything such as join clubs, contribute more in conversations despite the amount of effort it kind of takes for me to talk for a longer period of time. Even when I feel a connection coming on between me and someone else they eventually leave, get bored, or forget about me because I still am not enough to get their interest. I thought high school would be better but I’m already about halfway or so through and still no friends. I wish that I was close with my family to make up for that. I have 2 parents who hate each other yet still live together, and no siblings. I actually used to be closer to my cousins and family when I was younger, but even though I like them they’re all in college much older than me or much younger than me plus they live 15 hours away by plane and that also leaves a barrier in our relationship. 

I lie to myself and can temporarily believe that I’ll be fine on my own. But it’s not that easy. I love being alone, but I hate being lonely. I walk through the hallways in school and see everyone in their friend groups laughing, hugging whenever they see each other, supporting one another and it stings to know that I may never have that. I’ll never again really know what it’s like to be missed, to make someone proud whenever I get an award to achieve something small like winning a game. I’ll never know what it’s like to be someone’s first choice, let alone an option to them at all. So I just want to know, how do I make this a little easier to bare?",2022-09-23 01:40:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622908782,6,/r/lonely/comments/xljw7y/how_do_i_cope_with_loneliness_in_highschool_im/,,0,1,How do I cope with loneliness in highschool?

It hurts to be alone, seeing those who share a connection and hearing their laughter, speaking freely with one another not caring for judgment because they're living in the moment to care. Having someone by their side likely gives them a sense of comfort and confidence. I yearn to have a friendship like that.

I know that Friendship takes time and effort to build, yet I'm impatient. It pains me to see everybody else with somebody at school. I don't want to feel this emotion anymore.  I don't want to desperately long for someone as if it was the only thing that can bring me joy.

Embracing loneliness seems to be the best solution so far. This way I wouldn't feel self-conscious about my peers getting along together while I sit alone. Envious of having what I don't.

I’m 25F, used to post lots of complaints in this sub due to loneliness and depression. It’s heartbroken for me to read many of you experience the same, if not worse, experience relating to mental illness and loneliness, even wanting to end things by suicide, just to make it all go away.

Several years prior, I had the worst time of my life, I had an awful first bf, who treat me with nothing but disrespect, and often used me to fulfill his own satisfaction. I finally let myself to be brave albeit hurtful, and broke up with him, then I had my first episode of suicidal thoughts. At that time, I was the black sheep of the family. My family had money problems, my parents had marital problems, and I had no friends, so when I broke up with my ex, I was alone, and being alone, your thoughts can be incredibly dangerous. I almost went on and kill myself, but I hold up and convince myself, that if everyone else can be much happier than I am, why can’t I? So I held up, even though I cried myself out day and night. Then I met my second boyfriend. He is a much nicer man, but I had to have an abortion because of him, and it hurts me deeply. Although after time went on, I found a friend within him, but unfortunately things didn’t work out, and I am alone, again.

The next episode of depression that I experienced was after I broke up with my 2nd ex, early this year. Not because of the break up, but I was at a foreign country at that moment with language I barely, and it was incredibly scary. Now, I am still in that foreign country, with no family or friends here. I am lucky to have a bf now, who treats me much, much better, but the loneliness is still there. There are nights when I miss my home country, and when I envy people who can befriend others easily. But albeit all of the loneliness, all of the depression, I am in a better place now, my life quality has become much, much better compared to all those years ago.

I grow. I learn things. I have become someone better.

I know, and I completely understand my life story may be much simpler than yours, who may experience much more difficult hardships. But I can promise you, I never regret my decision NOT to kill myself that day. I may still be lonely sometimes, cry, etc., but still, what I have seen, experienced, and endured, I would never trade it.

So if there is anyone out there, who is reading this, who thought about ending things, who have depression, who have loneliness, just know it will get better, please, don’t throw your life away. If you see someone else who is much happier than you, you can be that person, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, next month, who knows.",2022-09-23 06:28:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1625402140,15,/r/lonely/comments/xlpni1/sharing_my_experience/,,0,20,Sharing my experience :)

4680,xlps6p,jotspot,"I've tried a lot, but there's nowhere for me to be. I am alone among crowds of people, because none of them are like me. I am an alien. A very depressed alien. I have no ""people"". It's just me, floating in existence aimlessly, painfully. I've tried joining groups and stuff, but that doesn't work out. So I am alone, again. I have lived alone since I was 15. I have never had an SO. I haven't even been on a date in a dozen years. I have no family (mostly due to transphobia), and very few casual friends, most of which I can never see, because they have lives and I don't. Even at pride, I felt like an alien, because they are all different from me. My best friends are older ladys who are closer to aunts, plus a person I've never met because they are thousands of km/miles away. I'm not far along enough developmentally in life to meet others my own age. Not capable of love, but I still believe capable of friendship. But noone wants that. They all want to get hitched, or are already hitched. The only parties interested just want me for a sexual play thing, which I have no part of (and I'm ace and a virgin anyway). Forget the fact that I am too self conscious anyway. I recently tried going to a centre for people with mental health issues recently a few times, but most people there are older or not very bright, so we don't have common ground to communicate. It's hard because some don't even understand what I'm saying. So I am an alien. I tried joining card game groups, but transphobia kept me away and then other issues make me realize I'm unwanted. I volunteer at the museum, but I am alone there too. The curator comes and goes, and when he's gone, I'm alone again, in the basement working on something. There's not a lot I can do tbh, so I spend most of it at home when I'm not in those 3 places. With no money, and no point to leave, plus ASD problems that limit where I can go, I guess I'm stuck. I'm not a kid, but I sure have the maturity of one, so that makes me feel out of place, and like an alien again. Noone calls me. There's no one to even call or text me, or make sure I'm okay. And what scares me most? The few places I can go are also closed off to me when winter comes... I've got only a couple more weeks of being out and about, and then I have to hibernate...It's going to be a lonely 6 months....",2022-09-23 06:35:48,lonely,t5_2qjny,1532116803,7,/r/lonely/comments/xlps6p/day_in_day_out_always_alone/,,0,0,"Day in, day out...

I feel like no one likes me anymore. 
I think I am a nice person, at least I try to be. It seems like when I try to talk to the opposite sex that they never feel anything for me. I got so tired of this agonizing emptyness, that on the 24 of last year I jumped off an overpass. Which was about 60ft in the air. I landed feet first and broke 6 ribs, my hip, my left leg, both my feet, and a burst fracture in my spine. The revived me 3 time and had rro give me a blood transfusion.

My entire holiday (and life come to think of it) has been my playing video games for hours on end with no teammates. I only have so much time left of the holidays and my youth, which so far has been spent in a dark room, playing cod, jacking off and smoking pot. It all just feels like a constant post-masturbation guilt. After this post I will probably go to bed with nothing but my pillow and the blue light of my phone for company.

None of my friendships have been particularly meaningful or have lasted long. Once the first flames of interest die out the interactions hit a dead end. What “close” friends I thought I had have also died out with them finding another group or girlfriend to hang out with. It’s hard to be close friends when all you are to them is their plan b. All the advice I get is some form of “put yourself out there and make the first move”. As an introvert, most people don’t realise the difficulty of making it over that hurdle. It almost feels like you have to scale a mountain before anything starts to go downhill. My desire for alone time and my desire for company is dragging me both ways. The only way I can ever achieve complete satisfaction with my life is with interaction. Humans are all social creatures after all. As much as video games, YouTube and reddit have helped me to cope, at the end of the day, that’s all they are, a coping mechanism.

4724,xlycuy,ILikeFireEmblemFates,"I've been in University for a couple weeks now. In my italian class, there's a girl who i find stunningly good looking, with a very grunge style, bangs and overall very reminiscent of the time when Nirvana was hip. 

We do not study the same thing, i am learning about geopolitics and she is into psychology, there is also a gap in our Italian level as she is quite fluent (and might leave the group for a better ones if our professor wants) meanwhile i haven't trained it for quite some times.

She seems like a very fascinating person, who showed to the whole class that she was a knowledgeable and smart person through her answers and i'd love to learn more about her, she talked about her hobbies of singing and going to the opera/theatre with her friends.

Problem is that with her rather uncommon style she probably attracts tons of people, she might even already be in couple or have lots of guys much more attractive and into her hobbies than me who just knows her because we share a class, i don't even have any way to communicate with her outside of school.

For some reason i've thought about her a lot and i hate it because i never had this experience before, im always good at forgetting whatever i need to forget to live a good life, i know that i have no chance with her, It's over even before it started.

4728,xlzyy7,DaBorisbsuperstar,"Before anything this is gonna have some stuff about suicide, drugs, alcoholism and similar stuff. If you are sensitive about this maybe skip this post.
Ever since I can remember to ""have feelings"" I felt like something was missing. Even as a 7 year old I remember how I would always feel... Incomplete. I wasn't necessarily sad, nor happy. I kinda just existed. Never understood it so I guess I kinda learned to live with it.
It was after my best friend, my ""sister"" and my now ex girlfriend that I truly understood what that feeling was.
At 13 years old I moved countries and after a while I became really good friends with a guy from my school. Let's call him Leo.
Leo and I grew to basically become good friends. We had a decently deep friendship. Never talked about really deep stuff, but we would always do stuff together. When both of us were free we were for example be playing video-games together.
At some point I got really bad to the point that I almost ended it. I talked to Leo about it and he basically told me to fuck off.
If it hadn't been for a woman I met online I wouldn't be alive. I was 14 at that point and she was 31. We met because of our shared star wars liking and at some point she decided I was gonna be her ""brother"".
She took care of me as if I was her actual little brother. Always looking out for me and helping me with whatever was on my mind. And no, it never became anything romantic or sexual. Although looking back at it I can understand if some people think that's fucked up.
Long story short: She saved me, stopped me from killing myself and brought me to a point in which I could live without fearing something might finally tip the tie and make me end it.
And just for her to disappear out of my life from nowhere.
I got really bad after that. She was the closest I had to someone who cared about me.
Fast forward some time Leo and I are still friends. Yes, he treated me like shit, but I have the problem that I let people treat me horribly, yet still would give them everything if they are important to me.
Then Leo got really bad. He got depressed, started drinking, smoking and then finally drugs. I did everything to help him in all the ways I could, but in the end he still treated me like shit and I stopped talking to him. That was the first time in my life I put myself before someone else.
Even if both my sister and my friend weren't ideal and it ended in bad ways, I didn't feel empty like I used to before. Yet when I lost them both, I did feel that way again.
Don't mistake it meaning that I didn't have any friends other than them. I've always been someone who gets along with basically anyone so you could say I had plenty of ""friends"". Things is it was just all very superficial stuff and well... I was nobody's favourite person. 
Until just before my 15th I met a girl. Let's call her Melanie.
Melanie was my first love. Melanie was also the first person to make me feel loved and at home. If that makes any sense. To sum it up: I felt better than with anyone else and at any other point in my life, but she broke up with me.
Since then I've been feeling worse and worse and worse. I'm going back to old feelings I had when I tried to kill myself.
I'm 16 years old and I have a strong need for love, appreciation and care. I want someone to love and someone who loves me. I have many ""friends"" but I'm nobody's favourite person. I'm bad at describing this sort of stuff and I hope it's understandable.
It's not that I'm a shitty person either. I've been told so many times that I am an amazing person. I'm loving, caring and selfless. Is that not enough?
I always try my best with people and give my best, just to get used and hurt.
Am I not deserving of love?
And why? Why do I have to have these feelings as a 16 year old? Why can't I just be a douchebag who is happy bulling people or something? I hate those people, but Idk... Why can't I have it easier?",2022-09-23 15:02:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602424104,4,/r/lonely/comments/xlzyy7/drowning_at_16/,,0,0,Drowning at 16

4730,xm0r7j,hahayupno,"Have been in this sub for a while now. 

Quite annoying that almost all of the interactions with people just end up cut because of one or the other losing interest. Messaging people and getting to know them everytime is annoying and quite boring. Haven't even mentioned that when I get to know someone (as far as you can from the other side of the world through a screen) I usually realize I don't quite click with them or like interacting with them. That then usually ends up with the convo simmering out. Start again. Get to know someone, try to keep up the conversations and one or the other loses interest eventually.

Hence I've come to the grand conclusion that friendships need effort and perseverance and good timing/luck of finding the right person.

It's like, I see a pretty girl and I want to get to know her and hopefully make her become my girlfriend. But during the chase I'm just awkward and don't know what to say or even feel. I just feel empty and depressed inside and I don't really know what I actually want. I feel like I don't even know what to do to fall in love. I know that I want to cuddle and go on dates and do all the couple-y stuff together, but I don't know how to express it to a girl without appearing like a creep and scaring her off. Hence I just end up suppressing all my emotions and keeping it inside me.

4743,xm3eig,Ok-Avocado464,"During quarenting I did a lot of self reflection and gew a lot as a person mentally, part of that mental growth came with the sudden realization that not only am I lonely right now but I've always been very lonely. I've never had a real friend in my life, I've never had a person I felt like I could just be 100% authentically myself with without being ridiculed for it or shamed. I've never had someone that would stick up for me like I'd stick up for them when they needed it.   


I even was niave enough at one point to believe a toxic person was my friend. This toxic person would never stick up for me ever, the second they had one little excuse to antagonize me they would take it, no hesitation. ditch me for new people. She even befriended someone that was horribly bullying me at the time ? Later she came back and apologized, she always did. And I would just forgive her completely with no hesitation. 

Although this was a long time ago I spend a lot of time looking back at my old relationships now a days and wondering how real were they ? I don't think any of them were, Sometimes I wonder if theres something wrong with me, like what if i'm cursed, I don't understand why I can't just have one friend. I hate being lonely, I hate having social anxiety. I hate being a mentally ill freak. 

I hate everything about myself, my body, my face, my hair, my skin, my voice. I don't even know if I have a personality of my own at this point, I've always been forced to put on so many masks and play fake people that I don't know what my authentic self is.  


I'm honestly suprised that I haven't just killed myself yet. I've thought about it so many times, I've planned the times I could do it, how I would do it.

4781,xm89wf,grey_floyd,"Hello,

Writing here just in case there are more people here who can identify with the feelings and emotions which I am going through. Any advice or ideas? Have you ever experienced something similar? How did do you cope with this?

I am mid-40, single man living in western EU, originally from eastern EU (English is not my native tongue). Have been working as software dev all my life - since 2002 full time. 

Although I did (reasonably) well at the beginning, my ""career"", if you excuse this word, has been truly collapsing in the last 4-5 years. Now I will be facing unemployment soon unless I manage to find something new. 

I simply cannot find myself doing this job anymore given my age. It's as if my body/brain/soul/heart were telling me all the time that I have to change something and I stubbornly keep staying in the same place all the time. But what to change?

I lost all the passion and energy to study in my limited free time to keep up to date with IT. This and absolute sh\*\*ty jobs which I have been doing professionally in the last 5-6 years have turned my skills into sad, rusty remains. And what should I study? Why? Kids these days are 17 years old and have already often tons of experience in software dev. With that experience and sky-high self-confidence, they will be my bosses when they are 22-25 years old. Unfortunately, I don't have the social skills and self-confidence to go for management path… 

Not to mention that in my case, the total loneliness in my life is the ""icing on the cake"". Have lost contact with some people in the last 2-3 years. In some cases, even my attempts to revive these relationships failed. These days, when at work, I am surrounded by young people who are passionate about their work, careers and everything and I am not able to talk to them anymore. We just live on two different planets.

So here I am - depressed, with lack of motivation and total lack of vision for the rest of my life. Don't know what to do... 

Sorry for this rambling it but I just had to vent somewhere. Somehow, I am just totally lost in life...",2022-09-23 20:27:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1625090790,2,/r/lonely/comments/xm89wf/alone_lonely_mid_40_with_software_dev_career/,,0,1,Alone &amp; lonely mid 40 with software dev career collapsing

N if that wasnt enough, the other guy also just asked someone out for the first time ever. Im scared he’ll also gradually leave as they all do. N even though im really happy for both of them, im scared to lose them to their gfs like it has happened with my other friends.

4788,xm910y,Pit-and-Chase,"It's not like I don't have any friends, or even that they're not good friends really. I do have friends, in fact I probably have more than most people, certainly on this subreddit. I'm part of a somewhat large friendgroup, and it sounds almost selfish that I wish those two people hadn't joined recently. I mean, I'm only really close with the one person in the friendgroup, if she wasn't in it then nor would I. It's not like she's a bad friend or anything either, she's an amazing friend in fact. She always listens to me whenever I vent to her about anything, she values my opinion, hell she walked all the way downtown to just comfort me that one time. Maybe I'm just ungrateful, idk.

It's just that when she's around the rest of the friendgroup, I feel kinda like I don't fit in. They're so energetic, and I'm not, and they're always throwing food and mocking that one girl's hairstyle and I don't like sitting with them at break or lunch. I mean, they've made jokes about incest and the firetruck game before.

It's just that I feel like by the end of the school year, I'll have no friends. They'll probably have realised that I'm a terrible friend and have left me by then, and it doesn't help that the one person I actively liked in my class has just abandoned me for a new girl and someone who's friend left recently. I struggle to involve myself and then get upset when they don't put in the effort to involve me, when really I don't involve myself. 

I mean, I have friends but I still feel lonely, so often. I wish I knew why, but I don't. Sometimes it feels like I actually am alone, and that nobody cares when logically I know that they do. I probably don't even deserve to be lonely when I have so many opportunities, so many classmates who actively talk to me and ask if we're friends. I'm always the one to say no, because it's almost become a joke in my class now, like ""oh I'm friends with \[name\], right?"" and it's almost become a meme or smth. It's not like I have no options, but I keep pushing everyone away and I don't include myself and it'll be my fault when I end up alone.

All this is coupled with me beginning to question if I'm aromantic. I don't see myself ever in a relationship but I desperately want touch that typically comes with relationships. I love cuddling, I love hugging, but it's weird to want that. I have one person who'll cuddle with me, who I don't see as often as I like, and isn't in the same year as me at school. And even then, I often want physical contact when they're just not in the mood and I don't want to be the person initiating it.

I'm really clingy but simultaneously push everyone away. I crave physical contact and hugs and I want to cuddle, but I know I'll struggle to find anyone willing to do that platonically. And it's really stupid, but the whole thing that set me off on this was me reading about two people cuddling close to each other in a book, and realising how desperately I want that. Physical affection is my love language but it's also the most romanticized one when I really don't want that.

But hey, I sent a message to the first friend I mentioned asking if she'd hug me more, and I really hope that makes me stop feeling so lonely. It's a small, really baby step towards helping myself ig, but to me it feels like an achievement of sorts. I know this isn't as bad as most vents on here, and I know it's self-induced, but writing it down might help. Maybe telling my friend will help. 

This won't last forever, right? Please tell me that it gets better, and that my friend *will* start initiating the physical touch I so crave. Please tell me that's not so much to wish for.",2022-09-23 20:57:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1617612421,1,/r/lonely/comments/xm910y/i_dont_know_why_im_so_lonely/,,0,0,I don't know why I'm so lonely

I have literally only one friend and he does not live anywhere near me and i almost never do anything with him. I don’t know what to do or what I’m doing wrong. Well I do know I’m ugly, I look like a nerd, and I have social anxiety. I have never once since second grade had a girl interested in me. 

I have started my first year of college this year and I stupidly thought it would be different. It’s the same shit as always. I’m just left out of everything and there is nothing I can do about it. I just sit in my room all day, when I go out no one talks to me and I have no idea what situation would be right for me to talk to a girl and even if I did know my social anxiety would prevent me from doing it. People already were making a bunch of friends and meeting girls on week one. It has been over a month and nothing. I do go to events and stuff but nothing happens for me and it never has.

This even happens online. I was added to a groupchat of people with the same name. It is a gender neutral name so there is girls in the chat too. This guy always gets on their and calls me an ugly pussy who has never touched a woman. And hes right. And the girls in the chat love everything he says its so fucking weird to me. Every guy I’ve ever known did not have to work hard to get anything despite what they tell themselves. Girls will just walk up to them and start talking. That has literally never happened to me.

I have 0 friends at my college and I have never had a girlfriend. I have no logical reason to love. I can’t fucking stand it anymore. I’m not threatening to kill myself becasue I know that I won’t; But there is absolutely no reason not to. I just want the same experience as everyone else but have never come close. I don’t know what I can do from here. I refuse to accept that I will never have a girlfriend or friends but right now I don’t know any other option.

I also create these imaginary scenes where I’m in like a high position job and people being below me and having to admire me and like me for that. These imaginations come naturally to me and sometimes a couple of times a day. Especially if I feel lonely I believe. I don’t know why I am like this and it kinda bothers me that I want to be looked up to and admired so much. It’s all in my head but i believe it effects my real life too. 

I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember and I don’t know if there is a name for it (please tell me if there is). I sometimes thought about going to a psychiatrist to see what the “problem” is and why I feel like this.

Haven't been feeling good recently.

I turned 18 this year and I feel like a failure, haven't seen friends since college ended a couple months ago, no girlfriend to speak of, have barely left the house other than when necessary, and i haven't got the slightest passion, aspiration or ambition for careers or life or anything besides the depths of my comfort zone.

I'm occasionally helping my dad with his job cause that opportunity basically fell into my lap, and I can live with it. I tried some work shelf-stocking at a shop down the road because we know the people there, but it was too fat for me to handle and I felt all panicked and alone and helpless and had to call my dad to bail me out after literally an hour, and I know, I'm a scared, fragile bitch

I've always got my parents and brother at home and I love them, but I still just feel rather alone, especially since I'm more comfortable being open and sensitive with my friends than my family. And family just aren't really the same as friends, you know?

And every now and then while I'm in bed, I'll end up in a downward spiral into a pit of self-loathing which takes most of the subsequent day to crawl out of

And I also saw some stuff about Cyberpunk: Edgerunners which made me feel even more depressed. Definitely won't be watching that anytime soon, because I cannot emotionally handle stuff that is so heart-crushingly sad

I imagine I must come across as really pathetic, and I'm inclined to agree

4807,xmcqrh,Ok_Stress_2920,"I’ve always wanted to go shark cage diving and swimming with whale sharks. I found my opportunity to do it at an aquarium in another state. So I invited a friend and we planned it all out and bought our admission tickets separately. 
When the time came for us to go, he admitted that he had lied at the aquarium . 

He had only bought his ticket for general entry to the aquarium and a dolphin show and that was it. He didn’t tell me until it was time to go in the shark cage diving program. 
I was very upset and told him that “I’m not cancelling my already scheduled and payed programs because I have wanted to do this for a VERY long time and it’s not like we live near this aquarium” he should’ve just told me the truth. I forgave him but I felt resented 

Fast forward, all the instructors made me feel like a weirdo for doing these programs alone. Apparently, they were bothered that I didn’t have a “buddy” to do this with me. They kept on pointing out that I didn’t have a buddy like if I was socially incompetent. And to top it off, for the swimming with whale sharks an instructor said we needed to partner up and (again I didn’t have a partner because my friend had lied to me about purchasing his tickets) so a lady was like you can group up with us and then she also added that “omg I would never do this alone”. 
Like, I don’t need a buddy. It’s okay to be independent. Also these people didn’t know my situation. People need to be less judgmental. It’s not like it was a game show or a team building project!! We were literally swimming alone. Nobody could stay side to side. They’re so ridiculous honestly but still 
Needless to say, I won’t be inviting that friend anywhere ever again. 

My point is they made me feel like a freak but jokes on them because independent people are secure in their own skin. And apparently all these “you need a buddy” clowns need to recheck their self confidence because EVERYONE has lonely bouts. That’s just part of the human experience.",2022-09-23 23:31:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642864409,14,/r/lonely/comments/xmcqrh/theres_no_need_to_always_have_a_buddy_ffs/,,0,2,There’s no need to always have a “buddy” ffs

(22f, throwaway account obviously) But I see so many people here say how it’s easier in life for those who are attractive, and I’m not denying it, but it doesn’t solve anything at all. I think I’m conveniently attractive?

Everyday I cry because I don’t want to be here. I don’t talk to anyone or see anyone unless it’s my mother or my boyfriend. And i hate when my boyfriend is away at work or hanging out with my friends because then i’m left completely alone in my awful thoughts. I just wish i had friends to talk to and laugh with outside of him, because when we fight or he just wants to be without me I break so bad, and i know how annoyed he gets and will probably break up with me over it.

Today I had Chinese for lunch and I went into my local Chinese and placed my order.

The cashier she was so cute.

While in the waiting area I could help but glance but I caught myself staring and I’m pretty sure she noticed cause she made eye contact with me.

Sometimes when I’m having a shitty day emotionally whenever I see a pretty woman or a woman I find attractive I feel embarrassed and kinda pathetic my brain will come up with any reason to remind me I’m unattractive, and ugly, and I’m gonna die alone.

Then I just get irrationally anxious and start bouncing my leg and twiddling my thumbs.

Then I start thinking about my ex and I miss being held and cuddled and I feel like a child. And sometimes I feel like a misogynistic person and im objectifying woman and it’s just a shitty feeling it’s hard to describe 


And today my Mema is now staying with us cause she can’t get Medicare, cause my pop pop lowered his alimony payments and doesn’t want to go to the court house or the legal route to fix it cause now to the government it looks like she has more money than she actually has

Without insurance she can’t afford a care home she already owes 60,000$ to the place. She can barely be by herself

Now I don’t mind her being around it’s my mom and uncle I’m worried about.

I love my mema and she’s been nothing but Good to me but my mom and uncle didn’t have the best relationship growing up. They told me story’s from back in the day that make me think Jesus mema I love you but you were an asshole at one point.

Just today alone like they are not fighting but there patience threshold isn’t very high (in fairness a lot of my memas issues stem from learned helplessness) and I’m very worried for my mom who already sacrifices so much and her stress levels are already high and they will just keep getting worse and worse. 

I think I caught her having a panic attack earlier today.

I can always still go to my dads but I can’t just run away that’s just a dick move.  Even I need to keep an eye on him cause he lives by himself and sometimes doesn’t take care of himself or his apartment properly unless I’m there with him.

And as self centered as it may seem I am worried about having to stop parts of my life to accommodate.  Like obviously I help I take time to help and do things considering the amount of extra time I have on my hands outside of work.

The only things I do outside of work is go to the movies and go to my books a million and read in the cafe.

I mean, it’s almost hilarious how absurd it is when you get past the embarrassment and depression sinking in, and I feel so stupid for only just really realizing this now. 

They were never friends, and a part of me knew that, but I just passed it off as overthinking, but no, I was literally 100% correct; these people didn’t care about me in the slightest, not even a little bit, and no one has in like a year; every bond I’ve made since I lost that one friendship has been nothing but superficial. Maybe they talked to me because they were bored and their other friends weren’t online, or maybe it’s because we were already talking for a little while and breaking it off would be pretty awkward, or maybe they just felt bad for me, but I can feel it with each text and lame excuse for a ""conversation"" that I look back on.

4888,xmlhnz,ScottGolden," 

I know I'm ranting when I write this post so forgive me but it's one of those nights.  As a physically disabled person who is mentally cognitively aware it's a struggle.  MC my physical disability and that has never bothered me . people can learn about my physical pain and chronic ailments and that doesn't bother me but the social isolation that comes with being disabled bothers me.  I'm very successful in my work I've run multiple businesses in my life Ben self-supporting for 15 years which is something that more than three-quarters of the disabled Community never achieves. I love my clients I love helping other people and I've been blessed throughout my life that I've had experiences that other people wouldn't comparative Lee especially being in a wheelchair but still it's incredibly lonely. 

Due to my vision, I cannot drive which means when I want to go somewhere I'm either at the mercy of a public transportation system that other Lee sucks and is dangerous pens that I'm fine not going anywhere. I say pretend because when you express how frustrated you are with being disabled because of the lack of help that exists within your location you get told there should we a program for that.  In any cases there are programs for that most of them however require you to remain impoverished which means you live a whole nother life which isn't particularly safe. 

I nearly died almost four years ago due to a Health crisis and in some ways, I came back for my clients but the reality is doing it completely on my own is proving harder than I could ever admit to most people. I have friends online from all over the world but it's not the same as going to a concert or being randomly invited to someone's house or out to dinner you know?

I'm a workaholic because honestly, it's the only area of my life where I feel completely successful and it's the one thing that unless I lose my mental faculties no one can take away from me.  I come from an abusive family and both of my parents told me my entire life that no one would ever want me in their life. intellectually I know their abusers and I know that ultimately it's not true but at the same time when the majority of my life is apologizing for the things that I cannot do it's hard to stay positive.   I have tried the religious route and honestly, I find the people there to be many times more harmful than helpful in the Wind the involvement of a deity doesn't help with the loneliness I often get told just to have more faith. 

 the idea that I could conceivably pass away alone has not been lost on me but at the same time I'm not looking for sympathy I think part of me hopes that the universe she's me right this and helps swing the statistical odds in my favor there are 8 billion people on the planet after all and I know I'm a good friend deep down I'm supportive funny a great problem solver and ultimately someone who is willing to invest in the needs of others when needed.  Just hard sometimes in the midst of all of that not to feel invisible good things are coming even though I can't see it faith in that I must hold on to because the overwhelming of the alternative is uncomfortable.",2022-09-24 06:49:04,lonely,t5_2qjny,1586479316,7,/r/lonely/comments/xmlhnz/the_things_unspoken_i_wish_a_friend_could_hear_or/,,0,1,the things unspoken I wish a friend could hear or know

4901,xmneyc,Omnikunsan,"I grew up getting bullied a lot, and because of it, I've lacked self respect up until this year, and it was one hell of a journey coming to terms with it. Because I lacked self respect, I isolated myself for the longest time, and reached a point where I was so lonely Id take anyone. I spent 4 years in a horrible relationship with a girl who only wanted to do the things she wanted to do, which was more isolated behavior, and would take out her insecurities on me, pretty much bullying me and excusing her behavior with mental illness, and I would just let it all slide, taking each punch, becoming bitter and depressed as the years went on.

I had become so attached to little rays of light in between each slight, to the point, that when she cheated on me and ghosted me, I wanted to kill myself. Obviously it was a failed attempt, but afterwards I realized that I did it to myself. I should have gotten out of that situation sooner. I'm now evaluating all of my relationships and seeing them for what they really are. 2 people who claimed to be family don't work, and scroll through social media all day, but can't even message me more than once a week. I kept telling myself ""I'm the asshole for expecting more"", but the give away was after a recent accident on my bike. Walked away with a sprained toe and road rash everywhere. Told some discord buddies what happened and I got ""omg are you okay, if there's anything we can do let us know"". Told these so called family members, and I didn't get a message until the next freaking day, and they admitted they saw the messages when I sent them, and all they had to say was ""that sucks, get well soon, but anyway blah blah, ghost. 

That was my wake up call. Id rather die alone than call someone like that a friend or family. I'll give'em this, I'm only alive now because of their help, and for that I'm somewhat thankful, but treating me like pen pal and calling me family is bullshit. I've also had a sneaking suspicion they played apart in the break up for the longest time, but I kept telling myself, there's no evidence, quit being an asshole, but I've decided to trust my feelings from here on out.  I will not be a push over just to pretend I have a friend any more!

Moral of the story, you are valuable and worth so much more! We all are! Don't let other people make you feel otherwise!

The times at school, work, being with friends and family, the time where you met your first love, have children, grow old. Then when you reach the point where death is knocking at you, you will think just what a ride it has been.

I know that someone might think that if your reality is the point where your life flashes before your eyes, then if that reality reaches to the point where you will actually die, will the flashback repeat over and over again causing a loop?

4934,xmuatz,PhantomZone771,"Idk how else to explain it apart from that. Dissociation. Numbness.

When I was younger I used to struggle to relate to others because we never really shared the same interests. I made a few friends who stuck with me but if they weren’t there at school I would just wander or sit by myself. I spent a lot of time just sitting, staring at the floor or other people. 

When I turned 16, I started A-levels and that’s when things had changed a lot. I had run into someone who I had become obsessed with. I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. We became close. I told her how I felt but she said she wasn’t ready at the time. I understood. We became closer and there were always a lot of mixed signals, even my friends at the time would say the same idk what it was but something drove me to try again; maybe a small sliver of hope. The answer changed but only briefly. The next day she changed her mind which I understood. But I was more frustrated with myself. Why I couldn’t get rid of these feelings.

The pandemic hit and we started talking less and less. We had reconnected the months that followed and I thought about confessing that I still felt the same but I chose not to because I knew it wouldn’t change anything. That the answer was probably the same. So I sat there having typed out a long message explaining how I felt, with an itchy trigger finger waiting to press send. But I didn’t. I cried myself to sleep, with the pain in my chest. 

It was at that point which I was introduced to someone else by a friend. She was wonderful. It was like a mirror image of myself. We spoke for hours on music, comic books and movies. I felt so much. A month had passed and I confessed to her and she gave me a similar response. I understood. I never hated the rejection, I hated myself for not being able to control my feelings and suppress them.

My friends had sat me down at one point and gave me a reality check. I had become jealous of others who I thought were more attractive than I am saying something to her before I could. I hated who I had become. Arrogant, jealous and obsessive. I didn’t want to let anyone go because I always tried so hard to keep people from leaving. 

So I took what they said and distanced myself from everyone for my own good. I fed myself these thoughts that “no one was interested” and that “no one would ever want me”, to stop myself from falling in love too easily, to stop my obsession. It was at that point I started to dissociate/feel numb. 

I would talk to the few friends I had but not for long. I closed myself off and tried to focus on finishing A-levels. The summer was one of the loneliest. I started realising the reasons why those thoughts I fed myself were true. I hated my body because of it. My appearance. 

When I started university, I thought I would keep to myself and avoid speaking to anyone for my own good. I did make new friends, great ones who helped. But the damage I had to done to myself now seems somewhat permanent. 

I didn’t fall for anyone. In fact I haven’t felt anything ever since that moment in A-levels. I found myself dissociating a lot, with friends, but always by myself. I spent the 2nd term sitting outside coffee shops just watching people go by. I’d spend the whole day not speaking to anyone, just having the noise around me to drown out the silence along with any music I could find. I hadn’t felt like this since I was younger. 

My problem is that I think I care too much/ I try to hard. I can’t leave people on delivered and I’m always eagerly waiting for a reply that sometimes just never comes. It becomes compulsive. The checking. The stress. I try to avoid spamming to not annoy them. I don’t wan to lose them. 

This summer I did nothing. Absolutely nothing. I stayed in my room for the whole summer, with nothing but my thoughts. I’d do the same routine; wake up, lay in bed for on my phone for hours, try to sleep again, if I couldn’t I’d eventually get up. I realised how worthless I felt. How I had become so miserable that no one would love me. I’d cry myself to sleep with the same pain, longing for someone but too afraid to to try again without becoming attached to someone who would probably never feel the same way and who would leave again or who I’d try to push away so I could get over them. 

I felt so alone. My friend,who recently broke up with her bf and ended up in a summer fling that messed with her feelings, was telling me how she feels lonely now, longing for the same thing as I do. It hurts to watch her go through this. We’ve become best friends and I have nothing I can say to her because she knows and I know that I don’t even know how to be comfortable alone. I know that I can try to reassure her as much as I can but she’ll probably go through the same pain. It sucks. 

I spent my birthday and the following day feeling really low. On a whim I tried posting on a dating subreddit and I sat there as I did with people’s text messages. Waiting. For any reply. Anything at all. An hour passed. Two. Three. Nothing. I realised that nothing had changed. I was still that same 16-17 year old kid who craved affection and physical touch, who wanted to be in a relationship. This isn’t the first time I’ve posted on one of these subreddits either. I felt worthless and miserable. 

And I still feel the same. I want to be in a relationship. I want to experience my firsts. I want to find someone who loves me and who I can love and not worry about leaving me. I want someone who I can hold. But I fear I’ve lost the ability to feel anything. When I try to cry, no tears come out. I hate it. I hate myself for feeling like this. It hurts so much. I’m going to try therapy but I wonder if that really will change anything. This all sounds pathetic. I feel pathetic for saying any of this.",2022-09-24 14:28:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639096712,8,/r/lonely/comments/xmuatz/dissociation/,,0,22,Dissociation

4949,xmwsqj,__sunnyd,"This has been the case with me for years...but moreso after a breakup that I had 8 months ago. I'm a bit older now (late 30s) and it's much harder for me to make friends. I notice that out of the few friends that I have, I am the one who initiates more. It hurts. Most of them are in relationships, or with kids. I'm like that single friend who, likely due to my own shortcomings which I take responsibility for, have just been left alone on this very lonely island.

Every week, I pore over facebook events, festivals, hobby clubs, chat groups, searching desperately. The hardest parts, are the weekends, and they are also the hardest to fill with plans. Because that is everyones' most valuable slot - it's easier to make plans with someone during a week night. Holidays are also super hard... everyone has all of these couple-related plans... taking a vacation together...going to each others' families. Not this guy. I look at my calendar... it's shamefully desolate.

The frustrating thing about this is that I work really hard, I try everything, I go to the hobby clubs, I work on myself, I meditate, I really really am trying my best. I'm not meeting women and going on dates, and I'm meeting people here and there and get friendly which is great, but these relationships are situational, and I can't say, invite these people to spend a saturday with me. 

For those of you who it might be helpful for, the most helpful thing for me was finding groups that meet weekly, and then putting these slots in my calendar. Meditation groups, hobby groups etc... I'm like that guy from fight club. But...alas, all of this and my calendar is still often desolate. I've become burnt out lately and I stopped making such of an effort. I do sulk about it, but I just don't really know what to do anymore. I can go do things alone of course, but at some point it honestly stops being fun to just be alone all the time. I feel sad and alone, and single, watching all of these people around me having this fulfilling lives.

I hope you guys are having an easier time. Sending lots of love and good energy your way. Thanks for listening/reading.",2022-09-24 16:09:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1503062358,5,/r/lonely/comments/xmwsqj/i_am_obsessive_about_filling_up_my_calendar_so/,,0,1,"I am obsessive about filling up my calendar, so that I won't be alone.

4950,xmxi8v,Big-Transition-7782,"I'm a 24-y.o. single male. I have no problems in terms of financials or making friends. I have a somewhat decent low-paying job since I've only worked for 2 years. I have several friends that I hang out with. Lately I've been feeling depressed seeing my friends getting into a relationship one by one. It seems like they're making progress with their life and I'm left behind. I've never understood women in my life. I'm single and have never been in a relationship, never even held hands and never been liked by someone (now keep in mind that the culture of picking up girls at bars or chatting to random chicks don't really exist in my country. I live in Asia, so people are more close-minded here). I've got no game and all the girls I liked have outright rejected me in the past, one even saying directly that I'm ""low-quality"". Of course this hurts my pride. I'm also fat. I've been trying my best to cut on carbs and go to the gym as frequently as I can after work, but I still gain weight. I think it's due to my stress, depression and inexistent sleeping pattern. I stress over being single, which in turn makes me fatter, less confident and less attractive to the opposite gender, which in turn makes me worry even more. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy, a cycle I cannot break.

I have no one to talk my problems to. My parents don't understand mental health and just told me to keep looking and approaching girls until I get a gf. I hardly have any female friends, and the few that I have are all in a happy relationship. I often hear that the best way to get a gf is to stop searching and be confident with oneself. I do not see how this is possible since the thought of being 30 in a few years and single worries me so much to the extent of having nightmares and waking up with cold sweat at night.

I don't know why I'm writing this post. Probably most of you don't even care about the conundrums of a random loner on the internet, so feel free to downvote or ignore this post. But to the few of you that is still reading, do you think I should just give up? I have tissues, wifi and a right hand anyways so it's well taken care of from that department. But I fear that I will grow old and regret living my life without ever being in a relationship, all while seeing my friends and siblings having happy families.

I also have severe social anxiety so it's not easy for me to find anyone new. Plus, I'm struggling with pretty severe depression on top of that which is also not conducive to finding a new girlfriend.

Today I'm feeling a bit shitty physically. I won't go into details because that'd be... well, gross, but I have pretty bad stomach cramps right now. And just feel physically miserable.

And really all I can think about right now is that I wish I had a loving girlfriend who would hold me. And kiss my forehead. And whisper sweet things to me. And tell me it's all gonna feel better soon. And it almost makes me want to cry.

I know that's kind of stupid. It's just stomach cramps, it'll pass. I'm an adult, I can handle some stomach cramps. But combined with my depression and my social isolation and my heartbreak and the fact that I haven't so much as touched another human being in 9 months, feeling physically miserable on top of that just makes me really miss having someone to hold me and comfort me and make me feel better right now. Or just someone to tell me they love me.

So, I don't need a pep talk about keeping hope alive; I've got that in spades. However, I also believe, with absolute certainty, that I will always lose any friend I make. I know that my life will be one of loneliness interrupted by valuable, but temporary relationships. I try... I try so hard to be grateful for the friends that I have while I have them, and to be grateful for the friends I have had when I lose them. I try to...enjoy the benefits of my solitude, the things I can only do or prefer to do alone (reading, songwriting, drawing etc.).

But it's so hard. It's so hard to believe that a life lived in this way is worth living. It's hard to believe that the relationships I have had, do have, and will have are worth all the time I have spent, do spend, and will spend alone.

I want to see my life through to its natural conclusion. But I don't know how I will manage to do that if I can't tolerate the periods of loneliness I will certainly and inevitably face for the rest of my life.

 I've met with some friends, four, in fact, two and two in a relationship.
I've already felt kinds awkward, they all sat on the couch, hugging, while I stayed on the floor, literally siting on the cold floor alone while watching the film.
Then  we went to the carnival, I usually like carnivals but I w as already feeling a bit bad, and then I saw a guy with whom I had 6 dates and he later told me he didn't like me (and he is in all his right but apparently I was just a test to know if he was bisexual or not and that kinda hurts a little).

I came home and started crying and honestly I don't wanna do shit right now, I never had a relationship, yeah sure, I have sex, but nothing else that that, I've never been kissed on the lips with feelings, I've never hold hands, I haven't been hugged in like seven years, not even by my family.
I'm so touch starved and I can't do shit about it, I don't understand why I can't have that, I try my best, but it's like I'm never enough, I just want to feel in love and have what they have.

And also, they are all life long friends, I'm the newest in the group and sometimes they talk about shit I don't really get and it's ok I enjoy being with them but I don't have that kind of friendship with anyone neither.
I won't ever be able to say ""my childhood friends"" because o have none, I had to change school three times for several reasons, and I was bullied a lot to.

I don't have really close friends, I don't have a happy family and I don't have a relationship.

I feel like i've taken each day, and all the challenges with strength and grace. But holy fuck, i'm exhausted. One thing I miss is having someone to come home to (roommates or partner), and just talk about our days together. I come home, and I have no one to talk to about my day. It's so dumb, but it really makes me feel lonely. No one really knows me. I wish I had someone around who cared about me as a person. I wish I had someone I could call when I am having a bad day. Like, i'm doing good, and life is generally going really great for me to be honest. But I still have my days. I still have my moments where I just need someone to call. Someone who just cares about me. Like I give so much love and care to myself, because I know it's important. And I can do that all day long, but I'm human. I still crave for someone to be there for me, or show up for me consistently.. not just when i'm doing good. But when I'm doing bad too. Being single has taught me a lot, and i'm very committed to my growth as an individual. But this journey that i'm on is so so lonely. Finding myself and who I am, without someone else there has been both so empowering, and so hard at the same time. I just miss having a person who I feel close with. I don't feel close to anyone.

while i was there, i had the uncomfortable realization that the only people i really had to talk to about being admitted to the hospital were my parents. i have no friends i would ask to visit me. i have nobody to confide in other that them. 

it felt bad, because only a few months earlier i *did* have those kinds of friends. i had one in particular who i was very close with, who had been in hospitals a lot due to her chronic illness. i would talk with her a lot about my medical issues and she’d be understanding, having been through the same thing. 

i got some blood work and an x-ray done and once it was determined i didn’t have a blood clot i was sent home. i got home and cried because i thought to myself that if i was dying in the hospital today i would have no friends to come visit me. even my parents are across the country. 

i miss my friends so much. i hate myself for telling them my secret. i should have known it would make them hate me. they gave me ptsd as a parting gift. now i’m a fucking failure who would die in the hospital alone if it ever came down to it.",2022-09-25 01:02:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1659931932,3,/r/lonely/comments/xn9d2d/had_to_go_to_the_hospital_today/,,0,8,had to go to the hospital today

5052,xnca2d,solarpoweredJJ,"Hello.

I just wanted to write some words of encouragement, from someone who also struggles with loneliness and the related feelings.

This pain, this loneliness.

These feelings are always hard. These feelings are never easy.

It feels like no one ever understands and that we can never find people that never understand us no matter how much we try and put ourselves out there.

We just want to be happy.

We just want to be loved.

We carry one of the biggest burdens we know of on our shoulders every day, that burden being the constant critique of ourselves inside and out constantly.

We're great at supporting others. But we treat ourselves so negatively.

Even with these burdens, we choose to walk forward in life every day. 

Every day that goes by is a small success. Every check on the calendar proves to everyone, proves to us, that we made it.

This pain, this loneliness.

We walk forward with it, and we are stronger for it.

Stay strong everyone. Have a good night.",2022-09-25 03:28:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,1549518819,18,/r/lonely/comments/xnca2d/we_can_do_this/,,1,2,We Can Do This.

When I was a kid, I had my friends and we would hangout almost every day, until I got depressed as a teenager and isolated myself. Then it was hard to get back to hanging out with them again. I will hit old friends up to try to invite them to something I want to do and then they would just ignore me or be hard to schedule something with. I kinda had friends in college, but I never managed to build or join another friend group like I had as a kid.

5058,xncrh8,bruisedbrains,"The reason why i think that is because i’m a very intense type of person, meaning i can be very enthusiastic when i find someone i like. I flirted first, I told him I liked him first, I instigated several conversations just because I was thinking about him and wanted to talk to him. It was great at first but then after a couple months it was just complete silence. Avoidance because I’m sure it’s too difficult to confront someone you know really likes you and tell them you only like them a little, but not as much as their ex. It hurts so much, why am I so direct and blunt. I literally asked this man right after I said I liked him if he was ok with me flirting with him and if he saw any interest in me. I don’t like mind games, i hate overthinking so i keep things pretty simple to give myself and the other person reassurance. I know I can be a lot so I kept my distance and was very hesitant to make sure I wasn’t bothering him or getting in the way of his life or anything. So much thought went into everything I did and said, and yet he was able to say nothing and let my brain rot trying to piece together what went wrong. I never want to be direct again. I hate myself for being so enthusiastic over someone so easily. I never want to be the first person to text someone, or to tell them i like them. I never want to even look at a man unless he shows me interest first. It hurts so bad. And I’m sure men can relate as well with the gender reversed.

I thought if I just accept my carnal desires as being a woman who likes other woman, I would eventually find someone who understands me and wants me for me. Well, it's been 27 years and I've never been in a relationship and I have only my own shortcomings and proclivities as a woman who likes other women for my own moral failings as a woman who should be normal and straight instead. 

The problem in my acceptance is the fact I still feel extremely envious whenever I'm with my friends who are with their partners and I'm always the odd one out as the perpetually single friend who just grins and bears the pain of having to see the happiness I'll never be capable of feeling or understanding. I'm tired of feeling like a lonely loser who's only pitied for not being capable of being loved, but I know I need to just learn to accept myself

5077,xneotq,sunflowr_seeds,"i’ve had a few occurrences where I realized that I don't have a lot of friends, but recently I was talking to my mother. She asked me ""do you have any real friends?"" honestly as funny as that sounds, I thought about it but was unable answered cause I don't, I don't have a group/click of people I can call my best friend/s. it hit me today when I was in my therapy session and after talking to my therapist for a bit he asked me, ""are you lonely, bud?"". I thought about it and agreed with him, I am lonely very very lonely and the more I think about it the more I realize how I have been lonely for a long time. I just haven't addressed it or brought it to the surface. 

it hurts, I feel like I can't count on anyone to stick around in the long run, and on top of further diagnoses regarding me (I've got clinical depression), it puts me in a place of solitude. I don't reach out to people because I assume that things aren't going to last, I do absurd things to catch the attention of others in hopes the situation could go further but set myself up for disappointment. but then again, I have friends and people I can associate with, but it doesn't go anywhere. 

for instance, I have a friend, and she's an amazing person to hang out with and I love her, I thought that our friendship together would be worthwhile, and it was. but she recently this year is getting her life in order, I'm so happy she's growing in her own skin and support her 100%, but things are different, we don't have time like we used to, and I know I could be doing the same but she's moving forward in ways that I'm unable to at the moment. and I think we're drifting apart, in other words, I accept the fact that some people come and go in our lives. 

I'm not sure what I'm writing this for, in hopes to make friends, venting, or for empathy. either way, if you've read all this junk through, and relate to anything I'm talking about, I want to let you know that you're not alone, I feel how you feel, I know the loneliness. and I wanna say thank you for reading this threw because it makes me feel less lonely knowing that you took the time to stick around.

I understand it to an extent. But i need more support. I get sad that my friends don’t ask me how i am. I only have one friend who’s really there for me and understands how bad my situation is. I’m tired of babysitting every single weekend because my sister Is addicted to drugs while my friends text me about the fun things they’re doing. My parents help me with nothing, and they’re so dysfunctional they barely make it through their own lives, and constantly lash out at us. I’m doing so much on my own and it’s so lonely and i don’t even want to be alive but my therapist said i need to stop seeking reassurance and rely on myself. At what point does my isolation and loneliness become valid, then?  I guess if i feel utterly alone in this life then i just need to “rely on myself”.

I know there was a time before this where I wasn’t completely on my own, but the longer I spend entirely in my own head; the more weeks go by where I don’t speak to anyone, the more I feel those days slipping away. 

Is this it? Is this all I can ever hope for? Is this how I am destined to live out the rest of my days? Will I die as alone as I lived? I don’t know, but it feels more and more likely every day. Every forgotten memory of the life I once had is another reason for me to believe that I can’t change things; that it’s my destiny to live and die alone. I already don’t cry about it anymore.

She was there when it came to realizing which friends were fake towards me , my sexuality journey, and also my mental health journey as well. Last year, I was able to tell her any and everything about either how I felt or what i was thinking, and i didn’t have the need to hide my real face which would just be 😐 without any emotion instead of faking a smile. Even though I appreciated her staying by my side, I always hated how her mood would change because of me. I could be having a horrible day and not hide it by not faking a smile, and automatically her smile would also disappear and she wouldn’t talk to me because she thinks i need space, which is true, but i never wanted her to feel like that. Thankfully this year we have a bigger friend group so when i do have bad days, she doesn’t have to change how she feels because of the other friends in our group having their good days which I absolutely love. I love seeing her happy and not have to pretend to be the “strong friend” or “therapy friend” ever since we joined the group. But over time, i stopped talking about mental health(she hasn’t noticed), and she now became part of the group of people that i isolate from when having a bad day that prevents me from getting out of bed.

How are you? Have you drank enough water today? You better because you have to stay hydrated, it helps your brain process all the things you have to do during the day. Who am I? I am nobody, I'm not here to preach on how you should live your own lives because each and everyone of us has their own issues and whatnot to deal with. But what I must really need to ask is to take care of yourself first.

I mean it, it's not about all the toxic positivity movement about self improvement, I'm here to tell you that the more you care for yourself the more your energies will be perceived by other people. What we lack nowadays is that self-care that keeps us mentally stable, people nowadays see someone who is happy and think it's weird. Why though? Why is it weird to be positive and happy? The world is already gloomy and dim as it is, why ourselves should be that way? I don't believe in God but I know that we are all here for a reason. We're all books in the making and one day we will be fully finished novels with our plot lines, characters, adventures etc.

Don't forget to love every inch of yourself even with all the shit that other people throw at you. The Buddha said that we must be our own islands, we have to be our own source of power, love, affection and peace. If we're an island other people can reach us and be safe because we can take care of ourselves and others! Isn't that a beautiful concept?

Love yourself with everything you have, your faults, your doubts, your weaknesses and your strengths. Every single negative thing, embrace it. Your darkness is part of you, there's no need to fight it. Greet it like an old friend.

I send you all my love, my gratitude for reading this, my energies.

Going for a walk is me ‘sneaking off somewhere suspicious’ and I’ve got to be back early, take my phone with me, let me know where ur going, etc. Im 21 (F) living in the safest town ever. Why the fuck do I need to be treated like this?! I feel controlled and shamed constantly. I feel like the lowest I’ve ever been. I have no friends to confide in so all these feelings build up to the point I feel crazy.",2022-09-25 12:50:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1635158860,1,/r/lonely/comments/xnmjci/having_a_tough_time/,,0,1,Having a tough time

Most of my social interactions are meeting someone new or trying to get a bit closer to someone I know more casually, and it’s not the same as having a good chat with someone you know really well. I’m introverted and easily stressed too, so it’s hard work, lol. 

I think I’m doing the right things and just need to keep working on it, but I feel really ashamed of how lonely I am and find it hard to accept that it’s going to take time and work to get what other people just have and take for granted.

(respectfully don’t acknowledge this post if your an adult or not from North America. i deal with perverts enough in real life, i don’t need it online too)

I just want to forget all of the messed up stuff i did in my life. What did i deserve to be alone and not have anyone except my family love me? no one has found me handsome or cute, i’ve just been ugly or “below average attraction”. I’m just so envious of teenagers that have friends in real life, that can date in real life or teens that can actually express themselves. 

is it too much to ask to have a cute boy to hold me while i sleep? or to have a beautiful girl to bring to homecoming? it’s just so frustrating that i have to wait until college to get these simple life experiences. i haven’t been kissed, i haven’t been to a party, i haven’t been to a sleepover, i’ve never had a friend hug me or even had real friends since elementary school. 

i literally go to school and don’t talk to anyone, go to my music school and don’t feel included there and i stopped going to the gym because i’m tired to boys judging me based on the color of my skin and how skinny i am.  

do i have to kill myself before someone will care about me? will i have to be straight before i get a romantic experience? will i have to be white before people will stop treating me like shit?",2022-09-25 13:35:31,lonely,t5_2qjny,1657674949,1,/r/lonely/comments/xnnk4d/the_art_of_forgetting/,,0,0,The art of forgetting

5159,xnukvj,XSA888,"I am 19 at the moment, but I feel like there is nothing left to live for. I started university this year, and everybody told me that this was gonna be awsome. I really suffered in highschool, where I had only one friend, not a close one, but just a buddie. My relatives told me that university was going to be differente. It is in the way, that I don't have such a strict timetable, but for the other aspect, it is just as bad or even worse.

I lived in a rural (very) small town for my entire life, but now I had to move to a ""big"" city (only 160 000 people live here, but it is considered big in my country). This meant that I had to give up my hobby of amateur astronomy. I left my telescopes home, since I cannot bring them here, and this makes me really sad. In highschool I was a ""straight A"" student, since I know how to suck up to teachers, so they wouldn't fuck around with me as much, this meant that I never had to study for anything, and now it haunts me back really hard. 

This is only my first semester here and I only have failing grades, and there is enourmus pressure from my parents to perform as good as in highschool. I know nobody in this city, and I hate going to nightclubs or other ""social"" places. When I am not studinig, I am just sitting in front of my PC, and wasting time on bullshits. 

I have nobody to talk to, my parents are mad at me for having bad grades, my roommate is a good guy, but we have nothing in common besides the room, the only hobby I had is no longer with me, and won't be for the next few months, and I just feel lost and forgotten. I never talked to girls, since I knew from an early age that I am unattractive, and I don't want to waste time getting rejected. 

The sad thing is that I lived trough a very similar experience when I went from elementary to highschool, everybody told me that highschool was gona be better than elementary, and that everybody was gonna be cool and friendly, and I would find friends. Elementary school was pretty bad, since I also felt very isolated there, but at least there I had a few guys who invited me to hang out from time to time. 

I can't even work for myself, since buisnesses only offer unpaid interships for ""students"", so I am dependent on my parents for money, and they are giving me less and less due to my bad grades, and they are even treathening me, that they will kick me out if I can't pass the exams at the end of the semester.

5166,xnvu4l,Saperxde,"***warning, im literally analizing my life in this post for some reason***

^(Im almost 22, just putting it out there.)  
Its been 24 hours since i finished it and i thought about my life a bit more than usual. I realized that im wasting so much of my life doing nothing. As in, i finally realized that my hobbies were worth spending time on. I love trying my absolute best in osu!, in the past i tried cs but i was young and at the time i didnt understand what it means to try your best. I learned that while.. you know, going through life while trying to get better at osu!... sounds pathethic but its not the only thing i did ofc. 

Anyways, the point is that i just realized that the rest of the time i spend outside of what i like doing, **i waste** on reddit, twitter, porn, just sitting in my chair... ""resting"" is what i would say to myself i was doing. I could get a job or go to college...  thats not really what i mean though. That i can do anytime and it wont change my pace in life much, money could be useful but i dont care about money..

What i care about is finding people to like doing stuff with. Here begins the complications because i dont really keep a single thing interesting for more than a month or two. I get depressed, realize something about myself or whatever the f else can happen in my life will change what i like to do in my spare time... guess that is something i should try and control as much as i can now..

Though, im not really the type of person to constantly hang out with a group of people.. i love doing it but its not THE THING. I like to be alone. But you know how how you sometimes feel like you need to have someone there at all times, not even physically there, just a message away. Yeah... i really would need that right now. 

It would have to be a girl though, like not even a question in my mind, which is kinda annoying cuz it cuts the % of it happening in half and i wish i was bi but im very straight sadly. Im a horny man, man. Though its not about sex, i dont care to have someone to stroke my cock all day, ^(though it would be fucking cool lets be real here.) 

Id like a girl that i could just do whatever the fuck with, literally anything. But the main point is probably is that i want to be desired. Someone to randomly give me a hug so i could hug em back as hard as i can and start laughing at how weak they are or something. 

Is this literally just me being touch starved or am i just desperate? I dont really know man.

5189,xo1d2j,someoneinlife1,"Just gonna rant and maybe not make much sense here. Loneliness is awful. And I’ve been alone for so long that I get so attached to people who don’t even care about me. The thing is I can’t have a conversation, with anyone. If I try, it dies out after a minute. I legitimately don’t know how people do it. And I have no goals for the future, no nothing…so I really don’t have much to talk about. I just feel like a loser, and everyone knows it. I second guess everything I think about saying and so I just stay silent instead and people think I’m totally weird because I don’t talk to them.

At my job I’m mainly on my own except for sometimes my boss and another guy and it’s so awkward when I see them because I can’t talk to them. It’s weird because when they walk past me to go somewhere I’m not sure if I should make eye contact or ignore them, so I just stare at my phone and try (and fail) to be normal. And the problem is my boss is nice to me, because he’s my boss. And so my brain has decided that I’m in love with him. Just because he gives me attention when no other guys in my life do. He’s not even my type at all, he’s a lot older than me and he’s married. Being lonely lowers your bar I suppose. But of course I can’t have a conversation him either because I have nothing to talk about, so we barely talk unless it’s about the job.

When you’re this lonely every little interaction with people sticks out so much. And so of course you way over-read into every little situation. And while you go home and think about the small interaction that made you happy that day, they go home and don’t even give you a second thought because they have a freaking life. I’m only happy when I’m busy. And even then I’m not really happy, I’m just not thinking about how my life is going nowhere. 

I know there’s other lonely people out there because of this subreddit, but I have never met someone with no friends in real life. Why is that? I feel like I’m the weirdest person to ever exist. And with each year that passes, it gets too late for me. I’m just wasting my life and my youth and it all sucks.

I followed the past advice not allowing her back in my life so I told her “pay me back whenever goodbye” she then goes to try to talk to me (very one sided). She tells me she is back in AA, going to therapy and misses me. I’ve only spoken to her a few more times in a very distant tone asking how classes are going and how her daughter is doing.

I am attending college, my second year now. I've signed up for groups, went to social outings, have gone out of my way to try and form connections. I feel that same familiar feeling of discomfort and unbelonging and slowly weasel my way out of their affiliation. My efforts are not reciprocated.

I've asked them how they are doing and what's going on to make sure they're alright. I've always had the intuitive feeling that I was never really a strong friend to any of them, a good addition but never a person given much of a second thought. The energy I receive from them does not match mine. My efforts are not reciprocated.

I've had an okay relationship with my parents. Not bad, not good. We have a little talk some time, the company is nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I don't particularly disturb others, or in my confidence don't believe that I do. I just find myself not forming any meaningful relations with others other than them asking me for assistance, or being a chummy acquittance or little more than a small talking morsel for them to kill time. When I try to further it, nothing ever seems to stem even if I try a little harder to reach out.

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I've used my different forms of online outlets as a substitute. It is a fine and worthy way to try and know people, but anything beyond a surface level interest and one time. conversation is as far as it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I may be too reserved.

&amp;#x200B;

I do many things right. I exercise and take pride in being able to run and have a lean body. I try to reach out and read many different things, keeping up to date on the world and politics and to keep myself open minded to new things and ideas. I work and study to provide myself an income and to do the best I can on my studies. I sustain a healthy and methodical diet and get plenty of sleep and rest. My hygiene standards involve showering daily, grooming, and teeth care. I do the right thing and make myself the best I can be.

&amp;#x200B;

But it just seems there seems to be some sort of illusive force or concept I do not comprehend that's holding me back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I always try to smile and look at the new day and blue sky with positivity and optimism. It works most of the times. But when I return to my quarters after a productive and fulfilling day, an all too familiar feeling of emptiness returns to me. Many times I don't feel like doing anything but fulfilling my obligations and then laying down.

&amp;#x200B;

So many souls I see every day. Some happy, some sad, some with company and some without. 

&amp;#x200B;

All accompanying me is a bitter dark chasm within.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day feels like this. I've come to realize that I am truly alone.

5234,xo5vqc,barkowacko,"title.

spent my off day from work tonight playing video games in my apartment by myself when i was suddenly overcome by a huge wave of sadness. i realized, like, damn. this is what my life just is now. going to work, coming home, and spending most of my time by myself. no social life to speak of, since most of the ppl i knew in high school drifted from me and i never made any real friends in college (had to drop out early). and after spending the past few yrs attempting on and off to meet new people i realized that making friends as an adult is the hardest shit ever. i didnt realize just how hard it would be.

i feel like if youre not in an established friend group by the time youre outta college (like me) youre kinda just fucked 🙃 most times i attempt reachin out to somebody new that i find super cool and relatable i get straight up brushed off or ignored. i wanna say maybe theres somethin about me thats just not really likeable? but i dont know for sure.

sigh. i just wanna have a social life and be invited into other ppls lives like how i invite others into mine but the older i get the more i realize its probably not gonna happen 🥱 and thats what led me here.

i am so tired of feeling like this, feeling like a loner and that theres nowhere for me to fit in or that i have nobody relatable that i can connect with. i wanna really feel like im a part of a group, and that i matter to somebody. i know a lot of yall must feel the same way, so i was wondering, is there a discord server or group chat that you guys hang out in? if not — lets make one! i wanna find my people, wherever they are, and stop feeling so isolated.",2022-09-26 01:58:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624083000,3,/r/lonely/comments/xo5vqc/26m_tired_of_not_having_a_real_group_of_friends/,,0,1,26/M — tired of not having a real group of friends

5240,xo6dsr,sean-exists,"I feel so ashamed to feel this fucking alone at 15. I should be happy right now. I should be with friends; I should have friends. I shouldn’t be allowed to feel this sad, I have a good life and parents who love me and I have money and I go to a good school but no one ever wants to be around me. 

This whole summer not one person asked me to hang out with them, not one text asking to do something. I never get called and I know my friends hung and hang out without me. I just rotted in my room every single day

Every time I’m with my friends I feel like I’m fighting for their attention and I’m always the one starting a conversation. The only time I’m with friends anyways is at lunch because they are forced to be with me. 

I have been asked how I’m doing once in the past 4 months and of course I lied and said “I’m doin alright.” 

The worst part is I never cry, I want to but I just feel nothing. When I’m walking through the hallways I only ever feel anger and resentment for those around me.

People might not even hate me, but no one really likes me, not really. I’m just an afterthought, I fade into the background. I’m not special and no one ever thinks “hey let’s invite him!” Never. Because no one likes being around me. 

I thought that going to the gym was supposed to help confidence but I feel shittier than I ever have in my life despite without a doubt being in the best shape I ever have been. When I started I could barely bench 75 and now I can do 135 for reps. 

I want to say it’s all in my head like I have been for years but I know it’s a lie and I have evidence that people purposefully don’t invite me places 

More than anything I just want someone who loves me, a friend who wants to be around me, someone who asks how I’m doing and means it. 

Maybe I’m just meant to not have friends, it has to happen to some people. Even the losers in my grade have friends and hang out with each other but I literally am never around friends no matter how hard I try. So I’m the kid in my grade with no real friends, there has to be at least one. 

Sometimes I feel like I have to have some sort of mental illness. Like if a doctor told me “yup you’re retarded” maybe it would make sense why people don’t like me but I just don’t get it. 

Every day I come home, do homework, go to the gym, and then sit in my bed and think about what a fucking loser I am until I fall asleep and sleep through dinner. 

I feel like such a disappointment to my parents, I hate when they ask if I’m doing anything this weekend and when every single fucking time I say nothing. Stop fucking asking. I wish they would disappear so I didn’t feel like they wished I were with friends. 

I know a therapist wouldn’t help because they can’t fix not having any friends so I’m just alone with no one to talk to. I would feel like such a loser asking for one anyways, a disappointment. Just another teen who has “depression,” like fuck off just learn to put down the phone and realize you have friends.

All of my friends are growing up, finding each other/other people/their ""forever partners"", and moving on. I'm either a third wheel or flat-out ignored, after working through so much shit to even get to this point in my life. But you know what? I was fine, I was happy for them all, truly. I am happy for them. They all deserve the best. And besides, I had my kitty to take care of and keep me company (he was the best cuddler, and he made so many bad days that much better), and I decided I was happy and had everything I needed. I didn't care who ended up with who, where I'd be in the future, what anything would look like - I decided things really did get better, and we'd take it one step at a time.

But then the universe sent me a huge ""fuck you"" and triple-combo killed the one thing that made me truly happy, because I haven't suffered enough apparently. Now that final vet visit is etched into my brain forever, every single part. And of course, my body must hate me just as much, because it's got that hour-long memory on loop like some stupid YouTube video every time I try to close my eyes.

Before that though, when the vet (bless her) initially handed me the paperwork and went over what I could do to make my cat better, I tried everything I possibly could on that paper. And then I must have prayed to every god in existence, sleeping next to him on the floor every night, trying to be optimistic and hoping for the best this time (instead of going worst case scenario like I always do).

No, fuck you. He died 4 days later anyway.

Everyone keeps trying to patronize me and just pat me on the back like they care or something. But they all pretty much say the same thing and it's so fucking old. It won't get better. I'm not an idiot. I know a life peak when I see one. I don't want to play this game anymore. It sucks. I just want my cat back. I don't care. I just want my cat back. I don't want a lot.

I asked all of them and every single one said they weren’t going to homecoming. I didn’t think much of it so I ended up not going and decided to catch up on homework.

This morning I open my instagram and see that everyone I knew ended up going to homecoming and had the time of their lives. They posted group photos of themselves dressed up and dancing and going out to dinner and partying. I wasted the last homecoming of my life doing homework because my friends said to my face that they weren’t going. 

What’s worse is they didn’t message me saying they changed their minds or even invited me to go. This isn’t anything new. They always smile and talk to me in class but never invite or include me in anything despite them knowing me for years. I’m always the one left out. I’m always the one who is lied to. The problem is that no one else slightly includes me in their friend group so I have to suck it up and he stuck in this purgatory.

It seemed like I was the only one at my school who didn’t go since everyone was posting about how great of a time they had. It feels like I’m just a ghost.

5279,xoaa0z,solarpoweredJJ,"Hello.

I had a rough day today. I had a fight with a coworker and it got me thinking about various things. This post isn't about that fight or venting, but in what I want at the end of the day.

I took a few hours after work to just listen to music and stare in the ocean by myself. I asked myself a few questions.

I asked if I was happy. I asked if I was sad.

I asked myself if I was envious of other people whether it be my friends, co-workers, etc.

I asked if I was proud of myself, and whether or not I was okay with being me. 

After a long drifting self-talk I realized I just wanted one thing at the moment.

I wanted an unconditional love. 

It felt like I just wanted a big hug.

I understood that I wasn't exposing that part of myself that much, if at all, in my every-day life.

And now after all of that, I wonder to myself if the problem isn't necessarily that I feel lonely, but that I feel lonely in these feelings I keep to myself.

I like being alone. And I'm wondering if I just want someone to share this loneliness with. Or at least, someone who I'm not afraid being this vulnerable around. This feeling of being so fragile; this feeling of being so weak. 

I haven't found that answer yet.

I hope I will one day.",2022-09-26 05:32:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,1549518819,6,/r/lonely/comments/xoaa0z/being_okay_with_being_vulnerable/,,0,2,Being Okay With Being Vulnerable.

Someone I can trust and show my affection to, someone I can show how much love I can truly give.

I am nothing more than a gust of wind - I exist in your life for nothing more than a few seconds, before I vanish and move onto the next person, felt but never noticed and certainly never remembered. I just want to exist in someone's life, to finally take material form, but it seems that I simply cannot. I wonder where I went wrong, what I'm doing wrong, why it's so easy for others but not me to exist. I wish I could live like they do, but I can't, I don't know how, I'm not able to. I can't say things directly the way other people do, so I speak in hieroglyphics and stammer our Morse code and hope that people understand me. I've been trying to learn to live by myself, so I've built a fortress, and now no one can enter. 

Every day I dig this hole deeper, and every day I get closer to my inevitable death alone. 

No one is ever going to be there on the other end of my fantasies. No one is ever going to walk up behind me, hook his arms under my shoulders and hug me tight against his chest just because there's nothing more than he wants to do than hold me. There's never going to be a person who holds my hand and squeezes it every few minutes just to remind me that I'm his. And I'll never be able to feel anyone subtly touch my hips during late-night TV binge sessions because he just needs to feel my flesh in his hands.

Attraction is impossible. Everyone I meet seems to, simply put, lack maturity, have nothing in common with me, or live halfway across the country. At this rate it really seems like I'm never going to find anyone. It feels like it's just waiting from here on out.

It’s hard to deal with rejection when you’re mentally ill. I’m seriously having a hard time coping with this. I’ve never been in a relationship before and I’m a virgin and stuff and he was the first guy that I’ve ever kissed. I’ve been rejected in the past SO MANY TIMES like it’s genuinely unreal.

I thought it would be different this time since he’s a virgin too and has no experience with girls but I’m genuinely not enough because it’s been said to me more than once that they don’t have the drive to pursue anything with me and it’s not me it’s them blah blah.

This seriously fucks with people, I struggle to get guys to like me so this will definitely have an impact on any relationship I have with anyone in the future like any kind relationship.

I’ve accepted that I’ll be lonely and this is my fate. Nobody will ever love me, I don’t even love myself. This will even have a strong impact on my body dysmorphia.

And here i am, 33 years of age, finished school with several uni degrees, Technical, IT, good paying salary, nice big 3 room penthouse for just me and the cleaning lady i hired to clean it 1 time a week. my own private garage witch i made my personal Bike and Lego storage. 

I go on vacation 2-3 times a year, i spent 3 weeks on the Amalfi coast, Sicily and Capri island in Italy in April of this year, at the end of the month i am going on a roundabout 3 week Greece sightseeing trip where i will be taking my camera and drone for sightseeing, i would like to see what remains of the ottoman empire, the ancient Greek and roman times, and the Greek war of independence, going to visit Nafplion just see the stairs of the church where Ioannis Kapodistrias was shot, i like history. 

Yet in the back of my mind, there is always Grandpa and his provider story, i was never interested into dating i am average looking and quite chubby, i do not wear fancy clothes, jeans and a shirt and i am gucci, I always thought that girls where interested in whats on the inside, but this is quite often not the case. 

I always feel like i should buy expensive clothes and dress nicely, but that is not me i do not want people to get a wrong impression of me, i speak my mind and never hesitate to say what i think. 

At times i do feel lonely and the ""urge"" to go out dating, i have been on myself and self providing for so long, i haven't dated a girl in 5 years and then comes the question: do i want to give up my freedom for commitment?

Here's the deal, today i asked a girl if she maybe wants to go out with me and she said she is not interested. she was just acting nice, that was straight shot to my guts, that hurt quite allot, made me fall of my stature. but also a sense of proud of having the guts to ask someone out. 

For the super lonely people out there, would you trade in all that freedom that i have for dating?

My answer is fack ehm, if she is not into you, she is not into you, i look forward to my Greece trip i shouldn't be worried about girls, why be lonely if you have a chance to meet all these new people and hopefully make some friends along the way, its what my mom told me, if she likes you very much she will come to you.

On a throwaway because I don’t want people I know to see. I have been very back and forth with feelings over the last year, and it just keeps getting so much worse so quickly. To be blunt I have many thoughts of ‘giving up’, feeling hopeless and pointless and suicidal, however I then spiral and panic about dying and fearing when my life will end.

Whenever I try to bring this up I get told to be quiet and stop talking about it as it is upsetting to some members of my friendship group.

5363,xoqtf2,WhatuKnowAboutMoney,"I'm 33M. I have a house i bought last year, a Work from home job making like 65k a year, i just adopted a dog. Like all things about me seem good on paper, but i'm so lonely and it seems hopeless to find a romantic partner.  I didn't date for like 5 years after my last relationship or i tried, but nothing ever clicked or no one was interested. I was living at home so that really hurt my confidence, but now i'm living alone and no on is interested still on the apps.  the only place i feel like i'd be able to meet someone off that apps is the dog park.  I don't have any clubs or churches i go to and any of them would be male dominated anyways like a ping pong club.  

I think i'm ok looking, but i'm getting old and my eyes have wrinkle and bags. I'm just like average. not overweight. skin kinda spotty from freckles and zits as a kid.  Still somehow get zits at 33.  I'm just so directionless in life and with the work from home and no longer living with parents i'm alone 99% of the time.  Friends are all busy with their homes and significant relationships and i've like self isolated myself from a life of being an introvert. There's this worker appreciation event this week where i'll see people from work who i haven't seen in 9 months and i'm dreading it.  Like i know i'm so alone, but still fear socialization things. It used to be an in person job and my coworkers never did any happy hours or anything. there could be days where i wouldn't talk to anyone in the office so working from home is so much better, even if isolated.  They all basically stayed in person so i'm just worried it will be awkward and not looking forward to it.

Romance wise I was seeing someone for 5 months and that was the first time in 5 years i was like ""wow maybe there is hope"", but that woman was like the best i could do out of 8 women i went on dates with. (most didn't want to continue seeing me after a date) and it wasn't even great relationship.  i'm just so desperate for love i put up with her constantly flaking on me, seeing her once every 2 weeks.  she was just always busy.  We were exclusive and messaged everyday, but i hadn't seen her in 5 weeks and felt like she was avoiding me so i asked what was up and that lead to her wanting to break up to work on herself.  She was just busy and like if i hadn't said anything we could have kept going, but she was like ""its better to get it out of the way now then in a year"" and to think i could have kept it going for a few more months if just kept my mouth shut I super regret saying anything. Was just frustrated, but had been unhappy. i would like to see my person a few times a week and have them sleepover and stuff. not just dinner, bang and then go for 4 hours every 2 weeks.  She said we could stay friends and stay in contact, but we hooked up one last time and i like tried to convince her to stay together and she just wanted to work on herself alone and wasn't interested. and since then she has ghosted me even though she said we could keep messaging and be friends.  She has a lot of trauma to be sure, but like i could have been there for her. and of course i've seen her profile on dating apps and it seems the same as it was before.  Like why not just keep hooking up with me if your on the dating apps. she said she wanted to work on herself and find a partner to have kids with cause i'm iffy about kids, but now i'm like for the right person i'll have kids, i told her that.


IDK this is just a massive rant. I just woke up feeling super depressed. I thought the dog would help, but thats just causing me more anxiety having to care for her and she has like separation anxiety so I have to like plan leaving the home so she doesn't freak out. or make my trips short. I just feel trapped. with the dog, in my home, in my job, in romance, in this state.  Have debated rehoming her, but my situation wouldn't change and i do love the dog already. its like I know i'm wasting my life, I look back at the time post highschool and i already have regrets so what is it going to be like when i'm an old man.  Just a lifetime of regrets. I'm like trying and keep going day after day.  i just don't know how to fix it.  I feel like a romantic partner would help, but i don't seem capable of attracting anyone. Like i swiped thorugh everyone on bumble and got like 2 matches. Same photos as i used in january and back then it was struggle, but i got a few dates. so far this time its like nothing..  Other than that a new job might help, but its like comfortable now and a new job could be worse.

5364,xoqvbw,You-Heard-Write,"I went to a friend's bachelorette party this weekend, and Saturday night we did a jeopardy game which was mostly about the bride, groom, and our (the bridesmaids) friendships with the bride. It was a well made game and was very fun until I realized halfway through that I don't feel like I have any friends who know or care about me enough to be able to answer similar questions about me. And I immediately felt guilty that my depression was ruining the fun for me, but it absolutely shattered me. I don't even think the bride would be able to answer many questions about me if the roles were reversed. I always put more effort into my friendships than the other party and it breaks my heart, and now, I'm starting to question if I was only asked to be a bridesmaid out of pity/obligation.

I keep telling people that I don't want a bridal party for my own wedding in 2 years because they are too much trouble, but honestly, it's because I don't feel like there is anyone close enough to be in those positions. It doesn't help that my best friend of 12 years has dropped off the face of the earth since he got a girlfriend and couldn't care less that I'd recently gotten engaged.

I've been super depressed ever since because I just can't figure out why no one likes me and why I don't matter.

I have no friends for the past 2 years and recently realised that the ones i had before were fake aswell. Approximately 4 months ago i have lost interest in the last thing which i enjoyed, gaming. Since then whenever i have free time i just watch pointless youtube videos, shorts or recently tiktok. I don't work out, got myself together a bit recently about actually going to the gym but turns out i might have a hearth thingy so gotta wait with that until the end of november. I am slightly overweight, not morbidly but enough to make me have 0 confidence in myself. School feels like torture, my head frequently hurts because (what i think) is the lack of any kind of emotional/intellectual relaxation which i see as talking to friends, hanging out or just generally doing things one enjoys. I have been prescribed medication almost 2 months ago which i don't feel the effect of. I had gone to therapy for almost a year but towards the end i felt like my therapist was angry with me for not making any progress, and at our last meeting which was in june i felt pretty hurt by a thing she said so we haven't spoken since. I feel like not contacting her was the right decision since i haven't heard from her too after that. I always have something to respond, counter with when someone tries to give me advice on anything and it makes me feel terrible. Sometimes i can't sleep at night and i feel so bad that i just moan from the pain inside while unable to properly cry for some reason. I do have a few people online who i can sort of talk to but only for a couple sentences, then the conversations die out.

5394,xou8gm,RedditUser000aaa,"This post took form the moment I realised how lonely I am. I do have a loving gf, but I'd also love a group of friends.

Where can I find friends? There are activities for adults, absolutely but those are the kind of activities meant for age groups wayyy beyond my age group and thus the interests I have would not even slightly match with them.

I often find myself of dreaming of a friend group where we can just relax or play D&amp;D, play games or just watch movies.

Where I live there are places for young people where they can just hang out and they have ton of free time activities. I kind of wish that such a place would exist for adults as well.

I've even considered trying to use a dating app to specifically find friends, but despite some dating apps having the option to find friends, I suppose majority want something more than a friendship.

This dilemma is frustrating and I wish it was just easier somehow, why is it this hard to find friends??",2022-09-26 20:07:59,lonely,t5_2qjny,1588925896,1,/r/lonely/comments/xou8gm/where_are_you_supposed_to_find_friends_as_an_adult/,,0,3,Where are you supposed to find friends as an adult?

I'm so damn grateful for having her by my side, but I can't help but feel that most people absolutely don't care about me or think badly of me. I am very shy and never start a conversation myself. But that doesn't mean I want to be treated like an alien. When I make an eye contact with someone new, they give me a wry look. When I'm not looking at anyone, I feel like everyone is watching me, like I'm that weird social outcast. This has been the case since primary school. That means that even if I really want to approach a new, interesting to me person, I don't do it, because I'm afraid that they will give me that wry look or think: ""Why is this stranger weirdo talking to me?"". I never know how to talk to someone new without it feeling awkward or desperate or out of nowhere. And since about 3 years, from when I met my best friend, no one else has approached me yet. I feel lonely and as if something is wrong with me. I take care of my looks and try to give a friendly vibe, and people still look at me like at the freak.

5408,xovjde,Brilliant-Client-914,"I know that it's a very long text but please read it anyway.


For context I'm 16 now. Back in elementary school I used to be in a group of 4 people , we were best friends (and I mean it). At middle school tho because we were with a lot more people and new people to be friends with I started to fall off of that group. Nowadays we barely talk but I know that the 3 of them are still pretty good friends and their group is larger.

 Anyway today I started thinking where it all went wrong and why I lost my true friends and after a lot of thinking I came to understand that it was ALL  my fault. Back then I didn't hang out with them after school a lot of times only when they asked me, and now I think that the problem was that I never once tried to do anything with them after school, I thought that that friendship would last like that but it didn't. 

Now I'm jealous of their friends group but I'm even angrier at myself because I was the problem all along and the only reason why I am not friends with them anymore is because I didn't know that I had to put effort to sustain that friendship.

I am angry at myself for losing all those opportunities because I was stupid!!!

 Now I have 0 real friends and only talk to 2 other dudes only at school but I am not friends with them (not because I can't but because I don't want to).

I would give everything to go back in time 7-8 years and do things the right way.

Idk, I feel like life could be so much better if I had put in the effort, and I feel like I missed so many things because of that. I can't forgive myself

Now, I am always at home studying or scrolling through social media seeing other people going to clubs and just hanging out.

I'm 15 and never really made friends. I went to a small private school where everyone knew everyone from elementary to middle school. Didn't really ever have friends but, I could at least talk to people somewhat at school. Fast forward to 9th grade and I didn't go to a real school more like an online course thing. For 10th grade I started 2 weeks since I got registered late I was kinda excited since after 7th grade ish I haven't really talked to anyone since for the remainder of 7th grade and all of 8th grade I had online. Anyway it sucks so much Ive been in school a month now and I've talked on 3 different occasions to people who weren't teachers, plus it wasn't even like on the three ocasions people were just talking to me it was a group project and even in that I barley talked compared to anyone else. Kinda sad I was excited for it since I felt like I could finally sorta talk to someone but not really. I feel so incredibly lonley I genuinely talk to no one besides my parents. I used to have good online friends but, we don't really talk much anymore. I had one friend from the school I used to go to even had her added on Instagram but, we havent talked for 3 weeks and even before that every conversation we had I had to initiate it. I even tried to open up to her about how disappointed I was about school but, she ignored all the parts I talked about being lonely (I told her in general about how it was going not just my social life like teachers how it was etc). I don't even care to have close friends I just want someone to talk to. Like with my online friends we weren't super super close but it was nice to hop online and play some games with someone.

I genuinely dread school everyday I feel so bad about my self. I hate hearing about everyone talking about their relationships and such. I feel kinda 'behind' as well since highschool I feel is when you get a lot of 'first' time relationships and I just can't do that. I feel kinda embarrassed even. Everyone's talking with each other about their friends, their girlfriend/boyfriends and I'm just sitting at the edge of table no one even paying me any attention. 

anyway just wanted to vent or hey someone give me advice since I genuinely don't think I can continue going on if shits gonna stay like this.",2022-09-27 00:25:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646357150,12,/r/lonely/comments/xp0xo7/i_have_0_friends/,,0,1,I have 0 friends

Growing up as a woman I was always told that my anxiety doesn't matter, i worry too much, when I'm dissociating from reality I'm just over reacting, when I can't focus and I'm paralyzed from my constant anxiety I'm just lazy. I try to talk to people and they brush me off, nobody is willing hear me out or believe me. I feel like I was born to love, but to never get love back in return. No care or understanding has ever been shown to me, so now I live in silence.  I am the only one I have in my life that can truly help.  alcohol has been a big help as well. I know it's not healthy but I can't see me living life without it.

these thoughts of mine will probably lead to no real result, they will not help me at all, and nothing is the basis of this message, a chain of thoughts that I will probably forget in a week.

*BACKSTORY*
hi I'm 20 years old, it's been 20 years since my asian parents had me born here in italy (yes it's the backstory, so you'll actually invest more in my post)

*INTRODUCTION*
you know the meme about how college students feel so lonely? it's not a meme for nothing lmao. it's not even the fact that i am an introvert, shy and/or weak person, i am an extrovert, maybe not yet in my prime form because of low self-esteem, but that's another story for another time.

Loneliness, feeling lonely, is the feeling of losing what you had in the past and crying about it like a baby. Well i tried to ignored it for a very long time, the fact that i lost a lot of my friends, lovers or people i really liked over the years because of my dodging personality. But it's about time for me to admit, that i have become a lonely person.

*MAIN BODY, I GUESS*
I don't struggle talking to people, is just that, I can't make friendships that last long, i have to let go of someone after a certain point, no fights not anything like that, is just, for the better. I only have 2 friends that i know for a very, very long time, but i don't see them much because every time I'm with them it becomes a therapy session and that's boring, sad and overall a bad experience for someone who just want to talk about, idk, how the fuck do fishes fucking bond with their owners.

I'm 20 years old now, i wasted my childhood and my teens, i won't give any backstory here, but i don't give a fuck anymore, i do have regrets, but what can i do, go back in time? it's time for my redemption arc, i wanna say sorry to myself, I'm sorry, for the fact that i basically only talk to my mom and my lil bro everyday, without going out. That boosted my passion on movies, cooking, music, art and clothes tho, but that's not the point.

I don't have anyone to talk to anymore, no one that can stand my randomness, weirdness and other corny adjectives, it is sad, i am sad, everyone sad, congrats.

it's time to say goodbye, i probably wont read any comments or even open this subreddit for a while, this is getting me sad as fuck, damn. i just want to say, there's nothing i want to say, but i feel bad not leaving a good message,

*THE END*
Appearance matter, no matter how delusional you can be, it will always matter, same goes for being true to yourself, explore what you like and what you don't, go deep in your thinking pattern, evolve yourself, build YOUR ""perfect"" at least close to the personality YOU want, and fucking enjoy life, you know how thin is the line of death? there is no line at all, i can even die of an heart attack rn because of fucking sneeze you know? a sneeze! well anyways, stop going around and around, if you have problems, fucking go at them and knock people out, maybe not or yes, but enjoy life everyone, go procreate or just make yourself a sandwich and eat a banana, banana makes you happy, well im gone now, love, real love to anyone that have read this far, goodbye, bye bye.",2022-09-27 00:51:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1643676069,2,/r/lonely/comments/xp1jsc/lonely_story_for_lonely_people/,,0,2,Lonely story for lonely people.

Sometimes I wonder if I did this to myself. There's a part of me that grows every year that makes me wonder if I don't even deserve happiness. Every single time something good happens, something lese come along and fucks it up. I have expiration dates on anything that makes me smile: Friends, family, co-workers, partners, hobbies, jobs, vacations, memories in general, etc. And I mean, sometimes it's my fault and I can own  it, but lately... These last couple of years though? They have been... Rough. But the biggest fuck up of my life was losing the love of my life. I purposed in, and got engaged in 2020 (we were 4 years in), and everything was great and he really was everything to me... Then one day he was just gone. No messages, no calls, no longer in my arms... He just left. Never told me why. And it still kills me to this day. He was all I had of something stable in my life. Made me believe that I could be a better person. He gave me a reason to live, hope for the future, and so much more. It's been a year now, and I'm falling apart. I'm so angry at him and upset with myself that I let this happen. I knew that There was an expiration date on this, I just didn't know it hit as hard as this.

None of them came looking for me, which makes sense because they made it very clear they didn’t give a shit about me or value me even half as much as I valued them, but I’m mutuals with one of them on Twitter, and neither of us took the initiative to soft block the other. I think I just held hope that maybe they’d reach out to me and ask if I was okay or for me to come back because of my abrupt departure, which, of course, never happened.

She has cut me off, which I didn’t expect since she didn’t tell me she was going to do that. I know she wanted me to pay rent myself for the place where I live now that I don’t study anymore, which is fine, I understand that.
We even talked about jobs - how it’s okay if I’m not employed yet because the right job will come along sometime, where my skills actually matter. I thought we understood each other. 
But now she acts like I should be able to pay for everything in my life (it’s only been a month since our big conversation). She expects every penny back that she gives me. It’s not like she has money troubles herself. She’s well off. 
Makes me feel like I’m a burden on her shoulders, like she doesn’t want me anymore. I understand that I guess. But damn that hurts. 
I can pay for most of my things, and my bf has a job, we can afford stuff. But sometimes it’s just not enough. 
And when me and my mum talk on the phone, she tells me about the jewellery she bought herself, about the clothes she bought. She tells me that my shoes look old and that I need new ones.
Feels shitty because I know that. I know my clothes are old, but I can’t buy new ones.

I feel useless because jobs for my specific education pay so fucking little. Well under minimum wage. Most of them aren’t full time jobs. 
I can’t even get a normal day job because I can’t leave my puppy alone in the flat, I have to be home while my boyfriend works.

Basically cried my eyes out last night, which coupled with the cold I have really hurt them lmao. Feeling extra shitty.

5483,xp661c,DiedInParadise,"I (Female) have a friend (Male) who I’ll call N. We’ve known each other since kindergarten since we’ve lived in the same town all our lives thus far and about 6 years ago we became really close.

There have been rocky periods where we have taken short breaks or needed space, etc. but for the most part we have been in each other’s top 3 (at least) for a while now.

Last year we had a minor falling out after he started making some questionable life choices that I didn’t agree with, and another disagreement after I found out he had been consistently lying to me about things to “avoid conflict.”

After they cleaned up and he and I talked through our situation things were back on track, or so I thought.

Earlier this month I heard from a mutual friend about a groupchat the two of them are in that I hadn’t know about. Not only was I never told about it, but it wasn’t a small group of people either. They just invited whoever they felt like whenever and almost everybody I had ever considered friendly towards me was in it.

My other friend, who I will call E told me about it by mistake. E wasn’t aware that I didn’t know about the groupchat and I haven’t told them yet.

The whole gimmick of the groupchat was that two people who I had denounced as people in my life wanted a space I couldn’t enter where they could “safely” talk shit about me.

What is worse is that, while N probably doesn’t participate in any of that, he makes no effort to avoid or prevent it. N has never stood up for me because he wants to make as many people as happy as possible. N created the groupchat for them, too.

I have autism and would have been probably diagnosed with Asperger’s before that title became obsolete. Getting along with people has never been an issue, but I feel very disconnected from my peers and when I learned about the groupchat I couldn’t sleep for a week.

I dont have any other people to turn to and im not ready to be completely alone, as I hardly speak to my friends at all let alone anybody else.

I cant help but feel like this is somehow my fault, either for not picking up on some vital social sign that could have indicated stuff like this would happen or for letting it get this far.

Its been a few weeks and a I’ve tried getting over it, even after confronting N and then formally forgiving him, but I can’t take this anymore.

I don’t remember how long it’s been since I last posted, but not a a lot has changed besides me reaching out to one of my old friends and having him pass on a note to the others. 

About how proud I was of them, and how I was sorry for what I did, even though I don’t know what it was. About how I cry every time I see them hit a new milestone, because I wasn’t there to celebrate with them. 

I’ve only gotten worse since then, I think. I don’t do anything anymore but work, eat, play games, and sleep. All in that order every single day. 

My family seems to be happier without me in the house, now. My younger siblings get to go to events and conventions that I could only dream of. My dad came home to work and isn’t all over the country anymore and I envy my siblings because of it. I wish I could’ve seen my dad everyday like they get to. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. After everything that’s happened over these past few months, I feel hopeless and like I’m unlovable and unworthy of happiness. 

But I hold onto a string that i’ll find it one day, even though i know it’s not possible.

5503,xp9bpi,A_nice_Redditor_,"I (26m) was alone for a very long time. My whole adult life I tried to make friends and find a girlfriend. I suffered from depression and anxieties, but I'm in therapy for about 4 years now.

In the last tear I did pretty well. I've got my first relationship (but ended after 5 weeks though), had a few dates, I got friends and so on. During the whole time in Therapy I was working on myself and I got better a lot. 
Also I started to work out a few Weeks ago and it went quite well.

In May this year I had a date with the nicest person I've ever met. She was gorgeous, had nice interests and so on. I have to admit I was astonished.
Unfortunately it ended afterwards because of her private situation with study and her mental health. She told me that she likes me but she feels overwhelmed by the situation and needs time.
I understand that and told her that she can message me whenever she feels to.

Over time I recognized she hasn't deleted my number because I still get her WhataApp Updates.

Now I wrote her and just asked how she's doing. But she haven't responded yet(it's been a week now)

Also I had a chat with a different girl which seems kind of interested. We talked about meeting each other. Before we fixed it she told me that she doesn't feel well.
I told her to message me when she fells better. This is also a week ago.

Accept people can hurt you emotionally and mentally, caused so much pain, then walk away, and you have to accept it ?

I am tired of people preaching about how pain and trauma softens you and your heart. No, it does not. Not all the time. Pain changes you and sometimes, people don't and can't heal from the pain. 

The scar stays in their lives and they never heal.

Some people romanticize scars and says it will teach you something.  Some pain is just pain and it teaches you nothing. It is just, pain.

There is not always a lesson to learn from pain. And I am genuinely tired of people telling me, something good will come out of this experience. 

I think some experience is just as it is - an experience. And sometimes pain, is just pain and nothing more. You don't really have to believe people who tells you ""pain is meant to teach you something"" and then dig deep into your wound, searching for the lesson.

Sometimes, pain is just pain. An experience that  is meant to be an experience and nothing more.

5508,xp9o3q,solarpoweredJJ,"Hello.

I wanted to write some things before I went to bed tonight.

Today was a good day over all. I've got a lot of things done and took some time to see people who I haven't seen in a while. It was nice.

Throughout this day I've been practicing my thought checking; for those unfamiliar with the term it originates from therapy. It's a self-help practice where you cognitively recognize what thoughts and scenarios enter your mind and deconstruct them, asking yourself if they are valid thoughts, factual thoughts etc. The goal is to try to minimize the impact these thoughts have on yourself so you can feel better.

Over the years I've gotten better at it. I can recognize certain negative moments as inconsequential and so-forth; logically I can tell myself these things.

Emotionally however, that's a different story.

I have a habitual tendency to blame myself over things (fights, arguments, etc). It stems from my childhood. 

Resulting from that, I used to have (and still have) negative moments play on in my head where I blame myself as the problem. If I wasn't there things would be better; if I acted differently things wouldn't have happened this way; etc.

Again logically I tell myself things to support myself. I have learned that my existence does not equal pain.

But the pain never goes away. The emotions are always there, filled with a stabbing pain. What's worse is that the same scenario will keep replaying over and over in my head, and I'll keep trying to analyze it and tell myself things are okay. Meanwhile I'm holding it together to keep going throughout the day and I'm doing my best to take care of myself mentally.

It's exhausting. It's so, so tiring. It's a repeating cycle that just keeps going and going and going.

After a few days it'll get better (hopefully, it usually does). 

But I think that for me is the loneliest thing I experience. 

I don't want to be strong all the time and have to smile and suffer through what I feel silently. Sometimes I wish I could just have someone to tell me things are okay.

I know though that I could never realistically have that, just because these thoughts repeat over and over in my head. I've had friends who have comforted me before in situations (which I am incredibly thankful for), but in the end I know that I have to grow and face my pain.

I have faced it, and continue to face it. Just sometimes, some days, I just don't want to deal with this by myself. 

Sometimes I just want someone who would be willing to help me suffer through it. Maybe it's selfish I don't know. 

But gosh, dang is it lonely to fight.",2022-09-27 07:20:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1549518819,16,/r/lonely/comments/xp9o3q/the_loneliest_parts_are_the_mental_battles/,,0,4,The Loneliest Parts are the Mental Battles.

Problem is, it is exhausting.

Genuinely curious about loneliness and why, how, people feel that way and what causes them to feel like that.

Here are a few questions:

1) Have your ever felt lonely/isolated in your life?
2) Have you ever felt isolated in your life despite having a social circle/friends?
3) Have you ever experienced difficulty in making friends in your life?

5554,xpn2vq,Skippynipperjr,"I'm 26 and I've never been in a relationship and honestly have never gone on a date. I get nervous when I think about dating as I tend to be rather naive and have been burned by other experiences where I've been taken advantage of and had my heart broken. I've tried online dating on and off for around 5 years with exactly 1 match during that time which never panned out. I just recently started asking people about first date ideas and then came to realize that my idea of a first date is a lot less than what my peers think which is disheartening.

At this point I want to just give up. It hurts to hope for a connection and just get disappointed every step of the way. I'm tired of seeing all my friends and family go on dates, get into relationships, get hookups, and now everyone seems to be getting married. And here I am still waiting to go on my first date. 

I don't have my own place either unfortunately, I've had to live with my parents due to some financial struggles in the past and even though I have a solid and stable job now I feel like I've missed out on the part of my life where I'm supposed to be figuring out how to date. I'm pretty much starting from scratch at 26 and it's the most daunting thing to think about. I worry that my mental health struggles are going to impact anything that may come of a connection I may find as well which only adds to the anxiety. 

I tend to be super shy around new people and getting over that first hurdle of trusting someone is a giant challenge. Most of my hobbies are things like ttrpgs and gaming so I don't have a ton of pictures of myself to put on dating profiles. I am considering just throwing in the towel and deleting all my dating apps so I can just stop thinking about it. But if I do that I'll pretty much just be talking to all my friends who either aren't interested in me whether it be their preferences on gender or they don't see me in that way. Or they're already in relationships and aren't in the market. Do I just give up? Do I keep trying and increase the loneliness factor when none of my efforts work? Am I doing something wrong? Am I just ugly? These are the questions I always have and I just don't know what to do anymore.

It’s really awkward being lonely around other people. Everyone around me has friends, even if they don’t hang out they have people to talk to. And I just go to my room and cry to nobody. Part of me wishes someone would barge in. 

I used to be at a point where I wished I had a stalker, just to prove to me that I am worth wanting to know. I know actually having a stalker would be terrifying and make me even more paranoid and anxious. But I liked the idea of someone wanting to know me that bad, reading my dumb posts on social media and whatever. Maybe more like an over obsessive friend, I’m always that friend.

Back in 2020, I happened to stumble upon this girl online unexpectedly. We met on a coding forum, and after talking for some time, she disclosed she never had a boyfriend or even a male friend! We really hit if off and we talked for many months. She was a devout Catholic girl who was raised in a strict, homeschooled family with 6 other younger siblings in rural Illinois.

After talking for so long, we discussed the potential of getting married. We talked about our honeymoon and how we would name and raise our kids. I was really hoping to marry her.

Sadly, when we met the first time in person, she rejected me. She later went on to meet another guy and marry him. He got to be her first everything! Her first love, her first kiss, her first real relationship, her first marriage, her first sex... I mean EVERYTHING!

I am still devastated and heartbroken till this day about it. Anything that reminds me of her brings me to my knees in sadness and disbelief.

The thing is, I want to find a woman just like her when we first met, one without a romantic past. One that has never had her first love or a boyfriend.

But now that I have to go back to work, a new job I started only a month ago, I feel trapped for the first time in my life because I'm stuck there for at least the next 8 years. I love the work but not the people. My birthday was last week and even though I'm still young I know what I really want to be in life and once more life taught me that I will never be it. 

I want to find love, travel, become a mum, adopt a couple of dogs, do stuff in my life but everything I do, I have to do alone and I'm so fed up with doing things on my own. I want someone in my life to experience things with, I want someone to message to just say hi to, tell about things,  I'm so touch starved I actually teared up when my only friend hugged me for my birthday last week. It messes my with my head and the move doesn't help there. At least as long the cows across the street don't learn to text or my cats learn to speak. 

When I asked my best friend to do stuff she told me that she rather spend the money on activites with her boyfriend ( I get it, they don't get out that much due to the increasing costs) and I'm happy that she spends time with me just talking and taking walks and stuff but I really want do ... something.

5586,xps4os,PhantomZone771,"I’ve always been introverted in some form. I never had the opportunity to go to many parties and my parents were somewhat strict when it came to where I could go and when. 

When I started university I had slightly more liberty because I could come up with an excuse but even so I was always worried that they would get angry. Whenever my friends talk about staying late or drinking I’m always hesitant because I know I’ll have to go home to my parents.

There was one party at the end of first year my friends convinced me to go to. There was alcohol but I avoided drinking because my parents were going to pick me up afterwards. I felt out of place at the party because I was sober and everyone else was drinking and I just kept hiding in different places I could find to avoid having to dance or anything. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of the social aspect of university unless I’m with friends in classes or we go out during the day. 

Sometimes I wish I would have moved out or I think about if I should look for places to move out. I didn’t this year because the cost of living crisis is serious and the arguments that would unfold from me saying I’m moving out would be frustrating.

5620,xpwqrx,jg2516,"I've been lonely for as long as I can remember. It's a part of me perhaps. It's my extra heart, it's what I breath out when I sleep by myself at night. I demand my loneliness, I crave it. To be individualistic, to do what the lonely do. 

I write this from a strange place I arrive at sometimes. I am never here for too long, but here I am deep in my thoughts, and here I begin to dig into my solitude. I ask the question, where is everyone? Why am I alone unlike the others? 

For the first time in my life, I am self supported. I have my own place, it's my own world, a creation utterly of my choosing. And yet, it has become a sarcophagus of a seemingly inherent solitude. Perhaps it is the solitude that is self sufficient. 

I wonder if others dig into their minds like this. I look to the stars, and wish someone would stand beside me, and hold my hand. To feel their warmth as we stare up into the void. I solely long for one thing.

I am a man now, to turn 25 at the turn of a Christmas I shall endeavour to avoid. My solitude mustn't be broken by the others. With each tick of the clock my loneliness flows like the grains of sand in an hourglass. It fills, and eventually, there is simply no more sand. There is no more solitude to give, for I am as alone as can be.

I don't wish to be sad. And usually, I am not. I enjoy the life I have created, often fallen into by coincidence. Each day passes and each day learn to smile at the others, and understand their warmth is indeed that, and not a false cold I often felt within my bones. I am alone, yes. But one day I won't be. 

Time is unkind. It is the unstoppable force we must contend with. We cannot win, only battle in an attritional war that will drain us of our strength, until the day our ticker stops ticking. Loss does not mean failure, and often it is the battling defeats that are remembered. 

When my heart stops, my life too will halt. And while my time may be short, or perhaps long, I know that it was not my loneliness that defined me. Because I will have waited patiently, as I must. I must try with what I have, and accept that some days I will lose. The digging into my mind will return too on days where my war is a struggle in all fields. 

I am alone, but it is not the end. 

The loneliness shall pass, as all things do.",2022-09-27 23:53:06,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579653454,10,/r/lonely/comments/xpwqrx/the_lonely_monologue/,,0,2,The lonely monologue

When I was 23 I met a girl online who was pretty similar to me, we did the whole LDR thing for about a year, and then moved in together for the next 4 years. She was basically my only friend, we talked constantly, but recently she cheated on me and dumped me.

I don't really miss her, she wasn't a very good person, but this loneliness is rough. Going from having someone who slept next to you every night, talked to you every day, and then suddenly all of that is gone and you're completely alone without any friends at all. I'm listening to ASMR roleplay videos and hugging a pillow just to fall asleep because the feeling of sleeping alone is so weird after all these years.

Co workers are a good place to start socialising, but what if i have a job that have no co workers ?

And my interests don't have clubs or places that have them, even gaming is a foreign concept here ..

5705,xq9dug,404errorabortmistake,"I’ve (26m) recently been through a painful breakup with an incredible woman (26f) who I cheated on. 

I have lost a lot - my relationship with her, some of my friends, and likely our flat that my partner and me rent together. We still talk and she says there’s a possibility we could get back together in the future, but for now she needs space and time to heal. 

I am responsible for my unfaithful behaviour. Over the last few months I have been working hard to establish the underlying issues I have that lead me to impulsivity. My behaviour was influenced by drugs &amp; alcohol and I’ve been through therapy to identify and resolve childhood trauma. It’s recently become apparent I may have BPD. I am having a triage call with community mental health professionals to establish a clearer diagnosis on Friday. I have since removed recreational drugs and alcohol from my life &amp; am 72 days sober. I’ve been on antidepressants for about 2 years now and have recently had my dosage upped to 125mg sertraline.

My old friends as well as my ex-partner are all mostly drinkers and drug-takers. Given my new sobriety and given also the recent losses I’ve experienced, I’m feeling incredibly lonely. Given how much alcohol is centred here in the UK as the main social activity, I’m finding it hard to find ways of establishing new relationships with people, men and women. I do play football (soccer) and have recently started volunteering at a homeless charity at the weekends so I don’t get tempted to drink, but the opportunities to make new likeminded friends around my age are still quite limited. 

I’m just feeling pretty stuck and stranded in life right now. In a kind of visceral purgatory where I am between my past and future selves, making changes I want to consolidate as permanent, yet having lost important relationships I value and wanted to carry into my future. Due to the changes I have made, I’m pessimistic about the opportunities I’ll have to actually meet new people, and am depressed about the likely longevity of this “purgatory” period.",2022-09-28 10:48:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1646848382,2,/r/lonely/comments/xq9dug/i_dont_know_how_to_make_new_friends/,,0,1,I don’t know how to make new friends

No contact with family in over 3 years

In contact with 1 of 2 siblings, sporadic at best

Only long term friend lost to s****de a year ago

My coworkers don't like working with me a lot of the time (been given this feedback)

My partner of 8 years just left me, she's always getting crushes on other men before realizing it's nothing and coming back. She came home with another guy's hoodie the day after she dumped me. 

The 4 days leading up to it a childhood friend came to visit, she disappeared with them (who I guess told her he specifically did not want to see me), came back when he left, dumped me, and left for another friend's house.

The friend is the boyfriend of our roommate who both always invited her over without me, in front of me.

My - well she's an ex now I guess - and the roommate just whisper and shit around me. Last night they had a sleepover in my old bed, I've been in the living room or in my car.

I have nobody that I'm close enough to to even tell. I had one boss a few months ago who told me he cared for me but when asking about my problems/life, would tell me ""self pity will get you nowhere.""

I have 2 jobs, both bosses are leaving, one already has. 
One seemed to actually care about me which was nice but that's gone now and I only ever saw them like 4 hours a week.

I'm to the point where I feel like the only person in my life is my therapist and that's only because I pay them to be in it. I can't even get here either cause I flaked and let my medical benefits lapse.

I'm dysthymic, high functioning ASD, anxious af, and least helpful for friend making-schizoid (NOT the same as schizophrenic). 

Idk if there is something truly wrong with me but I keep coming to the conclusion that there must be if I'm the common denominator in all of this. I guess I just wasn't born with social skills and I have to make a conscious effort to do good. I just wish the people who were born with these natural social abilities realized it's not like that for everyone and went a little easier.

So sorry you had to sit through all that but good job for enduring. Like I said, I have nobody to talk to so I just started typing.

Looking for people to talk to, be over 18

Seriously getting tired of the same old thing. Not trying to be an ass or sound like I’m complaining just being blunt. There’s bots, ghosts, people promoting themselves, it’s honestly exhausting. Not really into talking to talking to people who are in relationships either that usually goes one of two ways and I’d just rather avoid it. I’m really into horror movies, Pokémon, and virtual pets like tamagotchi, so if you like one of those I’ll probably nerd out. I have a switch and ps4 totally down to play some monster hunter or the Snes classic games together or smash bros or whatever. Also I’ve been playing Legends Arceus a lot so if you wanna talk about how god damn annoying paras is I’m down. When I do find someone interesting they talk nonstop then slowly “get busy” like I understand if you’re honestly busy I’m usually honestly busy, I recently bought a house and work 80 hours to do this so I get that, but I’m feeling it’s an excuse. I’m not interested in text tag every 7 hours, I’m starting to feel jaded and like I’m just ranting. Regardless, I’m down to try to build real bonds, I’ll talk about just about anything, we can watch dumb horror movies and talk about how stupid it is or watch crazy documentaries and so the same. We can be flirty, talk about crazy stuff, do whatever I don’t really care as long as it’s interesting. I just want someone honest and real.

me ""it was good, just reading now, what did you do""

5759,xqkr6f,ExiledxxHH,"So, I stumbled upon this subreddit from pure guessing and need a place to kinda put thoughts on paper...well....somewhere...  


Most day's I feel lonely...I don't feel like I have ""friends"" or really someone to call a ""friend"". I feel almost as if I wake up, go to work, do what needs to be done each day and wake up with the same recycled process and feel as if its out of body. I always feel when I make the tinest mistake with these ""friends"" that the friendship is ruined and its unable to be recovered and that I'm ostrachzied from the group after said mistake. I almost feel forced to participate in conversations just so, I can feel some engagement. 

(I do want to say I've felt like this before the world went on lockdown, this isn't something that's emerged and reared its ugly head over the past few years. )  


No matter who I'm around Family, Wife, the ""friends"", Coworkers. I feel this emptiness and lonliness almost like I'm walking around in someone else's body at times. The worse part is its gotten worse as I've grown up. I've tried expressing my emotions via free form poetry to get those emotions and feelings out, lightly talking to my wife about it. Even then it feels like I've got this emptiness that feels like I'm just living something that shouldn't be. Almost like this isn't worth being here.......I know that sounds dark but its true....Somedays I feel maybe this loneliness has spun into dark thoughts or the dark thoughts have spun into a web of loneliness.....maybe I'm to blame for never talking to anyone about this......Maybe I'm just looking for some type of answers of why or what has drove these thoughts. Deeper into my thought process, who knows......

On a related note, I wish there were a reasonable way to anonymously send flowers to a stranger on the internet.

Yeah, well I never got to enjoy or have ""fun"" when I was younger. Most of my early 20s were spent either living in a depressed state (never diagnosed with clinical depression), drunk or in a state of regret or what if. Now, were some of those things in my control? Absolutely. Nobody asked me to start drinking...but at that time it gave me comfort especially when I felt all alone on a campus which seemingly seemed filled with couples who used to walk to class, lunch or just around the student center. I missed out on so much. Especially dating... Why? It all seemed so simple and understanding. Neither of us have too much money or achieved anything major. So we could just be normal, and hangout. It wasn't status or money based (to an extent).   


Now? The goalposts have shifted so much. I am 26, never been on a date, never had a ""first"" anything...and everybody today seems to be in a rush. Hustle, buy, spend, invest, travel, start a family, then hustle again, get promoted...

I didn't get to enjoy the simple nature of youth. The part where it was easy to date, and meet people. Now not only do I have the added burden of making something of my life...I also get to do it without having experienced any semblance of romance or dating experience. Also, some of you might say ""well sex isn't necessary to feel happy""... okay well, i don't know if it is to me or not. I never got to experience it. So it is something I want in life.   


I am tired of the awkward moments grabbing a beer with coworkers and them sharing all the stuff they did or past stories...and me having to put a façade or make something up, and shift the conversation back onto them so that my lies don't get found out.   


The expectation is that you ""get the partying"" out of your system, but I never got to live through it...and now a big part of me wants to. I want the random hookups at bars, at a club or just making out in the parking lot of movie theaters. Everything people in my generation got to experience...just to know what it all feels like. 

But I can't anymore. The world has moved past me. People these days don't even want to be with someone who has never dated. They see it as a red flag. I don't blame them. But i can't get any experience if that keeps on. It's like catch 22 or something.",2022-09-28 21:48:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660941486,9,/r/lonely/comments/xqphfk/the_expectation_of_getting_it_out_of_your_system/,,0,2,"The expectation of ""getting it out of your system"""

Apologies in advance if I ramble. I (F,19) am in my first year of college and am incredibly lonely and depressed. Nothing is going how I thought it would. Classes are incredibly draining and taxing on my mental health, my roommates have been just terrible and inconsiderate to me disrespecting me at every turn, and I feel as if I have no real friends or anyone to turn to. It’s pathetic even writing this but in the dorm showers this morning I cried for a few hours and just held myself because I am so touch starved and lonely. I am so stupid as to think college would be better. “It’s the prime of your life!” everyone says but that’s exactly what people say about high-school and it was genuinely the worst four years of my life. I can’t do this shit again. My heart hurts I am just so lonely and I feel like I have nothing and no one. I have always been there for everyone else and always try to make people laugh, smile, and feel so special, cared about, and loved. But when I need anything I am always forced to deal with it alone and it is the most souls crushing feeling you could ever experience. I just don’t even feel like a real person anymore. My depression, anxiety, and mental health in general have gone down the drain despite all my best efforts and it just feels so pointless to keep trying to “get better”. Life doesn’t even feel worth it anymore. I try so hard to keep my mental health in a good place and it just breaks my heart to feel like I have to start from square one over and over again. I am surrounded by all these smart college people and just feel so incredibly stupid and incompetent. It doesn’t even seem to be worth trying anymore because I will never be as intelligent or talented. God, I am so tired of crying myself to sleep every night in my shitty bunk bed that I share with my awful roommate and I just want to go home and say I failed and I’m just worthless. I feel like such a freak here and feel as if I will never fit in because there is something fundamentally wrong with me.

To preface, it should be known that I have friends, I think. I have floormates I talk to regularly, I have people who I see and say hi to, but... Part of me feels like I'm missing out on a very, very big part of the college experience, and it makes me feel empty.

I've found myself, more often than not, dreading my free time I have. For example, this upcoming Saturday, I have nothing all that exciting planned, and it terrifies me to think that I will have to go a full 24 hours without having anything new or exciting to do. I genuinely don't look forward to the weekend because I feel like it's a time that is supposed to be spent with friends or family, but... That just does not happen. I spend so much time alone in my dorm, and it makes me feel like shit.

I have been forcing myself to go out and do extracurriculars such as clubs and campus involvement, and a lot of said extracurriculars have been beneficial to my personal values, but not all that great for making connections. I find it so, so hard to believe that anyone would make time to hang out with me. I feel my time is worth less than the time of others, so time spent hanging out with me is time wasted for other people.

I find myself literally looking forward to the small events that do happen on a weekly basis. When I'm at work or in class, I'm doing SOMETHING. I'm not just in my dorm alone. On the off chance I'm meeting a friend for lunch, I find myself looking forward to it as my event for the week, because it means I won't have to eat lunch alone.

I just feel like there's an extraordinarily heavy emphasis on making connections at university, and it's not happening for me. Am I putting too much pressure on myself? I go to sleep not looking forward to the next morning if the next day is a day off from obligations.

Last year however it was kinda ok I still saw them pretty frequently so me not having any close friends at collage never rlly got to me that much. However this year for some reason everyone has been extremely busy whether that’s with work, school or relationships. I really get to interact with a few of them once a week or some I haven’t seen in months. 
 Normally I just work harder on my assignments but it still gets a little lonely, especially seeing other friend groups doing stuff together. I know this is kinda on my to be honest. I should have made more of an effort to make friends and build on said friendships but it’s kinda easier to say that then actually do it. I’ll probably get over it but rn it feels really bad.

I'm (29f) not really sure where to start. A few things have just got to me recently. 

Firstly me and my partner are close to buying our first home together in a couple weeks which should a really positive thing, and I was excited but I'm just overwhelmed about how much there will be to do and remember (finances, admin, packing, nevermind decorating) but at the same time waiting in limbo for things to happen. Also as you'll read below, I'm physically limited in how I can help. It's a cute two bed house about 8 miles away from the city we live now.

Secondly, my mom (65f) who lives a 100 miles away, has confided she feels quite unwell and has found a lump, she has scans and tests next week and I'm just so worried about the outcome, she always doesn't want ne visiting her as she's so fatigued though we talk every other day. She's a smoker and not as fit as she used to be. I'm an only child with a emotionally-stunted dad and no other close family, so it's quite isolating. Buying a home far away from her feels like it's a betrayal even thought she's super excited for me and know me and my partner live in the city for our jobs. 

Thirdly, I recently broke my left wrist (in a misguided attempt to learn to rollerskate). The wrist break is just one of those things tbh, I have a very supportive partner helping me with stuff. Fingers crossed I might not need surgery but we'll see. The chaos of the NHS I've experienced makes me nervous for my mum. The need to rest and not use my arm means I just have a very overactive mind with nothing to distract me. 

Lastly, even before breaking my wrist I was feeling very low and detached. I'm not as invested in things I normally enjoyed, like art or reading and I've noticed I'm doing lots of online shopping, which is definitely just me chasing a dopamine rush, rather than a desperate need for a dress. Having less mobility has really emphasised this. 

The majority of my good friends live elsewhere now and I've gone from having a super busy social life pre covid to barely seeing people as everyone is doing their own lives. I have a job which on paper is a dream job, with a fantastic employer, good colleagues, and a lot of variety but I just feel like I'm putting my head above water to interact and be normal. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for really. I've been up half the night and tried to ring Samaritans but no one picked up.",2022-09-29 05:28:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,1632141061,1,/r/lonely/comments/xqzbc3/feeling_overwhelmed_low_and_alone/,,0,0,"Feeling overwhelmed, low and alone"

i had a crush on him for about a year. he just made it so easy to like him. he made it so easy to love him.

i tried to get rid of my feelings for him because he would talk about how he wanted a lot of kids. that’s when i kinda knew that we’d never work, because i medically can’t have them and don’t want them, but honestly? for him? i thought about it. i daydreamed about us a lot. and i didn’t hate the idea of having kids with him.

i can tell this dude literally anything. from my useless facts, how my day went, the trauma caused by my mom, what i ate, and he just listens. i could send him 10 different texts about 10 different topics and he would address them separately and ask me questions about them. he forgets a bunch of stuff, but he remembers the smallest things i’ve told him. he remembers the day we met. november 10th, 2020.

10 minutes ago, he sent me a video of the sky. it was at night and i could barely see anything, but he said, “you know what, i’m gonna save that star. you see that star right there? if you’re ever feeling lonely, i am right there on top of that star, okay? that’s our star.”

i don’t know what love feels like as i didn’t grow up in a happy home, but i feel it when i’m with him. and i felt it when he sent that video. as i went through our friendship in my mind, i think i’ve always been in love with him, but i didn’t want to face that fact, so i wrote it off as a crush that lasted for 2 years. 

he told me he loves me, as a friend. i know that’s all we’ll ever be, because i’m not her. 

he looks at her the way i look at him. and she’s so lucky. 

he talks about their future the way i imagined my future with him. 

i always hoped and prayed that i’d meet my soulmate. that they’d be out there somewhere, and i did meet him. i believe we are soulmates, but platonically. even if this isn’t the way i want it to be, i’m just happy to have him in my life somehow. 

my heart does hurt, but i can’t say i’m surprised. this is how everything ends for me. in heartbreak.

5897,xr2hfk,SergTheSerious,"And perhaps that amount of work which is required to improve one's social life is what makes people like us back in revulsion, because it wouldn't seem fair or authentic to have to change our personalities to make ourselves more universally approachable.  People who ""glow up"" or bring out the ""best version of themselves"" may have sincerely done it to feel more comfortable in their own skin, but the truth is they also probably changed themselves in a culturally appropriated context so that they could feel more accepted among a greater majority of others, in a way which cannot measure the true characters inside of them.  This majority, while not all necessary for cultivating relationships, certainly opens more doors to find quality people.  And what makes it feel more disheartening is the way some people act to try to please others with tryhard jokes and dynamic personality traits, which is done in a way where you can tell they are trying to fake it and comes off as sad, simply because they feel the need to change what and how they approach subject matters to make themselves more appealing.

I'm inching towards my 21st birthday, friendless, jobless, relationshipless, with only my youth and health to cherish before it slowly slips away.  I feel quite lucid, but I suppose lucidity is in the eyes of the beholder.  I know I have work to do, and there is almost always a way when there is a will, but I can't help but feel so isolated from others in my college and feel like there's a certain magic I can't harness, which causes people to avoid any kind of small talk with me, even after I try to introduce myself.  It's come to the point where I feel disillusioned about society's intentions in general because we all tend to fall to the fate of social validation, and it just makes everything feel so fake.  I know it's a misdirected sentiment, but I DO NOT want to feel the need to rewire my brain to get people to like me, either.

The fact is, I don't even like socializing with people in the first place.  It's just the way everything else in life feels so dull and boring that there isn't anything else to fill the void.  Like I've become a subject of nature's own device in the way it wants me to bond with others.  Some other lonely people may feel strong enough to stay alone their whole lives, but for me, it just all feels so boring and depressing.

5899,xr2kq2,tough_luck99,"Hi all,

I hope you're all doing well despite our predicaments. I just wanted to vent today and talk about a recent experience. So I recently broke up with someone around two to three months ago and it's been tough. I lost a lot of self confidence in myself and I have been trying to move on since. I've mostly just been working, studying and going to the occasional party every few weeks or playing chess for a couple of hours (or more lol). However, it has been quite dull and I haven't really met anyone again until recently when I decided to enter into one of those university competitions (I won't explicitly say what it was but it had something to do with politics and diplomacy). I met someone in my group who was cute and interesting, and I think she thought I was the same as well (she did call me cute once during those two days).

We were hitting it off, at least I thought, and then we had a drinks with everyone to celebrate the competition, and I had a few of my friends there. Unfortunately, one of my more attractive friends ended up talking to her and she seemed to be more interested in talking to him than me. Nothing against my friend, he didn't do anything wrong. I ended up getting a bit drunk and just going back home to hang out with my roommate to reflect on the night. All I could think about was how much I hate myself and wish I was just a little bit taller and had a more symmetrical/attractive face. I started crying at night and felt like the whole few days experience was ruined, I just wish I was even slightly desirable.

Anyhow, she ended up messaging me the next day talking about how she enjoyed spending time with me and asked me some other things. I thought maybe this might mean something? However, I decided to protect myself and take four to five hours to reply to every message alongside giving very short replies. I feel horrible now, I feel so much regret but I am so scared to open myself up again. I don't know what to do, I thought we got along so well and maybe I was overthinking the whole thing between her and my friend? I just don't want to be someone's second choice and I don't want to feel less inferior over things I cannot control. I'm so sick of being hurt by people when it comes to dating, I am just so sick of rejection and I feel like I possibly stopped something that could have been good out of fear of being rejected.

That's all I have to say. ",2022-09-29 08:50:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1664440566,1,/r/lonely/comments/xr2kq2/i_met_someone_the_other_day_vent/,,0,1,I met someone the other day.. [VENT]

I’m 19M and recently moved to a city, having had an extroverted nature in the past that I can now recognise as drug use, I’ve struggled to form valuable connections. 

I crave friendships that have a deep connection and deep conversation, where we teach one another, we talk about our experiences. It seems like here in Australia, it’s all very much small talk. I’m interested in philosophy, how the human brain works but also other subjects like business, politics and human rights. 

I’ve tried to make irl friends and I suppose some online, but I don’t know where to go to build those relationships. I’m slowly accepting the fact that I may be alone mostly (I have a beautiful girlfriend who I have been with for nearly three years who is amazing and deep). 

Don’t get me wrong, I can do small talk, I’m quite a good talker, I just miss making friends where it’s an instant connection, much like a twin flame if you will.

I wasn't sure if it was actually interest or just friends until we both admitted being attracted to each other and one night she even sent risque photos.
Needless to say we type almost whole ass short stories when we talk and it's been amazing. The last few days she told me ahead of time she'd be pretty busy with work and she'll say she's gonna message me in the morning but each time it was way later in the day and she'd tell me we'll talk the next morning instead because she's exhausted.

Sure I have a few friends, had a few relationships but at the end of it all, I still felt lonely. It’s as if no one ever TRULY saw me. No one ever truly tried. As I get older, I feel that my chances of feeling any of these just once is slipping away. What have I done to deserve this fate? I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

5928,xr9s5k,PsalmoftheSad,"The way dreams used to be for me were times of reprieve from the numbing loneliness of this life. Last night begged to differ, though

My dreams used to be teasing me of a life I can't have.. Where I'd be going on dates with a girl that's genuinely interested in me and vice-versa. Nowadays they've taken a hard left into a more realistic aspect.


Last night I had a dream I was taking a girl with me to a party. We were both in my car and had to stomp on the brakes hard because this guy in front of us had a bad case of road rage. Either way, dude gets out of his car with a big ass bowie knife and I get out of mine with my concealed carry pistol. I yell something to the effect of ""Get the fuck back in your car"" but it eventually resulted in me having to shoot the guy. 


I sat down on a bench with my date and wrapped my arm around her to comfort her. Another guy walked up on us to make sure we were both okay, and when my date saw the other dude she immediately pushed me off the bench to make room for him




Sure people will say shit like ""Oh it's just a dream don't worry about it,"" but I can 1000% see this happening in real life. This is the kind of hand I'm dealt. Matter of fact I just had to cut someone out of my life a few weeks back because she decided I wasn't good enough to be in her life anymore. These are just the kinds of women I attract, I guess.

5933,xrbvsr,throwawayx12d4,"I'm 26M and really lonely and frustrated.

Throughout my life I've struggled with mental health and feel like I've missed out on a lot of life. I lost most of my friends towards the end of college partially because I was suicidal and the friend I asked help from thought I was doing it for attention. At the time, I wasn't willing/comfortable enough to go to therapy (ironically, therapy hasn't helped much when I did go). Those friendships ended when we a group of us talked about doing something pretty significant together, and they ended up intentional excluding me from it. And when I called them out on this they got angry that I ""yelled"" at them and ""demeaned"" them. The sad thing is, I still get a little jealous when one of the friends I still talk to says that they are going on trips together. Not because he's going on these trips with them, but because I feel like I will never have a group to go with on these types of trips. 

I've never been able to get myself to date because of this mental health issues and the feeling I would be toxic to whomever I date. And when I was also finally getting to the point to starting to go out and meet people for potential friends/significant others, I had a massive fight with my dad where he said I'm like my moms family and I hate people, I'm a pussy for not being able to face him and just get over it, a dumbass whenever I don't listen to his advice/don't agree with him among other things. And I went back to my previous lonely behavior, inability to speak up, and my extreme feelings of jealousy whenever a coworker or friend talks about their friends or family or significant others.

And at the end of the day the one thing I want most is companionship and feeling like I belong. But, instead I feel like it'd be better if I just disappeared and started a new life and maybe my pain would go away since I would never have to hear about people who are part of my pain.",2022-09-29 16:14:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1655000122,23,/r/lonely/comments/xrbvsr/i_feel_empty_lonely_and_hate_being_alive/,,0,7,"I feel empty, lonely, and hate being alive"

I don't have friends hard to connect with decent normal people and I have a hard time maintaining relationships at all.

5969,xrijsd,BurntBananaPeel97,"2 days ago, I was in my corner minding my own business, eating lunch, when two girls walked up to me.
They had beautiful outfits and compared to them I look like chicken scraps. 
One of them examines me up, down, side to side. 
""I can't tell if they're a boy or a girl,"" one says. 

The other one thinks and says""Whatever they are, they're ugly anyway. We can't ask them to be in the video.""

It crushed my heart. I just wanted to be to myself. My one friend I have wasn't there that day. 
She said I don't look ugly. But it's really throwing me off the rails about what those girls said.

Edit:fixed typos.

Edit 2: I'm really thankful for all the kind words and advice you've all given me. I'm really grateful. I'm going to work to better myself",2022-09-29 20:46:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1660675686,263,/r/lonely/comments/xrijsd/i_just_feel_ugly/,,0,89,I just feel ugly

5973,xrix3i,dead_banshee,"I spent my entire life feeling extremely lonely. Im married and have kids but the loneliness I feel is different. I feel like I’m just here and everyone’s life is buzzing around me. When I find something funny or want to discuss a new movie, I have no one. No one enjoys the things I do or gets as deep into the subjects as I do. I get extremely hyperfixated on my hobbies and interests. It’s not for trying either, I reach out to people, I try to engage. It’s always met with people making me feel quite dumb, to be honest. It’s dismissive. I used to really go out of my way to connect with people. Even learning about their interests just to try to connect. But nothing is there because i can tell I’m just reaching for the connecting, not genuinely enjoying the subject. 

My husband is opposite of me and also very dismissive. Which is fine because he’s not very interesting anyhow when it comes to interest sharing. We do life great together and we enjoy each others company but let’s be honest… he doesn’t actually like any of my interests so it’s not very fulfilling to talk to him all the time.

I find so much frustration in this. I have SO much to share. I’m an artist, a horror movie and cult classic buff, I love talking and acting in different personas of my favorite shows and movies. I absolutely love rewatching the same movie over and over. 

I KNOW there has to be other people out there like me. Sometimes I just feel devastated that I’ll spend my life in a lonely shadow. 

Recently I’ve started feeling comfort with the amount of time I spend alone. While I talk to my kids and husband, it’s not always fulfilling because it’s mostly filling their needs.

Anyone else live in this cycle?",2022-09-29 21:02:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1586645010,3,/r/lonely/comments/xrix3i/starting_to_find_comfort_in_the_loneliness/,,0,0,Starting to find comfort in the loneliness

Once a week is a hard limit for me—I'd go bankrupt if I increased the frequency of my visits, but I need to complain just about every day.

The suicide hotline, the Trevor Project hotline, and my state's local crisis line are all effectively operated by AI's. The people there read from scripts and give what are effectively pre-recorded answers to everything you say. It isn't a safe place to talk and complain, because the people there are absolutely not listening.

My family and friends don't want to hear my complaints anymore. An entire server full of people on Discord banned me for ranting and complaining too much. I've been trying to stay silent for the past two weeks, and it is killing me.

5996,xrm3h5,riotgrrrlsummer,"What's your experience with trying to meet new people while going through depression or other mental health issues?

I've been living with depression for quite a while, I'm going to start medication soon, as it's no longer possible to ignore or bottle up (my bad I tried doing this for too long). I've no close friends who could support me. I mean, I have people around me, and even have a partner (we're poly) but it happens so the closest people in my life are going through their own tough times and their capacities are very, very limited, at best (in worst cases, some of them are just being unbearably toxic, which is just very harmful to my mental health). I can still do the basic things (I'm jobless now, on top of it all – so it's only the house chores), and have no problem going out (although it's becoming increasingly harder these days). And I've noticed that wherever I leave the house to, say, take a walk on my own, I feel a bit better, if only for a while.

And I do also feel the need to meet new people and spend time with someone like-minded. 
I'm non-binary (but kind of masculine looking – at least to some, lol), in my early thirties. Mostly prefer dating queer men or other non-binary people.

I don't have enough energy now to go to places and meet new people there, so I've been using Tinder and other dating apps. But I haven't found much luck there. I'm not into one night stands (and it seems to be a self-destructive thing to do when you feel so alone – at least it's been that for me), I'd really love to have something meaningful. 

Well, some people seem to flinch after reading/hearing that I'm poly – although it's okay, I'm used to it. What doesn't feel okay is that there are also many people who seem to be simply turned off by the ""dark energy"" I ooze (I was once even told about it directly, lol). 

I can't pretend to be any happier than I am now when I'm having a date. Although I totally understand  that a mere site of a person going through dark times in their life can be a bit too much. Sometimes it feels like I have some infectious disease and everyone is afraid to get too close to me. And on the other hand, as I feel so vulnerable now, it takes more time that usual for me to simply 

I know I'll get better sooner or later. And I understand that it's very naive and selfish to think that meeting someone new would help me solve my problems. But I believe it could help to brighten up my dark days. (Plus I don't think I'm such a bad companion even now – I haven't lost my ability to listen, my empathy, and my sense of humor, after all.) Otherwise I'm afraid I'll be feeling even more isolated. :(

6025,xrpvxy,Alive_Ad4988,"I previously moved out on my own. I have a very kind roommate but I still feel so lonely. I am mad at my parents so my relationship with them has weakened. My siblings either have their own life going on or other things which makes it hard for me to build a new type of connection with them. I grew up in a family where pain and grief wasnt discussed other than my mom's issues so I have a lot of unresolved trauma. Talking about things that hurt me as a kid sound silly so I can't tell people I know without thinking it'd sound stupid. I only talk about factual things with people but I barely call someone when I'm feeling down. The times I've been vulnerable with someone or teared up next to someone is rare. A few people. I always cry on myself and get back up. I pity myself sometimes or sometimes I face whatever it is. 

And on top of it there was a guy that rejected me. He randomly shows up in my life and makes me excited then pulls back. Leaving me in a loop of emotions of excitement/dissapointment/resentment/hopefulness. I just can't say no to him when he wants me. But it's always hot and cold. Or he is dating someone else. I know he will never choose me. And I remember all the times I wasn't chosen. And I question if I even choose myself. 

I am so hard on myself sometimes. I have a big ego which makes it hard for me to connect with people. I forgive people when they hurt me but at their smallest comment that effects my ego I am eager to cut them off.

6026,xrq9vf,Jazzlike-Fox7525,"Ive had a few shots and this is gonna come out now cause it just fucking needed to and the internet may judge me but at least here the opinions won't matter.

I've been thinking a bout ending it for a while now but with no painless or particularly clean way to kill myself i haven't done it yet. Last time i tried started cutting myself but it was too painful and i stopped before i could do any real damage and i quit like a fucking pussy.

Ive been thinking about it every day for months now knowing that i don't have the actual courage to do anything. I have a few short term goals to help pull me back into reality but what happens when they're gone. What happens after i buy new stuff for my room, when i build my dream home when i buy my dream car. Ill be alone with no one to share it with, it will matter to me but then it'll be worthless cause i matter to no one. 

I have a mom and a dad that are involved in my life but to my dad i'm a responsibility forced on him by a shitty ex and to my mom im just a reflection of her, an investment and a testimony to her 'benevolent' existence (should have just aborted me like the first two and saved both me and my dad the trouble). Neither of them took it well when i said i don't believe in God or that i don't want to go to church. To her i was the same as some hedonistic devil worshiper and to him i was just an attention seeking embarrassment. So coming out the closet definitely isn't an option. 

 I went back to college to take only one course, thinking that after a year working from home almost never leaving my room the clean air and social interaction would help. Yeah i was so fucking wrong i made a right turn in Satan's anus. I have to take the day classes so im stuck having to deal with a bunch of teenage asshats and worse yet it's an agriculture course with a particle. So every week for the next 8 weeks i have to do manual labor with a bunch of prep age chickenshits who giggle at everything whilst still some how being more judgey than Judy. 

Tonight i had planned on getting drunk enough to numb the pain of slitting my wrists hence the shots but I have a friends birthday to celebrate on Saturday and they're the only thing keeping me going right now. I even said to leave my most valuable possessions to them in my final letter to the world, a $4000 gaming set up and a small gas station knife collection (they deserve much better though).

How ever she still has her own life to live and i have stuff to buy for my room, a house to build and a car to buy. I have a parents to endure (being a parasite to) peers to be alienated by, crushes to be rejected by or never talk to out of fear of rejection. So ill keep delaying the inevitable or maybe in the next two or three shots a TF-981 will find itself gliding through my fore-arms but i really hope i don't see tomorrow.",2022-09-30 02:47:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600300590,2,/r/lonely/comments/xrq9vf/shot_and_dreading_tomorrow/,,0,2,Shot and Dreading Tomorrow

6037,xrrkqe,joustingatwindmills,"TW: substance abuse

I very rarely feel lonely; I'm an introvert, I'm low energy, and I get a fair amount of social interaction at work.

But when I do find myself feeling lonely, maybe a couple times a year? It's absolutely retched. At first I don't realize what's going on, I just have this subtle feeling like something isn't right. I feel unsettled doing the things that I normally enjoy. I feel vaguely anxious doing the things that I normally do to relax. Am I tired? Hungry maybe? Something is off. Maybe it's the lighting in my house.

Then I start thinking I need to do something to deal with these feelings even though I don't know why I'm feeling them. Sometimes my first thought is to drink, because that will relax my body, give me energy, and make me feel less anxious right? But I can't drink because I'm an alcoholic. I just straight up am incapable of moderation. Okay the tape through, it always ends badly and makes me feel like crap in the end. So I scratch that idea.

Then I think, that's weird, I've been sober for a while, why am I suddenly wanting to drink when it hardly ever crosses my mind? Then I text some people I haven't heard from in a while, and others I have heard from recently. Why am I suddenly reaching out to other people when normally I'm totally great on my own...

Oh. I'm lonely. Shit. That means I'm at the mercy of how other people respond to my attempts to connect. Fuck. Why does everyone live so far away. There's really only like two people I could hang out with without feeling drained from the interactions. The family I still talk to is halfway across the globe and my close friends are all hours away in different states. God how long has it been since I've made a new, real friend?

So I'm sitting here on the couch with my thoughts feeling squirrelly. The tip of my tongue is pushing itself into the roof of my mouth behind my teeth. My shoulders are tensed up, my hips are tilted forward. My calves are clenched for goodness sake. I try to relax all those parts but the second I try to turn my attention away from my body it tenses right back up again.

So I'm lonely, and on top of that I'm anxious and tense. And because it's almost midnight on a weekday and I don't have that one close relationship person to connect with I just have to... wait it out and hope it resolves on its own. Maybe take a Xanax. And sit with it until the feeling passes. Try to distract myself, but I'm tunnel-visioned on this right now. 

I hate this. I don't feel right. Please tell me I'm okay and I'm not alone.",2022-09-30 03:55:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1540749496,2,/r/lonely/comments/xrrkqe/im_very_rarely_lonely/,,0,10,I'm very rarely lonely

Yeah I’ll be straight forward, I’m in love with my best friend and she knows we talked about it. I got diagnosed with herpes and I just lost it I was about to hurt myself but all I could think was I need to say “good bye” and I did, I called her told her what I was gonna do and that I loved her very much. She didn’t want to let me go do that so I cried as I told her how I felt about myself and that I thought this would be the best time ti just end it
But she talked me out of it. I just really needed her and we’re talking again after half a year I cut her out because she did more harm than good to me but I don’t care I clicked with her, we spent everyday with each other for 2 years after that. we’d fight sometimes but we’d always go back and tell each other how much we missed each other. A day later after we’re starting talking again I tell her how I felt about because someone else told her everything I said about her, the good and bad so I told her how I feel and everything was great we text each other we call each other every morning but at the end of the day sometimes she won’t reply and apologize for not texting back. We live far from each other( she’s in another state) and she dates women only she tells me and like if I don’t reply she’ll get upset and say something along the lines like “ why am I like this” I’ll be honest when she does something that upsets me or I find something suspicious. I don’t get along with her friends much ( always guys) and the same with them but I tell her how I feel and she knows that I’m in love with her and we tell each other we’re each other’s best friends and I do feel like she is my best friend but sometimes I feel like she texts me when she feels like it ( could be 5 minutes or hours) but if I don’t reply like that it’s a problem and I just cave when she’s upset I want to and have to make it better cuz I just don’t want her upset with me and sometimes I feel she feels the same like she doesn’t want me to be upset at her. 

So tonight she hasn’t replied so I text her “good night I love you” and we’ll I’m upset she hasn’t replied and I don’t have it in me to tell her next time we talk that I don’t like it when she does that because I feel like she does more for her other friends that live closer to her. People that hang out with her go out to places and smoke weed together ( the things we use to do everyday) and it hurts me. It hurts she’s not mine and every other girl I’ve tried to talk to and build a friendship like that with someone else but I can’t

6071,xrwgwt,auntLIITTiya,"I (32f) used to be the life of the party w my girlfriends. I came from a big group of friends for 10 years but many of them got married and only now hang out w other married friends

I started becoming closer to a smaller group of girls who am I loved hanging out with. I introduced them to one of my guy friends that was in my bigger group. They all live next to each other and started quickly hanging out with each other without me. I tried to not let it get to me, but I did.

Soon I found that they were hanging out with me less and less and I was feeling the distance. Long story short I found out that the guy friend that was my best friend had started talking negatively about me to those girls.

Does girls who I’ve been friends with for years and have never had a problem with me all of a sudden now it was parroting what he was saying. (he later in the day to me that he was talking poorly about me and that he apologized for being a bad friend, but by that point it was too late. He also has never really made it up to me and just continued to grow distant) 

It’s been almost a year and I miss them. I was at a guy I like friends house the other day and one of the guys that lived there asked if I had any girlfriends I could invite over to the house, I got really sad. I didn’t. I don’t. I just really feel even more like a loser and alone. 

I went from having an abundance of friends to have any nothing in such a short amount of time I don’t even know how it happened honestly. I feel I can’t go anywhere because I can’t secure a girls to come with me. And I don’t want to be a solo girl going out by herself. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m not useful because I can’t bring girls, I do have guy friends but guys that I like their friends don’t want to hang out with them. 

I’m stupid. I’m worthless. I’m a fraud. And I feel this is making me having a harder time connecting with people than I once have.

I second-guess everything that I do and say in fear that it’ll cause someone to talk shit about me again. I have PTSD about it. I’m over thinking constantly about how I’m coming off and what I’m doing and what I’m saying and how that could trigger someone to spoil the well Like how my friend did with my other girlfriends which I never realized could be so easy to do.

But I lost that *ability,* I literally forgot what I desire because I haven't felt something similar for a long time. I had crushes, but even then it was hard to imagine because my mind couldn't comprehend the idea that my crush may be interested in me, or even end up in a relationship with me.

I can't even imagine something along these lines when I get a *blueprint* into my sight. It doesn't matter if it's a romantic song, a romantic movie, or a video game with romance. I even tried my hands on a so-called dating sim and stopped playing it because my mind screamed *as if that will happen.* 

I hope that nobody else has to go through something like this. It was borderline *okay* to feel lonely as long as I could escape into imagination.

6106,xs3htj,rootnaut17,"I mean I sort of don't. I want to be unnoticed. Or, mostly at least. I want to be noticed by some people, and unacknowledged by others. 
The problem is that there is no reason for anyone to notice me. I am totally uninteresting, unattractive, humourless, and sad. 
So, the only way I feel like I can be noticed is by negative things, and in reality I'm understanding it's been like this for maybe most of my life- certainly most of what I can remember. 
But like this is not good, because you're just preying on people's morality, and probably a lot of the time they can see through it anyway.
It would be nice to talk to someone, for someone to ask me genuinely, with sincerity, if I'm OK. But, no one cares if I'm OK, and I can't blame them, because I don't either. The only way I feel it's acceptable for me to talk to someone is if I pay them for it, but no one's really selling ""chats"" and I can't take it anymore to keep thinking that I can be helped. I tried that recently and now I'm worse than ever.
I have a job I enjoy, I'm doing almost what I always wanted to do, but when I was younger I neglected to think that I might want someone to be there for me to share it with, and vice versa. Now I'm 23, and relationships are out of reach and friendships can no longer be made.
The pain of being entirely isolated is matched by the pain of knowing that this reality cannot be changed. Together they will kill me, eventually. My hope is dimming, which is almost a relief. I can get away from all of this when it's finally out.",2022-09-30 14:57:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592085973,7,/r/lonely/comments/xs3htj/23m_i_just_want_to_be_noticed/,,0,2,23(M) I just want to be noticed

6108,xs409a,Ok-Avocado464,"I just want one friend, I’d that so much to ask for ? I’ve heard people say that true friends are hard to come by but I don’t even care at this point. I’ll be friends with anyone as long as I finally have someone to talk to, play games with, make memories with. 

Why can’t I have that ? I’m so lonely the only friends I have are in my head,I’ve isolated myself for so long due to my depression and anxiety that I lack basic social skills. I’m a sophomore but I’m supposed to be a junior. I flunked freshman year so I’m a year behind. I’ve only shown up to class three times this year and none of my assignments are complete. 

I had no energy to complete them, I’m so ashamed of myself for how badly out of hand my school has gotten I plan on killing myself if I get held back again. I can’t handle the shame 

I get really depressed anytime I see people my age having fun with their friends irl or on social media because I never got to experience that due to the pandemic and my declining mental health. I don’t even keep track of the days anymore, they have no meaning to me. Every single day is the same, there’s nothing to look forward to anymore. Nothing to be happy about. I’m just numb all the time. 

I recently started taking anti depressants so hopefully that works out but I don’t really think they’ll change my situation.

I just wish I could stop being so lonely but for some reason it’s extremely difficult to connect with people even online in spaces where I’m supposed to share a lot of things in common with people. I just don’t know how to form close connections anymore",2022-09-30 15:18:03,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634060712,14,/r/lonely/comments/xs409a/i_just_want_a_friend/,,0,1,I just want a friend

6112,xs5d74,Murky_Effect3914,"Yeah cool I turned 18 2-days ago. But the few friends whom I have were either busy or didn’t want to get together and do something (I’m leaning toward both, with a greater emphasis on the latter). I fucking hate it. I feel like I’m losing pretty much everyone (and sure that’s only a handful but that’s significant to me — I’m weird and awkward so friends don’t come easy), gradually; but surely. You know, when it’s like an unstoppable decline? Yeah. I can’t and won’t fucking do anything about it because whatever — that’s just what they want. 

Why is everyone such a coward? Just fucking say you’re not interested and/or block/unfollow me, and done. Every step, which seemingly goes forward, just becomes, at best, another step back  (but usually several steps back, bc then I need to cope with having failed with another person again; with having gotten my hopes up for fucking nothing). I’ve had like 6 fucking people not work out this year, which is like at least 3/4. 

So my birthday was boring and mostly shit like the rest of my year. I haven’t had a “normal” one since 20 fucking 18. I got an Apple Watch and a cookbook btw. And now I have two.5-weeks of holidays, which will be fucking unbearable. I’m so sick of it all. Anyway, I don’t rly want b day wishes bc well none of you (i presume) know me, so anyway don’t feel the need to do it if you don’t want to. But go ahead if you do. 

Anyway virtually nothing changes. Yeah I can buy alcohol cigarettes and gambling shit but that’s about it (not interested in any of these things). I’m so tired of being lonely — I can’t fucking enjoy anything, and even when I’m not lonely, my anxiety often ruins the few fucking opportunities that I have. I feel like all of my friends/sort of friends find me to be insufferable; and that I’ll die alone. 

The last time that I wasn’t lonely was 3.5 years ago or something, and the one who did this turned out to be an actual sociopath. Nothing since. And in nearly 3-years, I’ve only had two fkn hugs: one for pity; and one to calm me down from anxiety.

Anyway, a little about me i do love to listen to musics indie pop rock love's to watch movies (Specially Horror) Love's to bake and I love animals and have a few of them at home - a cat and a dog.

My emotional range is very limited. I am not unhappy with my life as it is because I am not sure what 'unhappy' feels like. I have fleeting interests in art but nothing hold my attention for long. Most days I just lie down and think.

I do not know if I should feel lonely, or if I am lonely but just cannot recognize it.

6184,xsfh9f,burner234527,"The title says it all really but I just don’t know how much longer I can carry on for, as I have virtually no friends and none that reply to my texts on the same day. I’m clearly so unlikeable and socially inept that nobody wants to know me - at this point I’d be better off dead as what point is living when you have nobody that cares about you or wants to spend time with you?

I don’t see anyone outside of work and even at work I have just one person I can consider a work friend, even though we have little in common, she’s kind enough to tolerate me. Still, I get horrible anxiety as I know everyone thinks I’m socially inept and weird, which I guess I am. I can’t express how much it hurts when people look at me with pity or glaze over what I’ve said with a facial expression that’s a mix of disdain and wishing they hadn’t spoken to me in the first place. It hurts me as well that there are plenty of cliches and I don’t fit into any of them, clearly I’m not valuable enough for anyone to want to befriend me.

The last year has been so hard as I moved back from university and not a single person who I thought was my friend, has actually wanted to make plans to see me. I can barely get a text back, to the point where I’ve stopped texting them. It’s honestly devestating - to think I actually thought I’d made friends for life. Even if they did want to see me though, I’m too humiliated to share how pathetic my life is now - I barely leave my room besides going to and from my job.

I’ve always had difficulty making and keeping friends and that’s what makes it so difficult for me to be optimistic. I haven’t kept any of my friends from school, university, my last job and so the pattern goes on. Even if I do click with people, they eventually see me for what I am and gradually distance themselves, or I shut myself off before it happens if I see where it’s going. I just don’t know how longer I can carry on like this - it’s humiliating to be my age and have no friends, and it’s so fucking painful to see everyone around you having amazing life experiences and being completely shut out, knowing it will never happen for you. I haven’t been on holiday for 4 years now and I’d love to go but I don’t have anyone to go with.

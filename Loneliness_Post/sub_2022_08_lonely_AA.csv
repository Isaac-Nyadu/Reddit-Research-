2,wd38ky,Maximum-319,"hello, newbie here.

something happened in the past that shattered my trust and made me start to question people's genuineness. I started to think that maybe people only talk to me cus they're bored, just being nice, is convenient, or they just straight up pity me. I question if I even really have or had any friends, and I am scared to talk to them about it because of those same thoughts. so time and again I sit in this dark and cold hole in my mind and just wonder about my loneliness.

do you guys have any advice?",2022-08-01 00:20:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wd38ky/afraid_of_people/,,0,2,afraid of people

It seems like everyone already has their friend groups solidly established. Hanging out with them feels so wrong, like I’m intruding. I don’t get their inside jokes, and it feels like they don’t want me inserting myself into their friend groups. 

I just really want to feel like a part of something. It feels like I haven’t yet found my community, my people. Plus it doesn’t help when everyone but me has a girlfriend, so they can just have fun together, without the need for a third wheel like me.

12,wd4a0s,Moon_And_Stars9,"One of the most genuine, close friends I've ever had is an online friend, and back in March they attempted suicide. He survived, but his parents took all forms of technology away. During school, we were able to talk because they used their friend's phones, but once summer started we weren't able to talk anymore. They told me they were getting their stuff back at the beginning of July, but their parents were gonna control all of it, go through all of it, and essentially there was no way for him to have discord and continue to talk to me (if we texted normally, he'd still be in trouble since his parents don't recognize my contact).

I'm in a server with his irl friend group and earlier today they were talking about him (one person said ""good news _____ is alive"" and someone else said ""yeah i've been talking to him for like a month). I was finally kind of moving on but now I'm reminded of it and I feel the pit in my stomach that I used to feel everyday. Their birthday is in a few weeks so I'm gonna have one of their friends to pass a happy birthday message on for me, and hopefully once school starts we can talk again. 

I know this won't happen, but I really want is that for their birthday, their parents lay off them so they'll be able to get discord again. Unfortunately they're very toxic so that's not going to happen.

13,wd4afb,FewRadish9849,"This is my first ever post on reddit so idk how this is gonna go

I’m 26 with no friends. I have a family who love me greatly but I don’t interact much with them due to being in my room a lot.

When I was like 13-20 i had a good and big friendship circle but felt like I was a tagalong most of the time. I’d say my social life was below average but not non existant before 21. After 21 I turned into a full time gamer basically after uni and stuff and just gamed all day for money at the start but now I don’t game much at all. The people I met when gaming only spoke to me because I was relevant to them and helped them win money etc. 

So fast forward to now and I’m 26, missed out on socialising for 6 years. I’m below average looking tbh not ugly though. I’m very small around 5’4 - 5’5. I’ve created bumble bff apps and a LOT (EVERY DATING APP possible) and maybe get 3-4 matches across all of them and only 1 responded to me and tbh my social interactions with people aren’t the best and convo ran out with this person quickly. My poor social skills imo are blamed on the fact I’ve done nothing but game since 20ish and just dont know how to speak to non-hardcore gamers anymore.

So its depressing I don’t get matches, i have pretty bad conversation, i have no friends online or real life. I’ve even turned into a degenerate gambler since 21 and lost a lot of money but thats the least of my worries tbh. I just want happiness, friends and to feel wanted by someone other than my family. Like does anyone understand what its like to KNOW nobody will even notice or care if I died but my family.

My hobbies include watching all sports, and gaming thats about it really. And I’m trying to think of things people will reply and answer them before such as why not message old friends from youth. I tried that, went out once and never got asked out again and  I ask them and its the same ‘Yeah sure I’ll let you know’ - never get a message, i dont want to feel like a pest.

Money issues are not a problem. I would go out and do anything with people if they asked or wanted to. I want to LIVE LIFE. i havent accomplished anything in life socially. Its a massive hole. I just dont know how to meet new people. Yeah its easy to say ‘go to the pub or just go out’ then what? Im a loner i go up to someone to say what? Hi?

19,wd4l47,Marianah_Ray,"I am a 46-year-old woman who has always been introverted. I am the friend that people call because they need a non-judgmental ear. I am the one who considers the feelings of others when usually I am rarely given a second thought. I am invisible. Doing things to make people smile warms my heart. For instance, before gas prices started going down in my area, I purchased about $600 worth of gas cards and gave them to a select few family/friends I knew needed them.  Some of them have to travel for work, and I know that things were getting tough for them. I am not saying this to boast about what a good person I am because I have my flaws, and work on my own issues accordingly. At the same time, I am not so selfish to not care or think about other people.  Sometimes I will jot down things that I believe people might need. I may take my mom/sister out to dinner and then, the next month, give someone who needs it, a Target gift card so they can get groceries/home stuff. I am hurting, and so I need to stop and step back.

Here is the problem: It is NEVER reciprocated. The same friend who called daily to rant about her toxic work environment never once asked how I was doing. One day after listening to her for about 90 minutes, and giving her useful advice, when I finally started talking about what was going on with my family and work, she had fallen asleep on the phone. She was SNORING!!!

The same friends, I text and wish a happy birthday, forget my birthday. I'm tired of people saying that you get what you give. Or that you attract what you are. If that were the case for me, I would have at least ONE authentic friend I could call on when I need an ear and give a damn enough to inquire if I am still ALIVE. My husband and I have dinner associates we go to dinner with from time to time, but outside of that setting, there's no conversation or interaction. The wife of one of the couples lost her father; I sent her a beautiful plant and card though I didn't know her well. Again, I am never on anyone's mind. Not even a hello or a text.

I do not give with the expectation of getting something in return; HOWEVER, it HURTS When you truly and genuinely care about others and NEVER have anyone around when you need them; to desire to have just ONE authentic friendship and realize you have no one. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm hurt. I'm lonely. The only place I am visible is in the gym because I am heavily into strength training. I have gym associates, but I don't know how to make friends anymore. I'm afraid to even try at this point. Do I just have the WRONG people in my life? If so, then how do I meet just ONE REAL friend? Time to sign up for Talkspace.

70,wdaevk,endless_afterthought,"I discovered my ex had been seeing several people and left him, he promised me he was faithful and we were exclusive. But his actions were a dead giveaway he's messing around. I finally confirmed it one day and left him. After many years of suffering from a previous trauma I finally gave myself a chance to love someone and to believe I can be loved for real, but in the end I just had to be cheated on again.

I got talking to someone recently from one of my posts and he has been very supportive. He calls me everyday while he streams a game for me on discord and has been really kind. He calms me a lot and makes me feel better. I feel guilty for having to mention my ex a lot to him and for venting lots but he doesn't mind and actually encourages me to talk and asks questions that are helpful in opening up. 

But I still feel extremely alone. I feel bitter and the heartbreak I'm going through still eats me inside. I don't want to turn this person into someone I should be venting to, he's genuinely nice. I know what it's like to play therapist for someone and I want to spare him from being that because it's unfair. 

So I think I'll have to keep everything in all the same and pretend I'm getting better every day. 

But it's actually getting worse. 

I miss my ex terribly despite what he did to me, everything reminds me of him, it's hard to accept everything and have a sense of normalcy. This new acquaintance tries to make me see how badly I was treated and I agree. But I still feel sad losing him. It's pathetic but it's how I feel. 

I'm sorry if this post rubs someone the wrong way, please be kind. I know I should be grateful for even having a single person care in a sense for me at this point and I feel like I should atleast pull myself together and try and move on and not be whining about my stupid ex anymore.

72,wdb28o,Much-Indication-7274,"Sorry I know this will provoke an eye roll from some and I really do understand there are more profound issues in the world but I'm really sad.  I have no friends. I also get really embarrassed/dislike showing my emotions so I'm gonna just put this post out there and it's probably gonna be long. 

So today was a hard day for me to even get out of bed. I finally made it out of the house around 5pm to take my 2 dogs to the dog park. I've never taken them alone before so I was really sad when I realized I had no friends to go with me. This is nothing new I always do things alone but I'm not a strong person and my dogs can be a lot at times. Either way, I told myself to stop being anxious and just grab a pair of headphones and go. So I did. The dogs were well behaved and my headphones helped drown out the loneliness. My worries were for nothing. I sat at a table in a secluded area alone for quite some time. Eventually 3 guys approached and sat at the table that was 1 foot from me and started engaging conversation with me. I declined to sit with them (although I basically already was due to the proximity of the tables) because I was worried of how the conversation would go. I thought about politely excusing myself but I did not want to come across as rude. They seemed very happy and kind. Plus where would I go? Sit across the field from them?lmao. So I told myself to just be an adult and hold a conversation and so I did. Initially I felt a little happy when we got a few minutes into chatting and they were being normal. We were just talking about the dogs and it was very normal conversation. I felt like they were genuinely interested in just talking to me as a person without any expectations and I did feel a little conceited/bitchy for thinking they'd try to hit on me before. Then of course the conversation turned into what i was dreading..them letting me know I am very pretty, hitting on me,  asking me my age, asking for my number, asking me to smoke weed with them, to hang out with them, then even asking me where I lived but asking exactly what apartment complex i live in, which all of that just made me very uncomfortable. One guy was married and was very persistent on letti g me know how beautiful he thought i was.
just like that I was filled with dread. I wished I was alone and i had regret talking to them . 

Anyways a little while later I stopped at the grocery store and it was pretty late out like almost 11pm. At check out there was just 1 lane and the teller was a taller, much older guy. I was nervous for the interaction but once again I told myself to be an adult and stop being anxious for no reason. He said the usual stuff, I responded and returned the ""how is your evening"" question. Then there was a silence and he looks at me and hums ""mmh mmh mmmmmh"" as if I am tasty or something idfk. Then he did it again while shaking his head while he scanned my water but had his eyes fixed on me. So now I'm extremely uncomfortable and he's creeping me tf out. He asks my name and starts complimenting me although he's probably in his 50s and I look very young for my age. I couldn't wait to pay and get out of there. he very enthusiastically tells me to have a good night and I'm sure stared at me while I walked away which I didn't even look because I knew it would make me even more uncomfortable. Ignorance is bliss

I then popped across the street to the gas station and some guy was yodeling across the parking lot trying to hit on me. I didn't even look at him.

 Anyways when I finally got home I felt very sad and i started to cry, so I decided to just figure out what the issue was. So what you spent the day alone again and people told you youre pretty? Whats the problem? After some thinking I realized I'm just feeling really empty and lonely and maybe even a little worthless? I am a confident person usually..but acknowledging that Im Incapable of building strong friendships with other women (due to various reasons) and then realizing that most men I encounter are really just interested in shooting their shot with me and have 0 interest in having anything to due with me when the idea of sex is off the table.. idk I just feel alone and sad. I don't like people complimenting my appearance. Women often end up being very mean towards me or if they are nice we just don't have much in common. I really struggle to make genuine connections.  I know often I'm just in my own head, but even with my dating life I'm just questioning where I've been going wrong because I genuinely would love to have a solid relationship but It never happens. Various reasons. 

Idk I just wish maybe I could have a normal conversation or day and not feel uncomfortable in my skin. Does anyone else ever feel like this? How can I change my perception of these types of interactions so that im not walking away feeling badly, regretful, worthless? How do I even know if a guy is genuinely interested in me or if he's just telling me what he thinks I want to hear because he wants to hook up?

it's just been kind of hard to build the courage to try to meet new people to get close with. i've been touch starved since i was 12 or so. i just miss feeling the touch from another person, intimately. i miss feeling close with people. it's actually starting to hurt every night when i'm alone. i don't really ask people for a lot, and i feel like asking to sleep call with a friend or something would be too much. this actually saddens me a lot more than it should. i have so many bigger things going on, but i literally cannot help but dwell on how lonely and touch-starved i am.",2022-08-01 07:37:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648929325,3,/r/lonely/comments/wdbczm/ive_been_touch_starved_for_years_and_i_am/,,0,0,i've been touch starved for years and i am starting to get painfully tired of it

81,wdbxuc,Noodleman5,"I don’t expect anything from this post, I just needed to say something somewhere , I’ve tried a diary and lighting them on fire but. Here it goes. 
I think I’m slowly falling into depression and the sad thing is I feel so numb by it now today.  I know I’m not alone , I know there’s plenty of people like myself. Struggling or maybe have it worse than me. But all my life all I’ve known is humiliation. Always looked at and treated as some burden. I was always awkward but always tried to be nice to everyone around me for as long as I could remember. But always the little guy , Even when I made “friends “ I always was picked on and joked on by my friends harshly. To this day this claim is tough love but I’m beginning to have my doubts. I’ve always tried to make meaningful relationships but I never knew how. My family were never affectionate. Parents always working coming from poor background. As adults now my siblings hardly talk to me , let along I found out they text on the regularly meanwhile my brother who is just the door across from hasn’t talked to me months and always tells me to leave him alone. But I have no to blame but myself.Nothing is expected of me. I’ve tried to change for the better and left California and now after a couple of years I’m back thinking it would help and finding myself and That I did, at least I thought it helped for me but I missed my family and friends. But ever since I came back.  None of my friends even try to call me or text me. My brother and sister feel even further away from me. And every time I meet a beautiful woman and try to establish a meaningful relationship, and I feel cursed because I always ruin it or they just leave with out a word after the first date. I’ve reached a point where I gave up on love entirely. Been trying for 9yrs now.  And I didn’t realize how depressed I was untill one night a tiny little voice in the back of my head was thinking about just. Ending it all. Drive far away somewhere and not tell anyone but leave a note for my parents saying I’m sorry and just idk. End it. I’m just that unhappy. And I’ve tried so many things. But I’m gonna keep trying to explore all my options before I decide on death since that’s the only thing absolute in this life.

Supposedly in the dream I've never seen the girl for a year in the dream world and when I saw her I just felt like I've met her even though I never did. So in the dream, she got out of her house. We conversed, smiling at each other then we took a walk. Didn't know to where but it was a long walk. We exchanged words, jokes and then there was this guy who I think came out of a truck with a machete wearing a hockey mask. I ran and so obviously I ran in slow mo and then eventually I stopped, tried to catch my breath then this guy unmasked himself and said it was just a prank lol. All 3 of us were exchanging smiles and words for a bit then me and the girl continued walking. We eventually got to the park. I can't remember what we exactly did but I remember taking pictures of her seeing joy in her eyes. It was a foreign feeling, something strong. Something I've never felt. I thought all this was real. In the dream we walked backed to her house, confidently knowing well see each other again...when I finally woke up, that's when it hit me😞",2022-08-01 09:15:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1656004361,3,/r/lonely/comments/wdcv16/dreaming_about_a_girl_ive_never_met/,,0,0,Dreaming about a girl I've never met

It's strictly a transactional relationship and we never go out of line, I never do anything creepy and things are going ok business wise. 

But recently I've really started feeling lonely, A LOT. I'll be honest, talking to them everyday, even if it's for work made me realize how good some of them are as a person but I can't have a friendship/relationship with them. That has made the feelings of loneliness even worse.

How do people cope with feeling alone no matter who you're with?
I always wanted to know what it was like to feel truly loved and appreciated.
How do people make connections who aren't toxic or manipulative?

If life has taught me anything, it's that nothing is real. Love is an illusion created to fool the person who is being manipulated. No one will be with one person forever. It's just what they tell others to create trust. 

I feel my purpose in life is to be a resource for others to build themselves up and find their true love/passion. I'm merely a checkpoint in the journey of life.

117,wdhooi,nikkupoteto,"Sorry for such a long text. It happened 5-6 months ago with someone I considered best friend and the only person I can trust anything. He had social anxiety, family issues, any other teenager's problems, but it never stopped me being good friends with him, we had happy moments, wholesome moments, doing silly friends stuff etc. I always helped him. And with time I almost became his ""personal therapist"". That was my mistake. I had tons of my problems(depression, ADHD, personal life, uni and others) but it never stopped me for dealing with his. I was happy when he was grateful, I was happy when I finally taught him something more healthy even with sacrifice of my own mental health. 

But it all got worse. With time he began to act like I own him my help, he ignored me for a week, because of one meme (here we go again) I send him as a joke after he started another help conversation. Yes, he was very vulnerable to some jokes, sarcasm or opinion (you can't guess which one will be lmao). Comparing to the first year we were friends later we had much more conflicts because of that, but still I felt sorry for him, treated that with understanding and those conflicts usually ended ok. Until the last one

We lived in different cities, so meeting each other was always exciting and we wanted to make the day longer, but that birthday I wanted to get back home as soon a I could. He couldn't just enjoy it,no, he must get mad at me for any random joke, start his depressing conversations, and of course I tried to help but I was so done I couldn't. And he got mad at this as well. We haven't talked for a while and I decided to make my first move and... I was absolutely shocked

I didn't want to leave him or do anything bad, I always thought it was all because his anxiety problems because I knew he was very worried ""what if all friends leave me :("" . Well he did it first, good for me. After he told me "" You gave me wrong type of support, I wanted more like emotional kind and you you gave me more idk practical"" I was completely shocked like dude WTF? How in the world did you came up with this? I gave you everything, any type you ever wanted and asked! I didn't even asked for ""thank you"" and this is what I got?When I was accused at being narcissistic I knew it was over. He knew how much i HATE people who act like this, always hated. He should knew it. And he's other friend kinda gave him this opinion based on...idk we never had conversation together, except that forced one where I was super uncomfortable talking about my depression. That's all. Idk why did they diagnose me behind my back, why he didn't stand up for me telling her that's not true. I felt like it was such spit in my face and my morals... well enough about him

That was all, my last friend. Somebody told me something I needed to hear long ago : ""friend is not obligated to solve someone's problems"". That's true. A friend help because he want to not because he should. And if a friend can't solve it that's ok as long as he supports you. 

But now I can't make new friends because I don't have opportunity and this feeling that somebody will just use me make it more difficult. I want to be alone and restore my mental health. I gave too much for others, I can't afford to give more. Sometimes I hope I don't make new friends, so they won't use me. And that sucks because I used to trust people a lot.",2022-08-01 13:36:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1575849795,2,/r/lonely/comments/wdhooi/trust_issues_after_losing_last_friend/,,0,2,Trust issues after losing last friend

All day just in a truck, when not driving I’m sleeping. I have come to start feeling sad for no reason. Like I’m just going through life without making any friends or memories. It’s kinda weird but sometimes I feel depressed as I see families and couples enjoying life when I stop to eat or pump gas.

I decided I need to start enjoying life anyway I can in my current situation. I’m looking to buy a headset and wanted to know who’d like to be friends and talk on the phone? And since I’m always going to different state if I’m ever in your area we could grab a bite, go bowling, etc..

So, my life have been ok about friendships and partners, but in time the things changed, old friends have gone for many reasons, different thougs, different lifestyles and more stuff like that

Just now i only have 4 close friends (One of them it's my ex girlfriend who cheated on me 2 years ago and tbh we have a good friendship). So what's the problem?

2 of them will left the country and i'll never see them again. My ex meet a new guy and i think that she is falling in love again (And i'm happy for her but the trouble it's that she had distantanced herself from me and i know it's for him) and the other friend just have too many friends and she is always bussy

I'm writing this because i dunno what to do, i'm feelig empty for a while, and now i'm feeling alone, i think that maybe i'm just exaggerating nut i'm really sad everyday thinking that i'll be with no friends. 

I'm not the best guy doing new friends but normally it's easier, but i'm too suspicious so i don't let new people know me or invite me to hang out, so

I'm afraid of be alone.

130,wdkohf,Lopsided-Ad8861,"I'm married to my best friend, 20 years now.  You'd think that would sound like the best thing ever - which it would be... had I not been friend zoned by my own partner.  For about 10 years now I've been little more than a roommate.  I've read the books, gone to the therapy - there's really just not that much more that can be done on my side...  she's just decided that she's not in love with me anymore and I can't make that change.  If something will change it's in her camp - and outside of my control.    


And it's smothering.    


I hate it.  I'm in love with her, it's like being in love with your best friend and never being able to act on it.  She knows it hurts me and that I'm dying inside, but says she can't change how she feels.  I believe she's sincere.

Why not leave, you say?  We have 4 kids.  I can't - they see Mom and Dad getting along well and being friends and it would tear up the family.  It's just inside of me that is painful... overall they have a good environment.  

She has suggested that I open myself up a bit, meet people, maybe even find someone to connect to...  sort of a soft open marriage to see if I can get my needs met somewhere else.  I don't know what to do about that.  Do I try?  I don't long for a hall pass but living life without passion and intimacy is pretty crappy too.  

So my question for you, Reddit, is... do I explore my options?  Do I suffer in silence?  Do I leave and just let the cards fall?  Do I just stay in this cycle of hoping something will change?

132,wdku67,wizardhat88,"So today was my birthday and of course I’m lame af so didn’t have anyone to celebrate with. Which got me to thinking about my persistent suicidal ideation etc

This terrible loneliness and deep depression I’ve been dealing with has absolutely turned me into a creature. I haven’t spoken to a person outside my family for months now. I sometimes don’t even think I’d be able to socialize anymore. And yet there’s still this irrational hope that things will get better.

So that’s why I still go on Omegle from time to time. Most of the people and the conversations are of course absolutely rubbish, it’s better than no interaction at all though.

But today of all days I got really lucky. I managed to have an incredible conversation about subjects dear to my heart, subjects I rarely get to talk about with people at all. We talked about books and literary concepts and analysis and philosophy and to be honest I haven’t had a conversation this meaningful since my early days at university. (They even knew about a philosopher I love, Emil Cioran, which I never met a person outside my country to have known him. And i decided to give Murakami another chance because of them, I just got Kafka on the Shore.)

This conversation truly made my day better, it feels so nice to be intellectually stimulated. And it also made me realise my own self imposed alienation and distance from other people based on perceived disparity between interests may be a bit misconceived on my part. 

It’s true that most people my age don’t really have, uhh, a deep interest in literature and philosophy and the likes, but there are also some people out there who are indeed likeminded, and I’ll never know when, where or even if I’ll ever find them if I continue to think of nothing but me potentially killing myself.

As Cioran said, ‘Only optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists. The others, having no reason to live, why would they have any to die?’

If you read this far, thank you, and I truly wish you find your own small glimmer of hope, especially meaningful to you!",2022-08-01 15:53:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1613824544,4,/r/lonely/comments/wdku67/today_was_my_birthday_and_the_only_good_thing/,,0,4,Today was my birthday and the only good thing that happened was a conversation on Omegle

168,wdr01p,_Forever_depressed_,"And yes, its the same friend from my older posts, i just cant seem to get over her now and its super embarrassing.

So yeah to start off, she has always told me lots of stuffs about her personal life, like her ups and downs. And to me it felt great cus it felt like she trusted me a lot.

But since last week she has been acting pretty quiet and dry with me. She doesnt share much about her personal life now when i ask her. She's pretty unresponsive now too. And i feel like idek her anymore since she doesnt share anything about what she has been up to.

I remember some time ago she did say that she had been doing pretty great in school, and made many many great friends. Of course i felt happy for her, but now im wondering if thats the actual reason why she's spending less time with me. Maybe im too boring for her now, since my life is pretty uneventful now due to school stress and other personal issues, and would rather hang out with more enthusiastic and interesting friends. I have met people who were like that before so that could be a possibility unfortunately.

She also tend to be a pretty strange and a confusing person. She told me that she trusts me the most and that im special to her (which i felt really honored), but idk, i feel like she doesnt really mean that??? Because right now she is talking much to me. She also sometimes say that same thing to her other friends, albeit more often with me (i think).

Anyways, my point is that she is starting to feel distant with me, and not replying to my messages as quickly as before. I have absolutely no idea what she has been up to these days cus she isnt telling me when i ask her. This makes me feel extremely depressed and lonely cus she's my only best friend now, and its making me feel worthless and untrustworthy now.

224,wdyiua,QuizzyP21,"I know many people have experienced the high of binging a TV show (currently Stranger Things for me), and that high sure is wonderful. For me, it feels like I’m a part of the universe. I’m a part of the group. I know the characters on a personal level and feel their sense of togetherness. 

And then the television turns off. When I stop watching, it’s like a shot to the face. More than ever recently, I’ve been questioning my choices since high school. The next few paragraphs is just a personal rant. 

I regret breaking up with my high school girlfriend during my senior year. I didn’t even have a good reason; I was just bored of life and thought it was her. That couldn’t be farther from the truth, and I realize that more and more over time as that feeling of emptiness and chronic boredom stick and grow with me. Today, I can barely remember the last time I talked to a girl.

I regret not being more social and experiencing more things because I was too busy addicted to stupid f***ing video games. It’s not like I didn’t have the opportunities either; I continually turned them down.

I regret not going away for college. I preferred to just stay in my bubble at home and take online classes while commuting when necessary.

I regret not allowing myself to make more friends. I don’t even really have a “friend group” anymore; my friends are still those from my high school friend group, but they don’t even talk to each other anymore and they’re all so frustrating and riddled with issues themselves.

When I was in high school, I thought I hated high school more than anybody else in the world. I remember thinking how most people really would end up missing high school, but never me. Today I would do almost f***ing anything to go back to the first day of freshman year, knowing what I know now.

Looking back, I know it’s probably not my fault and we’re all basically just a product of our genes and our environment (not a big believer in free will), but I regret so f***ing much. For around the past year Ive been hooked to exercising and the results make me feel like I’m doing better than others, but recently I am figuring out that even the exercise is more of an addiction/coping mechanism than it is a healthy habit. 

I’ve been low-moderately depressed forever, but for the first time maybe ever, I feel despair. I feel like I had a really nice life set up and permanently screwed it up when I broke things off with my ex more than 4 years ago. 

TV shows might be the only thing that remedies this feeling while I’m watching, and I think it’s because they all contain excitement and good/intriguing relationships… a sense of comradery. I have neither of these things, and I feel like I’m losing what I do have of both more and more over time.

I don’t even know what I’m doing posting on here. Like I said, I think I’m feeling despair.",2022-08-02 01:30:51,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634751971,14,/r/lonely/comments/wdyiua/tv_shows_are_my_favorite_drug_but_remind_me_of/,,0,21,TV shows are my favorite drug but remind me of how much I regret and how alone I am today (22M)

231,wdz2j8,fluffykittenfarts,"I think it’s normal that happiness comes with sadness.  Growing up consists of marriages that come with a new family and friends to accept.  The joys of new babies.  But also the loss of your older family members, the parties you once knew, beloved animals crossing the rainbow bridge.  But, there always comes anew.  A new puppy, a new friend, new happiness.  

But, what happens when you’ve had too much loss?  No family members to get married (they all are married with no kids).  No babies to be had (no siblings).  Bad breakups.  No luck in love.  The overwhelming fear of losing the last few people that care and make you happy sticks with you daily.  Your days turn into “what’s the point?”.  

I keep holding onto hope for the better.  But some days, the loneliness takes over.  I am reminded that having everything “you’re supposed to” means nothing without happiness and love.  I hope there’s other out there who can empathize with me.  I hope there’s others out there who have been in the deep depths of loneliness and have found their happiness.  I hope there’s others who can remind me how beautiful the happiness is that comes along with all this sadness.",2022-08-02 01:56:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wdz2j8/the_lifecycle/,,0,2,The lifecycle

234,wdzggq,Kananisun,"Hello! I am 25 soon to be 26 on Aug 19th. I was deeply triggered two days ago by reminiscing about memories. I was triggered because I feel alone. I look back at all the friendships I had and wonder if any of them was genuine. It's like everybody kept in touch with everybody else, checks up on everybody else, and celebrates everybody else but I am left out. I do have a boyfriend [long distance] &amp; my best friend who I have known since middle school [lives in a different state now] but they aren't in the same place as me. They have people who want to talk to them, who will reach out to them, and check up on them. I only have them. It truly saddens me because I had always put friendships on a pedestal... I cherished them, and put my all into them. Only to be here halfway to 30 and honestly by myself 99% of the time. It's the feeling that something must be wrong with me because no one sticks around, it's like I'm easily forgotten. 
It's just a trigger. For the majority of the time, I am perfectly fine, with reading my books, watching anime &amp; kdrama, and just doing things by myself. However social media can just bring back all that hurt I shoveled away. Seeing everyone get those congratulations when they post accomplishments, the support when posting something bad, or the happy birthdays. While I am ignored.

270,we2axi,FallenAazel,"My last girlfriend was with me for almost 2 years, we didn't have the best relationship but whatever. Well, she decided that the best time to break it off was after my father had been in the hospital for the entire week prior. Two days later (September 29th, 2021), he past away. She didn't seem to care that much and proceeded to intentionally make it seem like she was cheating on me, even though she actually wasn't. This alone absolutely destroyed me (I know, shocker). But now, roughly 10 months later, I'm still completely and entirely alone. Every person I've been interested in or tried to be with since has either flat out abandoned me or  went bat shit crazy, causing me to completely cut them out of my life. So now I'm just left with the fact that apparently no one likes me (because I don't really have friends either but that's a different matter) and I don't even have anyone that I can try to go for. I'm entirely alone, completely against my own will.
Also, fun fact about all this, I have not had literally any human contact since the last time I was with my ex.

280,we3im2,MAEBYOURDOLLY,"Dear Someone,

They all say a pretty face shouldn’t ever be lonely. But the deeper picture behind this mask/face of makeup I wear. Not sure if people will really read this all and not just check out my profile. But we all do what we do to get by in life. I thought life wouldn’t get harder. I die 2019 (traumatic event) the day I got the news. I’ve changed so much then.

It is taking longer than I expected. I find it unfair. People will tell me it’s the mind….find a therapist…go out. Depression is funny. As much as I want to I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. In my own little safe haven. 

For 3 years now I’ve been dealing medical and stress. I mean cmon I worked in health care for 6 years even during covid during my life changing events that had happened. Where was the healing right? I thought keeping busy would help but work wasn’t easy either. Pays really well, but managing a inpatient facility with patients and staff 24/7 was…you can’t say rough.

I never thought I’ll hate looking in the mirror so much every early morning trying to get myself to work. The stress has cause my eczema to react and not in the good way. Weight lost. Migraines. Even anxiety attack. Never in my 31 years would I ever thought I had those…or even experience this feeling of emptiness. 

I wish my friends understands when I call or text is because all I want is to just hear someone voice instead of my own voice In my head. 

June 29 is when I resign my position without any 2 weeks notice. So unprofessional of me. But I have given up my career my dreams and mostly my break making job to focus on me. 

Me? Who’s that? Past month that was the question I’ve been asking myself. Who do I see in the morrow every afternoon when I’m able to get up. Looking outside my window is like looking into a world of black and white. Watching all my friends fall in and out of love as I wasted my 7 years being hurt and lied to by the men I thought I would get to send the rest of my days, nights and life with. 

Im so lost. At 31 I thought I would get my shit together. But I guess the chicken finally hit the fan if that’s how you say it. No job. No income. No support cause I was supporting myself my whole life. Always been independent. Always giving to others in need. I’m afraid I can never come back from this and that is what kills me. Do I force myself to work while I’m having all these medical concerns. 

Damn. The world we live is pretty short and shitty. 

Dreams don’t come true. 


Or do they ? 


Maybe one day if I keep pushing it’ll all be ok. Never liked my life growing up as a different person. Never gave up then so why no right ? 

Anyways…..I think I’m not the only on out in this world feeling they are being seen or wanted !

289,we4lol,SnooMarzipans5231,"Hey everyone. Thanks for taking one minute to read the ramblings of a lonely internet rando. Genuinely, it means the world to me.

I’m a 26M living in California USA. I don’t know the ins and outs of writing a post like this so I’ll get right to the point. I can’t strike up interest with women to literally save my life, and for the life of me, I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.

It’s taken time, but over many years of experience honing my social skills, I feel like I should have the tools to meet, befriend, and eventually romantically interest women as my peers do so effortlessly. I’m confident in myself, I’ve developed a good sense of humor which people enjoy, I can maintain conversations on a variety of topics as well as actively listening to the other participant, I always treat everyone with respect and kindness… everything I can think of that a “good person” does. And yet, without fail, every opportunity ends the same- I meet someone new, we have a few chats making small talk, we sometimes exchange phone numbers, and then without warning they stop talking to me completely. Like I never even existed.

I think I speak for more than a few people on here when I say I’m tired of all the clichés. Be yourself and the right person will come to you, you’ll find the right person you’re meant to be with… leave that crap to the rom coms. I know the universe and the people in it aren’t obligated to give me anything; I don’t intend to come across narcissistic or self righteous. But when I work at a goal so hard to the point where it hurts me, and to have everything fizzle before me when I feel like I’m doing everything right, it’s beyond soul crushing, and have no idea where to turn for help.

If you’re still reading, thanks for sticking with me this far. Any comments are welcome. If anyone out there feels like they’re struggling like me, I wish you everything in the universe.

294,we55m1,TenchFromDelmakO,"I hate being asked, ""Why are you not married?"" or ""Why are you still single?"".

It's taken me decades to realize I've experienced trauma concerning relationships all my life. I had, up until, now thought I was in good mental shape for those kinds of things because I was ignorant of the trauma inflicted. The story is long, but moreover so sorted that telling just opens a pandora's box for the listener. Part of the lesson I learned is that finding someone who empathizes means someone who has experienced the same and getting someone who has not had the same experience to understand means traumatizing that person. If it's one rule I have ... it's not to hurt others or myself.

Sometimes learning, experiencing, living through, or just seeing and hearing something can leave a scar that is invisible and it's irreversible. All one can hope for is to be lucky enough to avoid falling into that trap or if you fell into it, just cope with it to live your life as normal as possible. I will try to tell the story without the bits that I feel would be harmful to others. And since this is media severely abbreviate it.

I was abused as a child. Its taken me decades to admit that. I became hypersexualized at an early age, but kept all matters concerning it very secret even at the age of 8 or 10 years old. I knew it was wrong. So I had this very attractive cousin that was my age that lived nearby when I was young. She constantly tried to seduce me or get me to do something sexual with her. In hindsight, she must have been abused herself to want to do such adult things in such an adult way. Trust me I wanted to give in so bad, but I knew there would be consequences for giving in and always avoided it. It didnt stop me from fantasizing about it constantly. That tease and how I teased myself, is just additional trauma.

When I moved away to a university, I finally felt it was ok to explore or give in to the desires I had forbade myself for so long. I am not unattractive, especially when I was 18. I chose one woman and literally stalked her, if waiting outside her door to meet her is stalking then I am guilty. We hit off. She broke it off with her boyfriend and we became exclusive. It was the most bliss I had experienced in my entire life. It felt unreal. We could not spend more than a few minutes without pleasuring each other. I stopped going to classes to spend more time with her, I couldn't help myself and started failing school. I had to break it off with her so I could concentrate. More trauma... I hurt her and myself. I even tried to get her back but she wouldn't have it; I did not blame her for that.

We were still friends. I fell in love with her new roommate. That wasn't really classy, but she was special. We made a deep connection. The conversations were the most engaging and stimulating I had ever had and the connection through sex was incredible. I learned she was abused, too. I never told her about my abuse...I really didn't consider myself abused back then. I lived with her for 3 years and she went off the deep end. If I tried to explain what drove her away from me, this story would only get attention for its outlandish and lascivious nature or just a story to read for its shock value. In reality, if I told you, you would not believe it, be traumatized yourself, and or get mad for telling it. She moved out of state to a prestigious school. I was more hurt than I had ever been in my life; I made the mistake of putting all my eggs in that basket. I followed her there but failed. I caught her communicating with a pimp in Canada. I left. 2 more years go by and I am still devastated.

Then I get a letter from her explaining that she really needed me in her life to save her. She was on the opposite coast, but that did not stop me. When I arrived to meet her she was not there. I was told she was a lot lizard and that she would return in a few days. She was happy and relieved to see me, but I was still skeptical ... didn't I was not still in love with her. I proposed to her again and this time she accepted, but afterward, she slowly started to tell me things she had kept secret from me. Like, that she was a prostitute and addicted to heroin. That she was bi leaning on lesbian and other more horrific things that I can not and should not disclose for the reasons described earlier. I felt like she didn't want me and repeatedly she chose the drug over me. Before I started to get suicidal thoughts, I left her.

I was traumatized but marched on. I attempted relationships afterward, but they never seemed to work out. I know why now. I went over a decade avoiding relationships altogether and then tried again recently. The last woman I dated was older than me and sexually assaulted me. And that's it I'm done with looking for love again.

Unfortunate circumstances, self-denial, on top of the constant abuse of others have guaranteed I will never find love in my life and it's just time to accept it now. I am too old, the world is totally fucked up with fucked up people in it and I seem to attract them or seek them out. I am just going to keep it all to myself. Not hurt anyone, nor myself.

Thanks so much for listening. And a hug for those brave enough to love still...I wish all of you love and happiness, but above all, I wish there to be no pain for anyone.",2022-08-02 07:23:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1639732610,10,/r/lonely/comments/we55m1/realizing_you_have_been_traumatized_is/,,0,0,Realizing you have been traumatized is traumatizing.

After the last attempt of taking my life I sat in my shower in the pitch dark for what seemed to be hours just screaming and crying until something in me sparked i went silent and sat there letting water just fall on my face and in that moment I started my spiritual journey my search for inner peace and happiness! It had seemed like I had a fresh start a new life embracing the loneliness and learning about myself for the first time I started meditation I started listening and messing around with frequencies binary beats , hemi syncs, silent meditations, yoga, anything and everything I could do I would do it! I was doing so well I was starting to love myself my self value was rising and then my friend was able to leave the rehab house and one of the very first talks we had was so insanely toxic I realized how narcissistic she is how could I have been so blind to it before how did I ever allow her to treat me so horrible I had to just let her go I blocked her completely out of my life and restarted my journey so far it has been wonderful so in my darkest most loneliest time of my life I learned that having no one except myself is actually much much better I now prefer to be alone and solely depend on myself for happiness my life has never been any better than it is now! 


Meditation is everything learn to love yourself and depend only on yourself for happiness! Doing that your wildest storms will settle and the sun will shine once again! 

If anyone would like to start meditation I can send links to my go to meditation playlist! Also give the gateway experience a google you would benefit greatly from it just alway use headphones when you listen to it!!!

She hasnt changed her any of her display pictures or the nickname she added to her profile. I don't know what that means but I know I love her more than anyone i ever can. 
I have lost any hope of finding love, moreover I don't want to love anyone else. She was the person I could die for and now I am dying every day to be with her knowing that I will never be with her.

I know she feels the same.

339,wee6xr,[deleted],"I am a mid twenties young man who has spent much of his life on the east coast. I now live in a Midwest city. Throughout my life I have mainly experienced loneliness. I have never had a girlfriend yet I have had some good sex. A few observations about Americans I have noticed:

1. A lot of high status people actually do not have good social skills. If you have spent much of your life being perceived as high status by your peers you probably did not need to try very hard to make friends and get what you want from others.

2. A lot of toxic people are much more eager to connect and make friends with you as they are looking for emotional supply. A lot of high value folks will have more barriers to entry and do not jump into new relations quickly.

3. A lot of your social possibilities end after 25. Yes I know this is a controversial claim but most Americans have a core group of friends from early childhood/high school/college and it is unlikely that they will leave this group of people or include you within this group.

4. Your professional life is not be your social life. Do not drink at company events. Never date another employee. Avoid giving too much details about yourself to others.

5. Try and meet new people through physical activities and sports leagues. These people often have better mental health then others, more attractive, and are higher in conscientiousness. 

6. In any room there is someone you can meet who can help you. Whether it be socially, financially, or emotional support. Find that person. They are out there. 

7. You have to be ok with being completely rejected by others. You have to try to talk to random people. Our life is full of endless iterations and possibilities.",2022-08-02 15:10:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/wee6xr/my_experience_with_loneliness/,,0,0,My experience with loneliness

362,weji4g,plsHelpME001,"Hey guys. Wish i had something somewhat possitive to say, but im sorry i need some help.
Seriously - how do people make it through this


Its gotten so much worser for me in the last week since i started work.
I get up at 6 come come at 5 and go to sleep at 9 or so.

Nobody gives a shit about me. People only talk shit and never give any approval.
I've always been treated as a failure, but i honestly don't know what i did to deserve this.
I treat people respectfully and even avoid conflict, but don't allow myself to be trampled on.

I literally only have like 5 hours in a day to myself except weekends, but 5 days of the week im so fucking miserable in ways i didn't know were possible. I spend what little time i hablve in my day seccond guessing myself in every way i can. I have cried more in the last days than i have in my entire life i think. 

I've worked before and even been involved in gang activity sadly,but i swear to god it was never my intention to end up there - long story short. My friend was infront of me talking to the boss and i just couldn't let his dumass do that - i also got us out 2,5 years later and it was hell in the gang. Constantly on edge and in fear of mine and my friends lives. (I dont care, but i never maimed, killed or hurt anyone in my time - and i say this because i fully belive in karma - but i really didn't do anything)

But back then i was younger and processed shit differently. Now - honestly.... what is the point?
I think the last time i heard a genuine ""good job"" was when i was a teenager or before that. I hate my life and i hate eveything. I don't hate myself i have no reason to. I truly am a good person who doesnt deserve this. Nobody deserves to feel how i feel. I dont care about the money or any of that shit I just want people to see me at the very least. All i care about is for someone to acknowledge me somehow.


I will never take my own life though. As much as im in pain and alone i am not a loser. I cannot give up. But it doesn't mean that it makes it any better.

Im so sorry guys, but i needed to get this off my chest.
I have never spoken to anyone or shared this and its been killing me",2022-08-02 18:40:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,,5,/r/lonely/comments/weji4g/how_do_you_do_it/,,0,2,How do you do it?

Before him, I was floating around for ten years. I don’t connect with people very well or easily, so that makes this encounter even more painful. I thought I finally found my person, but I must be the reason I can’t have a good, stable relationship. Accepting this is difficult to endure.

Hi
Just venting, I feel so lonely even though I’m surrounded by people I care about. Even at work my colleagues knew each other beforehand and I can’t get along with them, they come and go together and they hang out together and I’m all by myself.
Then my family, my sisters are so close together and my mother seem to favor them since we were children.
I don’t what to do, I cry every night because I feel lonely, even during the day I try not to cry in front of others.
I’m afraid that I’ll die alone, all I want is just one person.

I had my reservations about the girl being real for a few reasons, but I get barely any matches, so I kinda just went along with it. I put so much effort into dating apps that I just wanted to believe that this person was genuine.

Over the next week, we texted each other every day. We talked about each other, planned a date, shared pictures of dogs and food, etc. I have barely any intimate experience with others, so it felt amazing just to talk to someone like this. Someone who actually cared about me, my interests, my appearance. I felt like a real person for the first time in many years.

Eventually, it became too clear that she was a scammer - I had to stop myself from going any further. At the time, I told myself that it was just an interesting detour, and that I would connect with real people soon. I was deluding myself. That fake girl was the only person who could ever give a shit about me. I’ve had no success on these dating apps since then, despite efforts to improve with other people’s advice.

I keep thinking back to that fleeting happiness I had. Sometimes I hope that I encounter another scammer like them, just so I can pretend to feel love again.

396,weo29h,Snoo36413,"I am so sick of not having anyone in my life, I cannot remember the last time someone asked me how my fucking day went, no one gives a SINGLE fuck about me, I could fall of the face of the planet and people I have to interact with may be concerned but thats as far as it'd go. I'm 21 and I've felt this feeling since I was around 11 or 12, this intense feeling of disconnect to everyone around me, the only connection I ever had was my ex and shes gone now, that was, for a on and off a year the only relief  I had and she never truly understood and was just sometimes there for me, but it was comforting and she did genuinely love me, I felt actually human for a brief spell, then she fucking left and doesn't like me anymore or give a single fuck about me. I have come to the conclusion this is it, I will just have this constant nagging feeling that something isn't right.

Its so god damn isolating and pathetic, the only time I feel slightly better is when random strangers online feel similar, I've used 4chan as a crutch since 12, I dont even want to know how much that + perpetual loneliness has affected my brain. In my life I have everything else, I'm working toward goals such as university and a career, I've got many hobbies such as singing and playing the guitar, weight lifting, drawing, building terrariums but no matter what people say ''wOrK toWard Ur gOalS, gEt sOme HobBieS, mAke, SomE fRienDs!1'' nothing scratches that itch, they just distract me, It probably doesn't help I'm autistic as well. Making friends didn't help, I have some course friends and I hung out with them yesterday but I just felt the same, theres no connection and they dont really give a fuck about me. Just surface level people, I work towards stuff in my life, I feel the same, I've tried hooking up with people but it doesn't fix shit, these are not the answers. Does anyone else feel like this? I have stuff but this issue goes much deeper, hell, I have parents but I dont really feel connected to them and thats shitty, I know they love me and I'm going to say I love them but they are very dysfunctional and I cannot live with them, never had any family growing up either due to a feud so growing up I literally had just my two pretty much mentally ill parents and surface level school friends I had to interact with.  I also feel like the only interactions I have are when people want me for something, aint no one just try to get to know me for the sake of it, there are always ulterior motives, apart from the ex which did leave me with trust issues. I'm not sure I could be arsed living like this until my natural end, humans are supposed to be connected to each other, monkes together strong type of shit. Finally if this lasts for years how much more mentally unstable am I going to become until I'm just not fit for relationships? Loneliness and the feeling of isolation and disconnect is so insidious, it just rots you from the inside out. Wish I had someone to share my life with, not in an unhealthy dependency way.

407,wepenw,throwaway0183701,"I’ve been romantically alone (henceforth called “loneliness” for simplicity) for so long. For my whole life, really, cuz I’ve never even been anyone’s crush. And it’s made me so fucking desperate. I swear I would do damn near anything if someone offered me love in return. I don’t care if I get abused, I don’t care if they’re toxic, I don’t care about anything. *Anything* would be better than this loneliness. Or at least that’s how I feel.

But it makes me feel so creepy. The most normal things that people do get overblown in my head. What they didn’t even think about or did as a common nicety, I hold a precious gem and a core memory. They didn’t intend it that way, I have no right to feel this way about it. But I do and I can’t stop and it makes me hate myself.

I had to go to the doctor, and a nurse talked to me. She was nice. And immediately I started thinking “omg she’s cute, I like her, does she like me? Why is she talking to me? She’s so pretty... does she like me? Could we be together? Am I worth something to her?” . Insane person shit. The emotional equivalent of a starved dog in a cage barking and snapping at the smell of a Slim Jim in someone’s pocket. And that’s what I’m reduced to because of my shit luck. How am I supposed to see myself as worth anything when *that’s* what I am?

And then I had to get an xray, and the nurse of course had to be a woman. Same shit. And worse because she actually had to touch me. She was just doing her job, she only touched my hips to move my dumbass into the right position. She’s not gonna think about touching me ever again, except maybe to tell her partner about the terrified fatass she had to deal with today. But I’m gonna remember it as the first time in months that anyone has touched me, and I’m not gonna be able to forget how good it felt to be moved around by my hips. And I damn sure ain’t gonna be able to forget how fucking creepy that makes me.

So how the fuck am I supposed to not hate myself for this, exactly? I know people that aren’t confident and self-assured don’t find love. I won’t find love as long as I hate myself for this. But not ever having been loved is the biggest part of why I hate myself. But I can’t be loved unless I fix that. But I can’t fix that unless I’m loved. And round and round it goes. It’s a feedback loop, and it’s just gonna get louder and louder until one day I can’t take the stress and my head explodes.

I wish so badly I could choose what I cared about. I’d give anything to not give a shit about love, or what people think of me. I’d be ok then, I might even genuinely enjoy life and be thankful for waking up. But instead I’m stuck in this hell where I want something I can’t have because not having it disqualifies me from having it. It’s entirely absurd, it’s such a perfect contradiction that I think it constitutes evidence that there’s an evil god who designed life to be so perfectly fine tuned to suck ass",2022-08-02 22:39:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606960124,5,/r/lonely/comments/wepenw/how_am_i_supposed_to_deal_with_how_creepy_my/,,0,2,How am I supposed to deal with how creepy my desperation makes me?

Despite that I feel really sad that I'm not capable of having a healthy romantic relationship. I've only had one in my whole life. While I love my friends, they're not the touchy types and without a SO I'm almost always touch starved. Touch starvation drives my brain to a lot of dark places. It was the driving force behind my suicide attempt 5 years ago and it often leads me to suicidal ideation. I'm not suicidal anymore thankfully but it still can get dark. To cope with that feeling I started dabbling in drugs over the years and now I'm a pretty intense meth addict at 26. For the most part it does a good job of making me feel good and not feeling too sad about the hurt. But I have days like today where I will break down and cry multiple times because I just crave so hard to be held by a special person. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I feel like this type of thing is deranged and shows that I'm sick in the head. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I’m making this cause have any of you ever just sat there wasting your life or felt like you are at least not knowing a damn thing about what you want and you just feel so behind and tired even tho you haven’t done anything and when you try to do anything it takes so much energy especially when it’s outside your comfort zone. I’ve lived my life as a only child and I my family tree is small My mom is the only daughter and I’m the only child so I feel I get pressured to be the one to step up as a man especially since I’m the only male in my family and I never had a genuine father figure so I’ve been having to figure out this whole “act tough” thing but it’s like weird cause I’m expected of so much and I am very anti social when I don’t know someone so trying to open up is such a struggle yet I’m supposed and I can’t lie my mother held my hand more than I’d like to admit when I was younger and I feel like that affected me even more cause now I feel like I’m co dependent and I can’t think on my own or for myself and I hate it if I’m being honest it makes me hate self and it’s not her fault my mother did the best she could as a single parent she was just being motherly but I never had a father figure to balance it out and now I’m expected to just know how to act and do things as a man and it makes me feel so lost and out of touch and yeah usually I don’t care but sometimes it adds up and I just need to vent cause the damn looks people just give you for not following the social norms just bother me sometimes and like I don’t know what to do I used to have people to talk to but you know as people get older they do there own things and life and get busy I don’t blame them like said I have a small circle so it’s hard for me to let people in the circle so now I just feel more alone now cause I can’t communicate liek before to people and I’m only writing this to vent and I do apologize if there’s no structure to this I have adhd which only adds to the damn difficultly lol but it’s weird that I don’t know what I want to do with my life I graduated Highschool in 2020 and I’ve been wasting time at least in my opinion I’ve traveled and stuff but I feel like I should be doing more and I’ve been given so much advice and yet I don’t know why I refuse to change anyways that’s my rant or i don’t even know what to call this,2022-08-02 23:20:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,1588927999,2,/r/lonely/comments/weqd51/m19_i_dont_know_what_i_want_out_life/,,0,1,M19 I don’t know what I want out life

436,wesozx,Exciting_West9188,"i met him on insta and long story short i ended up blocking him the day before we agreed to meet each other in real life since we live like 10 minutes away from each other. i was so overwhelmed with how quickly things were moving since we didn’t even know each other for a full month yet. he dropped many hints that he likes me too; he would call me cute, pretty, other times he would be more bold and say that i’m hot and i turn him on. shit, he even said one time that he would kiss me, after he asked what i would do if we were alone, and he also said he wanted to hug me. but he was also a massive red flag— he’d judge me when i said i preferred not to masturb8 and essentially called me mentally ill for it,  and he would ask me what i would do when i was hrny. he also asked creepy questions like whether or not i shave my pubes which is just ??? he also had some political views that i just did not agree with. i would try to educate him but then he’d say ‘forget it’ and then change the topic. 
so why the hell do i miss him so much??? we would chat on insta basically every day about anything and everything. i miss waking up to his goodnight and goodmorning texts, the songs we would recommend each other, the way he would say ‘see you in dreams’ right before we would go to sleep, since that was the only other way we’d see each other, other than instagram. i guess i’m just still a bit emotionally attached to him. 
but i could’ve at least told him why i was blocking him. we chatted one night then the next morning i just blocked him because i was terrified with the thought that he would turn really toxic and horrible, even though he generally seemed nice to talk to. i can’t even imagine the confusion or anger he must’ve went through when i blocked him without explanation. that was such a shtty move of me, he deserved at least an explanation. i’m thinking of unblocking him to tell him why, but i don’t want to see his reaction. tf is wrong with me lmoaoo

454,weupmr,that_witch18,"TW: cuss words 
My guy best friend is kind of an asshole, I’m gonna start with that. But behind that he’s an amazing guy that I love to hangout with and I love his family. I started noticing that I get these feelings when I’m around him, like genuinely happy feelings. 
I never noticed before but I find him attractive too. I love how blue his eyes are because in different lightings they completely change hue. He has always been there for me up until recently when he started dating this new girl. I’ve never felt so lonely and that’s when I realized I had fallen in love with him. Thought it was just me loving him as a friend but I was just denying it at that point. 
I’ve been depressed for a long time and when I started working at my job we became friends fast. We are both weirdos and loners so we get along great. I know that he doesn’t feel anything beyond platonic unfortunately. Now don’t get me wrong we have cuddled a few times but it never went past that because I don’t think he wanted to and I am still a virgin lol 
What sucks is he can talk about the girls he dates or talks to but when I mention a guy I met he changes the subject. It kinda pisses me off that I support him with his love interests but he doesn’t with mine. I don’t get it and probably never will. I really realized I love him when I had broken up with my ex and explained to him why I did(he pushed for sex after I said no 3 times and he knew I wasn’t ready because I want to wait for the right guy, obviously not him 🤷🏼‍♀️) he was happy that I knew a red flag when I saw one. About a week after I did that he broke up with his girlfriend at the time and we hung out a lot more. He has a new girlfriend now but before that we would hang out most days we weren’t working together. Normally it was me watching him work on cars. When we cuddle he will randomly tickle the shit out of me. But I know I can never be what he wants and needs so I will stay on the sidelines watching and hope that he is happy, I think I’m used to being lonely at this point 🙂 thank you for listening to my rant",2022-08-03 02:41:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/weupmr/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend_rant/,,0,3,I’m in love with my best friend (rant)

467,wewgxt,zepol_2,"TLDR: being lonely during hard times in life is fucking devastating.

internet stranger not sure if you are gonna read this, but if you ever go through something similar just know that everything is gonna be alright 

I've always enjoyed being alone and by myself , but the last two years have been really though and being alone has made it worse.

When my dad passed away two years ago i talked too some friends online (pandemic ) who somehow supported me, but after that ni idea hwats happening but I'm just more alone than ever. I barely express how I feel or stuff. When i got the news my dad died I didn't even cried not until next day.

This year things have been worse, my mom is dying an since then anxiety has taken over me, I used to talk to my friends but since then I'm just not talking to anyone, they text or call, i just dont reply because i don't feel like talking and bc it imply talking about my mom and everything which will make my anxiety worse.

The worst part is I haven't talked about this with anyone, i have all those mix of emotions inside that want to get out but they can't, i can't even cry , i just feel powerless and furious that this is happening to my mom. And i know it might sljnd selfish but she is the only person that had my back and she's my everything so once she's gone I'll be completely alone.

My mom passing is not what hurts, i know that that's life, it's just that it's too soon and in one of the worst ways possible, I'd like to do great stuff and enjoy the time i have with her but she is just in bed sick and possible depressed, and there's nothing i can't do, no one I can talk to.

Emotionally, i feel like a pressure cooker hat it's gonna blow off at any moment or that maybe at some point I just want to give up bc it's too lonely and too painful.

I'd love to have someone I could talk about how i feel and that tell me that everything's gonna be alright even though is not, just s simple hug, because i have to be the strongest i have to be brave in from of my mom and have to te her everyday that it's okay",2022-08-03 04:08:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1504064357,2,/r/lonely/comments/wewgxt/loneliness_sucks/,,0,0,loneliness sucks

It's crazy since I was younger I really never had anyone I know alot of people heard this before but honestly on a picture of me being a new born baby they wrote ""mistake"" it's funny now to come think about it. Growing up for me was honestly the worst my own father would treat me like garbage didn't even care if I was alive or not the old man walked out on me, for my mother she was always seeking for love she was always busy so I was left to fend for myself. At school I'd get bully alot kids would even tell me to go end myself, ""not even your own parents love you why don't you disappear"" I was the outcast of everything didn't have any friends nor anyone my first attempt of me trying to end it was at 8 years old. (I've tried to do it 30 times already through my life) pretty crazy a little kid having those thoughts, I ended up getting caught in my 5th grade year with scars on my wrist they made a whole deal they ended up calling my mother she showed up put an act saying she loves me and is always there for me and she didn't even know why I would do it etc... as soon as we got home she yelled at me saying I was stupid and mental etc... that's the day I realized I was on my own, months pass and it was my so called mothers birthday I ended up getting her a gift to make up for the things that happened it was a ring with a picture frame of me smiling with a little note saying how much ""I love her"" I ended up giving it to her and all she did was just toss it to a side, I just looked at her hoping at least she saw what I did for her with my heart. She didn't even care about it......then graduation came for elementary (I know it's not that important but as a child it was a big thing) I remember I told her that same morning that my graduation is today and I did a good job I got honors and awards, as the time came for it they called my name up and asked for my parents to come up to take a picture with me, and no surprise nobody was there for me... the kids laughed cause the principle kept saying for my parents stand up but nobody ever showed up.... as I grew to my teenage years my mom started dating at the time she would tell me things kept on mentally abusing me saying I wasn't worth anything that I won't make it out here crushed my dreams. I still remember alot of things I just don't wanna take up the whole space... up until now I have been battling my depression if I'm being honest I try my best everyday but I can't... I just hate this life I was given.... I sometimes do belive what people say I was a mistake I should've been gone.. it hurts I can't find love I can't find family heck I never even got a hug from.anyone never even had a im proud of you never had anyone actually hear me out im always the one to listen to everyone.... I'm tired if I'm honest life isn't so great........ I was blamed for everything I was all the bad things that happend to me is my fault.... I was brainwashed everything was my fault..... I legit have nothing but pain, anger and hate in my heart.... I wanna change I wanna feel peace I want happiness...... I want a family or friends or someone who actually cares for once.....

Family, got it.

Laugh and Smiles, surrounded by people all day, got it.

But I'm lonely.

I just want the girl for me. I get like this sometimes, then go back to saying fuck it, and update the tinder profile for hookups. But keep it normal enough in case I do find a girl to date. But it just...never happens. IDK what i am doing anymore. I get so excited thinking of futures with girls i find attractive. But they may not check messages and never respond. Or aren't ready emotionally and by the time they are, we have stopped talking.

All day today, I went to work, I was just sad and down. Put on a happy face for the most part. But at one time, I stopped working, looked around. I just stared at my warehouse job and just thought to myself. I am almost 24. I have had plenty of partners whether they were ongoing fun or one night stands but...no partner. Im waisting away. I KNOW i could treat someone right and be the right one. I could be the best BF they have had. I could do this and I could do that. But I am just here. Working a shitty schedule and a job i hate now. Idk maybe im not trying hard enough. I just..im just sad. I just want my someone. I want someone to tell me they missed me while i was at work. I want someone to send me tik toks while im at work to watch them on my break. I want to talk to them when i drive home. I want to love someone. But i havent found them yet. And sure, it will probably come. But it hasnt yet. I hate that im nearly 24 and just, alone. I feel alone. All these friends and all these partners and all my family. I feel alone. I want to cuddle, i want to kiss. I want to be with someone. I want to make them food. i want to drive them to a parking lot at night and dance in the headlights. I want all that shit. But cant find anyone.

I did end up changing my tinder bio up to not be for anything other than wanting to find the one. But we will see.

Today, my dog of almost 15 years was taken away from us. He's been a big part of my life, especially because he was there for almost three quarters of the time I've been alive for.
A lot of people never understood why I loved him so much but we've always been a pair, never doing things apart. We influenced each other so much and whenever I would feel down I would look at him and see his big goofy smile I would remember that everything would be alright. 
He was my joy and I'm so happy I got to spend time with him during his last moments. 
But now he's gone and not only do I feel like the one thing in my life I loved without hesitation isn't here but also it's starting to tear my family apart, as he was the anchor that brought us all together.
I'm not sure what my future holds but I'm sure there won't be a day that goes by that I won't be thinking of him.

I think that I suffer also of social anxiety.

The first times I made up some excuses and told him that I couldn't hang out those days because I was busy. He kept asking me to hang out and one day I accepted. We met maybe three or four times and then started to invite an other friend of his and introduced him to me. They taught me to play a game of cards wich I like and now, when we meet, we mainly play that game. This looks like what I longed for... But why do I keep not wanting to hang out with them?

This is even harder due to my very niche interest causing me hard to blend in with normal societies which I will feel 'tired' and boring.
Although my interest is wide but it's more commonly accepted in other countries

I like Marvel, DC, The Boys, Star Wars etc but it's rare to see Malaysian have interest in them outside of mainstream movies

I also like Ultraman, Kamen Rider basically Tokusatsu in general and again it's not common here, in fact people might think you are being childish for having interest in what they believe as a kid show

I am also a big anime fan, but due to my very niche taste in anime, most of the series I like such as Danganronpa, K, Monogatari etc are also uncommon to the people here which they majorly only watch mainstream show such as Demon Slayer, Spy x Family etc

I also played a lot of games, owning over thousand game on Steam but unfortunately most people are not open to niche game and only the mainstream one which in a sense I don't find much joy in talking about it. I give an example such as Warframe is very rare in Malaysia despite being one of the top played game

I feel like I cannot truly express myself to another person due to interest clashing.

562,wfakv9,SqammerFN,"Hey guys, I guess this is where we talk about our loneliness and see if anyone can relate? I’ve had depression and anxiety since my childhood, and ever since I turned 18 it would increasingly get worse every 6mo-yr. It went from, I hate my life, to planning when and how every single day. The truthful reason I probably haven’t yet is because I don’t want my family to be the ones to see my blood on the floor. It got really bad about 2yrs ago when my gf of 1 1/2 years cheated on me and broke up with me after I gave everything I had. No talks, just ended, after that the job was gone and my life was filled with blacking out and hoping I would go away while blacked out. I eventually got back on my feet but I still feel worse every day. I lie to people about what’s going on in my head because I don’t want to spend my days on medicine or in the looney bin. This depression has given me an extremely addictive personality and if I didn’t make good money I’d be in a box somewhere or dead. I hate people and don’t hang around my friends much anymore because I feel like everyone has some sort of ulterior motive. I don’t like making relationships with women around me because my little trust I had built with my ex gf was crushed. I’m in my mid 20s now and it won’t stop, the only thing that stops my evil thoughts is drinking. I can’t even tell it all on here because it really is that bad, which is probably another reason I feel you all would be better off without a human like me on earth walking around with thoughts I have. Is this my fate? Am I done?",2022-08-03 16:10:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,1535478134,5,/r/lonely/comments/wfakv9/impending_doom/,,0,1,Impending Doom

572,wfcj4a,PepsiMan_21,"Hi. I am a 28 year old introvert.

I just want to get this off my chest.

I broke a 4 year relationship with my boyfriend about 10 months ago, he was the only person that would talk/text me almost every day. The only person that hung out with me.

The past 10 months have been absolute misery.

I have very few friends, they're all married, they don't have time for me anymore. It's been around a year since we last hung out. I feel lonely every single day, no one talks to me, I just want someone to chat, the only people that acknowledge my existence are coworkers that text me about work non stop.

I find myself checking at my phone every 5 minutes to see if there's a notification, and when it does notify me it's merch e-mail. It is so anxiety inducing I have to turn off my phone, so I kill any expectation that anyone will talk to me, when I turn back my phone again after 2 or 3 hours, not a single person talked to me. I spend entire weekends alone, watching movies and eating snacks. I never get a ""Hello how you doing"". I keep telling myself ""That's how it is, you're all alone now, by yourself"". The only company I have is my pet cat that sits on my lap and sleeps on my bed.

I tried dating apps to meet people, but they can never keep an ongoing conversation. it's always ""How are you?"" ""Where r you from?"", then some random topic, after a few hours or next day they just lose complete interest.

I try picking topics with my friends, sharing videos, but they barely reply. I'm friendly, I'm smart, I'm polite, yet somehow I can't befriend anyone, neither online or at work, everyone knows me, but no one invites me to lunch, I sit by myself everyday, no one wants to hang out with me. I feel invisible, If those people didn't talk to me on work related stuff I think I would have snapped by now.

I cry myself to sleep often because if I died tomorrow no one would miss me. It fucking sucks and it's the worst feeling in the world.

I wonder if anyone else feel like this.",2022-08-03 17:25:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1597630124,2,/r/lonely/comments/wfcj4a/no_one_talksthink_of_me/,,0,1,No one talks/think of me

I have a lot of hobbies, which keep me occupied, my love of travelling for one! I am always out and about on the weekends exploring something new in London. But, sometimes i feel, what is the point, I do all this travelling, but I have no one to share it with. I also work out 4 days a week and do improv classes too.

He then turned around saying “so your saying you could care less?” Which was obviously not what it was. I just don’t know how to express it.. he then proceeded to tell my mom about what happened.

614,wfiesd,SalemKnightly,"All my life I had such shallow connections with people, because I’m shy and rambly and like to do stuff like parallel play as opposed to like public outings and walks and stuff.

Since I’m disabled, it’s hard to get out. Especially since I recently was almost abducted off the street.
So, I don’t go out without my bf.

I used to have a “bff” who gaslit me and abused me and ruined every relationship I had, just because she could.
So, I never had people try to be friends without her in the way.

When I finally got rid of her, I had no one for over a year.
The summer a year after grad, I met my friend who introduced me to my bf and his best friend.

So, I had three friends and then the first friend moved across the country and the best friend moved in with me and my bf.

He had drinking issues he still kinda has. 
When he’d get drunk, his other personalities would come out and try and k*ll me.
It’s hard to get past that hurt when he never addressed it.
Thankfully, he doesn’t drink hard liquor anymore. Just beer.

Plus he’s been staying on my couch unpaid for two years, so that caused so much poverty and tensions.
Thankfully, he has a job and is saving up for moving out.

I just want a good friend who won’t abuse me cuz they drink or because I don’t agree with them.

Whenever I try new friends, like on whisper, they try to fuck me or they ghost after a week for followers or whatever.
The other friend I made is in another country and she’s becoming so unhealthy and obsessive over her bf.
I don’t want unhealthiness in my life.
I had a rough life.

I just want a healthy friendship.
I just want to feel cared for.
My whole family moved across the country this year and I just don’t wanna feel alone anymore.

615,wfigsw,Odd_Ad1399," I want to preface this by saying that I'm don't pretend to complain about women in this post or anything like that! Everyone is free to want to be with whoever they want!

As the title says, I feel like most of the times something happens with a girl, they weren't really interested in me, just physically attracted. Now obviosly if I'm at the club with some friends I also don't expect to get to know a lot of people at a club.

But the thing is that this happens to me when meeting new people through friends, etc. I am a very shy person at first and it takes a bit for friends to get to know me, but still sometimes some of these friends start flirting without knowing me at all, sometimes I've barely said anything, and still if I go for it...well you know.

I've been obese most of my life and didn't take care of myself, these last years I lost weight bla bla bla you know the story. Now, I still don't feel like this as someone with a lot of self-steem problems, but I've been told by a lot of friends that I am good looking, and having my obese times as a reference, I can notice a stark difference when being out in clubs/bar, there's a lot of eye contact or girls even coming directly to talk.

Lately I have honestly been ignoring flirting and these kind of situations because as I'm trying to say with this whole post, these situations make me feel kinda sad, like people aren't really interested in me because of my personality, and I feel like it's hard to tell if they just one a fun night (fair enough, each can do as they want with their life) or they're actually interested in me as a person.

Now don't get me wrong, I also care about looks and are influenced a lot by it, but if I don't feel like there's some chemistry with the other person, I'm not really interested in hooking up and stuff.

As a person with self steem problems who thinks I am not a very interesting person, these situations just make things worse for me.

Idk just needed to vent and see if anyone feels like this/what do they think?

629,wfjqn2,Own_Discipline2351,I’m 28 and I just moved back home 2 months ago. I was living in a pretty toxic situation for two years with my son’s dad. I found out he cheated on me a month into moving in together but still decided to stay to try and work on it. Needless to say I wasted five years of my life but at least I have my son. While we were living together I paid all of the rent not just a portion all. The lights were also in my name the only bill he was responsible for was our Wi-Fi which got cut off frequently. I made the decision to choose myself and my son and decided not to renew our lease. Everything took a really big mental toll on me when I first moved and I ended up getting fired from my job. I also work for myself as a cake decorator so I’ve been using that as my main source of income at the moment. But this is hard..I feel like I’m starting back at square one..which I am. I don’t know what programs or assistance I could apply for to get my own place with my son. All I can do is rebuild of my bank account but first I need a new job. I feel defeated and used and I’m trying really hard every day to find a purpose in getting up. Moving back home has made it 100 times harder for me to run my business due to the lack of space. My brother doesn’t clean up after himself and he’s 25 . I frequently have to ask him to flush his feces down the toilet because he leaves them there. My dad is pretty inconsiderate too. And the time since I’ve been here I’ve had to give out $1800. I pay my dad my car note every month to put towards a loan he took out against my car and I found out he was not paying it on time and my car got repossessed. I thought coming home would be my best alternative but honestly I really don’t know anymore.,2022-08-03 22:14:45,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611881350,2,/r/lonely/comments/wfjqn2/really_need_my_own_place/,,0,2,Really need my own place

640,wfldap,Bitter-Metal5620,"I feel trapped. I think I'm more in this relationship because I feel terrified when I'm alone. I have loved my BF at some point over the last 5 years together, definitely during the first few years. But the feelings of deep passion have faded. We've inadvertently hurt each other multiple times (as well as taken revenge). We both have excessive baggage that we've brought to the relationship (past traumas, I'm an alcoholic and a codependent, he's a heroin addict trying to stay clean with extensive childhood trauma). 

Sometimes I get a feeling that he is hiding something from me. Today I saw old behavior patterns from him that in the past have been tied with using/cheating/lying. But I don't have proof. I brought it up anyways, knowing full well that if he is hiding something,  he will be defensive and if he is not hiding anything he will be defensive about being accused of something he's not doing. It didn't go very well. 

I trust my instincts more than I trust him. Part of me wants him gone while the other part of me does not want to be alone. I have done therapy, EMDR, inner child work, AA, Al-Anon, ACA and more for myself over the last few years. All very helpful, but the trapped feeling still gets the better of me.

I just hope that I can come across genuine people, because apparently there can be creepy people here with ill intentions. 

I (21f) feel like I’ve had some degree of depression since elementary school. Some “friends” would gossip about me, make fun of me, exclude me. I also had (and still have) family issues — overprotective parent with toxic behaviours, sibling with mental illness. I felt like I had to mature quickly as a kid and it affected my ability to socialize with others. This obviously took a toll on my self-esteem which then carried over to high school where I was pretty much a loner. I just put my head down and focused on my studies. I tried to make friendships but we didn’t click and most didn’t last long. 

Fast forward to university, I still haven’t made super close friendships. I feel like it’s 100% my fault. I haven’t had a friend group to go out and socialize with. I don’t know how to socialize. I don’t have anything to say anymore. This is one of my biggest insecurities because I used to be sharp. But now my brain feels so slow and quite empty lol. It might be due to the depression. When I was depressed I spent my time doing pointless things. So now I’m suffering the effects of it. I don’t use Instagram (probably bc I’m insecure.) I stopped using it since high school and never looked back (this makes me seem odd, right?). When I tell people this, they get turned off by it. I feel like it deters me from making connections and makes me even more alone. 

So yeah, I don’t have any close friends. I miss that feeling of endless conversations and laughing with them until my stomach hurts. I’ve never been in a relationship either. I wish I had a s/o to comfort me but realistically, I’m not in a good state mentally to be in a relationship. 

What I’m up to right now is working on myself. I want to change for the better and I need to start now. I’ve been starting to go to the gym often. I also want to start learning about different things outside of what I’m studying, I want to read more, start a new hobby, I just want to be interesting. I want to enjoy my own company because we have to learn to prioritize ourselves. I’m starting this new chapter in my life and it’s all about healing and re-inventing myself.

646,wfmszl,Fantastic_Nobody_902,"Sitting here at 30 years old and I can’t help but wonder what could’ve been if I just told that one person how I really felt. Had a crush on this individual since the third grade, but never had the courage to tell them. Literally had a decade (all the way thru High School) to say something, but I never did. I would say I was a very popular individual at my High School; never had issues socializing or issues talking to the opposite sex. Dated a few people in High School, but never told this person how I felt. I truly feel that the feelings were mutual, but neither of us ever said anything. It bothers me because there were so many signs, and I didn’t take advantage. If the current circumstances were different, I would for sure tell this individual how I felt (would’ve said something the last 10 years), but the circumstances on both sides will never allow for these true feelings to come out. 

This person looks to be happily married with a family while I’m completely alone (I chose the wrong girl at 18 years old and paid for it with my life. Her actions have left me as a quadriplegic for the last 10 years). The moral of my little story here is to always go with your gut feeling regarding everything in life.

655,wfoccu,weirdinid,"so like 1 month ago, my best friend and the person I slowly fell in love with told me that she doesn't want to continue our friendship anymore, and the reason for it goes like this ""You care too much for me, but I cannot do the same and I feel bad about being unable to do the same thing, so Im leaving"", such  a dumb reason you think? Yeah, I agree with you. We used to talk every single day for 1 year with each other but it seems like she was just bored and used to be friend with me for that time. She made me feel loved and used to talk me a lot, thats the main reason I probably feel in love with her. Right now Im trying my best to move on, I had so many suicide thoughts in my head and I still do sometimes but I keep trying my best to avoid them, the most interesting thing is she probably don't care about this anymore, probably forgot about it. I just hope that she and every other person who gets people attached to them and leave them after some time just because they can, I hope they have the same thing happening to them. 

My advice: do not get attached to people and do not expect much from them, everyone leaves besides your siblings and parents. If they don't try as hard as you do, stop trying and move on while it's still early.",2022-08-04 01:38:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654706210,1,/r/lonely/comments/wfoccu/vent_and_advice_for_yall/,,0,3,Vent and advice for y'all

The dating side is still trash I went to a few first dates but nothing never stick to the pan so I ditch the apps for awhile.  At the age where I am now (21m) this is when typically most people start finding their potential parter or maybe husband and wife. But for me it hasn't gone that way, I could go all day with dating fails but there isn't no need for that. I am just glad that I am putting myself out there and shooting my shot because at least in the end of the day you know you tried. I started becoming more physically active, been playing soccer a lot recently more and skateboarding around the city when I have the chance.

710,wftvsg,AdministrationNo3470,"Hello, My name is Joseph Benitez, I am 14 and going to be a freshman. I will give you the chronological order of my life. :)

Early: I was little but even then I could hear my parents fight, alot. My mom was addict. My dad, was abused alot as a child but strict as hell, he never really gave up on me and my brothers though, we were brought to my grandparents at a early age roughly 4-5 years old thats when I first started to feel depressed (Probably sounds silly). I felt like I needed a mom and that when I turned 7

Mid: My dad found my step mom and thats when Me and my brothers finally had a home, a real home. Ir so we thought I was regulary abused by my sister whom never got in trouble because I felt like a sell-out everytime I told on anybody which is practically never. It was OK though until roughly six years later.

~Presentish: My dad cheated on my step-mom with a whore (cam girl) We moved out into a apartment, thats when my mental health seriously declined (My mental health was slowly declining more in the past years) , this was the breaking point i felt like killing myself and almost did a couple of times, long story short my dad was gone for days at a time without a trace just me and my two brothers home alone for weeks. My dad finally got the offer of a lifetime with my step-mom and ""ended things"" with the other girl. It was a week before my dad cheated again. My dad took me and my little brother but left my older brother ""19 yrs old"" this is the first yime me and my brothers have been seriously split up. That brings me to the present my dad told us we cant talk to my step-mom anymore. I am furious at my dad but I don't want to tell him because he thinks the other girl is the ""one"" and he says for the first time he says he is actually happy with a woman. There was a girl back home who I realy liked and she really did understand me it may seem silly but I dont even have her number, Ive been fighting tooth and nail to find it but no luck.

721,wfvhcn,ThatTrainFan,"My love life sucks. 
I’m a 26 year old male and have only decided since the start of 2022 that I want a serious relationship. 

In early April, me and a girl I liked started sending ‘flirty’ messages to each other. I accidentally revealed the details of one of these messages to a mutual friend and that was the final nail in that potential relationships’ coffin.

In mid-May, in an attempt to get over the previous failed attempt I found this other girl I liked and have done for a long time from afar. I let her know I liked her and she said that she’d prefer to be ‘friends for now’ to which I thought ‘fair enough’. A couple of nights ago though I found out she liked this other guy (who is a friend of mine) and he likes her back. Since then I’ve been in a massive downwards spiral and convinced that the world doesn’t want me to be happy with someone.

All 3 of those people mentioned above as good friends of mine and quite supportive of me attempting to ignite the flames of a relationship.

I was someone who was quite shy and slowly became more confident over the past few years. I’m concerned that these setbacks will basically eradicate that progression and push me way back into my ‘shell’. 
I know I’m my current state of mind, I’m likely to push people away. It’s something I’ve done within previous friendship groups when there’s been some issue and I’ve taken some time for myself to allow me to express emotion in my own terms as opposed to showing other that emotion.

Those things aside, lots of people have said that I’m a ‘good person/good egg’ some even going so far as to say that I’d make an ‘excellent dad or brilliant husband/boyfriend’ yet it doesn’t feel like it. If I’m such a good person why has no-one considered me good enough to accept me for being me and start a relationship? Is it they will all consider me only as a friend? Even with so many people looking out for me, I will feel lonely as I’m missing the one thing that I’m currently looking for: love.",2022-08-04 08:09:25,lonely,t5_2qjny,1511051337,1,/r/lonely/comments/wfvhcn/i_just_want_to_be_loved_by_someone_ventrant/,,0,0,I just want to be loved by someone.

I prefer just listening to other people talk, but I usually don't have a response to give or anything to contribute which bothers most people. And even then I'd rather just sit in silence and enjoy some company, maybe listen to music or watch some movies and not say a single word. Some repressed part of me yearns to find that one person I could do that with, while the logical part of me knows that it will most likely never be a reality. I crave innocent and platonic intimacy without any sexual connotations, but I lack the drive to attempt to find someone willing to engage in that kind of relationship, nor do I even know where I would look. I simply do not have the energy that people expect from me. All of the days blur together and I can hardly form coherent thoughts or memories.

Throughout my life, I had always been a lonely person. I had no friends in school and would sit down and mind my own business or stare into outer space. I didn't talk with anyone at all.


It was painful, but it was manageable. I could distract myself from this painful loneliness by doing something else.


However this year, it changed. I made a great friend recently. Even though I stutter so much, am a really boring person, who's mouth is usually shut for most of the convos or when I do speak, nonsense comes out,
She accepted me for being me.



Eventually, I found myself being able to talk normally to her. My conversations were smoother. Of course still wasn't great but hey at least it was something.



.


She chose to sit next to me in class which meant so much to me and really appreciated.




But recently she's been changing seats and she would find another group of friends to talk to.





A few minutes of being with them eventually turned into hours of convos and being with them for the whole day at school.



Each second she is away, a feeling of loneliness and pain in my heart would come up. Eventually it almost felt like my heart would burst.





She's a person with a lot of friends and so it feels like I am replaceable at any second. If I was gone she wouldn't mind and I'm sure she has many many friends that could easily replace me.



But if she was gone, I would have to sit down all alone, minding my own business and staring into outer space again in school again and endure the loneliness again.




Our chat convos used to be so fun. It used to be a send message and it be read immediately and I would soon receive a reply in a few secs. I like to call it the blue tick convos.


Now she responds fast (in about 10-30 mins) however this is for EVERY message I send. The thing is she's online the whole time and the responses usually end up being dry and it feels like she doesn't want to talk to me.


Now the so called blue tick convos never happen anymore. I tried to think of topics and try to start conversations but it was all for naught.


The whole 10-30 mins of the time I would wait while staring at the online status wondering if she would reply soon. And when she did, it would be usually a one sentence convo.


And then she would go offline.




I tried to make other friends but it just wasn't the same. I was stuttering again scrambling for ideas on what to say.
It wasn't fun and was awkward talking to other people.



It didn't feel this painful when I was alone. It feels like an angel descended from heaven just to show me a ray of light, a glimmer of hope, only for it to disappear. Just knowing that it was what I could've had and that such a light existed and that I couldn't grab hold of it hurts and is so frustrating.






At this point I don't know what to do anymore. Should I confront her about it? That seems like such a selfish and a dick move to do. She could be busy and even if she wasn't, who's to say that she HAS to reply to my messages fast.



Should I just accept that she doesn't really want to talk to me and do the same thing I'm doing (Trying my best to start convos)?



Should I not put in this much effort for her? Should my responses also take 10-30 mins instead of instant?


Should I try to find new friends? Should I try to absorb myself in my hobbies to distract myself?

I know that if i reach out to them, they would likely respond. But im tired of being the one trying to hang out, to start conversations. I feel ignored by everybody around me.

But emotionally, i feel distant from everybody. Isolated. I dont feel like im connected to any of them. Like if i were to dissappear for any amount of time, i would hardly be a thought for them.

Im usually able to bury these emotions down, but today.....today they just want out, and it hurts.

I just want to feel wanted. Its been a lifetime since ive felt that way. If i opened up about any of this though, id just be told that it isnt the case, that they know my emotions better than myself.

743,wfz2nl,Old-Club9984,"I have a small group of friends, maybe 4 or 5 in total. Out of that, there's really only one person who cares about me. More than the others at least. Other than small-talk with me, the rest don't really care about how I'm feeling or what I'm doing. They actively ignore what I say most of the time, and my absence from their group hasn't really changed their attitude towards me. The only thing keeping the ever so feeble string between me and them is the fact that sometimes they do care. Their behaviour towards me changes sometimes, and it makes me want to believe that I'm just overthinking things, and shouldn't expect myself to be treated like a king.

Nonetheless, they go out a lot and send me pics when they hangout. Never did they invite me. Or take my feelings into considerance. It's as if they're oblivious to the entire thing sometimes.

I'm not introverted in the truest sense, and I have made multiple attempts to find others I could talk to. Form bonds with. But I get rejected every time. And this isn't rejection in a romantic sense, I mean rejection as in the 'you're not even worth sending a message to' feeling you get from people you just tried to chat with.

I don't have anybody to confide my feelings to. I've never hung out with anyone my entire life. I wake up every morning, hoping someone messaged me. Hoping someone bothered to check on me, even if it was just a random meme or funny video. But in the last few months, no one has ever done that. Not a single one.

749,wfzs5y,Afoolfortheeons,"Oh God, I troll too much. Yesterday I was bored and unmotivated to work on my book because I'm at the chapter where I start to talk about the cult I was in, and that's going to be difficult because so much happened in a short time, so I decided to make a post about how meth is spiritual on r/psychonaut. The first draft of the post made it obviously out to be me trolling, but I revised it so it was pretty apparent if you questioned some things I said, but the average person, in all their infinite wisdom, would fall for my ridiculous premise of a post. Fun was had educating the vocal naysayers in the comments about the CIA and other zany topics. 

I don't know why I'm drawn so much to trolling. I think part of it is compensation for my once poor social skills in order to socialize to some degree. I used to be a bad troll, way before I found my home subreddit of people similar to myself, which was seven years ago. I would try to break people, usually by creating infuriating arguments while insulting them with a cutting tongue. I wasn't always a moral person I guess. 

But now it's a matter of trying to educate and entertain others in a divergent manner. I love when I can flip somebody from being triggered and negative to when we both are having fun. Had a dude ask me about hearing aliens from meth psychosis yesterday, and I regaled him with all my crazy theories about how an extraterrestrial hivemind is interacting with humanity through the internet. He was receptive and polite, so I dropped the facade and we exchanged pleasantries before parting ways.

That's how I like to socialize now. I'm not much for making friends the traditional way, like chatting and jumping through hoops for each other. I dunno, I'm just weird, I guess. I'm not much of a social creature to begin with, yet at the same time I get lonely at times because I don't normally form close bonds with people. I guess I don't like opening up and being vulnerable with people typically. I'm a shallow person who uses absurd humor to patch the gap between being likable and actually being liked.

It makes me feel good that I'm able to be an inspirational figure for some of the people on my home subreddit and make them laugh on occasion. But, I'd love it if that led to making real friends. I have positive interactions and associates in the community, but I feel as if I'm just a hollow figurehead. I don't feel like a real person. I'm just a robot who can say the words, but I don't really have the full experience that an actual human being might.

What do people really think of me? I'm genuinely curious. I feel like I'm just putting on a puppet show for people. There's no real substance to me. I got shitposts, but there's no soul. I'm lonely I guess is what I'm saying. Since the start of the sub I mentioned, I'd hope to make the close friends that I always dreamed of. I got one, and he's the best ever. I consider some other people to be friends, but I don't know if they consider me a friend.

I'm going to use an example that still strikes me as painful. In what I think was a group chat where someone said they were traveling to America, a person I consider a good friend that I've known for years would talk with them and come to say that he has a homie in Tennessee. Homie; singular, meaning my friend and roommate who is a closer friend with him. Am I not a homie? We talk fairly frequently, but I guess there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just not good enough to be his friend. 

I dunno. I'm kinda sad now. Reflecting on a lifetime of feeling like a subhuman defect right now. It's always been this way. Kids didn't want to be my friend. My mom had to make playdates with their moms and coach me on how to make friends. I remember we would rehearse what to say with a pencil and notebook in order to get other kids' phone numbers. I remember her trying to get me to start a club so I could integrate with a number of my fellow students. I remember always being wrong and feeling like no one ever told me the rules of how the other kids were playing. I was always in my own little, defected world. 

Sigh…This double edged sword of a brain really hurts sometimes. It's great being a fucking genius, but sometimes I'd like to trade a few brain cells to be more loved. My friend had this same issue, but different. He openly welcomed brain damage from huffing because he surmised that it might make him more like other people. I think it hurt him in other ways. There's no escape from this curse. This is how life is for me. Just gotta accept it to transcend the suffering of it I guess. 

And I do that, to the point of openly embracing my strengths to compensate for my shortcomings. So, here's to me shitting out content by the day, and playing alternative social games like trolling. This is how I'm meant to be. And that's ok. I love myself, and I know that if I try hard enough, I can almost block out the pain I feel from simply being me.",2022-08-04 12:17:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630099080,2,/r/lonely/comments/wfzs5y/im_sad_right_now_but_thats_alright_i_dont_need_a/,,0,0,"I'm sad right now, but that's alright.

750,wg06b9,Prometheusatitangod,"I am so tired of being worse then anyones worse case scenario. Seeing people say I am 20-30 and haven't had a girlfriend in 1-3 years. I am always like ok sure I feel your pain but I am 51 never had a girlfriend haven't even been touched in a romantic/ sexual way except for once like 31 years ago and it was not sex not . It was an attempt to manipulate me into getting someone a green card.  I figured if I refused and she was still into me I would possibly have done it. But when I refused she stopped a became mega bitch bent on destroying my life . 
Dodge a bullet there lol 
I have always been a good judge of character and always saw threw people bullcrap . It's a super power that's a gift and a curse.  Every time I approach a woman.  Within a single glance I know she not into me.  While most dudes either out of desperation or pervoto will walk around with swagger thinking yeah I 200lbs overweight smell like garbage dressed in clothes that don't fit or match I got at Walmart in the discount section.  Yeah I stand a chance with this super model looking girl.  Umm noo no you don't.  I may be old now but I am muscular fit tall and even at 51 have a full head of thick hair . I very self-confidence and I can't get any woman to give me the time of day . 
So I don't look like someone who has gone decades without any luck with women.  So I always hear men whining about going months without sex seeing them acting crazy.  Like at a party once heard two associates talking about how men go gay in prison after a few years of not having a woman.  I said please if they go gay in jail by choice not because they got rapped.  But willing said ok I'll just have gay sex now . If they do that they are and always were on some level gay already.  
The associates said no but some guys have been in for like 15-20 years now one goes that long without sex with a woman a not think about going gay . I said please, it's been 31 years since I was even touched anything close to sexilual and I never once thought of going gay . Why because I not gay . I don't care if someone is that's who they are.  It's not me I love women I am only attracted to women.  Even after decades nothing changes that . 
The two associates stood there with there moths agape speechless.

I know a lot of people complain about getting ghosted, but I've noticed nearly everyone does it themselves and I don't understand why. Please don't message me if you're going to disappear after one conversation or if you're a pervert.

I'm a graphic designer and Illustrator looking for someone with whom I can talk to, game with occasionally, and have a good laugh with. Not in the mood for a rushed dopamine fest and then we become strangers overnight.

I'm a funny, caring, bold, creative person and there's more to me than I can type. Some of my hobbies include: gaming (mainly fps), cooking, jewelry making, woodwork, crocheting, and swimming. I mostly play Power Wash Simulator at the moment and I'm open to try new games too.

786,wg8789,DentonMethod,"    I'm a 27 yrs old man who in the past five or four years hasn't been very outgoing, barely have any friends, in fact I spend a lot of time alone, just going to work, playing video games or watching football in my spare time. One of my favorite bands, Slipknot came to my country few days ago and I decided I absolutely must go. Last time I went to a concert was six years ago when I was in college. Attending this show was one of the few instances when I went out of my comfort zone in the past years. 

    Like I said I don't have friends to go with so I went alone and during this time I couldn't help noticing that everyone was part of a friends group or came with their partner/lover. Felt like I was the only one who came solo and  all eyes were on me, like 'look at this looser, came with no friends, you should stay indoors'(I know I was getting paranoid, was all in my head but I still I couldn't shake this feeling). I felt much better only after the sun set which happened shortly after Slipknot showed up and was able to fully enjoy the experience. 


   Overall, I'm glad I decided to go, it was better than I expected, but still, I wish I had at least one person to go with, must be cool to experience this kind of things with someone who have the same passion and interests as you. I could've probably made some friends that night or socialize with someone but after years of being socially awkward and not getting out of my comfort zone I'm afraid it wasn't possible. 
   Idk why I felt posting this, I don't use Reddit too often, maybe curious to see if someone went through something similar. Thanks if you took your time to read it.",2022-08-04 18:16:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648225886,7,/r/lonely/comments/wg8789/i_went_to_an_awesome_concert_alone_it_sucks_when/,,0,6,I went to an awesome concert... alone.

791,wg9rxs,Sun2R1se,"I don’t know how to start it, but I feel pretty ignored or treated badly in my family.

Before, when anyone cried, they were all on that person

Now when it’s me, they don’t care, they don’t ask or anything. Just ignore…

The other day, I was sick so my emotions were wild, uncontrolled. I screamed at my sister, and she went in her room crying. My siblings started to take care of her, and completely forgot about me. I cried so much.

It wasn’t as bad at the day before. So much things happened the only I thought about was… you know. I went out and walked away from there, my mother went to get me and screamed at me, ignoring why I did that. My father? He doesn’t do anything about my mental health, never ask or even do anything at all! 

The next day, I went out, and when my mom came out, I panicked and ran away, bare foot. I ran the whole street. I have difficulty breathing because I used to wear a binder, and I have knee problems.

Where I live, things for help, like diagnosis and professional help can take up to 2 years for you to get it. 

They proposed that they call someone to help my relationship with my father, I said idk, but I’ll be 18 or near when it’ll be our turn. And they said that they need second confirmation. I’ll say no, clearly. My bf knows, and really wants me to live with him whenever I could. 

My parents often say that theirs never cared about them. Mine did, and they left when we moved out.. 

My siblings hardly acknowledge my feelings. 

All I think about is leaving in the middle of the night and never coming back.

Everyone was already talking to eachother so I just stood there for a while. I was feeling like they don't want me there and I had nothing to talk about with anybody, despite knowing all of them for over 6 years, so I left to sit by a nearby lake. I felt less lonely when I was alone than when I was around them. Few guys found me there and talked to me. I know they came to help me, but I can't stop feeling like they just wanted to be kind and actually didn't care. After few hours, I came back. There were even more people having  fun and talking to eachother. I just sat there till I went home feeling like I know none of them. I don't think they noticed when I left.

I ended up spending like 5 hours just being quite around people having fun.

My grandmother was my rapist and she groomed me to not speak. The thing is, I’d tell on her for raping me, but no one would even listen.

My paternal grandmother didn’t like me much either. She always compared me to my female cousin and never talked.

848,wghpob,Significant-Sun4654,"A few years ago I separated myself from my only group of friends, as I’d come to meet a girl who I felt was the only person I needed at the time. “Friends” being a loose group of guys that make jokes at each others detriment for an easy laugh. I’m talking jokes about parents divorcing or just the nastiest thing that could be though of. I was second to last at the bottom of that food chain. I spent about 6 months in complete solidarity, as Covid had taken me out of school. The only people I spoke to in a day were my parents as they got home from work. I hadn’t become suicidal by any means, but I had lost all regard for my own safety. Every once and a while I’d catch myself rolling through a stop sign hoping someone would meet me in the middle. This culminated in me buying a motorcycle as I felt that after. Full day of riding, if I came home alive it was because I wasn’t meant to go yet. I told my mom about how I was feeling on a Sunday. She had a doctors appointment set for me by lunch that next day. I walked out of the doctors office with a prescription for anti depressants, and a text on my phone from a guy I didn’t talk to a whole lot. He wanted to know if I’d heard from one of my old friends. That old friend was at the bottom of the food chain in terms of who got picked on every night when we would get on to play games. It wasn’t even picking, it was full on bullying. It had probably been a year since he’d figured out the trend. He just sat relatively quiet at the lunch table every day and maybe spoke up quietly every once and a while (I assume to avoid incurring the wrath of the teenage boys who were just looking for something easy to turn in to a joke). I won’t act like I didn’t participate, but every time he was gone to attention turned to me, and I soon realized how he must have felt. The day that I was at the doctors office because I felt alone, he made it through his day at school, to go home and take his life in a deer stand later that night. The search party consisted of me, some of his other friends, and the group of guys who I hadn’t spoken to in months without ever telling why. They cried when they found out, but I don’t think anyone learned anything. This happens nearly two years ago. Since then I’ve made little to know genuine connections with anyone, but I’ve made my way back around to my old group of friends. It’s the same as it’s always been, like a competition to see if they can top how bad they made me feel the night before. I carried a heavy regret for how I had treated my old friend even before his passing, and it’s something I’ll never be able to get rid of. The only thing that has kept me going since the end of my school year is the prayer that I’ll meet someone, anyone, when I move four hours away from home at the end of August. I feel as though I have no one in my life that cares if I make it through my day, and I’m petrified it will be the same way at college. Sometimes I cant help but wonder if I deserve it after all I put my old friend through. I hope he sees the obituary I keep in my car, and the framed picture of us I keep beside my bed. I hope he knows how sorry I am. I hope I find a friend soon.",2022-08-05 01:07:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/wghpob/all_i_have_is_my_hope_for_the_future/,,0,0,All I have is my hope for the future

#IF THEY WANTED TO, THEN THEY WOULD

Let’s be real. Who isn’t on their phone most of the time? There’s 24 hours in a day and you think I believe you didn’t open the message app at least once? You can post on Instagram, but not reply to the message I sent you two Tuesdays ago? Whatever. People are practically glued to their phones (including myself). And if no one wants to hang out with me or text back—so be it.

I can’t force them to. It does bug me and make me want to cry, but I remember everything that I’ve been through so far. I lived without them once, and I can do it again. So can you.

I’m not the coolest person ever, but I’m smart, funny, sweet, and a lot of other things too. So are you, though! I know it’s easier said than done, but don’t allow people to dampen your views on friendship and love.

One day, us lonely people might meet another best friend or another lover or another friend. Actually, we *will*. There’s nearly 8 billion people on this planet and you’ll find what you’ve been looking for. Whether it be someone to watch horro movies with or someone to  drive with late at night.

871,wgju9z,Nickdog8891,"Hey there, I hope you are having an ok day. 

My goal with this post is pretty simple, I'm just hoping to chat with someone, and see if it can turn into a friendship.  I'm pretty isolated at times, and I don't have anyone I regularly talk to, and it weighs on me.  

I can get along with anyone, but I tend to click better with women, I'm not sure why.  (But I know the internet is full of creeps, so I totally get being careful!)

A little about me seems fair.  I like gaming, whether its video games or board games, I'm a fan of sci-fi, and my go to movies or TV shows are usually action or comedy. 

If you are at all interested in chatting, leave me a comment or message!  Thanks",2022-08-05 02:47:30,lonely,t5_2qjny,1527669379,2,/r/lonely/comments/wgju9z/just_looking_to_connect/,,0,3,Just looking to connect
872,wgjup8,[deleted],"In my mind everyone only cares about themselves which is good. However I also believe everyone is jealous of each other as well. This kind of mindset makes it hard for me to make new friends. Even the old ones aren’t to be trusted. I wish I had friends who I can trust like family but with all my friends id hide my wallet during a sleepover. Thats the type of trust issues I have. The reason I need friends is who will come to my wedding if I have one besides my family, who will I add on social media if I decide to ever go back. Im living this miserable life where im a virgin and have no friends to hang out with and on top of that my very own personality is whats keeping me back from making friends. I just need some way to know whos truly a friend, and how I can find new friends at this age of 23?",2022-08-05 02:48:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,,15,/r/lonely/comments/wgjup8/how_can_i_make_friends_at_the_age_of_23_with/,,0,25,How can I make friends at the age of 23 with trust issues?

I’m so lonely and I feel like there is no point to my life, all I do is sit in my room and play video games with my friends, but when I’m done with that I text and talk to no one. I’m 17 and I feel like everyone else in my life is so much ahead of me, they have jobs, or they can drive, or they have girlfriends, I don’t have anything I can feel proud of myself, I’m on a team at school but I literally hate almost everyone on the team except for like 4 of them, and i still find those four a bit annoying.

886,wgm1ev,MakeItFast2020,"My life is in complete shambles. I’m closing in on 40, I’m overweight, bald, have very few friends, don’t see or talk to my family as often as I’d like, have a few grand in the bank and need periodic help from my father to keep up with the cost of living. I gave up chasing my dream job because I’m lazy and didn’t want to put in the grind to get where I wanted to go. I have no life insurance, no stocks, no 401K, no savings. My house is basically my only asset. I changed careers to something “easy” that obviously doesn’t pay great and told myself it’s because I wanted to settle down and start a family. I married an alcoholic and compulsive liar, who ended up making life a drunken hell, went to rehab, and started sleeping with someone she met there. She brought this man into our marital bed every chance she got, even after I found out, and that only stopped because she was going to be kicked out of the house by the courts and him not being on the property was a condition of her staying in the house. Since then, she’s left every single weekend to go off and be with this other man while I’ve been left at home to take care of our five year old daughter and wait for the divorce process to play out. She leaves before I get home on Friday and walks in on Sunday like it’s the most normal thing in the world. 

At work, I smile through the day, but all I hear are stories about everyone’s families - husbands, children, people going on maternity leave - and think about how that’s all been ripped away from me. No one is telling cute stories about me or things I did for them or the family. There are no siblings for my daughter to learn and experience life with. I’m all she’s got, sad to say. I feel terrible for her for getting dealt such a lousy hand. I’m reminded constantly on social media of people with their families and their spouses and their kids and their trips, and I feel like my life is basically one note and more or less over. I have no prospects for more family. I have no money for fancy trips. 

People I was colleagues with in my past profession have reached the pinnacle I dreamt of years ago. They’re there and I’m not. I’m reminded of their success constantly. I have no one to blame but myself, but I have no way to make up for past mistakes. The job involves traveling and odd hours, and that’s something I’m not in position to do as sole guardian and eventual custody plan, and probably never will be.

At night, either me or my “wife” puts our daughter to bed. If she does it she stays upstairs and goes to sleep. If I do it, she goes to bed herself before I finish. Every single night I am alone with no one to talk to, nothing to look forward to, no plans to make. Dating apps just serve to remind me how unwanted I am. The few that do respond typically ghost within a day or two. Every single I meet in the real world is either married, engaged, or has a boyfriend. Just as well, as I have absolutely nothing to offer them anyway. A broken family, a pale, obese, bald physique, and a few bucks. Awesome. The ladies sure are jumping at that.

If it wasn’t for my daughter I don’t know where I’d be right now. I don’t see any point to any of this if she wasn’t in the picture. I’m barely a blip on the radar to the vast majority of people, including the people I’d consider “close.” I don’t reach out and no one reaches out to me. If I wasn’t here, no one except my little girl would notice.

What the fuck am I supposed to do. I want to hit reset because everything is too fucked up to salvage. My life needs to be burnt to the ground and demoed. There’s no saving this. I’m the single suckiest, most toxic, worthless person I know. Can someone tell me: WHAT’S THE POINT!?!? Yeah, my kid, of course. But she’s just going to grow up and eventually see me for the loser I am. I am wasting my life and it’s at least half over.

Not like I ever was one, because if I was, then somebody would have let me know by now. But like, my wrist hurts for no fucking reason. I have a rib that dislocated and apparently will just never feel right again. I can't jog in place (which means I can't play ring fit adventure, what I was hoping to do to be more active) or jump rope or anything because my ankles damn near die after a couple consecutive days. My hair is falling out, so much that I'm too scared to brush it. I have a fucking varicose vein in my leg. A varicose vein!!!! I'm only twenty fucking three. Just what the fuck am I gonna be at 30, or 40?!

My therapist (who is in his late fifties) tries to console me when I get like this. He uses himself as an example, cuz he didn't ever date until he was like 40. Wtf am I supposed to do with that? Be satisfied? Be happy that I'll have to burn the best half of my life away just so I *might* be able to spend the last half rotting with someone I love? That doesn't make me feel better!!! I wanted someone when I 14! I've been cognizant of this issue as long as I've been interested in romance at all. Knowing that, hey, maybe something fuckin off the wall crazy will happen nd somebody will love the rotting piece of shit you are doesn't make me feel better, it makes me more angry!!!!! If there really is anyone out there with whom I could be happy, then I'm wasting my time with them. I'm throwing it away, and there's dick I can do about it because love isn't a one way street. It doesn't matter one fucking iota how I feel about anyone. It literally could not matter less, cuz I'm desperate enough to love whoever the fuck smiles at me first. But not one goddamned person on this godforsaken rock deems me worthy of their affection, so I stay alone. It would almost be more cruel if I did find someone who loved me long after I was in my prime. I'd have just enough time and ability left with them to regret what I never got to have with them.

I'm so fucking done with this. If this is some game some higher dimensional version of me is playing in the higher dimensional arcade, I hope to fucking god he learned his lesson and never sets foot in that shithole again. This place sucks, and it just gets worse the longer you stay. You get less free time, more responsibility for things you dont give two fucks about, and --unless you're lucky enough to find somebody or not give a shit about finding somebody -- no higher reason for being here than animalistic pleasure and distraction

There's nothing I wanna do here. There's not one goddammed thing here that makes me actually want to get out of bed in the morning.

So I can learn Japanese or calculus or chemistry and have fucking nobody to talk about it with???

911,wgpi91,Turbulent-Toe885,"I(M18) work at a retail store, it’s the kind of place that you can go hours without seeing anyone. I work entirely alone, no one but me runs the store, it gets very lonely and it’s recently been very mentally exhausting doing mundane tasks and having no human interaction.

Today I was pricing and putting out new clothes, it was a sweater of some kind, however it had this smell, the same smell my first serious girlfriend had. 

We dated for 5 years, most of middle school and half of high school. I loved her, and I guess I still do, but it’s not the same type of love anymore. We broke up 2 years ago, since then I’ve had other serious relationships, none of which have worked out. I no longer care for her too much, she changed a lot during our brake up and after. She was not the same girl I fell in love with. Before she dumped me she became toxic and started to give me trust issues. For weeks I would get anxiety about whether or not she loved me still, it affected me then, and it continues to affect me now and had an impact on my later relationships.

When I smelled that smell today, I smelled her. Her natural scent. It’s not a bad smell, just a uniquely recognizable one. It immediately brought me back to those days filled with anxiety and insecurity. Tears welled up in my eyes and my heart and mind were going a million miles an hour. A couple minutes later a customer walked in and I had to push my emotions away so I could muster a smile and a “welcome, How are you?… oh I’m doing great, thanks for asking, if you Need any help don’t be afraid to ask.” While they shopped I kept muttering under my breath for everything to stop and go away.

All I’ve ever wanted to do was to make great music but I’ve never had access to a piano coach or a real piano. It’s sinking in how much I suck. I have a physical issue which doesn’t allow me to sit for long durations. I can’t even learn if I wanted to. I’ve put out music before but I feel I’m just another talentless schmuck. I hate where I’m living. I hate myself. 

My back injury has made me put on 40 pounds. I can’t even see my dick. I feel like an absolute loser who has nothing going on for him. It’s not like I want to die. I just don’t want to be another mediocre piece of shit wiling his life away like the billions of mediocrity worldwide. 

What a sad use of a life. I’m relatively well off but don’t know how long that’ll allow me to coast.  I used to feel like I’m god’s favourite. Now I feel like I’m his best joke. I’m my mediocre father’s ultra mediocre son. This is not a worthwhile life. I’ve had this nagging feeling since I was a child.  

Therapy won’t do shit. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. All I do is sit in my misery and distract myself from that thought.

924,wgrlin,letusbecomemonke,"I never thought I would ever make a post like this in my life (yes I'm using throwaway alt), but here we go.

Unrequited love fucking sucks. Yeah, it's obvious when one person's love is not reciprocated, it's bad, but you know what? It's really, really bad. 

I'm a girl who fell in love with some guy online, that's how you know I hang around the internet a lot. We've known each other for about a month now and we don't know a lot about each other too much yet. So, you may be wondering, how tf did I fall in love with him? THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING, why did my heart choose him out of all guys I've met??? I already knew a few days after I met him that I really liked him. I felt like I could genuinely talk to the guy, since a lot of people I meet are pretty much bootlickers and constantly ""haha"" in their messages... like stfu I know you're not actually haha-ing, and it's just makes for bad appearance if used too much (sparingly is ok). I don't know to explain it. He just matches my vibe so well, I constantly ponder why this is the case. I would backread all of our messages, but I don't find a single reasonable one why I vibe with him. Pretty weird, right? The most simplest of his texts gets me pretty happy. 

A simple ""gn""? I will wish you the best sleep possible! A random ""youtube video link""? I love you, thanks for sharing this with me! 

That's pretty much how I'm like when I get those messages from him. He makes me so happy.

Then I come to wonder... does he even feel the same back? Does he just view me as another side person of his day? Does he hate talking to me? Does he think I'm annoying or stupid? Does he even like me? I can't tell if he likes me, but I bet if he was interested in me, he would probably respond to me in a more timely manner. I would almost literally drop whatever I'm doing to respond to his messages asap. 

So, my heart aches from this. It hurts thinking about why I love someone I most likely will never have. I should let him go, but I don't want to let him go... I cannot emphasize this enough. I really don't want this one of a kind human being disappear from my life, so it hurts to think about it. I question why I still cling onto a false glimmer of hope that he also likes me. That he also thinks about me. That we could be with each other in real life. It really hurts me if we don't chat with each other a lot, or he doesn't respond to me in a good time, and that he most likely just thinks of me as another friend at most. I'm being so selfish. 

It makes me have a bitter smile on my face when I realize this unique guy will never come to feel the way I do about him. I will never meet someone like him again.

I think about you a lot. It made me happy when you simply told me about your hectic week. It made me happy when you said you wanted to play a game with me (but didn't due to the chance of bad ping). It always made me happy whenever I woke up and I saw in my notifications of your message.

You make me happy, that's why it wounds me if I never made you happy. If you keep responding, I will always respond to you back. I will inevitably always be in love with you if we happen to continue our friendship for years to come. So, if I don't make you happy... please don't send a word to me ever again. Don't let me chase onto something I'll never be able to reach. Don't let me believe I can be with you. Don't let me make you suffer.

This guy makes me feel so much emotions, it's not even funny. I'm probably like 2 seconds worth of his life while I think about him like it's the end of the world. It sucks.

It's so stupid. Why do I like him this much in the first place? I had 2 dreams of this guy before (that's how much I would think about him). I really wish those weren't dreams.

Sigh... it's pretty hard to type out this heart aching feeling I have.

There was this one time I thought he ghosted me. But no, it was just some funny events occuring in his life, it made me cry actual tears to have him back.",2022-08-05 10:09:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/wgrlin/my_heart_hurts/,,0,9,my heart hurts

One is being taken for lunch and picking the restaurant, another is going out to dinner with their group. My group has said nothing to me. My team is not doing anything for me. This normally wouldn't bother me but the fact that everyone else is getting special treatment really gets under my skin. This pisses me off because my I worked my ass off for them and because of staff issues, my work kept us going.

One of the temps who I normally talk with was bragging to me about all the good things in their life going on, like their dates with their partner, their team bringing them for lunch, etc. On this persons birthday, their team also got them lunch and others brought them treats and cupcakes. My birthday was 2 weeks later and no one said anything, despite me mentioning it to them beforehand. I came home that day and just cried. I felt shattered. I was not expecting to be showered with attention, but I just wanted some small sliver of acknowledgement. Something to tell me ""hey we know you exist and we care about you"".

Im really being pushed to my limit. I cant stand this feeling of being less than everyone else. I keep feeling like something must be wrong with me. Like what makes you guys so special? This has been going on for so long. I am so tired of feeling insignificant. Im at the point where I am nothing but bitter and resentful all the time.

I can’t help but notice that in any social situation I’ve been in, I’ve only really had one person to talk to and never a group of friends. Whether that be in sports, in class, or whatever.

Now as I’ve long graduated from my towns school system and college, I can’t help but notice that pattern still occurring. I think I am a cool person to want to be friends with. Heck, I’d probably want to be friends with me. I even hear people who tell other people they want to be friends with me. 

But why doesn’t anyone reach out to me? Why wouldn’t anyone want an extra friend? I don’t get why people say they know me, or want to be friends with me, when they don’t even try to be friends. 

I’m just so lonely in a world full of already established friendships.",2022-08-05 17:36:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1626737218,4,/r/lonely/comments/wh1fwv/ive_always_said_that_everyone_know_me_but_no_one/,,0,6,"I’ve always said that everyone know me, but no one really knows me."

I don’t have any friends or family that would want to have contact with me. I live in remote city, because that was the only place where I could afford to live and commute to work. I spend my days on work and only work. If I don’t work I just watch yt and sleep, because there is nothing else to do here without friends that I would be able to afford. My father contacts me only to tell me I have to go to different country and get credit score to buy him a car (for now, by my country’s laws I have to support my parents, even if they didn’t contact me until I was 18, or abuse me). I don’t have any goals in life, because whatever I do, in the end I’m forced to be my parents retirement fund (we have national retirement fund, but my parents don’t qualify as they choose more money over saving for retirement and that qualifies them for alimony) so I can only work on my career, so someday I’m able to pay for their lives or kill myself before it comes to that. I pay for national retirement fund, but my generation has worse rules (otherwise country wouldn’t be able to afford retirements for older people) and we’re expected to save money other that this found, even thought we have like 16% inflation and before it out salaries were enough only to pay for rent and food. Phones and other electronic costs more than average salary, and to buy clothes I would have to go hungry for couple days a piece. I’m used to even worse times than that, but as I can’t even get vacation I’m so burned out I cut myself just so I can work more and I had to take week of unpaid free time (because my depression got so bad I was cutting myself everyday and I couldn’t sleep without alcohol) which resulted in me being dropped out of project (fortunately I still work in my company, I just have to wait for different project).

Hey, I (m15) don’t wanna sound cocky because i’m really not, but I recently noticed (or i mean I think) I am more “mature” than all the other ppl my age. Not necessarily a bad thing but sometimes I just wished to be young &amp; dumb and do stuff that 15 yrs old do but i just can’t. Every person i know goes out to the club, drinks, gets girls and stuff, obv i would like to try that but i’m never invited, but at the end of the day i don’t think i would like it. I’m not gonna talk much abt my loneliness but I literally talk to no one lol, and when i say no one i really mean no one. I just daydream everyday of having a friend or a gf to have deep and serious convos but i think that will never happen. I’m so scared about missing out on teenage stuff like teenage love and idk what to do. Re-reading this I sound wayyy happier than I actually am, and yeah I feel pretty sad but i’m not talking abt suicidal, I just accept the fact that it’s dumb and if i gotta do that i’ll at least wait till i’m like in my 20s so i have time to see if the situation gets better. Also I got this thing where I can precisely tell why and the reason behind a specific action that someone does just by watching for like 1 week how they act, speak etc and i’m pretty amazed by how accurate i am lol. That’s all i guess, i’m just some kid with no friends that watches in silence.  I don’t even know the real reason of this post because I will not open up 100% here but I just wanted to know if anyone else feel the same even tho i don’t think there’s many teenagers in here. Have a nice one and thanks for reading",2022-08-05 22:10:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645918124,2,/r/lonely/comments/wh7uq8/rough_teenage_years/,,0,0,rough teenage years

1033,whbna9,vent1667,"you know? that feeling of crippling loneliness, no matter how much i ignore it, it always comes back, be it in a day, a week, a month, it'll always be back

and i dont get it, i just dont get it, i tried to fix it, i tried to be sociable, i tried to care, tried to not care, tried to focus on college and my career and my life, tried to just do things that make me happy, tried talking to people, tried just leaving it alone, and im back at square one

its funny how something so stupid like a lovey dovey video can just ruin what will be maybe days of your emotional state and make you feel like the biggest loser of them all

but, i cant believe im so useless tbh, im about to graduate and nothing happened, i couldnt meet anyone, i couldnt even properly fall in love with anyone...i dont even have someone i could see as a crush, its just me again, as it was before

everyone says i dont, but i just know the only thing i need is someone that can actually understand me and just, love me for who i am...i just need to not be lonely anymore, i need someone to hug and kiss and be happy with and that's it, everything'd be ok again, life would be better, i'll finally know i do have a reason to go on

you know? sometimes i just need someone to hug me for a while and not let go, and just that would make my days better

sometimes i understand im a disaster...but im trying, all my friends are the same and they still found someone that love them, they were lucky enough to find someone...i try and try and im still by myself, no matter what i do

i just...i wish i knew what to do, who to find, who to talk to, where to be at what time, just something so i could finally be happy again...so i could finally be loved again

why am i not enough for anyone? i try to be the best i can be while dealing with who i am...i try to make everyone happy, i try to fix things and not get into trouble, i try to help...i try...why am i not enough?

sometimes i wish i could go back to when someone did...it felt like my life was better, i wanted to wake up every morning, everything was much more colorful, people even seemed nicer, like life just up and smiled at you and everything was finally perfect

i wish i wasnt unlovable anymore...",2022-08-06 01:09:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1572460289,7,/r/lonely/comments/whbna9/it_always_comes_back/,,0,2,it always comes back

1037,whc0um,skepticalia,"I recently came home from the airforce, or at least what still feels like recently, last year on October 30th. I was in for about 34 months, about a year before my 4 year term would've ended because I was medically discharged(which is honorable). I joined when I was 18 in 2019, couldn't afford college and had just started an online relationship with a girl not long before I joined(I'm a guy). Before I go any further, I want to explain that I'm aware that online relationships typically don't work and theyre looked down upon, trust me I heard it from my family enough I don't need to be told again, but I have a social anxiety disorder, ADHD(potentially autism), and recently was diagnosed with PTSD, I had a very very rough childhood and as a teen and have struggled to socialize my whole life because of it so I never had any luck with girls at my school, some liked me and I liked them but I was so socially inept I literally have had to manually learn how to socialize the past several years watching other people, there was no way they liked me for who I am and I wouldn't of even known what to do in the relationship. It was much easier online for me and I did learn things from online relationships, but with this girl that I started dating in 2018 I wanted to meet her, fast forward to 2020(2 years after I joined the military) I finally got a flight from overseas to see her, took so long because of covid, we got along very well, she was my first kiss and everything, every virginity you can think of, my mind was set so I proposed to her because I wanted her to come with me overseas and start a new life(stupid ik), she said yes. fast forward another year, shit hit the fan, I was losing my mind and losing trust with her, getting harassed constantly in the military, my injury in my shoulder got worse, she kept avoiding me and I couldn't handle the military anymore everyday was hell. My fiance at the time(still living in the US) was driving me insane, supervisors on my ass constantly, my anxiety was through the atmosphere and I tried several meds the clinic prescribed me, one of them(wellbutrin) sent me over the edge and so did my ex she cut off communication with me when I was begging her on the phone and crying for her to just talk to me so I overdosed on the wellbutrin, I took 600mg over the lethal dose, I took it back and tried to throw it up but it was already in my system. I was too scared to go to the ER I couldn't drive I was having hallucinations, seizures, every symptom on the list so I just decided to ride it out and cry myself to death. I somehow survived, I dont know how or why but I did and I told nobody that even happened over the weekend I just put on my uniform and went to work. Fast forward again, relationship got worse, found out she cheated on me a long time ago, I gave her another chance, then a gut feeling told me she's hiding more, I always felt like she was hiding shit so something told me to search for her on reddit and I found her selling fucking feet pictures, fucking feet pictures? Other shit too but I was pissed, and no she took down her profile dont ask for it, so I ignored her for a couple days and eventually called her to break up with her and that was it, I called again a week later to just explain more what she put me through and how much I did for her but after that I haven't talked to her since and cut off every connection to her. Sorry for long intro, but yeah fast forward again again to now about a year later im a civilian again and I've been lonely as hell, I hungout with one of my old hs friends after I came home a few times even the first night I came back, she seemed the same at first but she just started ignoring me so I stopped asking to hangout, tried another person I knew, nope, kept making excuses to not hangout. I'm I still the same awkward person as before? Is that why people just ignore me? I no longer live with my parents and it would be nice to have friends or anything at all but I have nothing but myself and I just work on my car, it can be fun at times but I just dont know what to do. I didn't know a lot of people in hs and I dont know how to meet new people, at one point I went so low as to make dating accounts literally just to find friends or something that can potentially turn into something else. I feel like my life is flying by, I'm 22 now and I can't believe highschool was over 4 years ago, I see people I used to see in hs and I feel like shit everytime knowing they had a lot of friends and probably life time friends from hs, everytime I see a couple in public I feel nothing but envy and it turns to anger like why the hell can't that be me, what have I dont wrong to be so different than people and feel so disconnected from everyone, even my family. It's gotten so bad that I regularly have conversations with myself or just pretend that someone is there with me, it's like I'm losing my mind. I've become bitter and miserable, I hate seeing couples, I can't even think of women In public as attractive anymore it shortly turns into disgust knowing they've probably done the same shit that's happened to me. It's like one part of me wants to meet new people, maybe find a nice girl but another half just wants to hate everyone and think of every woman as a slut and say fuck having friends. I dont really expect any solid advice, I just needed to vent, while this turned out longer than I meant there is far more to it to fully understand, especially for why I have PTSD and severe social anxiety but I guess anything would help",2022-08-06 01:28:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1618729754,5,/r/lonely/comments/whc0um/didnt_think_civilian_life_would_be_like_this_again/,,0,7,didn't think civilian life would be like this again

1051,whduvr,kevinkirty,"This is a post that I hope people can respond to and help me out. I am currently a high school senior and I don't necessarily have close friends. My school is a combination of middle and high school, so I knew that I had to make a good impression on people. I thought up this elaborate plan that I would find the most popular guy in my grade (or just the person I saw that would talk to a lot of people) and basically force him to be my friend but in a very subtle way. I constantly hung out with him until we became close friends. With that, I was ""popular"". Transition to eighth grade, only me and my other friend were in this school that went to the same elementary, so I brought him into the friend group as well. Me, the popular guy (lets call him tyler), and my elementary friend (lets call him samuel) started to hang out regularly. We got really close, and since them two played basketball I started to play basketball too. 9th grade comes and tyler's elementary school friend joins our friend group as well (lets call him justin), and we are pretty close, especially because of basketball, but slowly they start to bully me for absolutely no reason. I understand that every friend group has one person they make fun of, but for me I think they went a little too far, but I chose to hide that pain I felt because I was scared to lose them. Skip forward to junior year, I am extremely close to Samuel, and a lot of people know we're close friends. A few months into junior year, me and Samuel have a big falling out. He starts to talk crazy shit about me, and I start to despise him because of him. We still sat at the same lunch table, but we never talked to each other. I started to be friends with two guys that weren't in our friend group, and I get really close to them. They're the only people I really talk to. One of the friends has his own friend group that he's really close with, but the other is kind of like me where he has a friend group, but is closer to this three man group we had. I got really close to the friend who was like me, and I thought I had found a safe spot. I don't care if I'm not close with the people in my friend group, as long as I had someone who saw me as their closest friend and I saw them as mine. This guy who was like me, let's call him jessie, was my closest friend for the remaining months of senior year and into summer as well. Around the beginning of 2022, I started to reconcile with Samuel, and the friend group is a lot more stable, but since samuel was kinda the leader of the group, I stopped getting invited to stuff when we stopped talking, so I got really distanced with the people in my friend group. I felt kind of lonely because the people that I was hanging out with were going out and doing stuff, and I would be at home doing nothing. School is about to start soon, and Jessie has started talking to a girl. He says he doesn't like her, but they're abnormally close. I don't really care if he likes her or if he's super close friends with her, but it really sucks that she entered his life only a few months ago, and I've been friends with him for years now, and she has taken my spot. He says that I'm his close friend, but it sucks that he hangs out with her and goes out and does stuff with her. At this point, I'm genuinely alone, or at least I feel like it. I really hope that I can talk to people again and be close with someone, but it really sucks after these cliques have been formed already. I hang out with jessie and this girl pretty often with other people and we plan video games, but I know that she is closer to him than I am now. He said that he stayed up until 4 just talking to her, which sucks because we never did that. Then the following day they went out to go school shopping and ate lunch together, which really seems like a date sorta thing. He also laughs at jokes she makes that no one else finds funny, which also makes me a little suspicious. I'm posting this not only to just get all of this stuff off my chest, but I want to see if other people have gone through a similar situation. And to those people please tell me what I should do before I mentally and emotionally collapse. Life really sucks right now, and I hate my situation. I'm also really insecure about almost every part of myself, and not having someone to talk to about this stuff really just makes things much harder. I also don't wanna hear bullshit like ""find new friends"" or ""focus on yourself"" like that really doesn't help at all.",2022-08-06 03:03:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1581215058,2,/r/lonely/comments/whduvr/why_do_all_my_friends_leave_me/,,0,2,Why do all my friends leave me?

You ever type a very long text for almost an hour but then think ""well who would ever want to read this? Who would care?"" and then delete it?

I feel like that all the time but irl. No matter what you want to tell me I think have heard all and said all. So I don't say anything if I can, and I don't bother listening unless it is necessary for the task at hand.

If it's not related to what I need, want or can do, then I don't have any interest in listening to it or saying it, anymore. 

Its not being petty or petulant or whatever the word is for that, I just don't think anything new can be gained, if you are addicted to Google you know you search for anything before asking someone out loud and making an idiot out of yourself.

And then you see the same copypasted answers one after another, and then you think people irl should have more varied complex answers to those same questions but they don't, they just repeat what you just read sometimes even word for word.

I had multiple F’s on assignments this year but I did manage to keep my grades to B’s and C’s. My parents have been very disappointed though and I feel like a outsider in my family. One thing that’s been affected pretty bad is my relationship with my family. My parents used to check up on me a lot more but don’t really anymore. Which I’m cool with because I know since I have younger siblings and I’m older they have to watch them more but even with my older sister f15 and younger sister 10f they say goodnight to them and wake them up but never me. I know I should not take it to heart but it kinda hearts me. My mom is also always giving me talks about my grades and that this year if I get a C in the grade book at all I get my phone gone for a months until the next school quarter. I’m so anxious because my phone is the only place I can vent.

1079,whjdz1,NotHapiNan0,"Good evening.

First of all, I want to apologize in advance if there's any mistakes, English is not my first language.

About a year ago I got a new job, I was excited and happy that I finally got one, even though I had to move to another state, luckily some friends work there as well so I wasn't alone.

A couple months passed, I downloaded tinder since I've been interested on being in a relationship and found this awesome person that I really love and care.

As time goes by, my relationship got better and better, my friends and I were doing a lot of things and everything was awesome, working from home, having a well paid job and an even more awesome SO.

But, for some stupid, idiotic decision, I was outsourced (if that's even a word) to another branch in another state, I had to leave my friends, my girlfriend.

They told me that it only would be about 3 months working here, but it was a lie, they (the company I work for) actually don't know or care when I'll get back.

I'm just sitting in, not even a cubicle, it's just a table aside of the coffee machine with my laptop, around people that always forgot that I'm here.

I tried being friendly with them, however I got ignored most of those tries, I started eating by my own, never said a word (most of what I do, it's reported via email).

All my assignments come from emails, text messages, or printed documents, they always say or write my name incorrectly (even though I've always correcting them) 

It doesn't make sense for me being here, I could do my work from home, like always, but management its a joke and they think that if they can't see you then you're doing a poor job

I've always felt alone, even if I'm surrounded by them but this weekend, none of them came to work, I was there all by myself, today I said literally nothing, not even a good morning or enjoy your food, nothing.

I felt like a ghost.

This weekend, I'm alone, again, my SO doesn't like video calls since she has anxiety (don't get confused, she's done a lot for me and I don't want to pressure her into doing something that she doesn't like), my friends can't play online since they moved back to our ""original"" state and I don't have anyone to visit, to talk, nothing.

I can't go back because I don't have enough time, and I can't quit because I'll go back to my family's house in my ""original "" state and would be even more difficult to visit my SO

Each time I call my family they never asked me how I'm doing and when they do, I get interrupted every time.

I know nobody, and nobody knows me.

This is my 14th week alone

If you got here, reading my stupid rant, thank you a lot, I really appreciated

TLDR; Got new job, got an awesome and cool SO and move with friends, job needs me to move to another state, leave everything behind and Ive been alone for about 3 months",2022-08-06 08:30:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/whjdz1/rant_another_week_alone/,,0,1,(Rant) Another week alone

1099,whlmwp,thelonelinesss,"Hi folks, 

There are lots of lovely folks on here, but every post I've read through seems to be on the lookout for something very different from what I'm seeking.

Loneliness has been a theme throughout my life, has led me to attempt suicide at one point, and recently I got so lonely that I spent an immense amount of money (despite being far from rich) flying overseas to meet up with someone who I'd only met a couple of times over a decade ago, simply because they were kind to me when we met in a way that nobody else has been since.

Most people on this sub seem to be looking for an online friendship or a gaming partner, but I've never really played video games and I don't have that much interest in online friendship. I really need someone to meet up with in actual real life. 

I have a reasonable sense of humour but can't be described as a particularly open or jolly person. Topics I'd like to discuss are loneliness, depression, bitterness, rage, self-loathing, crippling laziness, and other such pleasant themes. I'm also interested in magic mushrooms, religion, cycling, psychogeography, literature and right-of-centre politics. 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex",2022-08-06 10:58:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637781360,2,/r/lonely/comments/whlmwp/male_37_london_looking_for_something_a_little/,,0,0,"Male, 37, London - looking for something a little different"

1105,whn5ro,long-for-nights,"**Idiot**

I find it hard to understand  
How much of my mind is you

How I long for you, your reply  
It is really painful to wait

Though what hurts the most  
Is how much if your mind isn’t me

And to slowly realise  
How much of a fucking idiot I was

To fall for you, to believe your words  
To hold out hope, and rationalise

I never felt like this about anyone  
You never felt anything at all for me

\-

I have no idea why I keep going back to thinking about you - every fucking night. It's getting tiresome now. I was the guy that hated social media because it paints an unrealistic picture of reality - and now I'm thrown into an absolute state of despair when I can see you are active on every conceivable channel, but ignore anything I send.

I don't like being like this. I don't know how to stop being like this, not really. Why, in the fuck, did I have to believe you. Nothing helps. All I do is numb the pain and hope the next push up, the next book, the next something, will drive you out of my mind.

I feel like I'm wearing a weighted vest, and the more weight I put on it, the more it hurts. I know I need to take it off - but I keep hoping it will become the most comfortable thing I've ever worn. I keep hoping that the next weight will make it all better, and be worth all the pain.

How much I invested in the idea of us. I can make the money back, but I can't take that time back. I can't erase those feelings. I really hate the kind of person I slowly became. I cannot believe I fell for it.

Anyway, hi. It’s been a while since I made an “organic” post. I’m not in a bad mood, just a lot more lonely off lately, especially since I’ve been distancing myself from a close gaming friends circle, but that’s because it was getting too toxic. 

I’m trying to make room for intimate relationships in my life, since I crave that so much. It’s hard for me to connect with/open up to people IRL despite having friends, friendly colleagues at a full time job, and acquaintances at the gym. Or just in general anyone, since I’d rather not burden anyone with my shit.

Anyyyhow. I’m likely here if you’re over 18 and want to talk. I highly prefer voice chats over at discord, and usually gel better with the XX chromosomes.

i don’t think he believes me, so maybe ill tell him the truth so he doesn’t think my dad got me. but that gentle moment, someone genuinely cared for me and was gentle. for a second i felt cared about and loved. i haven’t felt this lonely for this long, in well a long time. wish someone could just give me a hug, haven’t had a real one in awhile too.",2022-08-06 14:26:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600695837,47,/r/lonely/comments/whpki0/i_just_want_to_feel_loved_just_for_a_moment/,,1,15,"i just want to feel loved, just for a moment. please read."

There's nothing for me here. I had a girlfriend, I had friends, I was successful. Just 15 minutes ago, I was happy. But now I'm alone and sad and waiting for it to end because I have no reason to get up. Why tf do people like good dreams?


The dream was pretty detailed for me, but pretty simple objectively. I asked a popular, beautiful girl at my college if she wanted to have lunch together tomorrow, and she said yeah. I made sushi for us, it was successful. And she was about as scared as I was, which was strange but reassuring. The date went well and was fun, and we were gonna do it again tomorrow. Then I had to go to a history class, and I was actually made late by the date going long. But even though this teacher was such an asshat that he counted tardy as absent, I didn't even care, which is exceedingly strange for me. I was that happy with her. Then I just remember going through some history stuff, feeling more confident in class cuz I knew at least one person thought I wasn't the complete trash I saw myself as, and it was fun. There was another hot girl in this class, but I didn't feel like I desperately needed her approval. I just saw her as a normal person. I can't remember the last time I saw a hot person as normal like that. Then after classes were over, for some reason I was playing the guitar in a classroom, and I think the girl I had the date with was there. Maybe it was like some sort of guitar club or something? But I was actually able to play without self hate stopping me anytime I made a mistake.

In short, I was happy. I had a life worth living, and if I had stayed in that dream, I wouldn't have had any trouble finding the motivation to wake up.

I don't expect anyone to read that, I just had to write it. Hopefully it can get tf off my mind now.",2022-08-06 17:22:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603483175,1,/r/lonely/comments/whtges/rant_about_a_good_dream/,,0,0,Rant about a good dream

1139,whtw4j,geturcrap," Just a bit of background, I'm 17 and I had 3 love stories in my entire life. Without needing to say much, every single affair burned down to a crisp with either me being cheated on, me being called too whimsy, me being called unlovable, or a combination of all. (All of whom were girls) I would joke to my friends saying that I don't need affection and love to me is nothing but worthless.

Today I was able to go with my mom and little sister on a short trip to the sea. The trip lasted for half a day since we went together with my mom's coworkers as a holiday getaway.

When I got there, I met a boy who was around my age, and he greeted me dearly. For some reason, I felt like something was blooming inside me , like it was a bunch of butterflies, and the more we hang out, the more I felt inside.

We talked, we walked together, we shared life stories, we held hands, hell, he even hugged me when I was getting emotional about my personal agendas. That was the most affection that anyone have given me to this day. Which is why I regret the most when I couldn't say goodbye to him and ask him for his contacts.

That boy was the first person ever to make me feel love, affection and motivation to go on with my life. Which is also why I'm absolutely in pain right now. I'm questioning my mind, my sexuality, as my family is fairly conservative.

My heart is teared open. The more I think about it, the more I just want it to be over. I just feel like I can be loved again, but then I, myself have to messed it up. I didn't even know if he's gay or not, I just drowned in the way he looks, he talks and he carcasses my hands.

I'm in the comfort of my bed now, but I can't endure the pain anymore, I feel so lonely by myself. I just want it to all go away.",2022-08-06 17:42:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593678552,5,/r/lonely/comments/whtw4j/my_heart_is_broken_and_i_just_wanted_to_vent/,,0,1,"My heart is broken, and I just wanted to vent."

I think I am chronically lonely. I use being accepted by certain people to fuel my drive for money because certain people accept people with money. I don’t think I’m good enough being myself without money for certain people to accept me. So I feel like I need money. I tell myself that I’d rather be shot dead right now than never end up with money. Because I’d rather be shot dead right now than live a life where those certain people never accept me. Because I can’t accept myself if they can’t accept me. It’s about status. I don’t like myself if I’m not in the same status as certain people. Because even if being myself ticks certain people the wrong way, they will still accept me if I have the same status. I get special treatment if I have status. And I want special treatment. I don’t think the money will make me, me. I just think the money will give me the platform to show certain people who I am, even if they care more about my money. I think the money will give me power. Money is a ticket to sit at their table. The money will not make me less lonely. It will only make me lonelier. Because I will only be sitting at their table because of my money and nothing else. Because they won’t care about who I am without money. So why would I care about what certain people think of me, when all they think of me is my money. Because I don’t want to be excluded again by the same certain people that excluded me before. The certain people that excluded me because they didn’t like who I was without status. Because for some fucked up reason, I want to fit in with these certain people.

and it’s usually okay. back in may i was bawling my eyes out every hour and reminding myself suicide wasn’t worth it because i was going home in two weeks. i’ve gotten a lot better. sometimes things set me off, like the things they liked or my compulsive urge to check their pages. or even a joke someone else made that sounds a little too close to something they’d say.

So i thought of meeting her and making myself feel better but instead i started opening up to her about everything and she felt uneasy about everything and after few days she blocked me and after a month i get a closure about everything that i radiated negativity 
For the entire 2 years of duration i was the one who did my best to make her feel loved , listened to her, gave my everything to her and for once i never shared something that could make her feel uncomfortable or uneasy 
But when i tried sharing stuff with her because i was not in my best mind and a person who is depressed usually tries to share stuff with people whenever he feels dead from inside in hopes that the other person could understand him but anyway she blocked me and the reason was I was radiating negativity and right now i have lost hope in people because in the end they indeed show their backs i just feel dead from inside because i was treated like trash by the person whom i never expected would

1194,whzua4,hannahrazzle,"My boyfriend is in the Military. We’ve been dating for 2 years and 11.5 months. We’ve spent 7.5 months apart this year total. I’m so lonely. We went through the pandemic and so many horrible things together. His parents let me live with them when my abusive home life got to be too much, and that was less than a year into us dating. My abusive home life hasn’t improved, and I’m still struggling with severe mental illness. I support him 100%. I’m his biggest fan and I am beyond proud of him for getting the job he has. That Being said, I’m horribly lonely. I feel single. I get almost no affection anymore. He’s so busy with training that I come second. And I’m okay with that, his career must come first. And he’s serving our country. But I’m also wishing I got some complements, or some thoughtfulness, or that he didn’t leave me on read almost every time I messaged him. His weekends are spent with his friends and on the game. Don’t get me wrong, we talk sometimes. But it seems like just when I’m able to open up after shutting myself off to avoid being hurt, he sets distant again. I love him and I miss him so damn bad. But I feel single. I don’t think I’m allowed to feel lonely because he’s serving our country and I do have a boyfriend. He’s just more like a friend. I miss him. I miss him showing his love to me. I miss feeling wanted. I’m tired of chasing after him so I’ve gone cold. I can’t take any more rejection. It’s killing me. Im visiting him Labor Day weekend for our anniversary. Im terrified. I am so scared I will get there and He will be cold in person. I don’t know what to do at this point. I love him and I think he’s worth waiting for, but I miss feeling loved. Any advice would be welcome. I’ve tried talking to him and each time I try to initiate the conversation he shuts down. I’ve decided that he doesn’t need the extra stress while he’s training. I still try to initiate conversations about how I’d like to be supported and he’s just not having them. What do I do?

1199,wi0cpq,80sinmyheart,"Bit of background on my situation: I have been with the same man for about 16 years now. Married for many of those. We have children together. We experienced our first miscarriage this year, which was devastating. I admit I was depressed for a couple of months. I know I wasn’t easy to live with. Things have been a struggle off and on in our whole relationship. I just started to feel better, and then he told me he was depressed and didn’t know if he wanted to be with me anymore. He blames me for the miscarriage. I asked why he thought it was my fault. He said maybe if I was more active it wouldn’t have happened. He said all I did was lay in bed all day. I informed him that was impossible seeing as I work a full-time job. When I got home, yeah, I went to rest a bit…I was tired. But even if I could have laid in bed all day, that wouldn’t have caused a miscarriage. 

So anyway…he blames me, which is so hurtful. He left. He comes around every day to spend some time with us, but then he leaves. I feel used (I’m with the kids 100% of my free time)…I feel alone. 

There are parts that are nice like having the whole bed to myself and parking in the middle of the garage, and most importantly, not being yelled at or snapped at over every little thing…but it is still lonely. 

To make matters worse, I really just want to have a baby again and be in a loving relationship.

1204,wi113a,justtryingtohavfunn,"for reference our high school has 6 years.

throughout my whole high school life I’ve always felt pretty alone. During my second year I was really cool with a lot of people and had a good friend group but we never really did too much or at least I didn’t get invited and during my third year I kinda split up from this friend group bc they were just treating me like dicks, at that point I didn’t really have a friend group at all but I was still cool w a lot of people in school.

In my fourth year covid hit and we were off for so long, I fucked up a lot of my classes and didn’t talk to anyone from my school for literal months and in my fifth year I just spent it hanging around with 2 people, they’re cool and all but I still felt like they weren’t too good friends and at this point I was becoming cool with less and less people. I was also starting to improve myself at this point too and I just felt very isolated, I quit video games and started going to the gym hardcore, nobody does that at my school.

now this year when I go back will be my last and I still don’t really have anyone else except one person to hang around with.
I just feel like I’ve missed out on so much social stuff. Throughout my whole highschool years I never really liked the girls in my year but recently girls in the fourth year have been talking to me and some of them are really cool, I obv can’t follow up on them too much though bc of the age which fucking sucks bc now I wish I was born in their year and could spend a few years will cool people. Although they’re cool one of them is also making me feel like a bit of a loser by saying I literally have one friend and she is kinda right. One of the girls added me on Snapchat and then the others did and they were shocked at how she was already at the top of my bsf list. I don’t really use Snapchat at all and I probably should bc it’s what everyone else uses but I just don’t know if I can be bothered anymore.

I feel like I’ve missed out on so much stuff throughout highschool, I’d consider myself a good person too once u get to know me as a lot of people think I’m cool and wonder why I just hang around with one person. I don’t really know what I can this final year, it’s not even like my social skills are bad I’m just kinda realising I’m lonely and wish I could’ve spent a couple years in hs with this awesome girl.

and I’ve never really gotten sad over this until I met these girls, like just seeing them talk about stuff and everything makes me feel like my life is the most boring shit ever. 
I didn’t mind being mostly alone until I met them too, before I could just go about my life solo and be chill but now it feels like it would’ve been better with company.

I also just feel like I don’t really like most of the people in my year and even if I did I can’t really get into much of a friend group at this point, I’ve just kinda been there at school for 6 years whilst they’ve all experienced so much.

Also this summer has been kinda bad, I’ve never really had a summer where I’ve been out with friends much since I was a child:(

1238,wi4ky5,DaveNikju90,"&gt;TW: small mentions of self-harm and suicidal thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That happened while i was in a hospital obviously cause of mental stuff and all that but since i was really suicidal and did alot selfharm i tried to be alone all the time cause i didnt want anyone around me, but that was pretty hard cause in a hospital theres always someone there.

   
I met this girl, she had similiar problems like and every interaction with her was beautiful, and the best part is we also had similiar interests like reading manga and playing games and since we both had some of our manga there too we traded them overnight and that was probably one of those times where i actually was happy and didnt just act like it, because it felt like someone actually WANTED to spend time with me and enjoyed it. It was december at that time and since i was still a minor back then i was allowed to go home at christmas... but  i never came back to the hospital because apparently i didnt need it anymore???  But now comes the worst part, i was really shy to ask about her number or anything like that so i didnt do it, and at the last day that i was there which was december 23rd i said goodbye to her and she actually gave me her number on paper and honestly i  couldnt describe the feelings i had at the time, i tried so keep this little sheet of paper as safe as possible...

I arrived at home and looked for the paper and i couldnt find it i searched everywhere i could and it was gone, i cried i really cried a shit ton on that day and on the following week too, and i never saw her again.

  
and now im 19 laying in my bed thinking about this, while still having really bad mental health problems and also lonely all the time. I wonder how much would have changed if i wouldnt have lost this stupid paper, i would also not be surprised if everything would have stayed the same.  

Thanks if someone did actually read this",2022-08-07 02:19:16,lonely,t5_2qjny,1544061455,2,/r/lonely/comments/wi4ky5/i_remembered_something_from_3_or_4_years_ago_and/,,0,0,i remembered something from 3 or 4 years ago and i still hate myself so much for it

Now I feel as though there is no point pursuing any relationship or friendship ever again. (I've had bad people come in and out of my life since I was a child.) This is not just because of my partner's actions, but also my life long experience with people not wanting to listen to my side or ""truly"" get to know me. 

I feel like i'll have to fake happiness in the relationship until i can leave and I don't see a point in trying again and being let down by another human. I think i'll just keep my emotions to myself and only care about myself and my pet from now on.

The closest friend I have moved away years ago and now can only keep in touch with through the internet. And he doesn’t deem me worthy of his attention most of the time.

I am just aching all over. It’s like my body physically hurts from how lonely I am. It’s been 2 decades of life for me and I’ve never been loved, even by my parents. I hate going to sleep every night, knowing tomorrow will be the same. Just about the only thing worth living for at this point is going to sleep so I can fantasize about someone finally wanting me. And maybe one day I’ll finally lucid dream so it can be a little more real. I know that I’m hard to love, but I am starting to think that I was never meant to experience these fundamental human things.",2022-08-07 06:15:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,1616591878,18,/r/lonely/comments/wi8rmo/im_so_tired_of_begging_for_attention/,,0,8,I’m so tired of begging for attention

1282,wi96aq,thegamer10101,"Im 21 years old and have been feeling super depressed about the future. 

My father has multiple life-ending health conditions due to his own ignorance of things and now my whole family has to suffer, with the most weight of responsibilities falling on my shoulders. I had a lot things I wanted to do in life which I now cannot do, despite my parents saying that I might be able to in the future (read unforeseeable future). I taught myself how to make music, I’ve been playing piano for more than 15 years and recently taught myself how to play the guitar and flute. I taught myself various other life skills but every single one of them are now obsolete as I do not have the time to do anything. 

I had a fight with my parents recently and this stuff came up. I tried to convey what I had been feeling but they took it all in very wrong ways and that me being depressed is just something I’m doing to mess with their heads. 

It was at that moment I realised that I do not even have my parents who I can rely on for support. I do have friends, but I can’t go about talking to them about how I feel.

There is no big picture to this, there’s no small picture to this. I do not know what to do now or in the future. I do not matter and will not matter anytime in the future. My life has halted completely, and I feel ending it would feel the same.",2022-08-07 06:41:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1435994157,3,/r/lonely/comments/wi96aq/i_have_finally_understood_that_no_ones_going_to/,,0,1,"I have finally understood that no one’s going to be there for me, ever."
1283,wi98w4,Fearshatter,"I have a ton of friends, and I'm always ready to make more.  Always treat everyone I meet as a new friend.  Try to be empathetic and understanding, look underneath the surface to see why people are behaving the way they are.  Try to go outside my comfort zone and not make assumptions or judgments, try to see the best in people.  Frequently seek to mediate situations and establish connectivity as wide as I can.  Always ready to offer insight, advice, understanding, warmth, comfort, etc.  Often seen as the nurturer/protector of my friend group.  Which is... tbf really huge.  A lot of people deeply care about me.  Not only for what I do, but also for who I am as a person.  And I appreciate all that, but I'm often sort of a mentor/guiding figure in ways, always looking for solutions to solve problems, even if none appear right away.  The thing is though that... as beloved as I am... I don't know.  I just feel alone.  I feel like there's no one like me.  I feel like there's no one who sees things the way I do.  I feel like there's little anyone else with my ideals, at least no one I've met.  No one I've met who gives so much in the hopes of one day creating enough ripples to fix everything.  That's honestly partly my fault, and maybe a large part of my sadness and loneliness is the grief I feel from knowing with in the next some years I'm going to have to say goodbye to my mother, who's been the closest thing to a guiding figure I've ever been able to have, even though that's not saying a lot.  And maybe another part of it is also from knowing that the person who sees me in the most.... acknowledging light for my heroic tendencies, and my true identity deep down underneath it all, doesn't feel the same way I feel about her but like.  I don't know.

I just kinda wanted to vent.  I'm sorry.  If anyone wants to vent here too, I'll respond to as many comments as I can.  


Edit: Also, I just want to mention.  I don't resent anyone for not being able to be a guiding figure for me.  I'm more so just... lost. I  think.  I'm finding my way in the dark.  But I feel like I'm simultaneously drowning, burning, freezing, and being crushed alive emotionally, even though I'm... in a way, at peace.  It's a hard thing to describe.  Just a lot of... grief.

When I went to go meet her the first time, I got to meet her family and even went to church with them. Sadly, that weekend she rejected me.

She went on to meet another guy who got to be her first everything. She married him a couple months back. I am devistated and sick to my stomach even thinking about it

I'm kinda just winging this but I had to vent. Why is it that I get dumped right as I get attached to somebody? I had been on a single streak for about a year or 2, kinda hard to remember when you feel hollow lol. Anyways, I finally meet someone I can vibe with, love, and finally kinda tear down a few walls I had purposely set. You see I've had horrible luck with partners, most of them cheated on me, or had abused me. Two of them raped me, I feel fine talking about it cause it happened when I was 15 and 16. I've only had two good relationships, one that ended after a year on valentines day and one that ended yesterday. So with all this time I had put up walls to not get attached until I'm confident it will work, atleast for awhile. I threw up one wall and lowered it and got a little hurt, but that one was meant to be broken anyway so it didn't hurt that badly and after an hour I got over it. But the second wall I had up I lowered a few days ago, the one where I allow myself to become attached, and just like that ""it's not working out"". Like I had JUST lowered it. Allowed myself to love again, you can't tell me that isn't atleast kinda hilarious. Oh my God, I feel hopeless, I don't think I should ever lower that wall again, I know I will, I just hope this doesn't happen again. I just want to be loved dude, I'm not asking for much. A caring relationship with someone I can love who won't hurt me. The worst part is I'm bi. I'm literally a hopeless romantic cause no gender likes me! That is fuckin hilarious and you know it. It's like the punchline to a joke.

Memories emerge from every corner or spot of t to his house that it haunts me. His stuff is here and his presence is barley lingering. It’s starting to disappear and evaporate into nothing and I feel it so strongly. It’s the first time knowing he’s not coming back and it’s killing me. I’m so alone I have the animals but I’m empty and cold. I don’t even blink I just feel dead. I want to disappear and just die but I can’t leave my animals. I love him so much and he left me all alone. In this house it’s so quiet and I don’t hear the laughter or yelling from him playing the game. I feel so alone and I’m scared my heart can’t take this pain. I can’t do this on my own and it’s destroying me. I’m wearing his shirt because I’m so sick and crazy why can’t I just let this go and be strong on my own after everything that was done to me. I hate being alone. I’m so alone four years everyday with someone and they leave you it destroys you. I don’t know myself anymore and I don’t know what to do anymore. I beg for him to come back and it’s pathetic how Lonley and sad I am. I’m weak and it hurts so much.

1316,wich3y,themanwhodudes,"Has anyone heard murmurs of a server like this? I get there are a ton of traditional services like this but they're all so ultra-catered to weird boomer 1990s sex hotline sensabilties and that's not what I'm looking for at all. It's all Hooters and I'm looking for something a little more Starbucks.

Something not nessecarily platonic, but ideally not so overtly sexual. I get there's a ton of VRChat servers where you can throw money at someone to moan in their mic for 20 minutes in a private call but that's not really what I'm looking for. 

Somewhere where the abstract illusion of emotional intimacy with the opposite sex can be danced around for a couple hours would be nice. 

I would say I have a modest degree of self-confidence in most of my life, I'm a generally pretty solid conversationalist. I've hosted a moderately popular podcast for several years and being a loud goofball riffing with folks is a genuine passion of mine, I'm not generally a person pressed for things to say. But good lord christ all mighty, have I never had luck translating any of this into success in pursuing a relationship. 

Pretty lady folk people just be sending my entire central nervous system to the deepest lagoons of R'lyeh. I do have pretty severe anxiety issues, that I've never had the opportunity to properly deal with or medicate due to butt-ass-awful insurance, so I've just had to deal with it. And the opportunity to pursue any relationship never occurred until I turned 18 as I was homeschooled and fairly overweight until somewhat recently. so confidence in the dating market is just, not at all there for me. I'm a pretty strong believer in needing to be shown you're worthy of love before you're able to love yourself in a any meaningful degree beyond speculation and slogan-esque bravado.

OCD compounds with my anxiety and creates an endless feedback loop of stomach-churning anxiety and obsession over the fact I've never been loved any time I even entertain the notion of getting out there, it's completely immobilized me. I can't date like this, I can barely live like this. This is not the right headspace to be in to connect with other human beings.

I can't wait any longer, I can't wait till I miraculously find a therapist and work my shit out or get a psych to throw pills at my anxiety. The lack of intimacy and female affection in my life has seriously impacted my self-image and quality of life. If I could even just get a couple loose hours of this for a week's pay, I believe it'd help out big time.

Im a male, 24 years old and live in Germany since around 5,6 years. Since then i've tried to have a normal relationship with different girls, i've had one around 3 years long, before we broke up for some st\*pid reasons and after that it seems that i simply can't do it anymore. I've tried to write with some girls on instagram since we both follow each other and like / react to our stories / photos and i've had a date with 1 girl. We went out for a drink, talked to each other and after that it suddenly stopped so i guess it broke up. The question is what am I doing wrong to not have success with females? I am normal looking dude, around 180cm and 90kg i dress nice, i ain't rude with the chicks and im pretty chill alltogether. I like to go out with them, go eat something, go for a drink, walk in a park, talk to each other, drink red bull and watch netflix but for some reason i feel pretty lonely and that makes me kinda sad to be honest with you..

What hurt was when she went hiking with one of her female friends, (who I met before and got along with), and didn't ask me to come along. Even tho I told her I like hiking and constantly go hiking alone when she's off doing other things.

Everyday i feel more of a failure. If I don't feel like drowning, I feel robotic. Like daily motions of work, chores, taking care of kids bed and repeat. I feel like I don't do enough for my family. Am a bad mother cause I don't hug more, I don't play more, I don't clean fast enough. Then am a bad wife. I don't make my husband smile. I don't do more for him. I try to add more to my plate to just take the stress from everyone. But then I crash, but I can't afford to crash. I don't know how to make friends, my 2 best friends are both long distance so we don't see each other maybe once a year if that and I miss them so badly. 

If that doesn't eat at me daily, I don't really have family to talk to. I just feel so lost lately, I got a appointment set up to see a therapist again but am scared they are just going to give me medication and just tell me to reach out and try to take things one step at a time.

I'm just sharing for some support and encouragement. I have chronic IBS and have to spend multiple hours in the bathroom each day, whether I am actually going to the bathroom or because I feel like I need to. Currently I am also struggling with a lot of fatigue and there is many times I'm not up to doing much. I also don't really want to travel bc I don't like changing locations or going to environments where I'm not comfortable. To make a long story short, although I think I have some positive attributes, I often have this negative thought pattern that I'm not exciting enough or good enough for a woman. I feel like people want to do activities and be active and I often struggle with that. People bond over food and want to go out and I can barely eat. I go out to do things sometimes but I also stay in a lot. While I really yearn for a relationship and connection and having someone with me, I also worry that I won't be good enough or that it'll put so much pressure on me to do things that I can't because of my illness. I feel like I want someone who will be ok with chilling with me at home or not going out so often. I have been told that exists but it's not often portrayed so just hard to believe I can find someone who will view me as good enough.

1392,wiq7po,Original-Hurry1859,"I am turning 18 next Saturday and I feel kinda sad about it. I am expecting ”normal” people who have decent friend groups to hold big parties when they have birthdays. But it is impossible for me because I only have two people who I can call my friends. I also have people who I talk to in school but I wouldn’t consider them as my friends. This has kinda been the case for the last 2 years. The problem with me is that I just can’t start conversations with new people. I can only start them when I have drank alcohol. My social skills are actually not even that bad excluding that but since I am rarely being approached by other people, I need to try start conversations myself which is hard for me. I acknowledge that there are people in a worse situation than me with absolutely 0 friends and almost no social life. But comparing my social life to the average person my age hurts me so much. Especially when I see social media posts made by people I know (especially my crush), partying, it just hurts so much. There is no real word for the feeling. It’s like a mix of sadness and jealousness. I also sometimes get bellyache from it. School starts in a few days time so I am hoping that these things will change.

Now into my crush. I developed a crush on this extremely cute girl about 1.5 years ago. Since the past year, my crush to her has just grown. But the ”funny” thing is that I haven’t ever talked to her in person. I tried to start a conversation with her in Snapchat (i shouldn’t have done it) but she just replied ”Hey” and didn’t answer my question I sent just few seconds afterwards. I have had soooooo many chances to talk to her but I never had the courage to do so. I always overthink and just think that she is busy or something. Honestly I am surprised she doesn’t have a boyfriend because she is so beautiful. I feel like my life would be 10 times better if she was part of my daily life. Sorry for this very long post.

Even though I'm 24M, I'm at the point in life where I'm just gonna have to remain alone. Even if someone (especially here on Reddit) wants to befriend me, they're gonna have to prove it. Because I've had so much bad luck with people over the years that I'm honestly ready to give up. Hell! I might as well try to take my own life and nobody would even bother to care that I was gone for good.

when i first told her my secret she was trying to be understanding. then she said ""i'm trying very hard not to attack you right now"". then everything fell apart and people accused me of all this bullshit, and everyone was acting like i was persona non grata. it makes me sick, both to think i could ever have trusted her, and to think that everyone was okay with just excommunicating me. 

one of them posted later (i know, digital stalking, et cetera) that i had been ""excised"". like a tumor. i feel sick every time i think about that word. i was like a cancer to them. they threw me away like i was nothing and now i'm too afraid to make friends again. oh, doubly so since the hobby we all shared has thus been ruined for me. 

i feel so awful. i know, logically, it's not my fault and that they were being assholes by doing this to me. but at the same time, i just want them to forgive me for whatever they believe i've done wrong so i can be their friend again. i miss them so much. i miss making silly stories with them and crying over them together because no matter how stupid they were they were ours, together, and that was fantastic. i miss talking with them late at night annoying my neighbors to no end, i miss meeting with them every weekend, i miss being sent silly memes that reminded them of me. i miss being part of something. 

i've been coping mostly okay but god sometimes it all comes crushing down on me. i tried to look through those messages i sent her, when i told her my secret. i started hyperventilating and now i'm breaking down again. 

i feel stupid for it but i'm pretty sure i have ptsd over this shit to top it all off. sometimes it feels terrible just to be in my own bed because that's where i laid for days afterward, unable to get myself to do anything but cry. i feel so disgusted with myself for stalking them online, being mad at them for so clearly not giving a shit about my suicide attempt after the fact (not that they knew, because nobody bothered to ask), being so fucking mad at them for forgetting me and erasing me from photos like the tumor i was.

1492,wj3r0r,ScholarIcy3995,"I started messaging this girl on reddit. She sent me pics and she's honestly the perfect girl for me. I personally think she's beautiful but she's just average looking to other people. so she won't be completely out of my league, and the details she shared about herself made me think we'd be a good match. I talk to no girls at all. This is literally the only girl, or even human being because I don't have friends either, that I feel like I might have a connection with. Logically I know it isn't, but I feel like this is my one shot at making a human connection.

Anyway, I just couldn't come up with something interesting to message to her. I've spent all weekend trying so hard to come up with a good response to her message, and I just can't come up with anything. I literally have spent 5+ hours mulling over her message trying to think of something good and nothing. Now it's just awkward that it's been so long to message back. This is just the beginning messaging phase where we've only exchanged a few messages too so she'll just drop me at any point.

I want to compliment her and show I'm interested but I just can't figure out what to say without it being awkward because I'm just a random guy on the internet. 

This is really sad and stupid of me to:

1. Not be able to think of anything to say after spending all weekend thinking about this

2. Being so lonely that this means so much to me and thinking about her all weekend

3. Wasting so much time in trying to message a random girl on the internet who's probably not even interested, trying to force something that likely won't happen to happen",2022-08-08 08:43:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/wj3r0r/im_pathetically_lonely/,,0,2,I'm pathetically lonely

So if you remember I'd mentioned I have a best friend who is a great person but sometimes it's just hard for me to keep up our friendship. She has everything I've always wanted, namely - a loving family growing up and now a loving boyfriend.

I have had neither.

Today she received some pretty awesome news. She got selected in her dream uni for her Master's degree. I want to be happy for her, truly I do. But I just can't. 

It's only been a week since I received my first job offer and that day was one of the worst days in my life. I had no celebrations, no one told me they're proud of me. I am still trying to move on from what happened that day. And today when my friend called me to share the news and how happy her parents are and how EVERYONE congratulated her, I just couldn't bear it. I did my best to put up a brave face and congratulated her and said all that was expected from me, but deep inside this just reopened some wounds that I've been trying to heal actively for the past week, but really for all my life. 

I don't know what to do. Does this make me a bad friend? I really want to be a better friend to her.

This isn't the first time this has happened. All these years, during birthdays, holidays or any other day when one is supposed to feel happy with their loved ones, I have been sad and lonely. and the feeling only worsened when I went back to school and had to listen to what she did on those days.

Should I stop being friends with her? I feel like such a loser to think of  breaking our friendship over something like this, but I really can't be anymore brave or resilient. I am tired.

Some days I feel like it's never going to happen for me (24F). Even my transgender friend found a boyfriend. I can get dates but that's it, and all of the times they were just looking for fwbs/hook ups or I'm just not attracted to them physically. I've put myself out there multiple times by initiating  interest first and still nothing happens. I don't even see a purpose in going out anymore I'm always rejected anyway. I've gone to psychics to see if they can help, I'm going to set up time with a dating coach next check. I try to be happy and spend time with family and friends but it's always in the back of my mind no matter what I'm doing or who I am with. In the past when I thought I had a chance at a relationship and was talking to someone my mood would go from 0 to 100. I had more energy, smiles, giggles. I know a relationship is all I need to be happy but I guess it's just not my time yet. I don't know what I did wrong to deserve this. I've been crying myself to sleep almost every night, it's starting to get ridiculous and I don't want my eyes being puffy and red at work so I have to stop. I honestly don't know how to be happy single. Spending time with family and friends doesn't work because that's not truly what I want, it's just a distraction.

1544,wjdx8n,ThrowAwayRows,"I (19M) genuinely feel like I don't have anyone. Around this time last year I moved from my home country to a different country because I got the opportunity to do my dream job (software engineering). I moved here not knowing anyone and no one came with me. I felt like it would have been okay because I could make friends from work and join a club or something.

The first few months were great, I made new friends and joined a boxing club where I met more people and everything was great. Then a very very unpleasant person moved into the house share I was in and it felt like everything went down hill from there. 

I did have a friend group in my home country however for my 18th birthday I invited them all to a party and no one showed up to it, I felt humiliated and knew they weren't my friends. Even tho I've had their back for the last 8 years. I did have a girlfriend, although it was long distance I absolutely loved her, she helped me quit smoking and really motivated me to be the best version of me but then suddenly she changed and stopped saying she loved me and when my 18th came around she didn't even say happy birthday to me. I had a breakdown that night and we broke up and she said she was going to visit her brother to try figure out what went wrong, we never ended up talking again. This all happened 2 months before I moved country.

I feel like I can't talk to my family either, for context I'm the second youngest of 6 boys. Around 2 years ago it came out that my older brother had raped me when I was 7, for 10years I didn't know if it was either a bad dream or if it actually happened until my younger brother blurted it out when he was really drunk one day. He was raped at the same time I was and I remember the horror on his face when I said that he was telling the truth. Immediately the family rushed to hug him and tell him it's okay but I was just kind of set aside. I remember one of my older brothers who was like a hero to me my entire life walked over to me to ask if it was true and that we weren't making it up. He was cold in his words. Then when I told him it was true he just walked away. All I wanted was for someone to hug me and tell me it would be okay, I just wanted to feel some of my family's love. I've also been the quiet one so I was never really given that much attention like my other brothers were.
Now a few years after that event my rapist brother is still accepted by the family and they act like nothing has happened and for Christmas I was made to sit beside him, I was able to put on a brave face but I hated every second of it  and it's really putting me off from going back home this Christmas.

Anyway now all of the friends I made from work have moved out of the town we all lived in, I don't do boxing anymore as I was getting really bad concussions because I was sparing against much better and much bigger people (I'm 65kg and 5'6 and I was in the ring with mostly 80kg people and even someone who was 110kg). Long story short I didnt feel like they really cared about my health and felt uncomfortable going there.

I've tried to get into another relationship and found someone I really liked but long story short she chose someone else and her last words to me were something like ""I know that if me and you did date I would have loved you dearly"". And then another girl I was dating started trying to manipulate me so we broke up. And then another girl I was talking to cheated on me, and then another girl I was talking to just kept ditching the dates last minute. I feel like such a fucking idiot cause I keep falling for people so easily and it never works out. I'm talking to someone now and it's following the cycle, things were great for the first few weeks and now suddenly she just changed and doesn't talk to me anymore, I'm expecting her to send me a break up message. 

Because of the nature of my job there are segments of not having any work to do and I just sit there with my own thoughts eating at me. I can't find anything to distract myself enough to make this time pass faster. 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why people leave me, my abandonment issues are at an all time high, my self esteem and self confidence is extremely low. I havnt went outside in days. I cry myself to sleep because I feel like an idiot and a failure. All I want is someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay but I know it's not coming.

Also sorry for this mess of a rant/vent, I haven't talked to anyone in a few days and I just want to get this out there somewhere, there's so much more that I want to say but then this would be far too long.",2022-08-08 16:56:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,,6,/r/lonely/comments/wjdx8n/i_feel_like_i_have_no_one/,,0,3,I feel like I have no one

Always seeing these Kardashian wannabe’s passing me by, looking at me in disgust, I’ve accepted I’ll never have anyone to give the love and acceptance I want, let alone I’ve tried to love myself but the motivation and acceptance isn’t worthy. 

A little bit about me, I have ADHD, I was born into poverty, and while I’m getting on my feet and doing what I can to survive, I also have a degree in Fine Arts, I’m average looking, my teeth may not be straight but they’re sharp, and not missing like I’ve popped some crank in me. I suffer from a stomach condition that is not curable, eczema that’s scarred my body. Ive been made fun of, bullied, and judged my whole life, I’ve had suicide attempts, I’ve had self harm, I still hit myself, I still punch myself, to remind myself I’ll always be a peasant, a failure. That I need to accept what is, and to make the best out of it, because for the privileged folk, who can be born with great genetics, no problems, fuck others open handed, it’s life. People suck. Us fucking losers just need to accept it. We’ve been hurt, we’ve been destroyed. But we all can relate and we can someway somehow try and co-exist and find a happiness. 

Where many see order, I see a prison. I see life as one big misconception. Some are blessed, some are cursed. Therapy doesn’t help and if it did for you, I’m glad it did.

1570,wjivlz,ceasarsrighthand,"Hi everyone☺️
I’ve been spending my summertime with my family and I’ve had a great time. But now that I’m back to my hometown I’m feeling lonely because of my friends. My problem is that I’m not happy with my friendships and the dynamic between me and them. I have three separate friends, one pretty recent (and kinda healthy), and two old friends from school that only go out with me whenever they want (to vent). Everything we do is on their own terms even though it’s not spoken out loud. I can’t ask them to go out with me because each time they’ve already planned something with their other friends or they don’t like my plan or they’re just bored. Each time they ask me to go out with them I always say yes because I desperately want to go out and socialise (even though I don’t show it and come off as aloof), or if I say no they never take no as an answer (they basically don’t respect my feelings). I’m stuck in this loop and I don’t know what to do. My most recent friend is two years younger than me and she is facing some serious psychological problems and she has other closer friends so it’s not always possible for us to go out. I’m 24 yo and I’ve recently finished uni and search for work and I’m starting to worry because it’s really unlikely that I find new friends because I’m an introvert and also an adult 👵. I’m also scared that even if I find new friends that we match and have a great time I will ruin it and make the dynamic between us the same way it is with my other friends. I know it’s a self esteem problem and I’m working on it but still worry about it. 
Thanks to anyone who read this far☺️",2022-08-08 20:13:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1604481472,3,/r/lonely/comments/wjivlz/lonely_summer/,,0,1,Lonely summer

1573,wjix6k,localfounder,"I've never realized how lonely I am until I've dreamt of being in a social setting where it's really easy to connect with people. 

All of the people I've worked with in the past and the people I love in one place, on a rooftop, enjoying and having a drink or two. Some would be inviting others to smoke a cigarette, some just for a drink. Some having small talks and some reconnecting after years of being apart.

Oh how I wish it was real and would have lasted forever.

I rarely dream but why does it have to hurt when I do. Why is it really so hard to connect with others in actual and even when you do you feel like they're not really interested at all. 

Is it because I push people away too much? Is it because I don't know how to be myself or am I just too weird?

I know that there's a lot of questions to be asked, but in the end I'll just say ""it does not matter, what's important is that you have yourself"" and start another cycle again.

1577,wjjc3f,Desperate_Finance764,"About 2 months ago I was on top of the world. I had a girlfriend, an amazing group of friends. When me and my girlfriend broke up obviously I lost her, her family, her friends but I had my friends to help me through it. I found out that I suffer from codependency so that was a breakthrough but also my mental health went on a downward spiral. I am suffering from depression, depersonalization, extreme anxiety, along with other stuff that’s probably undiagnosed. 

But overtime I started losing friends. My friends from college starting hanging out without me, when I would reach out they would come up with a reason why they couldn’t then would hangout with each other instead. And my friends from my town are closer to each other than me so I try so hard to connect with them but I just fail. I just feel so utterly alone.

I resorted to going on dating apps to get any sort of human connection but ultimately it just makes me feel worse, especially since i have a hard time with social skills, and social anxiety so talking to people is often very difficult. I just feel so alone.

I’m not writing this for sympathy. More so for myself to put my thoughts out, and also for people going through something similar to know that you’re not alone. Even when it feels like you are, you’re not. There are so many people going through the same thing.

I looked around and it was crowded with mostly young people. I saw couples, friends, and other normal people. Suddenly I felt this pain in my stomach and it wasn't from anything physical. Loneliness caused me to be in pain. I thought of how I'm alone and no one cares. If I get attention it's not a positive thing. I probably did something wrong. This pain got worse as I saw normal people laughing and having fun together. Eventually I had to leave. I got home, sat down, put my head on my table in an attack of depression and loneliness, then proceeded to keep going. It's the feeling of loneliness but also knowing people assume the worst about you. If you say you are lonely you must have never done anything to find someone. You must be a bad person.

Earlier in the movie the escort made fun of K for having JOI as her partner.

Dr. Ana Stelline has to be the saddest character based on her backstory even though she had a small appearance, she's isolated because she has a weak immune system and I guess to keep busy and not go insane she has a hologram/virtual reality device, she makes scenarios to be part of them because she missed out alot in her childhood; she tears up when she helps out Officer K with his memories. I can say that I relate more to her because I missed out alot in my youth.

1614,wjq0zk,teoteo_pewpew,"I guess birthday posts are pretty common on this sub huh? No pressure for birthday wishes, that's not what it's really about.

My family (parents, uncle and aunt, and a pair of cousins, functionally all of my extended family) remembered my birthday. We're close like that, I'm lucky on that front.

I have one friend, she forgot last year, I was hurt and told her so, so far she's forgotten again. I have one person who I guess isn't my friend anymore, we really connected but I guess she doesn't want to deal with a long distance friendship, she hasn't responded since I told her I was moving a month ago. She has other friends, she doesn't need me. My love language is gifts, but I don't think I'll ever be able to rely on getting a gift from a friend, I can't remember the last time I did.

I've tried to stay cheerful all day. I don't like being sad all the time, I like the idea of my birthday and the gifts. I like stuffed animals, and pokemon, and I can tell my mom is starting to resent that I haven't 'outgrown' them. She made some comment when I opened some card packs they got for me, with this snide and passive aggressive face she sometimes does, that she thought I would've outgrown them by now, it finally made me crack from trying to act happy.

There are very few things in this world that make me innocently and purely happy. But I constantly am nickpicking myself, wondering if I could just like normal things if I would have my friends. Should I not tell people I like pokemon and kids shows? Should I hide the stuffed animals if someone were to come over? Will I have to wash the nail polish off, dress less feminine for a guy when I go see my uncle and aunt? The nail polish is my favorite color, which made me happy, but I know that's not all it means to most people.

I am hyper aware and internally shaming myself for the things I like that I know society doesn't, and I'm constantly left to wonder if only these didn't make me happy if I would have any friends who deeply cared about me. I'm left in a cycle of being unhappy and lonely, because even when things do make me happy I can't let myself enjoy them.

And my poor parents try so hard to make me happy. They got me nice gifts and a nice cake. They know I am mentally and physically unwell, I know they get upset they can't fix it. I can't break my poor parents heart and tell them I'm upset after they tried so hard to make me happy all day. So I have nobody to tell I'm upset, nobody who I feel I won't have to hide these things that make me happy in such a pure way, that won't judge. 

It seems like my birthday just reminded me about all the things that make me upset. I woke up feeling sick, as I do every day, and spent the day trying to be happy, then not being able to enjoy the gifts I did get that really did make me happy because I know my mom resents the things I enjoy. And I can't tell my dad, the only person who I can talk to about my mom, because it'll break his heart that I'm upset.

1644,wjtxv6,aarondawg71,"I've become extremely good at living with loneliness. It wasn't always this way, but somehow I've come to peacefully accept my reality. I think I cope a lot with it by using bodybuilding as something to keep me focused on a goal in life. A purpose to keep developing myself and guide my daily existence. Unfortunate incel stereotype but it really helps me. Maybe it's just my distraction, just like video games for some people.

That hasn't stopped me from keeping the door open for a relationship. One thing that gives me anxiety is the painfully obvious fact that I don't have friends. I think people see this as a red flag. The reason I'm even writing all of this is because someone recently asked me what I plan to do for my upcoming birthday.

Nothing, lol. Obviously nothing. Just like every other birthday. For whatever reason this one question has really triggered my pain response towards the deep loneliness that got me to where I am. The thing is that I do have work acquaintances. I have friendly people who will text me back if I text them. I'm arguably better off than probably many other lonely people. However I probably have cemented my situation because I don't want to bother anyone. They don't reach out to me to make plans. They don't invite me to events. Plus people are always busy now with their kids or partners or personal hobbies. And I'm definitely not going to burden someone with the uncomfortable position of rejecting a birthday invitation from a person who obviously has no one to celebrate their birthday with.

The person I consider my closest friend I've tried to make a simple lunch plan with says he is literally busy for the next few months. I asked again later thinking everyone has to eventually eat something and he emphasized that he couldn't. That was over a month ago. I take things like this and read into it a lot. For example, I moved recently and a number of people at work told me if I needed any help to reach out. Is that just a kind gesture people make without any guarantee to actually uphold it? I live completely alone without any family and so I've learned how to accomplish literally everything by myself, but it does get exhausting having to pay people to help me do things that many people could just ask their dad or brother to help with. So I actually did ask some people who offered to help me move one thing and they didn't respond back. I know I can't expect people to drop everything for me, but it just sucks. It sucks. Like I can't ask someone to take me to the airport without knowing they just don't want to do it.

Where am I even going with all this... IDK man. Usually I've come to terms with the fact that I won't ever have genuinely close friends but right now I've reopened that trauma for no reason. I haven't given up hope on a relationship but I'm getting closer to allowing that door to shut also. That's the story. No moral or anything, just a word vomit.

No offense to you minors on here, I just think you should have friends your age. But here's a few things about me, I'm a 20 yr old guy, I like watching movies, TV, YouTube, and streaming services like Netflix. I also like to draw, write, sing, and play video games. I do my best to make people laugh and so hopefully I can make yall smile who are sad and stuff. Anyways like I said, just dm me if you wanna talk or potentially be friends. Heck, I'm here if you just need to vent or need someone to talk to. I'll do my best to respond to you ASAP.

1696,wk19i3,AnotherLonerslife,"Sometimes I wonder why I exist…why my mother didn’t abort me when the father that deserted her before my birth asked her to..

It feels like I would have been better off not existing rather than existing. All my life all I’ve known is loneliness and pain and as I approach my mid 30s I don’t know how much longer I can do it.

I’m far from a negative person regardless of what I’ve been through but it’s so hard..I just feel like I’ve been given the short end of the stick since I was born and so lonely in this world. 

I was put into foster care as a toddler and although I was raised with a great family, I was raised in a racist environment. Almost Everyday from the age of 4, alone the only black person in my area I was called a N-Word or P-Word (racist one), punched and kicked by kids age 6-15 at least and bullied by teachers and locals. I experienced depressed as young as 5 years old when I look back and was ready to take my life as young as 7/8. As much as my foster family cared there was only so much they could do. 

Eventually I moved back with my birth mother and her new partner + a younger sister but I then endured a decade of physical and mental abuse after espcaping from the racism in my youth. Beaten till I bled, verbally and mentally abused - for something as little as not knowing how to tie my laces properly or not washing up fast enough. Years of back and forth with social services followed but I was told to accept it and get on with it. 

Kids thought I was too serious but no one knew I wanted to be that happy kid/teen who wasn’t socially anxious and thought of taking his life constantly. 

During these years I met some good people but they died or moved away. My best friend died at 7 of cancer. A local shop owner who showed me compassion and was friends with my foster family committed suicide in a butchers when I was 9. Many more people I thought I could rely on left and at the time I felt abandoned but as I got older I realised that’s life…but when you’re young and feel alone it feels like they don’t care..

In my older years once I reached 20 I lost my mother, aunts, friends and my foster family to death. My remaining family hate me for the pure fact that my father left my mother even though I have no clue who he is and show nothing but love to others. It’s left my feeling so dark and lost and I don’t know how much longer I can do this..I don’t really have friends as I’m always the last to any group I joined and ignored so I’m just there….I genuinely feel like if I died no one would notice or care. 

Might be silly to say and I promise I’m not an attention seeker. It’s just how I feel after all this time: life goes on and my point would be proved that whether I die or was never born I wouldn’t have mattered to anyone or anything in this world..

It’s really hard to se otherwise even with all the therapy.",2022-08-09 11:48:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wk19i3/lost/,,0,3,Lost

Always, since I was just a kid, I have been the excluded one. 
Today, for example, most of the people who i invited to my bachelor party are visiting together some city. For really stupid reasons they stopped talking with me (and others) a month ago. Now they are still friends and I have very few friends. I really enjoy the ones that are still with me, but i feel excluded, and it hurts. 
This is just the last example but it happened many times. I am surely not the best guy, the nicest or the funniest but I care the friends i have, i help them when they need them. I really do this, sincerely. I am the good guy.
But then it finishes that i am alone.

1738,wk8k1i,NotBorris,"I hate acknowledging this, but we absolutely live in a reality where looks matter.  And when it comes to guys who are unfortunate to not meet the standards, we still have some things we can grab onto.  Weather it's each other and we can form a brotherly bond or to learn to accept ourselves for who we are or improve so that we can like ourselves better.  But it seems that women who are not seen as attractive don't have that opportunity.  

Now I have never been with a woman, nor have I ever been a woman, so I'm not going to pretend that I fully know what I'm talking about.  But from what I've seen from movies, social media and the like, it's usually men that are given a pat on the shoulder and told that everything will work out in the end.  But I don't know if the same applies for women.  What if a girl has also been rejected numerous times, or has never had the self confidence to enter the world?  Would she be given the same support as guys would?  Would someone be willing to let her cry her eyes out and explain why they are so scarred or ashamed and actually listen to what she has to say.

And it irritates me when guys keep saying that a girlfriend will solve all problems, what if a girl does have interest to improve your situation but you don't find her attractive, or she's not up to the modern standards, then you'd be singing a different tune.  And what if she has the same problem as we do but all men have to say is, ""You're a girl, it's easier for you.""  This isn't easy for any of us, that's why we're here.  

I don't know man.  I know I'm going to be attacked for saying this, but if someone needed to hear this than I think it's better that I say it.  If you're a woman who is scarred to tell the world that you feel alone, you 100% matter as much as the rest of us.

1745,wkadjh,Wiinterrss,"Hey all, a bit of context behind this: I used to be in a friend group that made me feel mentally un well. I would often get ignored by them and they then proceeded to exclude me from their social events. I decided to leave this friend group early 2021 and haven’t found a friend group since. I only have one person I consider to actually be a friend and have no partner. I have tried finding a partner/friends but no one seems interested in getting to know me. I pushed myself to try and improve as a person and believe I have succeeded in that front by getting an apprenticeship and forcing myself to be more socially out going but none of it seems to help me. In a last ditch effort to find more people to speak to I have come to Reddit but everyone just seems to stop speaking after a while and honestly not seem interested at all. If anyone has any advice on what I could do I would greatly appreciate it.

1751,wkaxfg,radhe91,"Two years ago, during the lockdown i got a job as a Game QA. I used to play games all day and then i started getting paid for it.

Slowly as the grind started, my focus shifted away from my loneliness and to my work. I wouldn't say i was happy, i just didn't have time to see or feel the things that made me sad. My thoughts couldn't drag me down since my mind was always on my work.

Few months ago, my employer started a employee refrence plan, where current employees would get a certain monetary amount when anyone they referred gets hired and passes probation and training of one month. Majority of the people referred their friends or relatives. But since almost all of my colleagues are males, they also referred their girlfriends. And as such many girls were also hired.

At first, it was fine, i didn't really pay any attention. A certain game was about to be released so i had absolutely no free time. But now since it is released, work is a bit relaxed. I started noticing. All the couples in my office have moved desks to be close with each other. All the show of affection, holding hands, smiling at each other, chatting during lunch breaks. It just hurts too much.

I used to have a small group of people that I used to hang out with during lunch. Now it's just me. When i am sitting at the cafeteria, i noticed a difference there as well. The large tables have made way for the small 3-4 sitter 'couples' tables and chairs. While i sit alone in a corner, i see everyone enjoying the company of their significant other. I am not jealous, i am happy for them, but seeing what i don't have and would probably never have, just hurts too much.

During my walk to and from work, i used to see the people as a crowd going about. Now i see couples everywhere. The street is the same, so are the people, i just see them different and that's dragging me down.

It's not their fault. It's mine. I know that. I wish I could just join them with a s/o of my own. Being a spectator in all of this is taking a toll on me. 

I can tolerate being lonely as long i can ignore the happy couples around me. I can't do that anymore. I put my resignation today. I love the job, but the result of the hiring spree is unhealthy for me.",2022-08-09 18:33:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1577658762,3,/r/lonely/comments/wkaxfg/i_was_happyish_i_relapsed/,,0,0,I was happy(ish).

It feels better to have the ""will she respond?"" ""Maybe this one really thinks I'm cute"" ""she seem to think i'm funny"". Than having bad thought about how my friends are slipping away and my life isn't what I want it to be. Slowly becoming worse and worse.

Their full question was ""what would you trade away for an ideal end to your loneliness and depression and what do you envision that to be?""

My answer was ""everything"". Want all my worldly possessions? Done. All of it. Take my clothes, my furniture, my computers, my cars, my phones, my collections. Want my paychecks? Take it all, except for what I would absolutely need for survival. 

All I want in return is a companion that is as happy as I am just having someone to come home and talk and cuddle with. Someone that gets the same sense of love, satisfaction, and happiness taking care of me as I do them. Someone that just needs me, not the stuff I can buy them.

Not a good enough trade? OK, take 50 years off the end of my life. I only end up with a week left? That's OK, I'll die happy. Still not good enough? Take my sight, my sense of smell and taste. Take my legs. I don't care what you want, I'm willing to trade EVERYTHING. So long as I and my partner are happy for the rest of our lives.

1799,wkic27,achingbattlecry,"(Mentions of suicide.)

I'm a 18m, just graduated high school. But in this dream, for some reason I had not only had to repeat senior year, but the only way I could graduate was to participate in sports.

I've always hated sports. I've been a low-energy guy my entire life, even as a child I didn't have the energy for them. And they always made me feel like weak link on a team, the one holding everyone else back.

Anyway, long story short, I had to sign up for some sort of racing sport. Like a mix of cross country and parkour.

In the dream, I was good at racing. We went up against other schools, whoever came in last got eliminated until it was down to two teams, ours and some other high school.

The dream was ridiculously cinematic with the drama, but basically we won the tournament because I was faster than the guy I was up against.

And everyone celebrated me. Everyone was glad I was on their team. Everyone was praising me, congratulating me. I started crying in the dream, and I think even did in my sleep, too. I've never felt apart of something like that. But for just a few moments, I felt loved, wanted, useful and like I truly had a group where I belonged. I got a shiny trophy. Everyone was proud of me. I was proud of myself.

And then... And then I woke up.

I had no trophy. No one was cheering my name because no one even knows my name. My room has a bunch of colors in it but it looked so grey. I was the only one in the house. And nobody would notice if I disappeared. I don't actually belong anywhere.

I decided to take a shower because that usually helps wake me up and feel better..but this time, it didn't. After I bathed, I just went back to sleep, hoping maybe I could hop right back into that wonderful dream.

Instead, I had a completely different dream. I was a few years older, in my early 20's. I had my own apartment and a car, neither of which I have yet irl. I took my car to some hardware shop and bought a rope. Then I drove to my boyfriend's house (I am single irl, this bf was totally fictional) and I plead to him for forgiveness. I'm not sure what I even did, but he refused to forgive me and told me to get lost forever.

So I went back to my apartment and used the rope I purchased to tie a noose. I hung it on the ceiling, set up my chair was ready to take my own life. But then there was a knock on the door.

I opened up, and it was my made-up boyfriend. He said that he was too angry earlier to think clearly, but he had calmed down and could forgive me for whatever it is I had done. He hugged me and kissed my forehead. I remember falling to my knees, sobbing as he held me and gently told me everything was gonna be ok, he was here for me. Every now and then he would turn into a woman, which I didn't question because it was a dream and I'm bisexual anyway so it doesn't matter to me.

Eventually, he went into my room and found the noose. He promised he would stay with me until I was safe again. He was so tender and loving. He really, truly cared for me and wanted what was best for me.

Then, I woke up again. To no one, again. No one who would notice or care if I died. No one who would miss me. No one who would cry if I finally gave up on this life.

1801,wkiktd,Straight_Tension2629,"I always reach out to them everytime. It's frustrating because no one bothers to talk to me because they have other more important friends, while I feel like a loser for basically having none. I could say that I functionally have 0 friends because I get nothing out of the relationship, and it just feels shitty. We used to be close but stopped seeing each other during the pandemic, and now the friendship feels very one-sided because they are surrounded by friends while I have none, and they would rather talk to their better friends. Which is ok, but makes me feel like even more of a loser because I don't have anyone else to talk to. I feel like my attempts to reach out are a fly on the wall to them while I am desperately grasping for just someone to talk to. 

Even worse, they never helped me out when in my darkest time, not that they are obligated to, but I was always there for them because no one else was more important to take up my time. I feel bitter about the whole friendship(s) because I remember getting straight up ignored a lot when we hang out in groups. Not to mention them always texting other people while we are together, saying ""uh huh"" while typing away we're doing something. There's nothing I can do to cope because they are the only people I have. I just wish I had someone who would take the time to talk to me as much as I do for them, and that I wasn't such a loser who is the bottom rung of the friendship ladder.

1805,wkinug,xneverPaid,"So I was in a relationship for 4 months.. I was always a person who felt lonely almost all the time and barely had any friends or not any stuff to do.

The first months of my ""relationship""!was the best time of my life (what I thought back there) but overtime she started getting busy with work... She had many chances to take off some hours and spent time with me but she never did it and always told me ""for the money"" but never like ""for us"" just her.

After a while I felt more and more alone again I mean the only person I loved and I really wanted wasnt trying to take care of me or spend time with me. Until then everything was okay between us but when I once told her about some of my loneliness feelings it literally changed out of nowhere. She started ghosting me, flirting with other guys (per chat) and.. I was there still coping I told myself things like ""thats her personality she was like that to me when I first met her too"" and kept and kept and kept coping. It hurt me so much.. and I'm also a little of a jealous person she knew that

After a while.. The second I asked her if she wanted to take some work off to do something with me she instantly broke up.. and it hurt me even more. 

I had some people I know or like kind of and I once introduced her to them. Thinking of it she never introduced me to anyone in her life.. 

So now. I found out more about her ex... I found out that he had a similiar personality to me and she recently finally said ""goodbye"" to him and finally could block him off. She had some problems with him while our ""relationship"" So well.. I was nothing else than a fucking rebound if not worse

She got over me super quickly which is another point there was no true love from her.. We confessed at the same time it felt so real. Then she just goes, doesnt give a shit about me and now starts getting close very close with people I know.

She always has so many people around her helping her and I have no one.. not a single person writing me goodmorning, calling me caring about me or whatever. I was used, I was a rebound for her, I meant nothing to her.. and thats my second relationship also my second fucked up relationship and yet after all that I miss her so much... Its so sad I still keep coping and while all that I have to return 12th grade because of 2 big misunderstandings and I have huge Issues  about something liken returning a year. I told her about that in the relationship but she also never cared about my mental or that.. Its been almost 2 months since she broke up now.

I was always nice to her never did anything wrong.. In general I'm never mean to people or as much as something hurts me I never get angry at someone even not in my mental.. Is this a curse or something? Why am I trying my best for everysingle one I've met just to end in something like that?? She is happy now, has enough people around her, can laugh can smile is over me over her ex.. Im here still in love after all that killing myself over someone like her cant stop crying only myself only stress only bad thoughts.

I just really wanted to write out all that sorry I didnt respect any comas or paragraphs I'm just writing everything down while crying sorry if I said something selfish I cant take it anymore

I'd love to find a friend like I had when I was a kid. Go out for late night walks, maybe to the store/blockbuster, get some snacks and watch a movie/tv show.

Don't get me wrong, I've had online friendships for the last 14 or so years, but I wasn't lonely. It was just me and my online friends playing games and talking to each other. But now that I feel lonely, that doesn't help anymore. It makes me feel worse. Possibly because I don't really enjoy playing games as much as I used to, but I do it because it cheap entertainment, and I can do it alone.

What do you guys get out of it? I'd love to know because it seems that's what most people want on here, just a chatting pal for a little while to pass some time and then move onto the next person.

1889,wktb23,miruntel,"I am just another 23 yo loser. I don't know how to make new friends, either where I could find them. I prefer remaining in my room all day long crying about what piece of sh\*t I can be. I don't know what I do want for my life and it really hurts.

I don't have that know-how on socializing, I don't have a boyfriend and I feel like very hard finding one these days. I have a few friends, but all of them are girls and I feel like I lost connection with them in the past 2 years (since the f\*ckin' Pandemic has started). The most annoying thing is that I feel like I have nothing interesting to discuss with the new potential friends I make. They are all so superficial.

When being in a group of people though, I feel comfortable about speaking with them. I even like making jokes to make the others feel good in my place and that gives me energy. So I wouldn't characterize myself as an introvert, but I don't know, life just sucks.

I have all the hobbies a human being could have. From playing to an instrument (even 2) to photography, film photography including developing them, editing stuff in photoshop or even after effects, to painting, doing sports, hiking, solving a f\*cking Rubik's cube, listening to good music and so on.

I am in med school, in the final year and I am not even a bad student, I have good grades, I feel like I have a good clinical intuition and I did one semester in France and I did it almost well I think.

But even if all these things are great, I am not. I feel like I am not stupid but a loser. I feel like everything I do is in vain, I don't even know what I want to do after the med school ends. I don't know if I am going to manage everything that I will have to do as an intern in the hospital and I am really concerned about this. I feel like everyone has already his path but I am somewhere hanging there in the middle of nothing.

Everyone is having fun with their friends. My only fun is escaping a few days with my family in the woods or riding the bicycle in the evening.

I don't know how to get out from this. I also have a very low self esteem in general, so I think the last ray of hope will be god.

It also hurts because I see at my friends what I also long for. And it hurst while meeting them and it hurts afterwards.

Should I continue meeting them or is a quick break from meeting them also good, just to pause from the hurting inside?

I never admit this anywhere but I have been bullied all my life, always betrayed, got sexually assaulted for 2 years and couldn't do anything. I was suicidal until 3 days ago, today that feeling is back. All my friends have left me, blocked me, I listened to many people on reddit, about their life, about their problems, but why there's nobody when I need anyone? Don't I deserve anything? Sooner or later, everyone just misunderstands me and blocks. I don't think I'll be able to trust people ever again. And if anyone thinks that I'm doing this for some sympathy, i don't give a shit about fake internet points. I've had enough.
I thought porn was the ultimate problem of my life and everything bad is happening because of it, but I was so happy last 3 days, I didn't think about porn even once.Its not the ultimate problem, it never was.
It was always loneliness.

 People say I am kind and empathetic, are they blessings or curses? Maybe next time try to feel someone's pain like I have felt, like I have experienced. I wish I could have a special friend in my life who actually could give a shit about me.",2022-08-10 13:56:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,,9,/r/lonely/comments/wky4a0/i_am_just_sick_of_getting_hurt/,,0,7,I am just sick of getting hurt

1926,wl23t1,fujiandgala_,"using an alt, but i just wanted to get this off my chest for once. 

im pretty sure i have depression, but i haven't had a diagnosis because 1.) therapy is pretty expensive and i don't wanna be a burden and waste my parents money on it (i'm 15) and 2.) when i did ask to go to therapy, my mom brushed it off and i haven't gone since then. alright, back to the point. 

im so sick of people trying to show me kindness, because i believe all of the kindness is feigned in the end. i mean, who would care for a nobody like me? it's been proven; i have no friends, my family isn't that supportive; so why would anyone else care? it doesn't matter in the end, i'll just go back to being the same sad sack that ive always been since forever. ive basically lost all sense of feeling too; all i feel every day is emptiness. even if i do something fun, i still feel complete emptiness. i can't cry, i can't feel happy, i can't even feel anger, which is my most common emotion, but yet, i still feel like every emotion is devoid to me. i try to talk to people, and i try to keep them entertained or something, but, as always, they get bored and leave, most likely due to my lack of emotion. i see so many people with friend groups and stuff, and it's a complete struggle for me to make even one. it's left for me to wonder: why am i like this? why do i struggle so much to have someone to care about me? am i really THAT unlovable? im sorry if this is all over the place, it's just a jumble of thoughts that i felt like getting out.",2022-08-10 16:38:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/wl23t1/i_cant_be_loved_and_i_cant_love_either/,,0,5,"i can't be loved, and i can't love either"

1938,wl5gtg,Stimbes,"14 years ago I married the love of my life. She was amazing. I met her when I was working on my masters in Electrical Engineering. She was going to this brand new program called Mechatronics. It was amazing how smart she was. We collaborated on a lot of projects together. We worked on an idea I had from before school. She helped me get it working. I never had a partner before or after her than pushed me like that. Challenged me like she did. I felt like we had so much to teach each other. It hit me one day that I was deeply in love with her. I felt bad when she wasn't around. I remember her studying for her Ham Radio license so she could talk to me on the radio. We used to do RF experiments together. We would fly out to Maker Faire together in California. She was my partner. my love and my best friend. My life was complete with her. 

I remember when she had a seizure one day I rushed her to the hospital. They said she would be fine and that nothing was wrong. But it didn't stop. She started to lose vision in one of her eyes. Trouble speaking, eating, walking. Finally, a doctor from across the state looked at her MRI and chart. He said she had 6 months to live. I had never felt a pain in my chest like that before. The depression hit me so hard that I lost 70 lbs up until she died. I tried my best to spend every moment with her. Make it comfortable for her up to the end. I even built her casket myself in the shop we used to work in together. 

I retired at the age of 38 shortly after we buried her. The idea I had that we had worked on together sold to a company for enough money that I never have to work again. I'm glad for that because I have no passion for those things anymore. I sold the house. I moved as far away as I could. The memories of going places with her, going down streets and to stores, restaurants, and places like that all haunted me there. My therapist says I should start to date again. I can't find anyone that pushes me like she did. That made life exciting. We talked about engineering, cars, electronics, machines, radios together. I can't even find a male friend to do these things with unless a girlfriend. Most people aren't interested in the things I used to be. So I have nothing in common. It's just failure after failure in relationships. I won't find another one like her. I would only be settling for less to me. I'll never be happy again. Even after 11 years I'm still as depressed about this as the day I found out she had 6 months to live. I wish I would have been the one who died. I think she would have handled this better than I.",2022-08-10 18:52:49,lonely,t5_2qjny,1633297303,31,/r/lonely/comments/wl5gtg/being_widowed_sucks/,,0,12,Being widowed sucks.

Hey everyone. I want you to send me some songs you always go back and listen to. Those songs you play when you’re alone and maybe not feeling great. 

I’m curious as to what you guys listen to. Either DM them to me or pop them in the comments below. 

Two of my favourites are; 
Cheers Darling - Damien Rice. 
When the hospital was my home - Powfu 

Edit; Due to the overwhelming amount of comments, that has taken me completely by surprise, I will be adding a few more songs. 

What are you so afraid of (reimagined) - XXX, Rxseboy, Powfu 
Glimpse of us - Powfu Cover 
Hold Somebody - Guccihighwaters, Powfu

Edit #2; Alright you beautiful people, its currently 03:00am and I do unfortunately have to work tomorrow. I will check up on all these songs tomorrow at some point because quite frankly I did not see this ending up like this at all. Thank you all for sharing your music, it has been a blast.",2022-08-10 19:34:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1547436219,92,/r/lonely/comments/wl6jif/send_me_your_sadlonely_songs_that_you_always_go/,,0,360,Send me your Sad/Lonely songs that you always go back to

Just time and care. Someone I can message 24/7 and rely on and be there for them to rely on.(I'm pretty sure I have separation anxiety or something. The loneliness makes me feel sick).

Openness, honesty and communication are big. I don't like shallow things like judging people on looks. Personality is everything. I don't care what you look like. Just who you are. And I don't want to be judged for my looks, good or bad really.

The world we live in quite literally is designed to foster and nurture loneliness for corporate profit.

Social media companies design their apps in such a way that you'll draw negative comparisons between yourself and your friends, celebrities, and idols. 

Dating apps like Tinder, Buble, and even Hinge have become predatory in the way that they've monetized loneliness. Their algorithms are designed to match people based on short term friction rather than long term compatibility in order to sustain their business and long-term profit margins (keep desperate single people desperate and single $$$$). 

TLDR: There's nothing wrong with you, other than the fact that you live in a world gone mad, and you aren't the only one.

**Luck**, my friend. I put zero extra effort into my appearance. I didn't ""just lift bro."" I wasn't at the gym when I met her after doing 50 burpees. I didn't ""just love myself"" or see a fuckin shrink. I wasn't even thinking of dating. I was just... There. So was she. Excuse me if it seems like I'm putting her on some sort of pedestal -- because I don't mean to, but when she walked in those front doors there wasn't a snowball's chance in hell that I'd let her go without at least trying. And.. Well, here I am with a picture of her and I as my wallpaper on my phone now. We're not a thing, and I don't think I'm gonna pursue anything with her. We're two completely different people... Plus she likes to ghost me and I'm too damn old to play those games. 



Either way, something happened I swore up and down the street wouldn't... Simply because I didn't believe I deserved it. Shit I still don't think I deserve a happiness like that. Then again if we all got what we deserved a lot of us would be dead right now.

1995,wlfrj3,[deleted],"My whole life I have been a failure, and have failed in pretty much every aspect of life that matters. I have failed as a son, I have failed as a friend multiple times, I have failed to have any woman see any value in me, and I have failed as a medical student as well. There is nothing left for me in this world, and I have made my peace.

Since I was a kid, the only thing I ever really cared about was trying to make the world a better place through my intelligence. I felt as though over the course of my life, the best way for me to do this was through a career in science and medicine. Even being in med school and having the opportunity to be a doctor, does not make up for all the hatred, vitriol, ridicule, and disdain I have faced from others my entire life. In middle school, high school, and college, I was made fun of for being a scrawny weakling and nerd. Even as a child and adolescent, it was impossible for me to ever value my intelligence or academic achievements because others would just berate me or shun me for choosing this path in life. I would lie about how well I did to avoid ridicule. This is all my fault.

In relationships, I was never successful. People just saw me as a lame nerd who had nothing of value to offer, and the people who did see what little value I had were clearly smart enough to understand I could never see that value in myself. I have failed to develop close connections with people every step of the way. I have failed the most important aspect of being a human being.

My whole life, I have worked and worked and worked to be a person that's good enough for others. I have worked my whole life to see the fucking point. I have worked my whole life to try to help myself and see an actual reason to continue with life. Work work work. It's all I've ever done, and it has amounted to absolutely nothing.

1996,wlg6mw,Flames_of_Azure3," 

Honestly not sure if this goes here and/or I am just being a whiny b\*tch, but I want to get something off my chest. I am also an introvert by nature and I believe I have some Anxiety or depression issues that I am too poor to deal with.

I have been working at a small credit union for about 7 years now with my job before that being 9 years at a small dine-in pizza joint. I went from constantly hand washing dishes....by myself for 9 years to tellering at a credit union for 4 years. So a bit of an adjustment, but I figured it out. Then, when I asked for MORE to do, it took them half a year to respond and they put me in an office, and I compliance loans and mortgage. What that means is that I make sure we have all the necessary documents for each loan and they are done correctly. If not, I go tell the loan officers to fix it. I have been doing that for the last 3 years. I do help with other departments' duties because I have gotten this down to a science and I am very efficient and I don't screw around. But...this took most of that away and didn't give me much else to do, so I am just sitting there on my phone or with a book, which is not allowed. But what else am I supposed to do? No one wants me to help. Occasionally, I get called back to the teller line as a floater and our members are happy to see me if they remember me.....or just tell me I got fat because I used to be an unhealthy skinny because of my old high metabolism.

Problem is, in both jobs, I am basically ignored by everyone and in my current job, I am stuck in a small windowless cubicle with no camera on me like most do. I am just stuck there and honestly, it is furthering my depression. I feel like that position is a joke, a means to shut me up when I asked for more stuff to do...to just be helpful. I feel like that guy they put in the basement from the movie Office Space.

I should mention that turnover here is....bad. I started paying attention to those who left near the end of 2018, three years after I started. It is 2022 now and 200+ plus have come and gone in that time period and just as many before I started paying attention. Gives you further clues about how the place is run that people run away. Especially managers because the top brass is something else. Not even a consultant convinced them to change their ways. When he told them to pay their people more in a meeting, I hear them scoff.

Now, even before this job, I had issues finding a job...from 2008 to 2015, I was snubbed and ignored by most jobs and I was leaning towards going to the military until I got this job. I am grateful I originally got this job in the first place, but I feel I have overstayed my welcome here. Looking again into the job market is a nightmare and I get the same treatment and I don't have the option of the military because now I am in my 30s. So I looked into computer-related stuff and since my job is wasting my time, I am using that time to get my I.T. Certifications. Will soon test for IT Fundamentals.

I just, need to know what is wrong with me, in general, to make people and businesses act the way they do with me. Will I even have a freaking chance in the IT world or am I wasting my time? does my introvert/ambivert nature screw up my chances?

I am just so...tired and unhappy with everything about my life. Do I even deserve to be happy this late in my life?

For many years of my life i’ve suffered with chronic loneliness, and I never speak out on how I feel due to past circumstances.

Growing up as a child i was brutally neglected and psychologically/physically traumatized by my parents all for the fact they didn’t want me. Through the years growing up I learnt to accept I wasn’t wanted even until now. In school I was bullied all the way up until I graduated high school ever since I started kindergarten. 

The trauma continued at home and was relentless and ended up getting disowned by my parents yet I was too afraid to call CPS because I believed I deserved it. 

The suicidal thoughts began around age 10, and never stopped to this day. Its moreless all I can think about; except I don’t wanna die.

Skipping a few years around 2017 is when I decided to see a therapist and a year or so in my highschool ‘posed me as a threat and had my legal therapist be on school grounds throughout the week monday-friday. And I was obligated to see my therapist daily throughout the day.

I got diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, BPD

My therapist ended up giving up on me and word for word said “ur too much of a handful, I cannot continue to keep you as my client for this reason” Yet all I told her was things actually bothering me in my life as I should to a therapist. I’ve never went back to one since

I was put on anti depressants alongside seeing my therapist and took citolopram hydrobromide, colazipine, Mirtazipine. None of the medication and their doses worked so they ended up taking me off the medication. 

I moved out back in 2019, out to a city in college; (may I note in this going forward I’ve never had any friends or hungout with anyone prior to moving out) So I moved out and started a new beginning which ended up being my downfall.

My issues were getting in the way of everything and causing conflictions in between meeting new people. Overtime I overcame that problem and started making friends, and dabbled in dating. 

Most of the relationships I’ve had were fake and were only there for using me and took advantage of my kindness and giving personality. It still hurts to this day. And women I persued in love really took advantage of the situation then either later ghosted or was seeing other people while seeing me.

I began to feel suicidal even more after these events unfolded.

Its been 4 years now since I moved to this city and I have no one. Only myself. I battle with myself everyday questioning why this all has to happen to me. Why I can never get a break.

I truly believe I won’t make it to reach my birthday next month. I’m very well going to give what the world wants and end my life this week. I already planned it out and have been enacting on my bucket list for a month now and spent 10’s of thousands of dollars doing so. I’ve been giving everything I own away or have been selling it to pay for my bucket list.

Its all said and done now. I have nothing left to live for even if I did to begin with.

Its weird knowing no one cares about me or that no ones gonna miss me when I go.

I’m just a nobody in this world. I’ve accepted it. My only purpose is to die.",2022-08-11 03:15:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615149931,21,/r/lonely/comments/wlgwgy/im_all_alone_and_nobody_wants_me/,,0,3,I’m all alone and nobody wants me

2008,wlidhv,ThatboiZane,"Im 23m and have always been alone, but not really for lack of effort. Actually, it’s quite the opposite. I’ve grown tired of constantly trying to connect with people only for it to not be reciprocated. I’ve discovered I have autistic traits but trauma and experiences helped me grow out of a lot of the behaviors. Still, any autistic person will tell you it makes socializing difficult. I’ve also moved 8 different times K-12. 2 of those moves were to a different state. So that’s another factor.

To be clear I don’t go into anything with expectations. I’ve learned to not do that. I only try my very best to be considerate and respectful to everyone. I used to do things alone more often. Mostly to do my own thing, but also with hopes i might possibly meet people who have similar interests. Again, still no expectations just hopes. Yet, even if I do, I’m never able to build anything with anyone… I managed to make 2 lifelong friends which is a blessing. Except they both live far away (Met them both before moving again) and saying It’s hard to link up would be an understatement. Especially in adulthood where we have our own responsibilities.

I want to stay strong and try more things alone but it gets more depressing everytime. I’ve been trying so hard for so long and I just want friend to share moments and memories with. I yearn for some stability.

Should I just put more effort into visiting my current friends when I can? Am I being ungrateful? Am I trying to hard?

2009,wliea9,[deleted],"I'm just tired of trying to make friends at school, feeling suicidal

Like the title says, I just give up. In 9th grade I spent all of my days just staying in the library, and now that 10th grade started, I was hoping to change. I wanted to be more socialable, but no. By the looks of it it's impossible for me to make a single good friend.

 I've literally been spoonfed into some friend groups but I always fail to make a connection. When someone tells me a joke, I always reply in a really boring and lame way, and create an awkward moment until the person I'm talking to changes the topic. I hate this. 

I really hate this, I hate how I find myself pathetically jealous about people who have friends, I hate how my relationship with my parents is, and I hate myself. 

I genuinely wish I was never born. The only reason why my parents haven't divorced yet is because of me. They're both just rotting away and living their last few years of their life for a pathetic excuse of a child like me. A child who can't even manage to get straight A's in a mediocre highschool. There's a ton of more reasons, but honestly I'm tired. I'm doing a ton of more harm than good staying alive, so I guess I'm planning to poison myself tommorrow with 2 bottles of visine eyedroplets, since I heard they can kill ya. But I'll think about it.

2014,wlj1uc,Confused--Person,"Well I think I'm genuinely the worst definition of lonely, people often say they are lonely and have no one or they can't talk to anyone about anything but still have one or two people they can talk to and a few friends in addition to that . Me I just had one person. 

Well I had someone , now they are somewhat gone and  I'm alone. For two years I only had interactions with one person and that person quickly became my world and everything to me .  (I'm currently bed ridden due to a medical condition. )

I got deeply involved with this person , I love them , I started to use them as my motivation to get better,  they helped me get past my suicidal thoughts. They are amazing. 

As of a week ago they broke up with me . So now I'm officially without anyone.  I cried , I cried , and cried until I couldn't cry anymore,  then mentally I just broke . I can't coup without them and truly lost and directionless. 

Worst part ? Only one person could calm me down . Only she could calm me down. Last night I talked to her and after getting insecure about a misunderstanding where I thought she replaced me and I cried again , I called her , I couldn't say much of anything.  I maybe said 100 words during the call and she atleast three times as much trying to comfort me during an hour long call of mostly silence . Then the 52 minute mark hit , and she fell asleep it was after 2  am and I stayed on that call for an additional hour and a half listening to her breath and snore. 


Now things between us are officially dissolved. 

I don't believe in fairy tales
I don't believe in fairy tales
I don't believe in fairy tales
But I believe in you and me

I've had a song on repeat all evening. 


My mind is a mess , I'm sorry this was so scattered. 

Ps. As for why it ended , I don't know whose at fault we often fought but always got past it and she ended things when we had a very good few weeks riding high on happiness.  But in the end I am most likely the bad guy , as much as she'd say otherwise.  Yes as you can gleam she was basically an angel , I might be an atheist but that girl is what an angel and the height of goodness and kindness is .

2033,wllbf3,catastrophicish,"All throughout middle school and high school I struggled to feel as though I truly belonged. It was so bad in seventh grade I experienced suicidal ideation nearing the end of the school year and have been on some form or other of medication ever since. I was never completely friendless per se. There were always people I had to sit with at lunch or a friend or two to occasionally lean on. But what became painful was the temporariness of it all. People came and went in my life at times, and while I understand that it's natural in life for people to grow apart and change over time sometimes it felt so abrupt and out of the blue and I didn't even know why and it just hurt. I was included in things but the majority of the time I never felt like I could truly open up and be myself. Looking back, it probably didn't just have to do with my social anxiety but a growing aversion to getting close to people because getting hurt when they inevitably just faded away subconsciously felt like something within my control. Just a small bit. But the only consistency I ever felt throughout that time deep down was loneliness. A feeling of being not entirely seen, heard, or understood. That, I was told by adults was the magic of college. In college, everyone was a lot more open and friendly and that, is where I would find myself. That, is where I'd finally feel free. But in my case, that was a lie. My college experience has been so tumultuous I already feel I have wasted all of it. My first year I was surrounded by people who were all from a similar area and seemed to know each other a bunch and I already felt behind. I transferred and just as I began to see a glimmer of hope in belonging, the pandemic hit. I crashed, my grades took a hit, I took some time off while never escaping the fomo of those still back at school. I got into and out of an unhealthy relationship and attempted to pull myself together...and then my brother committed suicide. I'd already taken basically a year off. I was devastated, traumatized, and felt more distant from everyone than ever. But I went back. I spent countless times crying in my car because I didn't feel comfortable crying in front of my roommates. I was never able to truly get close to them with how distant the grief made me. While they were all excited about graduating, I was drowning. I was already going to be graduating late but the number of classes I had to drop because I just couldn't find the energy to do anything was embarrassing. I couldn't follow through on anything and I felt the judgment from those around me even if they did know what I was going through. Now, I have a whole year left (fifth year at this point) and I feel like the prime years of college everyone raves and reminisces about are already wasted. I am friendly with people and am included in things occasionally but they don't know me. I don't know how to let anyone truly know me at this point. As sad it sounds to leave on such bitter note, I think back to younger depressed me and can't help but think, would she really be proud of how I've turned out? Or would she have just committed suicide right then and there knowing how miserable I am today? I'm not currently suicidal or anything especially after seeing the grief my brother has put everyone close to him including me through. I just sometimes feel like a failure to past me whose only inclination to keep holding on was that life would be much better in the future I haven't lost hope that it will I just am disappointed that that time still hasn't come...",2022-08-11 07:30:15,lonely,t5_2qjny,1563839096,1,/r/lonely/comments/wllbf3/im_really_tired/,,0,0,I'm Really Tired...

2037,wllju6,Greedoshotfirst3,"So I’ve suffered from depression in the past after losing a parent when I was a late teen. When it first happened I felt nothing, no anger or sadness or anything. If anything I had a sigh of relief they were no longer in pain as it was a long process. 

Year or two later started having waves of depression for a day or two then slip into stages on mania for a day or two. I was rather numb to all feelings and things around me or I was over stimulated and couldn’t sit still or stop for 2 seconds. I later sought out medical help tried anti depressants which didn’t do anything for me and also tried counselling which again didn’t to anything for me. They tried to put it down to a delayed reaction to losing a parent but thinking back I’ve always been this way just what happened maybe enhanced it a little. 

Anyways I’ve managed to just calm my demons or even lighten how it affects me over the space of a couple of years. Don’t get me wrong I still have dark days and still have manic days but it’s manageable and feel as if I am in no danger. This post isn’t a sympathy or a cry for help or attention. What I’m saying is if you’re feeling down and feel like it’s never going to get better, trust me it is. Also if you feel like medication isn’t working or counselling isn’t working don’t worry and don’t think you can’t be fixed or helped, everyone’s brain functions differently and everyone has their own way of coping.

2038,wlllbs,catwomansthirdcat,"I’m a woman with an unlucky history of dating.All my friends either are married, in relationships, have babies, live far away from me, or too busy with their own lives. All valid. But I am left with no one.

I have friends that say “you can always text me or call me when you need anything or need to talk!!” And when I actually DO contact one of them, they never respond. Or they do, and they don’t really help. It’s just “sorry that happened to you” or “just focus on yourself”. Do you know how many times I have “focused and worked on myself”?!?! Omg. I’m tired. I’m tired and lonely. I have only went through a million types of spiritual awakenings and bettered myself for myself. And guess what? I STILL FEEL LONELY. I’m only getting older and I’m scared to keep feeling like this.

My therapist also called out on the day of my session and then disappeared.
I feel like a burden when a friend actually does respond to me. 

I wish I could text someone every day again like they actually cared about how I’m feeling and want to know how my day was.

I recently had a great friendship going for almost 6 months of texting each other just about every day. We knew each other for 3 years and only started talking for the last 6 months of knowing each other. We had a lot in common with music taste and tv shows and movies. There might have been some flirting but nothing creepy or harmful. I told the person I was going to a show in a city of their’s and they were really excited to see me. We went out and the day and the show was great. I asked if they wanted to hang out the next day before I left and they said yes and they said they would pick me up as well. Next day rolls around and I text them I’m checking out of my hotel and just about ready to go. No response. Text again, nothing. The texts are delivered, nothing. I was ghosted by a friend I really liked and built a super meaningful relationship and friendship with for SIX MONTHS and this person ghosted me. Not a word. I was heart broken. I was an idiot for even doing all of that trying to meet up with this “friend”. I was then so depressed for 3-4 months afterwards.
I’m in a different spot in my life now and guess what. I still feel lonely as fuck.

Everyone I know is too busy for me or doesn’t care or doesn’t know how to handle me and my emotions.
I would reach out to my family but they don’t know how to handle me or even their own feelings either. 

I kept hearing texting someone everyday is unhealthy, but I just want someone to be there for me. I don’t even have a bestie that talks to me every week to check up me. 
Every time I do talk to my “bestie” I just feel like we’re drifting apart. Nothing bad happened between us, just….drifting away.

I go to work, I pay my bills, I try to do side projects for money, I do everything I’m supposed to do. 
I “focus on myself” and I only feel more lonely.
I do creative things I like and watch shows/movies I like. I search for why I feel the way I feel. I try exercising more. I try sleeping more. I try eating differently. There is no “fix” on being lonely for me.
A friend called me “co-dependent” but maybe I am. But is that so bad? 
I also just want to be wanted and acknowledged. I want to be loved as well. 

I’m so tired of being lonely. I want this feeling to stop.",2022-08-11 07:48:21,lonely,t5_2qjny,,11,/r/lonely/comments/wlllbs/i_constantly_feel_lonely_and_annoyed_people/,,0,4,I constantly feel lonely and annoyed people saying “just focus on yourself”

2041,wlm1xz,Crazy_Gemini06,"Yeah, I know it’s pathetic I’m just so lonely he was all I had. He was the only guy who came back and fucked me over and over again, he was the only people who stayed in my life consistently everyone else left. He was my everything and more and then one day he told me that he had a new girlfriend and needed to stop talking to me, I cried and begged him not to leave I told him that he was he all I had but he still blocked me on his social media accounts and got with her. I was so broken I just layed in bed for days, didn’t eat, didn’t sleep didn’t talk to anyone, I started again cutting myself I was so sad. Then one night at 3am he called me and told me that he was back from deployment and wanted to see me. I didn’t care how late it was the second he pulled up I ran to him and we had the most amazing sex ever in the backseat of his car. His dick was so fat and glorious, it reminded me of how amazing he is. I wrapped boobs around his and he came, some of it got on my boobs and some of it was his toned thighs. I licked off everything that was on his thighs and balls, it tasted amazing like pasta water He took a SpongeBob beach towel he had in the car and wiped off my boobs, it was covered in his glorious juice. 

I begged him to dump that stupid fucking cunt and be with me but he told me that I’m just not his type and she is. I was so sad so I secretly took the cum towel and in my purse and have never washed it. That cum towel is the first thing I would save in fire. I can’t have him so I have his cum towel instead. I kiss it constantly and I think him constantly, I always hold the cum towel while I masterbate.

I miss him more than anything in the world he still asks me for nudes everyday which I send and if he says they aren’t good enough I retake until he is happy but he won’t talk to me about anything else out of respect for his girlfriend or even have me on social media because he doesn’t his girlfriend to know he talks to me and I miss him so much he is my universe but now all I have is his cum towel.",2022-08-11 08:18:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1546739497,0,/r/lonely/comments/wlm1xz/i_have_a_towel_covered_in_my_exfriends_cum_and_i/,,0,45,I have a towel covered in my ex-friends cum and I kiss it every night before I go to bed.

2049,wln59o,OkAnnual1631,"I just thought I'd share this, so today I looked at a post in quora asking if looks matter, and almost everyone said they do matter and they would not wanna be with an ugly person! But seriously, do they really matter? Think about it, would you rather be with a really handsome man or pretty lady who is so mean, and doesn't care about what you do for them and takes you for granted, or would you rather be with a person who you wouldn't consider handsome or pretty but they're a great friend or boyfriend/girlfriend to you and care about what you do for them, and they are thankful and thoughtful? Truly for everyone who has been called ugly (including me once) just because of the way you look and the person doesn't even check you out on who you are, how you treat people, your interests, personality, nothing! They're just arseholes! Because it's really what's on the inside that matters, not the outside.  Yeah maybe if you do care about looks you'd reject people or not be friends with people you don't like the look of and then later you would find someone who you find beautiful inside and out... but did you really have to take extra time just for a good looking person? Besides you'd probably get used to the way the person looks in the future anyway.  I swear it's crazy how many people out there will not respect you if you don't look a way they like, bullshit! I just wanna say to all of the lonely people here who have asked people to be their friend or go in a relationship and that's happened to them, I'm so sorry you had to go that! I'm kinda lonely too and because of all this baloney I kinda have social anxiety and get nervous to start a convo with people especially in a group.  Just remember, don't change your look for other people! Find people who like you for who you are, and hopefully more friendships and relationships in the future are made by what's on the inside.

I decided that I don t need such people in my life, but so help me God, Universe or whatever, I can t really understand why are there so many bad people in this world, when the world should have been better by each year. Maybe I m just too positive and think that maybe the world can change, but apparently no one does such thing. It s such a pity to know that one cares about you and you just throw shit at him, like he is a nobody.

2081,wlunrj,Bittlesbop,"I’m a 32 F without friends. I’m in therapy , work and go to school so I’m trying to better myself, but I’m noticing I don’t mix well with people. 

I’m very stubborn and hate for people to try to manipulate me into changing my mind . I also hate when people try to control/dominate me so I avoid them. 

I also am told I’m quite odd. I don’t have a lot of the same interest as my peers . Even when I play with gamers , I’m not interested in talking about all the game mechanics. I mostly play to get out of my head and relax. 

I feel like anytime I get close to someone they want to change me. They want me to be something to them . If I talk to a guy, he doesn’t care about my happiness, he cares about how I can add to his happiness. Same with friends , they didn’t ask me about school (the biggest thing in my life) , but would love to joke about my misery.

I don’t know what it’s like to feel loved. Not for who I can be to someone, but for who I am even if I didn’t change for them. 

This guy tried to get me to ride on his jet ski while I was at the lake( apparently he liked my appearance), but he didn’t ask my name , inquire about my well being or even if I was seeing anyone. He kept asking me to get on the jet ski (although i said no multiple times) until I ended up leaving. I really hate when people don’t treat me like a person and that’s how I felt, but his focus was on achieving some goal. I was just trying to get out the house and do something nice for myself , but most people don’t care about others no matter what they say , post online or , gaslighted themselves to believe . 

It’s exhausting and I feel like now I enter social situations with the mentality of “what do you want from me” and it’s rarely pure intentions. I had a friend that I would only hang out with every once in a while and all she did was bring random guys along … it was exhausting. I kept wondering why our friendship wasn’t entertaining without guys and I didn’t want that. 

I also do this with family 

My mom stopped by yesterday and I didn’t even want to talk to her, it’s the same routine. She doesn’t ask me how I am , but will talk endlessly about her own life. I put her on mute for 90 mins recently and she didn’t notice . It’s all about her. 

I feel like people find me boring and maybe I am , but I still want friends and companionship. 

I just haven’t figured out what works for me yet because I don’t have the energy or patience to correct all these behaviors nor do I have the strength to keep meeting people when it hasn’t worked out. I just isolate until something happens and i need to rejoin the world. 

Im so tired of being alone, but if no one else wants me as I am , as a separate uncontrollable person , I’m not sure how I can ever be content with life",2022-08-11 15:47:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610786189,22,/r/lonely/comments/wlunrj/afraid_ill_always_be_alone/,,1,10,Afraid I’ll always be alone

2084,wlvfkn,bikersquid333,"24m UK, I have zero friends atm, can't seem to connect with anyone beyond small talk. It's literally hell because I am so good around people and have been acting so naturally recently but at the end of the day or event or activity I might be doing I'm always alone, go home alone, eat alone, think alone, etc. 

I've never been in a relationship let alone experience any real intimacy with someone either. 

People think I'm fine and I have a decent social life but that's just because of the mask I've perfected over half my life at this point. I know this is probably going to get swept under the rug like so many posts from guys but there's one thing I know and that is not to give up so here's another try! 

I've got discord or WhatsApp but happy to text for a bit as well before calling. If you're not willing to have a phonecall then I don't have the energy to entertain short texts back and forth every few hours it's just exhausting. 

Check out my profile, there should be enough on there to give you a rough idea of what kind of person I am as well as my hobbies and interests 👍🏻.

2096,wlwhkk,Amanda12778,"Silent days. Silent days are the worst. I kind of hate them more than the days I can’t hold in my tears. But those days are more risky. Silent days. The days where my mind is blank no thoughts nothing goes on in my head it might sound like a good thing but it’s the worse. I feel empty exhausted and drained. My minds given up on trying to keep me alive. Today was that day. I can count how many words I said today. It was around 10 maybe a little over. But again my voice was gone I couldn’t say anything even if I wanted. Days like these hurt a little more.Days like these it’s harder to hide that I’m not okay. Days like these I want to be alone because being with people feels even more lonely and draining it feels like I’m floating as if I’m not there. Usually my social anxiety is the reason for these days but today it wasn’t the only reason… I had a dream a dream that I had my voice  a dream I was the perfect daughter a dream that I could communicate a dream that a boy liked me we would talk, laugh,he would make me smile a dream that I was happy. He was my  best friend he was someone that protected me never gave up on me was there for me made me laugh smile and for once I felt happy. He made me happy. I woke up smiling I thought it was all real I was so happy. Before the dream ended I had texted him I woke up and went straight to my phone to see if he had responded.But there was nothing,there was nobody. Only scam numbers or business text. Then I realized it had all been a dream none of it was real. I felt so hurt. Knowing I would never have what I had in that dream.Knowing that I will never have someone or be someone.I’ve had dreams like that before they’re the only dreams I remember and they hurt the most because it’s all fake it reminds me of what I’ll never have.But I never did what I did today I never not realized it was fake, maybe for a second I thought it was real but that’s it.

2098,wlwkku,hagia_bastard,"Hello! I'm conducting a study for my MSc Psychology thesis on ways we might be able to manage loneliness and depressive symptoms. There's lots of evidence out there to suggest that loneliness can have pretty severe consequences for people's mental \*and\* physical health, so it's pretty important to start developing ways of combating loneliness and the depressive symptoms associated with it. I'm also cool to chat about the science down in the comments.

The study can be found here:  [https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_2n2t3UgUrTrYT2u](https://nupsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2n2t3UgUrTrYT2u?fbclid=IwAR2BtN5Z7AC7b52DAMHrOlYaAkZI6oBZjMgLZP0Jsnd9vGBlIx4Rn1Dzn_Y) 

As a heads up, participation will involve a 15-minute survey on the platform Qualtrics. Our study has full ethical approval from Northumbria University.

Participation is limited to those 18 and above. I realise it's inconvenient to take the time out to fill in the survey, but by taking part, you may get some insight into your emotional management strategies and it may give you something to think about.

2123,wm07br,umbreon10000,"(25M) Been depressed the past 14 years, on and off suicidal. So sick of the lie ""it gets better"", it absolutely does fucking not.
Dont get me wrong, things go up and down, but it always ends up right back at the shithouse you started in.
Shits gotten real bad recently, I moved city with my fiance away from our friends (her for work, me for masters), but with covid and the housing market, it took ages and well affected my masters performance.

This is were it started, the stress of buying a house and doing the masters hit me like a ton of bricks, it was the first time in a while I had been so low. 
Then the relationship went toxic, I was blamed for it because of my depression, I understand it was a lot, but I was in therapy I was seeking help outside of her. I really wanted things to work and taught they would, but then one day she tried to frame me for domestic assault. And that was the end of 6 years. She moved back in with the friends i introduced her to so who do i got lmao

I was a mess for a while after this, I thought I had everything figured out then blamo all for naught.
But I consider myself pretty durable. I picked myself up as usual and put myself back out there. I did meet someone online, I thought it was too good to be true, and long story short, it was. She scammed me out of my savings.
Its really what I get for letting myself get excited.

Wanna know the kicker, I recently been offered the PhD I've busted my ass the last 3 years for. But I feel so worthless and unmotivated I dont think I want it anymore. I dont even see myself in a week ffs

Long story short I was in a relationship that lasted around 2 months. 

I was blindsided by being broken up, and finally feel like I'm close to being over it. It was very difficult for me, losing someone I was just getting to really know, someone I adored.

I have a nice job, workout daily, and have been attempting to make new friends and go out.

I just feel like this small fling made me realize that I want more in life. I know the next person won't come tomorrow but how do I feel content about being single again? It just feels like something is missing, and I want that to change.

Right now I thought about this and came up with a “theory” or how you’d call it, and thought it might be helpful to some people too.

There’s many different ways in which you can miss a person obviously, but the way how you express it or feel about it might say a lot about the whole situation.

I think there’s a significant difference between some of those feelings of grief. If it was toxic, and it hurts so much and keeps coming up, but somehow you can’t let it go.
The reason why you no longer have contact with the person can be very unique of course too. Who made the move to end the friendship or relationship, who did what.

Though ask yourself, in what way do you actually feel the grief.
Do you miss the person, as them, and would you take them back exactly as they were when things ended, or, does it hurt, and if you were given the chance, you’d just want the pain to end.

I think it makes a big difference. Like maybe you want the nice times back, just when everything was easier. And maybe the reason it broke apart was because they changed and it didn’t work anymore, or you both did or they showed you a side of them that you had never seen before and that ended it- either way something changed from when it used to be nice. 

And that time won’t come back. And when people change theres rarely anything you can do about it, it just happens.

But when you don’t actually want them back like it was when it broke, thats how you know, its good that you’re no longer together. 



And it can still hurt and thats okay, but just know it was a good thing to do it and its still okay to miss the love or the old person,

and I’m proud of you.",2022-08-11 23:41:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649980352,1,/r/lonely/comments/wm5vkz/a_take_on_grieving_toxic_realtionships/,,0,0,A take on grieving toxic realtionships.

2174,wm70zv,geekyguy4,"Hi

I'm 22. I started working full time this year. Regular 8 hours, working from home even.

I feel like I have nothing left in me after work. I just wanna lay down and die. I don't even have the energy or the will to do chores most of the time.

If I think about how I will have to do this for the rest of my life, it makes me sick.

It probably doesn't help that I cant really fall asleep in time so I'm not getting enough sleep.  
And I might also be depressed or burned out. I feel like I'm slowly going crazy.

I'm suppose to be in my prime, I'm not lacking in any material things, I'm don't have any disabilities, I have it so easy yet I'm still miserable..

I stress a lot about my adult responsibilities (finishing uni is numero uno), there's always this feeling in my chest, call it anxiety or whatever. Its been so long since I felt free or happy for a longer period.

If you have any advice, I'll probably won't take it. I just can't bring myself to do anything.. Though its nice of you if you comment.

*There was a lot of 'I's in this..*

2179,wm7j31,Sad_potato1898,"So to preface, I’m a 23 year old male. I graduated college, work a full-time job and live alone now. And with living alone, I tend to not only revisit but recover very dark memories from my grade school life. I think about how terribly I was treated by so called “friends”. Being constantly chastised, ridiculed, and outright treated as a punching bag when I damn well should’ve hit back sometimes. There are countless memories resurfacing of being embarrassed and harassed over many things, I was very into band, tried sports and did well with my schoolwork, I had one “girlfriend” and it felt like everyone wanted to intrude on the relationship which was awful. But so many people on so many occasions would do anything to take that everything from me. Truthfully, I had no one. My relationship with my parents wasn’t that great and my friends were shit so I was just downright depressed. I remember doing anything I could to hurt myself, whether it be taking random pills we had at home to drinking mouthwash. I just wanted physical pain to offset my emotional pain. Now that I’ve moved out of the state and started life on my own, I am so heartbroken at the fact that I was being emotionally abused right to my face and didn’t even know it. From the bottom of my heart, I hate those that put me through that mess so much. I hope the worst for them. I stopped replying to texts and occasionally reaching out to all of them over the course of college because of my pure disgust with them. Has anyone else been through something similar?😞",2022-08-12 00:57:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1606689481,7,/r/lonely/comments/wm7j31/i_hate_a_lot_if_people_i_went_to_high_school_with/,,0,1,I hate a lot if people I went to high school with

It hurts to have someone that calls you friend, you do your best to be the best friend you can be, always caring and loving, however when you call that particular friend out just to hang out and have some fun doing whatever, that person always dodges you...
But, the same friend hangs out with someone else every single week...

Even as an introvert, most people would feel miserable that way wouldn’t they? I’m tired of being alone and friendless. I hate it so much, but I think I experience “social anhedonia” and don’t enjoy hanging out with people much either. Hence the lack of motivation to make friends/have relationships. I can spend time with someone for a little bit, but I don’t genuinely “have fun” or enjoy myself. I just want to escape the situation like your average person wants to leave work as soon as they arrive. Also socializing tends to bring up self hate for me; I’m never really satisfied with myself. I’m not as smart or witty as I wish I was, I’m not really funny, I have nothing really interesting to say or much of a “personality” anymore. 

One morbid thing I do is read through things people say about friends who’ve died. “You were so kind and funny” “You always have a way of lighting up the room and making people feel good” And so on.

I (F18) feel as if I’m wasting what’s supposed to be the best years of my life away because I have no friends. I have a boyfriend that’s still in high school who has friends of his own, but I find them hard to get along with because of some history that happened while I was still in school. 
I have actually tried to get close with a couple of his friends, but it seems to always fall through either because they already have a close friend they enjoy spending time with, or our personalities just don’t click. 
It’s hard for me to make friends of my own right now, because I work (childcare) weird hours, and only hang out with people way older than me, or 4 year olds. 
I have a hard time socializing after going so long without friends, so now I find it hard to even keep a conversation with a stranger, I can’t imagine how hard it would be to maintain a friendship. 
As a female, I wish I could just have one girl friend that was my best friend. Someone I could connect easily with, conversation wouldn’t feel so hard, and we could go on little friend dates together. 
I wonder if it’s because of me, I wonder if it’s because I’m too ugly or just not like able. 
I pray every night that I’ll meet someone and become friends with them, and maybe even meet some of their friends and have a whole friend group. 
For now though, I’ll just keep wishing for one friend.

2229,wmefbw,FlatPassenger6,"I don’t know if this’ll fit. I live in a building that has a disabled outreach program and once a year, we have to renew our service agreement. Usually, they ask us about our health and emergency contacts, but one of the questions is “Do you ever get lonely?” To which I kind of fumbled around a bit and said “Sometimes”

What I meant was I was lonely in the romantic sense and I’d settle for some casual dating after being single for two years. I don’t mean to come across as curmudgeonly, but I kind of detest having to make small talk, it’s really rare that one to one conversation doesn’t feel alien to me, and I already have all the friends I can really want or need, which is basically like 3 people: My old college roommate, my ex, and a lovely person I occasionally Reddit chat with, where the rapport/banter felt natural pretty much instantly. I’m good with that I guess 

Admittedly, it’s an odd dichotomy to walk the line of, and I understand that my arms reach stance and the way I carry myself and some of the rougher edges of my personality don’t really lend themselves to dating or that kind of vulnerability. I can’t explain it, but man, do I just feel ready, y’know? It’s been two years of tumbleweeds in the love life department. Dating apps are hell and give me full blown anxiety attacks. But I also have no other way to meet people in that context, as a part of the vulnerable population in a pandemic that still has a ways out to becoming endemic.

It’s really the relationship side of isolation that weighs the heaviest on me. I still miss being a boyfriend, or just being paired up. Having someone that knows you and makes you feel understood because they chose and want to know you and make you feel that way and making someone else feel special. I don’t know how that side is going to shake out long term. Deep down, I’m fairly sure I’d like to be able to marry someone eventually, but who knows? It’s something I have to put in the back of my mind, otherwise I know I’m going to drive myself crazy. I’m lucky I can self soothe and compartmentalize when it really starts to get to me.

Of course, there’s no way being paired up with someone in a platonic way through outreach won’t eventually lead me to where I want to be in a roundabout way, but as soon as I heard the phrase “Buddy up” I started to regret saying anything at all. They can’t matchmaker you, it’s probably not in their budget. Thanks provincial government!

So, Lonely in love, but standoffish about making more friends.

What should I do if I feel something wrong with my friends?

We have a discord server which is always active but suddenly it became inactive on the next day. I felt as if I  was left there alone.

Did they left me? Or, is it just weird feeling that I have? Tut in the end of the day it made me feel so lonely.

What make it hurts more is that all of my friends are usually always in front of their computer and always active in voice-chats and playing games.

I've been thinking of cutting ties with them 100% but they seems like doing push and pull thingy which  is left me confused in where we stand as friends.

I had a small group of friends that I kept through my educational years.  But for the past 8 years since finishing university, I've been really lonely. Those particular friends moved away or moved on with their own lives.

Hitting 30 was a big low for me. Most people I knew were getting married, buying houses and having kids. Nobody really had time for to hang with me anymore, as they were too busy with their girlfriend or their kids. So every weekend I spend by myself for the past couple of years. I work Mon-Fri so I'm usually too busy to care. But the weekends hurt for sure. Sometimes I get to see ex-coworkers from past jobs but that's pretty much once every couple of months. 

At first, I was okay being able to play video games to my heart's content and have all the time to myself. But now I just feel really lonely. I've often thought about visiting places on my own but seeing couples, friends and stuff hanging out makes me feel worse, wishing I could have it.

I think when you get to 30+ years old, having a girlfriend and a family with kids maybe is more important than ever. Since you can't really rely on the people you used to know anymore.

2311,wmt5v7,MoreCoffeePlzzz,"Hi Yall,

This is kinda sad to admit but been lonely for a long time. All my immediate family passed away the last two years. I live alone in a house I just bought without other humans but have my dog at least.

One of my ""friends"" (of 17 years) moved in with their s.o. for a few months but they always kept to themselves and never invited out. Whenever I put a movie on streaming they would say ""Oh I saw that in the theaters"" without any invites and go back down to my basement they were renting. Acting like tenants rather than friends. Okay.

And recently they abruptly moved out without any notice. They took advantage of me. Always paid rent late. Before this they were living with one of their grandparents and cousins without jobs, insurance, etc. When they lived here they paid under 700 (650 for two people AND a cat) to rent the basement including utilities which has two rooms and a common space.

While I helped them settle here out of their expensive state, they were able to find work, update their expired IDs, get insurance, and kickstart their lives with a dual income of around 4k a month and a large bonus each for working at a certain warehouse company. They never comforted me at all when I needed consoling. In fact, they would use the term ""i'm gonna go dye"" as a substitute for sleep. and yeah I spelled a different word here for reasons even though they used the death version and not the colouring version.

I have a home office and work at home, so I don't see colleagues face to face but we chat in ms teams sometimes.

I just turned 32 last month (yippy for me with no family or friends saying happy bday). My older sister (33 was due to be 34 this later this month) passed the same month as my bday. My mom passed last October so not even a year later the last of my family gone. Being in my 30s its difficult meeting people. Also with introversion, GAD, depression etc. that doesnt help. God, life is tough and full of uncertainties.

I play video games to cope. I have a ps5, switch and pc with a i7 12th gen and 3090.

I have stuff but I don't have people to enjoy it with.

My dog tries hard to comfort me though. I'd like to meet new people to discuss hobbies and life with. I like action adventure games, VR, rpgs, most stuff. Not sports. I used to like anime in my teens and 20s but havent watched in a while, wouldnt mind recommendations to check out. I also like deeply pyschological shows like black mirror, Severence, trippy things like that, true crime and scifi and comedy like Community.

I said yes because there is nothing else out there and I start next week. The vibe I get from her is far more friendly than the last one, but I still am terrified to open up to her about my loneliness. I keep reading how I'm trash, the I word, a horrible person who deserves to suffer, and of course some other choice words. I'm having trouble opening up outside of here because IRL, what if she thinks I'm I word trash who deserve to suffer? Basically she would say, do better, then put me down. It actually did happen twice but they used other words that were not as straight forward. I feel like loneliness is this big taboo that you can't open up about. It only worked with one temporary therapist who I always liked to talk to. She said all these nice things and told me I'm not I word trash who is a danger to society. I still miss her. I can talk about my childhood to the therapist but one of the major problems I have is loneliness making me extremely depressed.

2336,wmwb8x,pximon,"I don’t know where to start.

First, I’m a sort-of grad student who’s waiting for her graduation ceremony in November. Life had been tiring the last few months with exams and my leaving home because I decided not to accept my birthgiver’s abuse anymore. 

But then I had to come back home because I couldn’t stay at the dorms anymore after finals are over. Me and the birth giver don’t talk and I feel liberated but still “on guard” whenever I see her doing random domestic stuff like cooking, washing the dishes, watching movie in the living room etc. It feels like if I lower my guard, she might strike me in the midst of doing those harmless domestic human stuff.

I do my own dishes and laundry btw.

I’m not working rn but I plan to but “planning” without putting it to motion is just daydreaming. I know this, yet I’m not doing anything to secure a job for some reason.

I don’t pay the bills and I order takeout (dad’s money) or reheat tinned pasta for meals. 

It’s not a fulfilling life. I’m not happy. I have friends but I don’t let them know what’s beyond the surface because I don’t want to burden them. I’m always alone, I’m fine with it but tbh I think it’s because I have no choice but to be alone. I stopped talking to my dad (eg asking how his day was and telling him stuff about mine) because he dismissed my experience when I mentioned the birth giver/ his wife’s abuse despite knowing how I feel about her. I just ask him for money sometimes and he gives enough for an okay-ish meal at a cafe which I usually go to with my friends every fortnight or so.

I kinda just gave up on the notion of having a normal family relationship with my family members. I have a roof over my head and i’m not starving, maybe I’m “comfortable” and is scared of change.

I have tried so hard in the past but my social failures were all so devastatingly mortifying I eventually always end up not trying at all since that's less embarrassing than trying hard and still failing.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not shy, I can easily walk up to someone and talk to them (if I'm feeling like it), but it seems ever since I was born I was just destined to be a loner. I feel different from everyone else (and I do not mean it in a good way at all): ever since I was a kid, I've always had obscure interests and a weird sense of humor. I used to be proud of it but ever since I got more self aware in 7th grade, I've never been the same. 

I usually assume it's because of my looks? I feel like I'm just not attractive at all to be even considered in any social context. I often feel others don't even perceive me as a girl (despite my feminine appearance), and of course this implies I also have never been in a relationship. My worst fear is being perceived as the ""weird, socially awkward kid"" at school (I'm 14 and about to go in 10th grade). That's the last thing I would ever want to be, but it seems like I am.

I have never been to a party, nor kissed someone. I know I'm young but it seems literally anyone my age has already done this. I've tried hanging out with people from my class, but we are so uncompatible that I eventually ended up trying really hard to relate to them (with them not reciprocating the effort) and failing miserably. 

I technically do have an irl friend group, but I've hung out with them like 8 times, had fun, but I can't seem to get close to them as I would like to. I may consider them my best friends and think of them every day, but I know that's not reciprocated and that I'm just some forgettable friend in the background who shows up once in a while (they live a bit far from me).

 When I'm interested in someone, I can't even ENTER the talking stage at all.

I feel like I'm completely missing out on everything highschool years have to offer. Friends, parties, love, relationships, you know, all the fun stuff. I'm missing out on everything.

People will say ""just go outside"" as if I don't already?? I'm so lonely it's become genuinely alienating. I wish this would end already.",2022-08-12 23:37:09,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630059444,9,/r/lonely/comments/wmzfob/im_tired/,,0,2,I'm tired

I just wanted someone to text me back, and they decided it was too hard because of their social skills.

2369,wn0x9c,bronnaoof,"TL;DR: I have lost my ability to socialize. I ghosted everyone in my life and that brings me immense sadness, but I feel stuck in this cycle of avoiding people because I have so much social anxiety and so little motivation. I would love advice on gaining control of your own life, and I would love for people to share their similar experiences so I don’t feel so alone. 

Ever since the pandemic began and I started going out less, I gradually have been losing my ability to socialize. I now no longer leave my house very often, if I leave 2-3 times in one week that’s a really good week for me. 

I no longer talk to any of my friends either, which breaks my heart because I think about them all the time but I get so much anxiety talking to people. I fully stopped responding to literally everyone without explaining my feelings. I even moved states and only told 2 of my friends the week I was leaving. I also barely respond to my family, to a point where they have threatened to call the police for wellness checks. My phone is set to do not disturb 24/7 so I don’t have to face anyone. 

My whole life I have struggled with avoiding things I find difficult, so the longer I don’t talk to someone, the more terrifying it becomes, and I feel so stuck in this cycle. At this point I feel I’ve dug myself so deep I don’t know how to bounce back and live my life and become happy again. I look back at my life before I got to this point and I am so disappointed in who I have become. 

I also want to add that I really don’t like myself because I have been unproductive for years and really struggle with my appearance, and this makes my depression 100x worse.

2406,wn5st2,BeeHot3659,"some literal POS had the nerve to try to gaslight me on how I feel, so to avoid anymore of those types I’ll just post from this acc… but anyway - 

To frame this, I have amazing taste in men because my standards are based on quality of character, emotional intelligence, and personality traits - not looks or height or whatever. 

I used to go out a lot and be one of the most confident, bubbly, and striking people in the room but it was with the benefit of alcohol. 
I got tired of leaving the house and I don’t really trust too much because of where I am. 

Literally everyone in my city (Miami) just wants to fuck everyone, and the guys will try to sell you a dream by *any means necessary* to get into your pants which I do not partake in at all. 

I’m almost involuntarily celibate at this point because I literally can’t find a guy I could say is trustworthy enough to sleep with and it’s kind of hard to get to know people because my guards are wayyyy the fuck up. 

On the outside, I’m happy and radiant when I’m meeting people but inside I’m like, “haha, I totally caught that red flag and will not be around you again.”

I’m a verrrrrrryyyyyyyyy loving soul, but I’m extremely selective because my heart breaks WILL lead me to be bed ridden for months or send me on a toxic self destructive binge, and all of my relationships have usually lasted more than a year. My longest was 4 years, and after that I learned to break up with people if I don’t feel completely loved or respected anymore after ample communication and chances. 

On dating apps I ask questions like, “what do you have in mind” for a plan for us to meet and the guys either actually might have a plan that’s 1. Inappropriate 2. Bad 3. Nice but they’re inconsistent or 4. they take me in circles trying to make me do that for them… 

It’s weird. I can’t really muster the energy to get up and go out anymore even though where I am it would be really easy for me to find a partner, but 9/10 not someone who would match me mentally and emotionally…. 


I think my emotional and mental depths are too deep for the average person. Like I’ve done my fair share of psychedelics, my parents practically raised me in a library, and I’m aware my perspective is going to be much more aligned with few.

I just want to align with another unique individual who has the same qualities of kindness, love, depth, honesty and ambition like I do. I do believe in true love but maybe I shouldn’t anymore? 

I just don’t know if it will ever happen, especially because I’m mostly straight and a lot of men don’t value honesty with women because they don’t always see us as people. 

And as I rise in age, I’m starting to think perhaps I wasn’t meant to be in a relationship with anyone?  

I’m considering being completely serene with my aloneness and not even bothering anymore. Maybe deleting all of the dating apps because they completely frustrate me, and just picking up a hobby. Or leaving them open in case that one comes around.

I wish I could loosen up in real life and maybe if I let go of needing to emotionally and mentally connect over time I could experience at least some casual romance. 
I just keep shutting people out if I get a whiff of BS… I don’t even know how to be charming anymore because I can’t be fake.

Don’t know the point of this. It’s Friday night and I’m just getting this off my chest. I’ll meditate and let the whole desire go. But this I think is my last hurrah.",2022-08-13 04:51:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602626592,4,/r/lonely/comments/wn5st2/guards_too_high/,,0,5,Guards too high.

I think we could've, no, we should've been a thing, though. I should have made a move, I should have tried harder to keep you around, but wouldn't that be disrespectful once you made it super clear that we were over? 

Well, for the last months I didn't really think about you all that much. You popped up once or twice? Maybe every other week or once a month. It doesn't really matter, I thought you were gone for good. But then, out of nowhere, you're everywhere. In everything I do I can see you. Sometimes I'm making plans and it feels like I should include you. When I think about my future, you're there. I wake up and I expect to see a message from you, even though I know there won't be any. Your name is in the lyrics of every single song I know, even the ones I don't really like. 

We should be a thing. That's what bothers me. We should've been a thing.

Of course I can go on without you, but I'll always wonder how different my life would be with you around. Would we be an annoying happy couple? Would we be childish and silly? Would you be mad at me because I don't seem to grow up? Would we be one of those couples that people don't even realize are a couple? Would we be totally independent most of the time and just cuddle up for entire weekends? All I know is that we should've been a thing.

Because I still think about you. And I'll allow myself to be selfish now, even if I sound like a spoiled kid. I should be yours and you should be mine.

It doesn’t help that I’m a minority and always had an community when I was in CA. In the state I’m currently in, I’m even more of an minority. I just feel so lonely here. I want to move back to CA but its just so expensive that my mom and I can’t afford it. I always thought of moving back to my home country where all my family is but theres an issue, my home country is still poor. Good news is that its developing very fast.

I miss feeling loved and cared about. I miss laughing and doing things I love with someone. Ive been crying since I got the text. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it, and I’ve found myself feeling like I just can’t take a breath. My heart feels so tight. I don’t know what it is that I do to make people leave me. I am just so tired of being alone. I’ve never been one to sit and contemplate suicide. (don’t worry this isn’t a note) But as the days go on, it seems maybe things would be easier if I decided to. I know it’s probably something I shouldn’t be so dramatic about but I don’t know how to describe how hurt and broken I am. I feel so paper thin. 

Maybe none of this makes sense. But I just needed somebody somewhere to listen to me even if just for a moment.

2446,wn9pjq,Metsi20,"From as early as as I can remember, I've never had any genuine friends. I've had 'friends' of course, but I've never had a friend who I could laugh my heart out with, talk to for hours, exchange deepest secrets with, and would always have their back. Hell, unlike most people I've never had a best friend.

I was always the social outcast, the weird girl, the loner(mostly) in my old school. In primary school, I'd sit in a circle of girls, but they would always chat about anything related to them, like when they would hangout and stuff. All in front of me. I was mostly left out, and whenever i tried to talk either they would acknowledge it with a quick 'Ok' and move on or outright ignore me. I felt like it wouldn't make any difference if i wasn't there. Like i was a tumor.

It got worse in secondary school. I was heavily bullied and no one had my back. I would try teporting to the teachers and they would mostly tell me it wasn't a big deal. Everyone in secondary at least had one friend they could rely on. And even if teachers didn't listen to them about their bullying, at least they could vent and have social support. Not for me though. And i was also kind of ridiculed for being alone. People would often video me on the social media at my most embarrassing moments, people would befriend me as a joke. My interests (anime, rock/indie music) wasn't aligned with the general public. 

My loneliness has contributed to my mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. I've accepted the fact that I'll always be a loner but i feel so fuckin lonely everyday. Whenever i look at a group of friends having fun together, i feel a stone in my heart, because i know i probably won't ever have that level of friendship. In counselling sessions I'm always told that friends can help me cope with my mental issues, but not having any friends has contributed to my mental issues.

Now I'm in college and although i have made some friends, I'm afraid that I'll always be lonely. I want to make closer friends in college because this is the most I've ever had to a genuine friendship. But I'm afraid people will think I'm trying too hard or I don't deserve to be that close to them. 

So yeah, always have been lonely, always am lonely, always will be lonely. I'll probably just end up being a old cat lady. I wonder if anyone can relate to never having any genuine friends in their life.",2022-08-13 08:47:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608229776,84,/r/lonely/comments/wn9pjq/i_wonder_if_anyone_else_is_in_the_same_spot_as_me/,,0,27,I wonder if anyone else is in the same spot as me.

I hate the self-pity, no self esteem, the fact i cry most of the time because of it. I really don't know what to do. Every day it hurts more &amp; i'm overthinking a lot.

Hello all. I have depression, I go to therapy weeks. I'm not sure of how severe it is but it is here. In my last session, we were talking about my social activities. I isolate myself very often, really only speaking to my boyfriend,  my mother or 1 of my cousins. I have very very little friends that I actually speak to. About 2-3 people. My therapist was asking me if I'm okay with not really having friends and why I don't try to make friends. I cannot think of things on the spot and have a very hard time expressing myself in person. For example of this, I don't talk about anything serious with my mom in person, I physically cannot. I just text her from my room. My boyfriend has also said there's been multiple occasions where I have trouble expressing myself on the phone(I have forgotten about this, my memory is extremely spotty). I felt so like empty just staring at my therapist as she looked for an explanation on why I am isolating myself. I enjoy being around others I guess but at the same time, I don't go out of my way to go be around others. And when I do go out of my ways to try to make friends, I have trouble. I love explaining things and rambling about anything that I'm enthusiastic about. Often times I forget on what exactly I'm passionate about because there's always 100 thoughts happening at once and I don't know which ones are actually me thinking these things. I just had to create a list on things I do love talking about so I can remember whenever I get the chance to ramble. But anyways back to what I was saying, I have trouble finding friends that stick. Mostly because when I try to speak on things I'm ignored, left on delivered, looked at like I'm crazy, or just not even listened to. I also have a lot of conflicts happening within myself(I think) because I can't understand regular social/human things. Like what charisma is, why people don't like me, is my brain is a separate entity, why do people choose to be bad people to others etc. I just don't know what's wrong with me. Why does no one want to talk to me? Why can't I understand those types of things? This is truly saddening to me. I'm not sure if I am really who I am and I don't understand why people chose to give me the time of day. Am I alone? Do any of you think like this?? Is anyone going through this? Thank you for reading this",2022-08-13 13:56:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1552762981,3,/r/lonely/comments/wnf4d8/i_am_alone/,,0,5,I am alone?
2470,wnf4ix,Hanako_Hanako,Hello there fellos reddit users. I recently moved to a new country and tranferred to a new school. And I honestly don't this my life felt this overmwhelming before. First of all my family of 4 will soon start living 2 by 2 (I will be staying with my mom). My brother and father will leave in a few days and that thought just drains me. My mother goes to work so I cant imagine being so alone. I go to school but not only is the system very different but also the people. I feel very overwhelmed. Since people tend to spell my name wrong I gave myself a nickname others can adress me as but... Whenever i hear it i feel like I am not myself. However i do have close friends from my old schools. But they are so far and they also have their own life... not to mention the time difference. So i feel like a burden. Honestly I know this isnt that big of a deal but the loneliness is consuming me day by day. I was wondering if anyone has any advice to feel better? And also maybe some tips to adapt to a new school and make close friendships like my old ones.

I moved to new city to make new friends and I still haven't made any and it's been a year. I broke up with my boyfriend because we were long distance and it wasn't working out. It's been so long that I've spoken to my old friends that i barely know how to start a conversation with them. I'm leaving my retail job with lots of people my age to start a wfh job.

I've got no one else to blame but myself and I hate myself for it. It's so easy for people to make friends and when I get close I sabotage it. I feel like I've had my opportunities to make connections and I keep ruining them so often that I don't think I'll get those opportunities again. 

I'm 23 and I should be going out and having fun. I don't even need to go to nightclubs just hanging out and seeing a movie with good friends is enough. But I ruin everything so I spend most of my days watching TV and going on twitter.

2475,wnfyld,[deleted],"Tried to come to reddit to get some online friends but I think either people here don't want friends and like to live alone or they just post for some attention and fake internet points only.
I'm done with one sided efforts, people talk like they need a friend, long term or short term, and next just ghost, or make the other person feel forced to talk.There's nothing to talk, after some basic info, there's just awkward silence for a moment and then the chat dies forever. I found some good people but most of them were just gaining attention or idk i don't give a shit but they certainly showed how much they need a friend. Everything that I have I said is based on personal experience. Everytime I talked to people here, I had to get information out of them, it felt more like an interrogation than a chat.

People here don't have friends because they don't know how to be a friend, no wonder this sub exists.

2492,wnkr4u,Thatebony,"I used to be lonely and would settle for anything. 
Ive grown up now 24 F, I’m still lonely but 
It doesn’t mean I will settle for about anything. 

I’d rather stay alone than be with people who will bring me down. 

I’m fit, go to the gym, mind what I eat. I wake up at 5, meditate, take care of my skin and my body. I am attractive, and have money. I love myself, and grind everyday to become the child-free / successful woman of my dream. 

I just don’t vibe with most people, and that’s ok. 
Why should you hang out with people that abuse you, and don’t do anything with their lives just because you’re lonely ? I’m staying alone until I meet likeminded people. 


Moral of the story : Don’t settle for anything ? You work hard ? Get with people who also work hard.

PSA : I feel a lot of people on r/lonely wouldn’t be so lonely if they tried to improve themselves FOR THEMSELVES. I’m literally getting a nose job in November. Nothing is too extreme imo.

PSA 2 : I’ve read a quote once, and it just resonated with me : “I might be a loner but y’all hang out with people that talk sh*t about y’all” 
Completely changed my perspective.

PSA 3 : Might be an unpopular opinion but oh well : idc. 
The whole self-pity of “oh, I’m so ugly, that’s why I’m alone BUT I don’t want to improve myself/ get more handsome because it’ll be much more sadder than not having anyone” is pathetic. 
Then. Stop. Complaining. You’re not willing to improve yourself but want someone perfect ? Your self-entitlement is showing pal. No woman is entitled to be on a relationship with you especially if you’re not up to their standards.

2493,wnkt8j,Alphamatter9," I slept for 14 hours last night because I couldn't bear to get myself out of bed. During that time I had a dream about a relationship from years ago and it felt good to be back with that person again. When I finally woke up I felt awful, it's a Saturday so I don't have work and my plans fell through for the weekend so I'm feeling stuck at home right now. I hate this because it just reminds me of how alone I really am and it means I'm just gonna be anxious all day.

 Lately work has been the only thing that I do other than sleep during the week to the point of where I've been skipping meals occasionally. On my drives to and from work I pretend to have conversations and day dream about spending time with people who I currently have no interaction with. It feels good to have these mock conversations and plans but I know it's not real and when I think about the reality of it I start to feel even worse. I'm afraid that I might be becoming slightly obsessive with the fantasies though and don't want to let them go.

 I haven't been reaching out to people much at all lately and find the idea of interacting with people I don't know as well terrifying. The last time I put myself out there I ended up in an awful relationship that drained me of everything I feel like I had. I ended up finally ending things but since then have built up walls that I myself am afraid to move past. I crave and want positive interactions with people in person but just can't bring myself to put everything out there like I have in the past. I dont want to try online dating again because I feel like it makes me feel even worse about myself but I don't know what else to do anymore.

 I feel scared, and cowardly. I'm not even really sure why I'm writing this other than to maybe put things into context and visualize things. I'm not sure what I'm going to do and I don't know if any of this really matters. I guess I kinda just wanta scream into the void.",2022-08-13 18:09:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1605429991,5,/r/lonely/comments/wnkt8j/i_wish_i_couldnt_dream_at_all/,,0,2,I wish I couldn't dream at all

2504,wnmgzc,_Forever_depressed_,"my best friend is probably like my only true friend now i guess (i dont really have any other friends actually) and she's also my crush too and i love her a lot. Unfortunately i dont think she shares the same feelings towards me because she likes another guy in her class. This guy in her class likes her too and has been crushing on her for years and just recently they have been talking and flirting a lot. She said that he sent her lots of selfies to her and it made her super excited cus he's giving her so much attention now. She also said yesterday she was KINDA holding his hand and now that guy is telling her that he will give her a hug when he sees her in school next monday. 

And u know what? Im not even supposed to know this information, and idk why she didnt tell me all these. I found out about these information just by lurking in the group chat during her conversation with her other friends when i wasnt online. 

I know the obvious advice is to move on (which im trying to do right now), but its really hard to get over it. I have met many friends in life, but many seem to just come and go. But not her. I have known my best friend for over a year, and no other person in my life has ever given me this much attention and love before, and of course, i started getting obsessed with her as well as falling in love with her some time after we met. And now we liked each other a lot platonically despite our ups and downs and she even sees me as her closest guy friend now which i deeply appreciate it. 

Also tbh i feel pretty skeptical about the guy she's crushing on cus my bestie sometimes complains to me about him acting super dry, but i think she's probably just overreacting cus she's pretty shy of him. Anyways, it seems like they are getting a lot closer now and its only a matter of time till they become official, leaving me alone to wallow in my sadness.",2022-08-13 19:24:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1637672002,1,/r/lonely/comments/wnmgzc/im_sad_and_heartbroken_af_now_cus_this_random_guy/,,0,1,im sad and heartbroken af now cus this random guy idk is hitting on my best friend

I keep listening to the same old dance and song ""hang in there"" ""it'll eventually get better"" ""you just gotta work on yourself"". But i mean, it's not getting better, it hasn't been even decent in fact, I've been living in auto mode (for calling it a way) for years, until recently i started to work on myself, i went to see a psychologist, I've been on meds for 7 months now, I've been eating healthier but i feel nothing, as a matter of fact, it feels even more mechanical, i really just want to rest, I want to feel nothing, i hate this soul sucking void that's inside me, i hate my loneliness, and i hate it when they say ""oh you have to enjoy your loneliness"" or ""you gotta love yourself if you wanna love somebody else"" sorry, but fuck that, I'll never love myself, i will despise myself every second of my miserable life, i hate looking at my reflection, barely have amy photos of me because i hate seeing myself.

2521,wnpkzi,-koka," I need a space to vent I guess. Life has been feeling so lonely lately. I have nobody to talk to ona regular basis. I do have one amazing great friend from college who’s always there to listen (we weren't even close in college but we rekindled through IG) but she has a life ya know? She’s also very far away and neither of us can drive to see each other. But.. i don’t think she’s why I’m feeling lonely… i cut all my friends off from high school and it felt good. It still feels good to not have them in my life but now it feels so lonely nowadays... ona daily basis. 

Friend #1 

One friend from highschool who i considered my bestfriend actually, I honestly grew to think she had a small crush on my abusive ex who left me crying while I was having rape flashbacks after sex and then my ex blamed me afterwards for it even happening. When we first got together my friend was so adamant that I don’t date her bc she had a boyfriend at the time (&amp; i didn’t date her until she dumped him don't attack me) but still it was weird she was advocating for this being as though she had talked to endless girls in relationships, why are her morals all of a sudden so adamant for me? Then when I got with my ex (she was from our HS too), my ex admitted to me that my bestfriend use to flirt with her late at night asking her things like ""why are you up?"" ""you sleep?"" and my bestfriend knew I had an extreme crush on my ex in highschool. But i let it go cus it was high school, we were teenagers. But when we broke up a year and some change later, I vented to my bestfriend for months... MONTHS about the heartbreak and sadness and abuse I endured just for her to randomly tell me one day that she talks to her on Instagram sometimes &amp; “she’s hilarious” this shocked me as I would have never ever ever talked to my bestfriend's abusive ex (the same one who had my bestfriend banging her head on the wall, use to punch her... I literally blocked her when I found out how abusive she was to my bestfriend) or giggled with her. Ain’t shit funny about abuse or an abusive person. Like what the fuck are ya laughing at. Recently, I also caught her liking pictures of my ex on Instagram very promiscuous pictures at that. So yeah, I blocked her. (I didn't just block her without a convo; I explained to her that I needed space from the relationship bcus it feels triggering that she still talks to her. she tries to check in with me but it’s just not the same knowing all that I know and to this day she still interacts with my ex knowing how bothersome it is, it just feels fake on my end tbh, so I blocked her for good the other day)

Friend #2

My next bestfriend told me she didn’t want to vent to me because she can’t relate to me being trans and doesn’t know how to help &amp; i overwhelm her. I thought what’s the point of a friend if i can’t even come to you when I need to vent or when I need to talk or when I need help? Ya know? You don’t even need to give advice i just need a listening ear. She also told me that I was invalidating her experience with heartbreak bc I told her she can’t possibly understand my heartbreak as she’s straight &amp; I came out as trans right when the break up was happening. There were just way more factors into my heartbreak that just made it worst. Plus, I’ve always been envious of guys I can never be like, &amp; my ex went straight back to dating cis guys after me. As a cis female, My bestfriend has never struggled with herself or her body in a gender dysphoria way ya know? &amp; she gave me advice like “move on” “let it go” “life goes on” generic shit that was just never helpful and just felt so repetitive &amp; robotic like she was tired of me plus, she had just got a boyfriend at the time she said that so I assumed she would prefer to spend more time with him so I blocked her. Not bc of the boyfriend but bc she told me she didn’t want me to vent to her anymore and how invalidating I was for telling her she just doesn't get it. But we had multiple virtual sleepovers of her venting to me and falling alseep with me during COVID, multiple phone calls of her venting to me. I guess she could only vent to me but I can’t vent to her when I come out of the closet? Blocked Immediately after that convo no explanation. 

Friend #3

My next friend I blocked was the reason why me &amp; my abusive ex broke up. She told me to go look at her IG story bc she’s not as great as I think she is. &amp; what do you know, she was publicly flirting with someone else &amp; when i approached my abusive ex about it, i was told I was overreacting and dramatic &amp; we didn’t even go together for her to “Cheat”. &amp; then she reassured me hours later that she didn’t cheat… yea... right. I never made it official bc she never wanted me to as she had just got out of a relationship &amp; i respected that but now she used that against me to say we don't go together &amp; i can do what i want... great. I guess friend #1 was right about not dating her &amp; I guess I should have been grateful to both her &amp; friend #3 but months later when friend # 3 reached out to me &amp; asked me how I was she ended up calling me pathetic and told me I had low self esteem for still being sad &amp; heartbroken months later &amp; i needed to “stand up” basically. I cut her off for that because how do you go to a friend saying you’re sad and they make you feel even worst. Just like friend #2, how can we be friends and I don’t feel comfortable venting to you, being emotionally vulnerable with you? I just want much more emotional support out of friendships bcus i already don’t get that type of support from my family. I'm not trying to feel unfulfilled in my relationships it hurts way too bad with my mom and dad and i have no siblings. Why would I continue relationships that make me feel just as lonely as my parents do?

Friend #4

The past friends i knew in HS &amp; i also met my abusive ex in HS but this friend i just cut off, I met on tinder. she had been ghosting me in and out for months and I’m getting surgery soon &amp; she said she’d be there to drive me if my family isn’t (my aunt has cancer so who knows who will take me to my surgery) Well.. she ghosted me again a month prior to my surgery even after telling me she’d help me financially with my recovery stuff. She left me on delivered for weeks after saying she’d help financially so i ghosted her for the first time even when she’s ghosted me several times over the past year. I can’t stand when somebody says they’ll do something, they got you… and then they show you exactly why you shouldn’t put your hope in people. 

That’s four friends i cut off in the past year. I also terminated services with my damn therapist. 

I cut off my therapist because a letter from her was required to get my top surgery but she was 3 weeks late with the letter and didn’t respond to any of my emails until i refused to go to my therapy sessions bc of her tardiness. She told me I’d have it by next week and when the week came, she tried to be funny and say “it isn’t even the end of the week!” since our sessions fell on Wednesday and still… i didn’t get the letter that saturday &amp; because of her tardiness the surgery I need for my mental health was pushed back a month. Imagine if you go into CVS asking for medicine cus you might stroke out and they say just wait just wait. &amp; you end up stroking out… that’s how it felt to be ignored and belittled for something I needed for my mental health. We say mental health matters but i guess not for trans people. Her excuse was, “we’re just not a gender center and we have other patients that we prioritize” she told me she was offended that I think she doesn’t care about me… even when she was weeks late with my mental health letter. She was offended… it was me who was offended by their lack of care for trans patients as she told me, “we aren’t a gender center” terminated services after almost a year of gettin help for my depression bcus she just didn’t help w my dysphoria or me being trans. It was always asking me how do you want to handle it? instead of actually heping me navigate through my emotions of being trans. I know she was a shitty therapist because when i told an organization who helped me with my top surgery denial, her eyes widened with shock after i told her the things she said to me. I can’t say I didn’t see the signs she wasn’t the therapist for me but it felt good to get rid of her. now, i have to have surgery in the middle of my school semester bc of her tardiness.. when I really could have gotten it in the summer \*sigh\* 

So that’s four friends and a therapist that left my life this past year. I did shrooms the other day and i stg i went to my own personal hell. It felt so dark and lonely like I literally couldn’t leave my bed because of how lonely and sad I felt from all the people who aren’t in my life anymore. And how little emotional support I have. 

And I swear to god I really wish I could mend those bonds. I wish i was more forgiving. I really wish I wasn’t so lonely I really wish that everytime I think about those friends.. i didn’t feel so much pain and sadness but it’s just… the things they did to me, the things they said to me, I don’t see I can’t imagine how it’s okay to say/do those things to anybody. I just wouldn’t have done or said any of the things they said/did to me.

This year, I’m choosing myself. Id rather be lonely by myself than feel lonely in a room with somebody else. This year, I’m going to find friendships and relationships that are worthwhile and don’t hurt. This year, I’ll have to actually learn how to let go because god that break up hurt so bad and it brought so many friends down with it. Maybe god I clearing my life of all the toxins I don’t know but I wish it didn’t feel lonely to choose myself and my happiness. I wish i didn’t feel like a burden to others when i vent. I wish i didn’t go through everything I went through with my ex. I wish… I wasn’t so lonely. I did find a friend within myself but still, it’s so lonely.",2022-08-13 21:49:58,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614948095,1,/r/lonely/comments/wnpkzi/i_cut_all_my_friends_from_high_school_off_they/,,0,1,I cut all my friends from high school off... they were my only friends
2522,wnpn5f,Invisibleman021183,"I posted similar yesterday but today someone told me that they were not going to tell me to keep putting myself out there because no one wants to be with me. He said, if you tried everything, you will have to find fulfillment outside of dating or love. Try some new hobbies not because of the same reason that I always getting about finding love but because I have to find meaning alone. He said I have to find some reason to exist outside of having love. It hurt to hear that but at least it was different. I know he didn't mean it in a bad way. The problem is, I've tried everything alone and now can't even use what used to work alone to find happiness such as playing video games or going on long walks without being alone crushing me. I have a question to those of you who have never found love. I mean the older people who never had a sig. other. I don't want to diminish the loneliness of those of you who found love. This is not against that and I know your loneliness is just as valid as mine. I am talking about, if you know you will always be alone, how do you find meaning in life? Some people are able to find happiness alone and don't mind waking up in a bed without someone else and go to sleep alone but are still happy. When I wake up the crushing feeling of loneliness destroys me. I think the first step is to stop thinking I will find love. Even when I gave up, a small part of me said, don't give up in finding love. If I could get rid of that, I could be less close to the edge. The physical pain of being alone is wearing me down and I don't know how much longer I can take being alone. I've never had a relationship and I wish I could give up but this part of me that is now causing a lot of damage is telling me to keep punishing myself by trying to find love in even the obvious reality that I never will. I haven't had a single IRL friend in years. There is no one to go out with. Enough with my ranting, how do you find fulfillment if you know no one loves you and no one will love you?",2022-08-13 21:52:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1642202607,3,/r/lonely/comments/wnpn5f/how_do_you_find_fulfillment_alone/,,0,2,How do you find fulfillment alone?

I wonder if you’ve forgotten me already  
Your memory was always atrocious

I loved reminding you of little things  
It sparked joy in you that I did

When you asked me to remind you of anything  
I felt I had a mission that couldn’t fail

I wonder if you’ve forgotten me already  
My memory was always pretty good

I think I knew what was important to you  
I think I knew what you wanted to erase

I would have reminded you for the rest of my life  
Because you are forgetful, three times over

\-

I some days feel having a good memory is a curse, because I remember everything that you told me that got my heart racing. All the promises.

And then time passes, and they don't come true. But I know how forgetful you are, about your own past, about your own words. About me.

I never saw that as a negative. And I never saw it as a weakness or as a dependency. I saw it as you. You being you. You trying your best. And how can I judge you for that?

I hope you don't forget me. Or at least not too quickly. I hope you hold on to the memory of me a bit longer, before all the other, better things take over.

I could've been more memorable. I could've predicted the future. I could've remembered someone else's past. I could've been less forgettable.

But know that I tried - with all I had. I'll get better. I'll make more of an impact next time.

I'll be as undeniable as you were to me. Because even when you forget me - I won't forget you.",2022-08-13 22:01:02,lonely,t5_2qjny,,2,/r/lonely/comments/wnptkb/forget/,,0,0,'Forget'

2531,wnq4bz,AndiAtom,"Hi everyone,

I'm turning 34 soon. This will mark my 10th anyversary of beeing lonely.  
I don't have any friends around. Only one Person I'm talking to online. She is nice and very understanding but it's just not the same. I just want a hug so badly. 

I want someone to hang out, to laugh, to build a close emotional relationship to. But I'm scared to do so since every time I tried I was hurt badly.

There were times at wich I didn't care about people after everything that happened to me. I had noone and I was fine with it. Even happy. Maybe because I felt safe. Sometimes I wish I could feel the same way today. 

But I'm suffering badly. I even planned to end it all. But for whatever reason I didn't. I'm in therapy right now yet still, at times, I wish I had gone through with it. I mean whats the point? Will I be hurt whenever I see happy people that live lifes full of love and adventure until I pass at old age?

My only real achievement is my job. My only social interaction are my coworkers. My days are all the same. I tried to mix it up a little by joining/trying several clubs like pool and whatnot. But everytime, even after a while, I feel totally out of place. I just don't belong I guess.

But I will live. I'll keep going. The same old routines. Day in day out...

There's no intent in this message. Just a rant I guess.

Today I found an old picture taken in 2015, I used to work at a Christian Youth camp and I made all of my friends there.
I remember laughing and hanging out with everyone, sneaking out of the camp grounds to go to the store/mall, make plans once a work week was over to all go watch a movie. Spending the nights at strangers houses cause your friends knew them… I know I’m 7 years older but man I miss those times. It’s so cruel I wish I could go back and relive those moments when I had friends. And now I see how everyone has split ways and I wonder “when was the last time we were all together? We didn’t even know it’d be the last time”. I’m happy to say everyone’s mostly successful or has a family/is traveling etc. but I miss them.. the thing about church friends is they don’t last in my case I learned that lesson twice this last time I voluntarily left cause of personal…. Beef?/issues with people there and I haven’t heard of anyone since then. And now I’m left with memories and no friends and I lay here in my bed and wonder how it is that I am 25 and have legitimately no friends? I met my gf off of a dating app so thank God I have some interaction outside of work. But I have no one to be my best man or even invite to my wedding (when I have one she’s great). The feeling is very empty and lonely. I miss those camp days. I miss having friends… I’m not even sure how to approach making a friend I haven’t spoken to anyone outside of work/necessity in years. My contacts list is so empty if you take out work, business, family contacts. Like Andy Bernard once said  “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”",2022-08-14 05:58:50,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608079296,5,/r/lonely/comments/wnyz0q/time_really_is_cruel/,,0,2,Time really is cruel

I won’t go into detail, but I’ve seen enough death to last me numerous life times. I came home but I didn’t come home. I’m married with two beautiful children. I’m in my 20s. Me and my wife have struggled with our marriage over the last 5 years(it’s this up coming weekend). One of her best friends convinced her to leave me cause I work 90 hours a week to provide for our family. Owning a company takes commitment and time. I’m trying to build something for my kids to take over or a back up plan for them incase college doesn’t work. Once she left me she wanted nothing to do with me or our kids(isn’t the first time). When she did have our kids they got hurt every single time they were in her care. When it was my week it’s them she would fuck our neighbors and the well known pedos(her excuse was she didn’t know. She didn’t ask anyone either nor cared). She bragged about how he was the best sex she’s ever had. Until I told her he was on the registry for fucking a 12 and 14 year old. She got ran through in a matter of 3 months. When we got back together she gave me gonorrhea from a different dude. Tried saying that when it hurt to piss was me being a pussy. I needed to change the way I dress, act etc to the way those guys did. When we are together she is a great mother. Fully committed. It’s because she’s held responsible. She kept videos of the other guys doing stuff to her, and the paranoia got to me and I checked her phone and found them. In my life time I’ve dealt with more pain than the average guy. I raised my two brothers at the age of ten, took beatings from my dad to make sure he couldn’t hurt them. It’s caused me to not be able to open up around other guys about literally anything except sports. We were so poor I gave up eating 6 days a week so my brothers had more food. The videos I saw, the level of pain. I’d rather endure everything that happened in my life every single day over and over again than have those play in my head. I’ve tried loving her and I do love her. But it’s to the point where it feelings like I’m mentally dying. And I’m stuck in a situation. If I leave, do I let her have 50% custody? Risking her hurting my kids even more cause she can’t be a mother on her own. To worried about parting. Or do I stay and torture myself so my kids have both parents? I live in a state where the mother could literally rape the kids and they will still grant her custody and child support(it’s happened already for others).

growing up i never had too many friends especially friends that are girls. other than the kids who lived on my street, id never hung out with kids from my school up until 7th-8th grade. that was because i transferred going into those grades. i was received well by basically every kid at this new school so it was a great change in my life. going into highschool my freshman year was pretty boring social wise, i’d talk to kids in school but other than that i mainly only talked to some of the kids from my grade school.(my school also was tragically all guys) i joined the rowing team and through that i met this one kid who basically in my sophomore year introduced me to the friend group i have today.(all guys) for the most part i can’t complain about my group of friends, they’re great. but the thing i can complain about is growing up i never made an effort to have friends that are girls. i guess because of anxiety i’ve always dealt with i never made the effort and just always found guys easier to talk and relate to. i am a straight man and i’ve never found guys attractive and in my entire 21 years of life i’ve only had one meaningful relationship with a girl and it ended horribly. that was when i was 19-20 and ever since that ended ive just i guess craved that feeling of having someone to always talk to, who cares about what you’re doing on a daily basis. i miss everything about the feeling of it. this truly sounds so fucking lame typing this out and reading it. i have tried apps after apps and everyone i match with just seems stale and uninterested. the girls i meet through friends are all usually, i’m not sure how to put it nicely but “easy”. at this point it truly just feels hopeless for me.",2022-08-14 06:37:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1560848060,1,/r/lonely/comments/wnzlpp/losing_hope/,,0,1,losing hope

Just felt like reaching out tonight. I moved to a new city 18 months ago when my relationship broke down. My best friend lives here but has two young kids so can’t get out very often. I’ve made a few friends but not many and they are busy people too.

Every day, if I don’t have something on I just feel so lonely. I live alone and so I go to the shops, or chat with my postie, just to have some human interaction. People at work don’t seem interested in hanging out outside of work.

Weekends are the worst. My parents love two hours away and I’ve started driving up there almost every weekend just to have some family time. Online dating isn’t really working and I just don’t know what to do with myself.

I used to look forward to work for the interactions (how sad is that) but it’s super stressful at the moment and I just dread it every day.

Hi I am a 19f and idk where to start. My nose is on my mind every day and I wish that I could get a nose job but I can’t afford to yet because I am working to pay my college tuition. For starters, I have been insecure pretty much my whole life. I am middle eastern and was a lot darker/ hairier as a child which was the start of the decline of my self esteem. I was made fun of a lot for having a “moustache” and having hairy arms, unibrow and what not as a preteen. I would cry to my mother about it nearly everyday to which she would refuse to let me shave/ wax any of it. Lol this was the start of a long ass toxic relationship with her. Over the years my nose started to have a bump on it, another thing to add to the list of insecurities. Didn’t help me when I was laying in my mothers lap when she pointed out how big and ugly my nose had gotten so  I tended to stay inside a lot of my early teen years since I deemed myself too ugly to be around/ hang out with kids my age. As far as boys goes I knew that I was ugly and none of them would ever want to be seen near me. After I got rid of all the extra hair lol I eventually accepted that I just wasn’t the type of girl any guy would ever be into because of my big nose so I stopped hoping that my crushes would ever like me back,guys were never into me anyways so it’s not like I expected anything. Having no guys be into me never really bothered me until I noticed how I was treated in comparison to other girls. And my hatred for my nose grew even more. What was so wrong with me that I don’t deserve to have love in my life either? I put all of this aside and focused on my schooling and job and forgot about it for a bit.  until the pandemic hit and we all had to wear masks and I really grew into my looks, did my makeup better worked out etc . I noticed a difference. All of a sudden people were nicer to me guys would actually look at me and not look away. I thought it was words at first and then I realized it’s cuz they couldn’t see the lower half of my face and this made my insecurity spiral. Anyways I’m 19 now no first kids, hand gold or anything and it’s driving me crazy. I’ve always been the smart funny independent friend and I don’t come off as desperate on the outside, but unfortunately that’s not how I feel on the inside. Even today when guys try to talk to me I get instantly uncomfortable s d insecure cuz I think they’re just judging me for my nose, I instantly shut out any guy who even tries to get to know me because of my childhood and I’ve had enough of this. I wish I could afford plastic surgery right now but I cannot I honestly don’t know how I’ll be able to fight off the suicidal part of me until I am able to afford a nose job and whatever else I need done. This even affects me at school and work because I never want to take my mask off or walk around without sunglasses on. It just sucks seeing other girls my age get in an out of relationships and situationships when I’ve had absolutely nothing. I don’t want my life alone I need my nose gone.

I always dread the idea of being with people and I'm not sure what kind of company and/or social activity I would enjoy.

Pretty much every time a social opportunity presents itself, I really don't want to do it. Just want to stay home playing single-player video games.

The idea of being with people seems like such an unrewarding effort.

I don't feel I'll gain anything interesting out of it.
I feel like I'll spend most of the time just being polite.
I also don't feel the need to be honest or open up to people.

So I don't see any benefit to doing social things.

But if I see social interaction on social media, it makes me feel that I probably should be doing it too.
So I start thinking about who would I want to do that with, and when and where and what. And all the thoughts that come to mind just sound really boring.

I think the bottom line is that I would love to be always alone and be ok with that.

I’ll try to respond to people as much as I can but I’m hoping more for the anyone can answer and respond to other people type vibe. And then next Sunday people can check in and see how everybody did that week. Figure this can start some conversations for people who have a hard time doing that and provides a reason to check back in on them in the future without the pressure of an everyday conversation. Or it might be a dumb idea and no on will respond, but I figure I would send it anyway haha.

Can someone show me the bright side?

It’s my birthday today. Just turned 24. But I’m not doing anything to celebrate. I’ve had bad birthdays but usually I had people around to celebrate with, even if it didn’t end up being that fun. 

Over the last month I ghosted all my friends (blocked them on all communication channels) because I wanted to focus on my personal health. Like going to the gym everyday. Dieting especially. When I hang out with them, I always end up slipping in these areas and I wanted that to stop. I’m not saying it’s their fault, I think I’m just mentally weak and need to be isolated because that’s when I’m most productive. I also tend to drink alcohol and smoke weed with them, nothing excessive but we’ve collectively done enough damage to our bodies in the last 8 years that I rather have that stop as well. I haven’t smoked in a month. 

They’ve been a little salty about me doing this. One friend said he’s “cut me off.” It’s definitely an over exaggeration but they’re still salty. Another said he downgraded me to an acquaintance. This was in a joking way. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve ghosted them. In 2021, I was at rock bottom fitness wise. I gained like 50lbs of fat. So far in 2022, I lost 30lbs. When 2022 started, I ghosted them for like 2 months and that’s where I developed these good habits. 

Anyways, when I unblocked some of them and said “hey let’s hangout for my birthday” they either didn’t respond or said “so you come back to us because you need friends to hangout with on your birthday?” made me feel pretty shitty. I mean what he’s saying is true, but still. I felt shitty because it sheds light on the fact that they’re my only friends. I don’t have a lot of friends. So over the last month I haven’t really done much socially. 

Am I the asshole here? I don’t even know. 

Other than that, I’ve just been talking to this girl for 3 months from a dating app. She’s 5 years younger than me and a total different race. After a month of talking she said we should just be friends, thinking that was my intention from the get go. So basically friendzoned. I continued talking to her bc I still want her and I’m lonely, but I know it’s stupid. It’s weird because she sends me good morning/night texts, double texts me when I don’t respond, sends voice notes, these are like relationship things no? But I don’t think she even sees me in that light. I’m delusional and think when I get really fit (lose another 20lbs) I’ll ask her out and try to “woo” her. Tbh, I think she just unintentionally uses me for attention, she is a good genuine friendly person. 

How sad is my life? I make good money but that doesn’t give you happiness. I’m going to get a 2nd job as a bouncer just to get out of my home more often. I live with my parents (common thing here) but I want to move out but can’t because it’s not smart financially, and I’d probably get too lonely. 

Thanks for reading, if you got this far. The only positive I can see that is my gym motivation is really high right now. I was on the treadmill and got my favourite song to play when the clock hit 12:00am, and it sort of felt like an adrenaline high.",2022-08-14 16:53:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1592171664,6,/r/lonely/comments/woaycu/its_my_birthday_how_sad_is_my_life/,,0,3,It’s my birthday.

Might be selfish but I don't care.

Two weeks of swiping all day everyday go by and quite literally no matches. Eventually I give up and delete my pictures because I feel insecure having them up. I replaced my main pic with just a black screen and call it quits.

Yesterday I clicked back on the app after leaving it alone for a few days and to my surprise I have 6 matches in the span of three days, they just matched because of my long ass bio and because we have so many similar interests. I start talking to one of them and we hit it off pretty well until she asks for a pic, when i sent it the tone of the convo changed immediately then like 5 minutes later she I guess either blocked me or unmatched me or something. It hurt but i start talking to another match and the same thing happens. Before she was replying every minute then the second I sent my face she stopped replying completely. It was late so I forced myself to believe she miraculously fell asleep right before I showed her.

Then I wake up this morning and she still hasn’t replied “thats ok..” I think, “she’s probably still asleep its only 10am” its 2pm now and she still hasn’t replied. She didn’t even have the decency to block me the last message in our conversation is just my ugly ass face.

Feeling your face on my chest

I felt I could tell you anything

I reach for your hands in my fantasies

Then I wake up  
And you are not there

Not even dreams compare to you  
I wish I could hold you one more time

It's where I visit you in my dreams. I don't know if you think about it, probably not as often as me.

It felt like I was isolating you from everything bad in the world, and nothing could get in. It felt like your warmth was protecting me from any intrusive thoughts, because I was so focused in the moment.

Maybe it's childish, but I wanted to stay like that forever. I want to go back to that moment, even if for just a few seconds.

So u/randomchick2038 planted an idea to create a telegram group to discuss and relieve people of loneliness. Few days later, she said a guy joined the group by name 'Hasan' and he sent a suspicious link to Lauren (u/randomchick2038), she opened it and it leaked her information to Hasan, so according to her, he asked her to send inappropriate pictures and do certain inappropriate activities otherwise he will leak her information, she did everything he said, then I informed her that he's just bluffing and he's just another kid showing he can use google.  I and everyone in group believed her, I told her to delete all accounts and block 'Hasan' everywhere. Today she told me to remove her from group, i suggested we should delete group because there won't be anyone there to moderate it and members were inactive.

She made me delete the group, started abusing me, and told me she made the whole story up to catch everyone's attention.

Many people tried to convince me that good redditors are still there, this is your good redditor?
I don't know if anything can be done here, but certainly this hurt me and made me trust people even less.  You know the truth, do what you will. Have a good day

2741,woiur8,PlumAmoeba87505,"
So I (16M) have been friends with this girl (16F) for a few years now and all this started a couple
Months ago.  She had a bf of about 1 2/3 years.  They weren’t great for each other but they got along alright for a little while.  While they were dating he would text me and ask for gift or date ideas since I knew what she liked and stuff like that.  Well Eventually her bf told her that he didn’t like how me and her would hangout so much.  Now I know that’s understandable but we always found a third person so it wasn’t just us and we tried to stay out in public so we weren’t ever alone.  Well after a while they just broke up and he was super immature about it.  Anyway he talked to me about trying to get back with her for a bit and I told him to stop talking to me a few times but I knew he was hurting so I usually just let him talk.  Well two days after they broke up it was her birthday and she had horrible birthdays in the past so I decided to throw her a small party with just a few friends.  Huge success and by the end of the night we were both tired so she went home.  We both didn’t sleep tho.  We spent most of the night up talking and it wasn’t until the morning when she told me that she liked me and she was trying to flirt all night did I get the message.  Now I had loved her like family up until this point but this changed things a bit.  I knew I liked her but I wasn’t going to do anything to change our relationship.  While I said screw air and we talked about how we were gonna do this.  Of course I was scared that if we broke up after a bit that things would be awkward and we might not be friends anymore.  Well it was a big fear I put it aside and we went ahead and dated.  Honestly it was amazing for the two or three weeks that we were together.  We. We’re able to move pretty quickly because we already knew each other really well.  She even said she loved me after a bit.  She took this online drivers Ed class so she could text and get her license.  While on this class she met a guy she knew and talked to a few years ago.  The rest of that week was just me watching them get closer and closer.  Well a few days later she said that she thinks we were better as friends and that we should just go back to being friends.  In an attempt
To preserve the friendship I didn’t argue.  But two weeks later her and this other guy were dating.  As the weeks go on she talks to me less and less and I’m trying to be supportive of her new relationship but it still hurts so much because even thought it was short I really did fall in love with her.  Should I ask her about it so I can get some clarity or should I just ignore it and move on?",2022-08-14 22:38:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1600454882,2,/r/lonely/comments/woiur8/kind_of_a_weird_situation_i_feel_awful_and/,,0,1,Kind of a weird situation.

2743,woj15q,DestructionIsBliss,"Couple of minutes ago I messaged someone who posted both on here and on a dating subreddit (I wouldn't dm anyone just for posting here, unless I had a really good reason for doing so). In both posts she complained about not having anyone to talk to cause other people are so ""boring"". Well, lucky for me, she's my age, lives in my country (which could still be a twelve hour drive away but is at least better than the other end of the earth) and we seem to share somewhat similar hobbies, even if we might differ a bit in the specifics. But hey, that's what conversations are for, to get clarity on such things. And of course, I'm pretty sure I'm not boring if I have someone else to talk to. Admittedly, the interest-intensity of topics I can ramble on about for hours may differ by individual, but luckily I got quite a variety of them to choose from.

&amp;#x200B;

Aight, so I reach out, telling her my name, age, general location and a couple of my interests. Not a ton, but basically covering the same points she had in her post on said dating subreddit. Less than a minute later I get her response to my message, indicating that she probably wasn't engaged in conversation with anyone else so far. What's the content of her response? She's telling me that she's ghosting me. First of all, it's not ghosting if you tell the other person that you're doing it. Second, it's double not ghosting if you haven't been talking in the first place lmao

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I appreciate the honesty, but why not just decline to chat? That is an option after all. Also, can't exactly call other people boring if your immediate response to a first message is ""meh, that invitation to chat wasn't an emotional roller coaster, Imma go with nooooooooo"". At least that's how I imagine her reaction was, of course there might be a different reason for her reaction. I don't know, I guess I felt inclined to share this experience here to tell you that if an option presents itself, actually take it. If someone wants to talk, say: ""Yeah, I'd love to chat for a bit and see how we get along"". Although I'm sure most of you wouldn't let an opportunity go to waste anyway. And if you think everyone else is boring, maybe you're not offering anything interesting to converse about either. You gotta be the one to initiate conversation sometime. Or maybe even all the time, I know I've been doing that for many many years before I found people who actually initiate themselves on a regular basis. I know it sucks hard to get there, but if that's what it takes, we gotta do it. For ourselves, 'cause we're worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

And most importantly, if someone doesn't appreaciate us, then sometimes, or maybe even more often than not, it's them who are missing out on what they could have with us, either in friendship or relationship, whatever you can offer as a person. We're worth talking to cause we're just as interesting and engaging as anyone who doesn't feel the crippling loneliness most of us are probably dealing with. We are worth talking to and engaging with. You and me can be just as funny, clever, thought provoking, supportive or whatever else you have in your head and heart that you feel like you can't share with another person! If that other person doesn't appreciate that, well, too bad for them, they're probably not people we should want to spend our time with in the first place. Someone else will appreciate us, and we'll know it when our lives cross paths with them. We're not doomed to be miserable and depressed! We are worth more than that. Or at least we can be.",2022-08-14 22:46:23,lonely,t5_2qjny,1603906547,2,/r/lonely/comments/woj15q/we_are_worth_talking_to_or_at_least_we_can_be/,,0,1,We are worth talking to. Or at least we can be.

2771,womc61,navatarian,"I’m going through a divorce where I had been in the relationship for almost nine years. My ex was controlling and basically forced all of my friends away. I spent nine years around her friends and family. Before our separation she told me my business was a burden on the relationship. We took a vacation soon after that was okay, but tension was there. I decided to sell my business on our trip. When I returned I met with a few companies and pulled the trigger. Things didn’t get better at home and I made the decision that she would be happier with someone else or on her own. I told her I wanted to separate. The best day she started her apartment search. 

We sold our house and settled finances. I got a lawyer to help me/us. I also finalized the sale of my business and the business that bought mine lost five employees in two weeks which burdened me with phone calls and issues. She moved back to the city and I moved to a family property that I am currently renovating.

It’s been a few months and she rushed the divorce.  After I signed paperwork she made a comment that if I talked to “anyone” she would make my life a “living hell” up until the day the divorce is final. She signed everything and sent it over to me and my lawyer a few days later. The next day a friend of mine from high school sent me screenshots of her in a dating app where she was “divorced” asking me what was going on. Because we are still to this day married. 

I did confront her and she was “bored” and “wanted someone to call her beautiful for once”. 

I’m not upset that she’s happy and moving on. I’m unhappy at the threat. I’m unhappy that my friends all moved on and won’t talk to me now. I’m unhappy that she started this renovation with me and I’m tackling it 100% on my own now and have no one to share it with. I’m unhappy that she was never ready for kids and now her dating profile says she wants children. I’m lonely because she’s moved on so fast and I can’t even connect with the friends and family I was once close too. I’ve even tried online chats with no success.

I think I grew up too quickly. Social media entered my life in 4th grade. I was bullied pretty heavily for being a little chunky, being Asian, being smart, and rarely getting to hang out because of my strict parents until I got into college. I think it started in 5th grade, when my “boyfriend” left me because he heard a rumor I was pregnant. (I was, what, 11?! I hadn’t even had my first kiss yet, let alone have sex!)

I eventually started feeling depressed but never really told anyone. I had a few select friends, not great ones, who knew how sad I was. It somehow got out that I was depressed and suicidal, and as my mom used to say, “Nobody wants to be friends with the depressed girl all the time.” All of a sudden, I no longer went to birthday parties or sleepovers. I dreaded summer break from school because I sat home alone every single day.

In high school, people would talk about the parties on weekends right in front of me. It gutted me when my best friends and boyfriend all were invited and went and would then talk about it in front of me. I had one friend who I still think of to this day, but we haven’t spoken in 3 years because his parents were more strict than mine — he never had social media or a cell phone. Before we graduated, he was the only one I felt comfortable with.

All of this made me insecure and shy. I thought college would be different. However, everyone I met was obsessed with frat parties and that just wasn’t my thing. I ended up not attending events because I had no one to go with.

Right before COVID, I thought I found my people. I even moved in with them during COVID. 6 months later, we had a huge fight and I moved out to live alone.

The only reason I’m not fully alone is because I gave the man who is now my fiancé (23m) a chance after he tried pursuing me for 3 years. He basically moved in with me right away and we even have a son together. Every day is spent with a baby or at work/school, and that is my only social interaction. I’m having a micro-wedding because I have no one but family to invite.

Sometimes I wish I could go back in time to try it all again.

Add in some terrible luck in the game youve been enjoying and it just sucks every out of you. Today its been 5 yrs since ive lost one of the best pets that ive had. Pets die and i get that but what kills me the most was i didnt even get to say goodbye to him. I was so wrapped up in my gf at the time and didnt realize how controlling she was that i didnt get a chance. I decided to move in with her and i couldnt take them. I was supposed to go back to my old place and take them some to a friends but since i was trying so hard to please my now ex i never made it back and so the friend went and picked them up. I wanted to see them when i could but never had the time or so i was told. And about a month later i got a text saying he passed. I fucking hate myself everyday for not getting the chance to say goodbye. It kills me. I will never forgive myself for that. Looking back before moving i should have known something was off. He was usually a loving cat always wanted to be around me. But there were times that he would hide and not come out. There isnt a day that will go by that i dont miss him or regret everything that happened. Its my fault and i can never change that. Going through all those memories and feelings alone just makes everything so much worse. Every one always tells me that theyd be there for me if i ever need anything but  are to busy when i try and reach out for help.

I’ve really tried making friends down here. My personality I’ve been told can be a bit off-putting at first and I think that’s turned people off to me down here. I’m tall and awkward and while I am female, I never feel like one around other females. I don’t feel male or anything, but just not… female? Feminine? Idk. I feel like I’m the one person that’s somewhat removed from the rest of the group, and my experiences in the past two years have confirmed that feeling. I’ve had two or 3 friends groups that have all moved through me. All of them stayed intact and I’m always the only one left behind. While I didn’t feel I fit in very much in them, they were my only connections down here. 

I’ve had some traumatic things happen to me since I’ve moved down here, most recently the loss of my sister, so my mental healths been fucked. I know that’s part of it probably. irritable and angry :/ it makes sense people don’t wanna spend their time around me 

I’m funny, that’s my number one thing. But idk if that’s cutting it anymore? I feel like I’m an acquired taste because I’ve been told that by friends who’ve stuck around. I’m trying to mold myself so that people give me a chance but I find myself surrounded by people who I don’t like and apparently don’t like me very much. But I hate being alone, I’m sick of it. 

Also, nothing on the horizon romantically. Absolutely. Fuckin. Nothing. I know I’m not ugly, I’ll say that much, so it’s not that. It’s whatever happens after I open my mouth 😐

My best friend is my roommate, very outgoing, and obviously she has friends that aren’t me bc she’s from down here. I almost resent her bc I’m so jealous that she can call someone whenever she wants or is lonely. She tries to introduce people to me but it feels like charity. Because I need help. It makes me embarrassed, it’s like she’s letting me know she’s aware I’m a loser. And that’s immature but it’s happening. I be bitter alone and sad 😐

2836,wou0or,d-stoppy,"Hi everyone.

My name is Declan. I'm 22yo and I've practically been lonely my whole life. At school, I was your typical nerdy kid who read books and did homework in the library while everyone else was outside socialising and playing football, or I would be inside playing a game on my own while others went round town and into nightclubs having fun. I've always classed myself as quite an extreme introvert. I struggle to even talk to my own family sometimes, let alone a random person in society and because of that, I never had friends. Even when others try to make the effort to know me, I always push them away.

My self esteem has always been very low. I was always branded as a need and ugly in school, and I carried that with me through my life. My mind loves to tell me how alone I am and that I should give up on trying to find other people because just like everything else in my life, I'll fail at it.

I was diagnosed with depression in 2018, and more recently diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder in late 2021, after I owned up that I inflicted self harm because I felt like no one loved or cared for me.

I'm getting to the point now where I'm giving up on it all. Where actually God planned my life to be this way and that I should just accept it and learn to live with it. God dealt me a shit hand in the game of life and I have to try and make the most out of it.

And yes, I have tried my hardest to make friends, but no one accepts me. I own my own discord server for a game called Destiny 2 and no one takes any notice of me and I tried dating apps and got more depressed and lonely when people rejected me on there. I play golf, but I find that I actually enjoy it more on my own than with other people because of the personalities of the people at the golf club.

I'm just lost, alone, and ready to give up.

I'm sorry for the ramblings. I felt like I needed to get a load off my chest. Thank you for reading.",2022-08-15 08:16:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,1602011494,5,/r/lonely/comments/wou0or/im_lonely_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,,0,3,I'm lonely and I don't know what to do

This is my first night finishing off the night alone and I started feeling down and lonely.  luckily I had other friends to visit but both are long time couples, one happens to be in Cali at the same time and one just moved here. I tried going to a bar to mingle (not that I'm good at starting conversation) and saw more couples and friends enjoying their life and ended up feeling worse, seeing what I feel I don't really have and kinda started spiraling about, in short feeling I will never have that and will never find a partner etc etc.  I have been single for a couple years (I turn 26 on Friday) and have really struggled to meet anyone worthwhile in any capacity.

But recently I was at a reunion with friends I haven't seen in a few years. Almost all of them are married, and a few even have kids. I actually really won't kids, but not unless I'm in a happy and healthy romantic relationship.

I cannot for the life of me learn to flirt.

I really tried for a few months to get out and date. I matched one with a few people, 1 or 2 in particular I got excited about, but I either got ghosted or at some point they lost interest for some reason. I'm sure it wasnt really my fault, but I have a very romantic personality. I believe in 'true love' even if there is more than 1 person it could happen with. I believe in having a partner that supports you, but also pushes you and you them.

I used to feel excited thinking about this stuff; hopeful, happy, dreamy, etc... but all I feel now (besides the rare feeling of hope) is sick to my heart. I feel unwanted and lonely. I find the courage to get out there from time to time but it hasn't worked out. Not even in a 'casual' sense. Its gotta start somewhere if its ever going to happen, but it hasn't/isn't happening anywhere for me.

Seeing how happy my friends were was great, and im happy for them really, but it just reminded me that I haven't had someone special in my life like that. (Technically had a hs gf, but like most hs romances it was pretty superficial).

I know talking here won't find me a gf or spouse, but idk...I just wanted to type it out to understand my feelings a bit better.

I only feel like I connect with 2 of them and they both live 3 and a half hours away and are in college so we barely talk. I just feel super lonely and isolated and I don't understand why I'm never invited or included in anything. I'm the life of the party, I'm extremely positive and when I'm around everyone is talking to me and I'm always encouraging them in everything they do, but I still don't feel any connection and feel as if I'm excluded. The only time we hang out is if I initiate it, and I know they have plenty free time for friends because they all hang out with each other. The only reasons I have is because I'm sober and they smoke and drink and maybe they dont want someone around whos sober because it makes them question their drug use, or since I'm a very weird person. Sorry this is gonna be a long one I really need to vent. But also when it comes to dating I feel like I block myself from connecting with anyone. I've had plenty of chances to date amazing people with goals aligned to mine (I'm a very goal oriented person) but no matter what I find a way to sabotage it and ruin any chnace of escaping this loneliness.

In short : I'm looking for people who are lonely and who lack a goal in life

A bit about me : I just don't know what I live for other than not to sadden my family too much if I went to leave. I don't care too much about money, I'm too weird and unstable socially to get some good close friends, and let's not even talk about dating. That part I've completely given up on, I'm too far gone, it saddens me but it's the way it is

I'm not here to complain about that, rather I'd like to dedicate myself to something else, find a goal to make living worth it 

I'm just here to ask if some folks here would be interested to work on that something with me, from scratch essentially. It could be a lot of things : trying to learn a new language, create a videogame we imagined, creating some art, a nice website, something we can burry our depression on together honestly, and motivate each other

Who knows, maybe we can become good friends in the process

Just trying to give my life a meaning idk, you can dm me if you're interested :)",2022-08-15 18:10:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619328982,4,/r/lonely/comments/wp6jog/finding_something_to_work_on_along_with_people/,,0,3,Finding something to work on along with people here

I could be at a party, or hanging out with my best friends, at the cinema, spending time with family, you name it and I'd still feel as though I'm there myself, isolated in the crowd. I've made a lot more of an effort to speak to people but then I just end up feeling like I dont connect with the people I speak to. 

To top it all off I've been having trouble with a girl I like. I had a suspicion that she liked me back but I found out that I was likely reading all the signs wrong and that she probably doesn't. Then my tiktok fyp decided it was the oerfect time to show me lots of happy couples. I was really starting to think I'd be able to find a way out of feeling like this only to have the rug pulled from under me and salt poured on the wounds.

I’ve been married for 5 years, and we are high school sweethearts. I love my wife but we are very different people, and sometimes it leads to very frustrating times. 

For the past couple of years, I can’t help but feel that the real me is coming out more and more and it doesn’t seem like I have anyone that I can really be myself around. I am constantly stugaling between who I think I am and who i think everyone else wants me to be. It has lead to these sinking feelings of incredible isolation, despite having so many people around me.

2958,wpepaz,Tommokia1,"I don't really feel loved in my intermediate family... I'm 27F, and recently moved with them to a new state... Since it was my dream state to live in, and there's more job opportunities in my field of study here...

I know I should be thankful that I have a family who hasn't kicked me out of the house by now... But, I'm planning on moving out as soon as I can. And I really mean, as soon as I can. I have no debt, and I need to buy a car now (I sold mine when we moved)... And then I need to save up more money after that.

It's just, we haven't had time to go to a car dealership, and they know I want a car.. But, I'm tired of asking and talking to them about things. Whenever I do, it seems that I am always the, ""Selfish"" one. Or they always point fingers back at me about things... I have a younger sister and I know she's probably their dream daughter... Cause she's so much like my mother and ""perfect"". Always learning, cooking, eating healthy etc. etc. Copy cat of my mother. They talk all the time about stuff and for hours...

I can't seem to get a word out with my mother being annoyed at me, or thinking I said something rude, when I was just explaining myself.

Or when I just randomly one night asked if everyone could be just a bit quieter in the morning or go into the ""other living room"", since everyone in that section of the house is already up. And then my dad calls me selfish. Because I wanted my older brother and his wife to have their baby in the other room of the house in the morning... And I get that they are trying to enjoy the baby and have fun, but when some of us are still sleeping and the baby is joyfully screeching or whatever, at least be considerate of us that are still sleeping and go somewhere else... at least just please be courteous.

I just feel so unheard in this family, and maybe I am rude and selfish... But, I was just asking for consideration and everything...

Or just today,

I asked my mom when she was going to the store.. And then she said, ""I don't know why you are bugging me about going to the store when you're giving all of your ramen away and not eating it."" And I literally said, ""Just because I give a few away to my brothers doesn't mean I'm not eating it."" Which I have been eating it. and then she fucking freaks the fuck out and goes, ""OH MY GOSH."" and makes a fucking ass face at mean. And I didn't even say it rudely. I was just saying I was sharing and shit. And I said, ""Just because you see me giving some away doesn't mean I haven't been eating it."" and blah blah blah.  And I know she's probably just upset because I have the ramen because she's a fucking healthy eater freak. I'm not like her at all. I like what I like to eat. And I told her since it always turns out this way, there's no point in talking at all. which is why I am always silent in this fucking family.

They don't even know who I am. And I don't want to share who I am, because I always feel fucking judged.

And again, I wouldn't have asked her if she was going to the store if I had my own car. Which they haven't even been trying to make fucking time for me to get a car to go the dealership.

I want to get out of this fucking family. I don't feel loved, I feel unheard. Sorry, it probably feels like I'm just complaining...

But they always point the issues at me. And I'm tired of this toxic ass family.

They probably even love my brother's wife more than me too. Fuck it. I don't care. I'm getting out of this house as soon as I can.

I'm not okay in this family.",2022-08-15 23:43:26,lonely,t5_2qjny,,19,/r/lonely/comments/wpepaz/i_know_i_shouldnt_be_complaining_but/,,0,27,I know I shouldn't be complaining but....
2959,wpexsf,RapidClearance,"I'm a ukrainian refugee living in germany since March. I never had friends here (except my fellow classmates from Ukraine who aren't really my friends) and I knew I will never have because no hobbies, no interests. Never liked summer or summer breaks because of the feeling of loneliness. I don't want to learn the language. My routine is just being on the phone or laptop, sometimes going to the gym or grocery store. I was late to the test that I didn't even prepare for, that I traveled 300km for. Now I have no chance of coming back ever. My father would probably kill me and my brother will just judge me. I don't know what to do with life anymore. Last year I was at home, at least. Now my fate is sealed, it seems. I don't have my cats anymore with me and I don't have my only friend with me. I left everything behind and now I'm suffering. The only person I have is my annoying mother. I have to put up with her stupid music, stupid attitude, touching my stuff. It makes me proud that I never defended her when my father hit her. I understand him, not that he's any better. I wish death upon her because I have my own reasons. She doesn't seem to miss anything, not the cats, definitely doesn't care about what I feel.

I’ve been bullied my whole life. If it wasn’t for being ugly it was for being gay. If it wasn’t for those, people would call me retarded, stupid, annoying, weird, boring and tell me to shut up everytime I tried to overcome the anxiety and open up. 

This has made it to where I can’t make friends or talk to people ESPECIALLY large groups of people in fear of being bullied or called stupid lame or a loser like I’ve always have been called. 

I find that most people click with each other easily and they’re able to make funny jokes with each other off the bat. Whenever I try yo be funny it’s crickets, and people say that was lame or cringe…

So how am I even supposed to make friends if everyone thinks I’m lame, ugly, boring, annoying, useless, and stupid ?

I’ve been feeling alone the past couple of years. I moved to a new city and decided to go back to college but I have not been able to make any friends here. I tried going to many different meetups but haven’t felt a connection with anyone.  

I thought about calling my family members to have some source of connection but I find it difficult to talk to them too. I only have my mom and aunt. However, they have issues of their own and talking to them doesn’t make me feel better afterwards. I actually feel lonely going home for the holidays because it’s only them two and they don’t have room for me to stay there so I have to get a hotel.

it could be “shyness”, fear / self doubt, and other things, it’s just hard to initiate a conversation sometimes.
so if anyone is lonely, you can message. 

i have a history of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis

I felt there was this invisible force  
Pulling us closer together

Almost by accident  
Very tenuous, close to invisible

Then suddenly, intertwined  
I never wanted it to end

Then, just as suddenly, apart  
As if nothing had ever happened

I started pushing myself  
Trying to become who I wanted

You wanted to keep me safe from you  
So you pushed me away

\-

I understand why you did it. At least I think I do. You don't want to place the burden of you on someone else, or what you think is the burden of you.

I never got frustrated with it - because I'm the same. I have to learn a lot about myself first.

We probably have the same fear. That we'll be late. That we'll be late for each other, for someone else, for whoever.

We have our journeys to get to where we want. Maybe I wanted us to walk it together too much. Maybe it's better we keep our own paths, and if we meet somewhere, we do. And if we don't, we don't.

I'm 21, I know it isn't that old. But I'm so lonely despite blending well with people and having ""acquaintances"". I'm average or above average in my subjects, I've been told I'm a great teammate in my college group works. My professors are kind to me because I work hard and earnestly. My classmates are also kind to me (save for a few deadbeat groupmates). And I feel like things are just... fine. But that's it.

No one ever looks at me for more than just... a good resource. The people who are in good terms with me... I'm not friends with them. I join them in lunch sometimes or catch up with them when we have same classes or professors but we never becomes ""friends"". I only have 2 friends and they were from my middle school years and they're not even anywhere close to me ever since we graduated high school. We only chat ever now and then when we have the time but that's it.

I've been joining organizations and clubs at uni to feel a little more involved but it's like there's always a wall between me and others. When I try to befriend others I end up... being a convenience. I never show my displeasure, I've been told I'm quite pleasant and polite. That I'm a good company to be around with, but they never really choose me, I'm just chosen out of convenience.

Maybe it's because my temperament is so relaxed and patience that people don't see me as an exciting person? And I'm not particularly introverted or shy so the quieg ones tend to not stick around even when I try to befriend them. I feel like something is so wrong with me, that I'm so plain like a blank piece of paper. Maybe I'm so polite and pleasant people find it so boring? What is wrong with the way I present myself that people find it good but never good enough?

It's like everyone's just so close yet so far. Everything is fine, but also isn't fine. 

I'm so lonely every single day. I'm not that depressed I end up not doing anything. Life still goes on and I do my classes, chores, and basically my daily needs like a regular human being.

3055,wpqf7f,GERGAAA,"Hi there! 

I have, and I want to tak about it!

I just started classes in person and start seeing people I don't talk to anymore because of some problems we had in the past, like broken romantic relationships.

I broke with my ex half a year ago mostly because she liked to gossip about everyone in a very negative way. That made me feel uncomfortable when talking to others, so it all ended for our good.

A couple of weeks after ending our relationship I started feeling sad and lonely. I think I missed her, but I just wanted to stay as friends. When I asked her about it she told me no and that she had already someone else, so I respected her decision  and stopped being as friendly (without being rude) and trying to see her as a friend.

But in a very inconsiderate way I started to think about what I was evading thanks to not being close with someone I considerate problematic. I thought that because of her behaviour she would lost her friends fast and that she would be even lonelier than me. Really very bad feelings from me, but this helped me a little bit.

And now this thought is real. Other people have told me that she and her friends had some kind of discussion and that they don't talk anymore. She is alone and I feel bad. Even though I thought something really negative, I don't wish her any bad experiences. I still care for her. Not in the same way but she was someone special to me.

Maybe I'm incorrect and she is not alone. Maybe she just changed all her friends very fast.

But either way, what do you think about all this??

That is all!

And apologies if there's something wrongly written. English is not my native language.",2022-08-16 10:09:00,lonely,t5_2qjny,1524539831,2,/r/lonely/comments/wpqf7f/have_you_been_right_in_thinks_you_did_not_want_to/,,0,0,Have you been right in thinks you did not want to be right about?

3060,wprs3m,Plunator,"I am a very introverted, socially awkward and boring person. I don't know what to talk about and thus I am really quiet and say nothing most of the time. When I do talk tho, I would constantly stutter, I would talk about lame and random things, sometimes when I open my mouth and talk, I have no idea what I'm saying. I have to agree with one of my friend's quote which he once said to me: ""What the fuck are you talking about?""


As such I have always tried to choose my words carefully, trying to make sure I don't stutter, trying to make sure that I was entertaining and had a topic to talk about.


However it's so hard to do it and feels robotic so eventually I gave up doing it.


Someone once told me that I was overthinking and overdoing it and that all I just needed to be is to be myself. But what does being myself mean? That I shouldn't force myself to speak if I don't want to? But when I tried doing that, noone came to talk to me, noone came to ask how my day was, noone seemed to care about me and I was naturally left out and it felt like I had been forgotten.


Not all hope is lost tho, sometimes, just sometimes, I find myself being able to enjoy myself and forget about ""what I should say next"" and I honestly I think this might be what he meant by be yourself.


However even this small ray of light that I've managed to grasp somehow manages to escapes everytime single time.


On the very rare occasion that I could be talking to someone for 2 or 3 hours straight, the next day I can barely go for 2 minutes.Eventually I run out of things to talk about and the other side is not interested in talking anymore and they will go talk to another person and forget about me. At this point I feel really sad and disappointed in myself, and it feels like I've been abandoned. And I start to wonder:


What changed in between yesterday and today?


Did I change? 

Did I do something wrong?

Was I more boring than usual?

Did I not initiate the conversation well enough?

Maybe he had a rough day and didn't want to talk?

Maybe he found better friends and preferred to talk to them? In that case are my messages a bother? Should I even send them at all? He's been online for 30 minutes and not replying after all.



After all how do you continuously maintain friendship with someone? How do people come up with ideas to talk about? I have no idea.


 
Even now most days I still feel lonely, alienated and alone and it hurts so much.



This is a selfish and embarrassing wish but deep down I'm still waiting and hoping for someone that I can truly connect with, who would choose me even if there were 100 friends to choose from, who would accept me as the person I am and stay with me.",2022-08-16 11:25:41,lonely,t5_2qjny,1594095047,2,/r/lonely/comments/wprs3m/i_have_no_idea_how_to_initiate_and_continue/,,0,0,I have no idea how to initiate and continue conversations

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore.

3. Also you don't get infinite skip button like omegle. You get a limited no of skips so that encourages you to really talk to each other.

I found out this by joining her discord server using my alt (my main used to be there but i left many months ago due to personal reasons). Normally she would share a few stuffs about the server and her personal life even after i left but she has since stopped, which is why im doing this. In the server i saw both of them happily talking to each other, having inside jokes and having conversations about topics that i have never heard her mentioning to me before. She's also in his other server too and has became friends with his friends.

I mean, we are still friends i guess, i really dont mind them getting back tgt, but this just makes me sad because im missing out on her personal life. She's making me feel left out, and she doesnt even show any slight interests to a single thing i talk about now. In the past she told me she would never go back to him cus he wasnt a good person to her. I really dont know what caused her to change her mind now that they are back together. And i cant confront her about this because im not even supposed to know about this whole thing. She's basically acting more distant now.

After ghosting me for like a week (and started to talk with his ex again and even being all lovely ducky) today he sends me a message, that he was sorry and doesn't want to end things badly, and wants to explain. I was all afternoon thinking. I mean, he's been having a rough couple years (his biological father died when he was a kid, his mother remarried and the stepdad died of leukemia). His friends and mother don't really pay much attention, I think he needs more emotional support (something that he was getting from his ex, even tho she was a cuckoo girl). Like I been trying to justify his treatment towards me, but I deserve better. I'm a girl that when you need something, I will give it to you. Need to talk? I'm there for you. Need advice? Hug? Anything, I'm here. I'm a good, modest and funny girl. I deserved better than being a second option. Wanna know what I did when I found out that he was with her ex again? First I took it as a joke, yeah it doesn't hurt. It's all right!. Got home,  took off my make up and crawled in a ball on my bed and started crying. Went like this for like 4-5 days. Lost 6 pounds because I didn't want to eat. I felt like I was the worst, that maybe it was me the problem. But no, I'm a good human being. I'm worthy.

3176,wqavvu,[deleted],"I’m no where near completing my goal and I’ve only taken a few steps from it, but those steps have been the hardest I have ever taken.

I’m a 15 year old in school who is lonely and I have 0 friends. 

Through my time being lonely, I have been able to watch the world from the sidelines and understood how fucked up society is and how the world is stacked against me, but that’s a rabbit hole too long for this message.

In a nutshell everything revolves around how confident you are in your ability. If you call someone a bitch and your unconfident they’ll argue against you. If you resonate confidence they’ll take a blind eye or play it off.

I have dedicated my life to become more confident so I can become better perceived.

I have quit Instagram, TikTok, discord so I don’t compare myself to other people. I have been working out and take good care of my nutrition. I talk to people in the most confident demeanour I can when every cell of my body is shivering in fear and that lies on hours on hours of watching YouTube videos on how to manipulate others to make them like you. I have joined the school rugby team which I suck at and people look down on me for it, but I push through knowing I must preserve so I can gain confidence. 

Every second is spent towards this goal now, I have never wanted something this bad, but I hardly have had any progress. I need motivation.

No wide hips or anything. Essentially, most people in my school tell me I look like a freshman. I just wish i was pretty like those girls.

3185,wqckps,thewaymylifegoes,"Hi, My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) have been dating for the better part of a year now. We had a very rocky start to the relationship and we've been struggling with toxicity (I have trust issues due to his alcohol use and past behavior, but we worked through it together). He has always been a poor texter, but I voiced that I needed more communication from him to feel safe and secure in the relationship and for months he was working on it (I could feel it, and there was so much improvement. I felt so seen).

Lately, the past month or so, he barely texts me anymore. When he does text me, he usually lazily sends two-word replies to the things I say or completely ignores what I say and texts something completely different. When I express how I feel, he states that he ""doesn't want to fight"" when I am just voicing my feelings in a calm way. He completely shuts down. He used to text me a few times at work throughout the day to check in on me or tell me how his shift is going (he's a bartender. he often works til 1-2am). Lately, he goes 6 to 7 hours without texting me at all, and says ""I'm busy at work"" and ""I hate being glued to my phone"" when it literally takes a few seconds to check in during a bathroom break. It's pushing me away and it hurts so bad, and I've told him how this affects me and he dismisses my feelings. He says ""I'm too dependent"" on him and he ""hates using his phone."" He complains like texting substance a few times a day is some sort of tall order. When we hang out though, he's always taking calls from his guy friends.

This past weekend he went out to a nightclub and didn't text me until 3 am when he came back. I was crying about this the next day, I told him how uncomfortable that made me (his lack of communication) and he said ""Nothing was stopping me from going. I'm not spending my 20's in my bedroom."" (He tried to deflect onto me saying he invited me, when he only invited me at midnight). He then invited me for drinks and I said no, going for drinks would make me feel worse. We had an agreement not to go to nightclubs without each other, but it was his brother's birthday. On Sunday, he went out again with his cousins and he let his phone die. They went drinking and then ended up in a casino til 3am again too. When I called him the next morning about it, he said ""Can I call you back in a few hours? I'm trying to sleep."" I voiced how uncomfortable the situation made me feel and he said ""I'm out with my family, I'm not giving you my time.""

Last night he got out of work at midnight, I hadn’t heard from him since 1pm. I texted him earlier in the day how much I missed him and love him and wish we could go back to when things were good He ignored my messages and said “I just got out of work. I’m going to P’s apartment then going home.” He wasn’t home til 2 am again. 

I'm feeling so alone in this relationship. But I can’t let go, I love him. I’m so afraid to lose someone again after it took two years to get over my ex. He makes me feel like a nuisance and that my feelings don't matter. I don't know why I can't let go. I think it's gotten to the point where we have resentment towards each other because he likes to drink and party, and I am an introvert who prefers movie nights inside. I’m so depressed and feel lost and aimless in life. My severe depression really damaged the relationship. Now my ideation is resurfacing at the thought of experiencing the breakup trauma I experienced before. We've broken up and gotten back together, we've gotten over countless rough patches and I do believe he does have love for me. I love him. But it feels like he's slow fading me or isn't brave enough to cut the cord. He's watched me cry so much recently over the state of our relationship and does not react at all. He says he ""hates when I cry"" but continues to behave in ways that make me feel hopeless for the longevity of our connection. He is my best friend. I know all too well that familiar feeling of losing something irreplaceable, and something that takes so long to build. Is there anything left to salvage here, or should I work on moving on?

3188,wqcsbj,TelephoneFit8363,"I’m a 20M, my whole life isn’t bad, I have a great family, and parents. It’s just my social/relationship life that’s been terrible. I’ve always wanted a relationship since high school, I’ve had two girlfriends since then, to now, however, they weren’t my type. 


It’s 
hard to accept a relationship that wouldn’t work well for me, call me picky, but I want someone who I enjoy being around, and someone who enjoys my company as well. Anyway, I won’t tell my whole life story so far, I’ll just say that the past few months have been mentally healthier for me than anytime in my life. 

I was kicked out of my parents house in January for good, after coming back from rehab, and not holding anger in properly. But being homeless, I lived in the shelter of course, and thanks to a great job training Program I was in, I was able to move to a sober living house program (which was a bit better).

I stayed in Oxford House, and I was required to attend AA meetings 5 times a week. I was on the road to being an alcoholic and addict, but I never was one, nonetheless, I learned great advice from the program, and the people at them. I realized that being uncomfortable brings you forward, and being open minded makes you progress as well. 


You’d think that after progressing with a state of mind like that for 3 straight months, I’d be able to talk to women with no problem, but I’m still scared to talk to them. Thankfully, my parents found me a nice apartment, and I’m living in it now, typing this thread up. 

I feel exhausted, the last thing I can think to do now to get a relationship is get on my knees and beg, tell me if y’all can relate.",2022-08-17 02:18:05,lonely,t5_2qjny,,3,/r/lonely/comments/wqcsbj/unlucky_relationship_life_i_tried_giving_up/,,0,5,"Unlucky Relationship Life: I Tried giving up control/being selfless/being far out of my comfort zone, and still nobody."

It feels like an offense just for me to exist or breathe around other people. Am I really that odd, so weird and disturbing, that you ridicule me for something as innocent as eating or breathing?

What is it about me that causes me to be so incapable of making friends? Nothing will amount to the feeling of crying in public because of how separated you feel from kids at the lunch table, how nobody choses to engage in you despite you making conversation. It is exhausting. 

These emotions tend to manifest into physical pain. I can feel my heart squeeze and send shooting tingles to my hands every time I’m sad. It’s almost comforting in a way, as the pain helps you release some of the pent up thoughts in your head. 

I am so tired. All I can do is stay awake all night and listen to music while watching the moon slowly rise. There is something horrifically wrong with me, but I don’t know what.",2022-08-17 08:05:38,lonely,t5_2qjny,,25,/r/lonely/comments/wqj5l9/an_alien/,,0,9,An alien.

3247,wqm5yv,ScarletPancakes,"I'm starting a new chapter in life, college. I'm excited and very nervous.

I didn't have a great time at high school, I was lonely. I mean, I did have friends, but most of the time I think that they only friends with me because they pitied me. No one ever asked me to hangout or anything, I always did everything by myself, which I didn't mind but I felt really lonely sometimes. I felt pathetic. Why couldn't I have a normal life? I always thought that maybe I was too boring, or too weird, or too awkward, and I intended to change everything in college.

Well, it doesn't get better. I find myself being an outcast again. The people around me already have friends, and I'm alone again. I talk to them of course, and befriend them but they already have their own crowd. When I talk people just brush me off like I'm not there. I go everywhere by myself. I don't have anyone to talk to. I watch my classmates hangout with each other but not me. I feel so lonely. I want to be able to greet and smile to people at the street, I want to feel like I belong here, to feel alive.

I moved to another part of the country, far away from my hometown, because I want to avoid people from my old school and I thought it would get better. I really want to go back home, but I can't. I fought really hard to be accepted in this uni and my parents spent a lot of money for me. I would probably be killed if I told them I want to go back. But I don't know if I can do it or try a little but longer... I don't feel like I belong. I'm watching people's life happening around me, while I don't even feel alive.

I have been friends with someone I went to high school with since our senior year. We were never best friends, more like the kind that would text and catch up every few months. But I made more than one trip in the 10 years since college just to hang out with her, we have exchanged gifts, etc. When I checked myself into a mental hospital in college, she was the phone number I gave to the doctor to show I had someone I could talk to.

I haven't talked with her in a while so I texted her suggesting I go visit her, and she sent me a long message saying she doesn't have time to see me, honestly wouldn't enjoy spending time with me even if she could, and that we've grown apart and should just go our separate ways.

God it felt like a punch in the gut. But at the same time, my entire life I've been used to being the friend people forgot about. I typically feel like I like the friend more than they like me.... and usually I'm right.

I honestly don't know what's so unloveable about me, but I sure wish I could change it.

3262,wqqjfd,topman20000,"So I already posted about this on Facebook, and I was very mature about it. After all, I don’t see what happened as a failure, but as a learning experience this time. Primarily because it was a fair audition, the agent was candid and blunt… And that’s really what that was all about. I’m sitting outside a restaurant here in Weimar Germany, drinking beers and having dinner before My next program rehearsal.  Hopefully the meal and the drink will make me feel better later.

But right now I don’t feel as good about the reality of the situation as I would want to.  For a lot of younger people in our program, it’s easy to take life less seriously and as a learning experience because they ARE younger, and they have a lot going for them.  Find 34, and the agent I auditioned for today made me feel really bad about it. Because in a lot of ways he may be right. I’m starting to age out of the opportunity to really make a big break in Opera Music.  

I feel really bad about this, because in all honesty I’ve never really had anybody in this industry truly believe in me.  And that’s the part about this that really hurts.  I really haven’t had anybody in my corner to tell people “hire this guy“, and yet I have everybody saying that they believe in me and that I can achieve anything.  It really hurts thinking about that, and then finding out that I wasn’t good enough where it mattered. If people really thought that about me when they heard my voice, I really have to ask… How come they didn’t speak for me?

I guess even for autistic people like myself, a measure of advocacy would be too much to ask.  But I suppose that’s the price I pay for trying to meet the standards of normal people.  

At any rate, I’m very lonely right now. Or as they say in Germany/Deutschland, Ich bin sehr heute einsam. There isn’t really anyone in this country who cares about that. They are an extremely practical people. Called, hurtful, everything Hass to be correct for them. They are very reserved people. They aren’t a bad people, but sometimes it feels very lonely trying to speak the language as best I can with what little I can retain, only for them to break out Into English putting me to shame, like I’m not even trying.  I don’t have a problem with the culture, But even with a modicum of German blood in my veins, I don’t think I fit in here any better than America.

I fell for his wit and charm, and learned after a few short months of living together just how controlling and manipulative he could be. Though never physically abusive, the mental torture and anguish at times was borderline psychotic. He spent months speaking to me at the lowest volume possible so I would think something was wrong with my hearing. It was so bad, I saw multiple specialist as I really thought I was going crazy. It’s in my actual medical chart “husband was causing patient mental anguish by speaking at lower than normal volumes. Patients hearing is fine.” 

After four years together I managed to move out and get my own place. I was doing okay, but fell behind on a bill, and ask his help. This turned in to him tell me he had no where to stay, and needing to sleep on my couch. Then, his mom passed away, and of course it was “well, I helped you, are you really going to kick me out now?” 

I got myself back in to a relationship with him, long story short. And while he seemed to have made some positive changes, recently a negative life event has happened, and he is back to his ways. He hid my pleasure toys, saying it wasn’t okay that I didn’t want to have sex with him but wanted to pleasure myself. I have sex with him frequently, just not everyday, and he makes me feel guilty any time I say no. He calls me lazy and says I never do anything around the house, though I am solely response for feeding our kids, cleaning, and caring for the pets and children. 

I try and talk to him about this and he yells and screams. He slammed a door yesterday and the blind came back and hit me in the face, busting my lip. He doesn’t seem to care or have any real concern over my feelings, and when I attempt to address them, he tells me I’m ruining his day.

3286,wqw0nt,bruisedbrains,She has bpd and i’m pretty sure i’m her “favorite person”. She was so anxious about me not having as much fun with her as compared to her sister that it eventually “came true”. She self sabotaged and essentially pushed herself away from me. She has a twisted sense of reality and was grasping at every possible form of evidence that i didn’t love her or i was ignoring her or disrespecting her. It’s so stressful. I’m dealing with my own issues and it’s hard navigating that and trying to be happy when my friend is experiencing a lot of insecurity about our friendship. I found a stray dog that followed me and tried to get in my car. I was so lonely and he looked so hungry and dirty. I gave him food but i didn’t have any dog supplies or anything and so i told him i was going to come back for him soon. The next day/ night I searched everywhere and i couldn’t find him.

Hi  people. I'm a 21 y/o guy and my health has been horrible for the past  3/4 years. I feel very lonely. I believe good relationships are pretty  much the most important think in the life of a human being, though in  all my life I never managed to establish any true connection with anyone  and by that I mean being curious about each other's world, his/her  interests, dreams and hobbies, talking about what makes us feel good and  what makes us feel bad, making jokes, truly caring for each other...

And by the way it seems to me that most relationships around me only work at a very superficial level.

I  can be pretty friendly and sociable, but after a while I get tired of  only doing small talk, I lose my motivation and end up alone with my  thoughts if the conversations I have with people won't get deeper or I  feel too ""distant""/different from them.

I obviously have some  anxiety and depression, pretty bad brain fog from my completely messed  up sleep habits/patterns, very low mental energy and I feel pretty much  dead inside.I'm extremely frustrated for not being able at all to  develop myself and grow, and I suppose that having many interests may  also play a minor role, but that's another story I guess.

I'd  like to practice my hobbies, do some sport, study and read a ton, follow  my passions, watch more movies, listen to more genres of music, play  more videogames, talk to a lot of people, travel and visit more places,  earn some money by myself, do something useful for this world with love,  spend time with someone special and being special for someone etc.

Instead,  I find myself laying on the bed, thinking about anything I can think of  for most of my day, and sometimes fapping a flaccid penis.

I  feel like I'm fully compatible only with a tiny percentage of people  (and I guess this is somewhat normal for most people(?)) but the thing  is that I don't feel able to accept a compromise. I just crave for a  truly strong, deep relationship and I don't feel really interested in  anything different from that. At the same time I believe realtionships  aren't only about compatibility, but also about nurturing the very same  relationships.

Probably it's all about doing a lot of stuff and  meeting as many people as possible but I find it very hard right now  because I basically have completely lost control of my life.

What  should I do? Could I have some underlying psychological disorders? I  think my intrapersonal intelligence developed a bit late, so maybe I  ended up like this because I figured out late what I really need(?)Any ideas/advice?Should I talk to a mental health professionist? And since there might be a lot of people in a situation even worse than mine, feel free to DM me if you want to chat, we can help each other :)",2022-08-17 22:45:27,lonely,t5_2qjny,1549497066,0,/r/lonely/comments/wr2kuw/feeling_very_lonely_couldnt_bond_with_anyone/,,0,0,"Feeling very lonely, couldn't bond with anyone"

3337,wr3w6y,Darkness-Descends,"So I’m 26M and currently severely depressed, probably more so than I’ve ever been in my life. But somehow just last month it’s like I woke up from a lifelong pattern of self-sabotage and realized that I have to completely change myself if I ever want a chance at being happy, and by extension, maybe one day finding someone who can care for me the way I desperately need. 

So for the past month I’ve really been doing my best to improve myself (set up a dermatologist appointment to fix my skin, dentist appointments to fix my teeth, quit smoking weed and drinking alcohol/coffee, bought weights and started a workout routine at home, started eating regularly to get myself to a healthy weight, and the list goes on), but the amount of time, effort, and money it’s going to take me to complete all these goals is pretty overwhelming and I have literally nobody to help me get through it. Not even a single friend. I talk to one person over discord, but I think they need a more normal friend, and with how depressed I am, I often don’t know how to be that for them. 

If there’s anybody out there who’s in a similar situation, whether you’ve already started your process, or you’re thinking about starting, and you could use a friend to help you, send me a message. I really need someone I can talk to and relate with, and while I need help myself, I would also be glad to help you however I can on your own path of improvement. It’s just so hard to be alone with my thoughts all the time and I know people here can understand that. 

I don’t even really care about what we talk about. Could be self improvement, but it could also be movies, music, books, video games, DnD, science, or just how horrible loneliness and depression is. Anything at all would be a huge help.

I’ve honestly always been better at speaking openly with women, but I’m happy to talk to a guy as well, as long as you aren’t the incel type who just blames women for you being alone. I fully consider myself to be one of the “forever alone” folks at this point, but I recognize that it’s entirely my fault. I also want to make it very clear that I am NOT looking for anything romantic/sexual in any way. Even though it is what I crave so desperately, I am just so far from being ready for anything like that at all right now. 

Sorry for the wall of text everybody but I just wanted to put it all out there.

3344,wr58bk,memories_torn_apart,"Hey all, 18M here. So since Sunday, I’ve been officially moved in to my university—things have been *difficult*. In between moving things and accompanying my familiar to xyz events and general sightseeing, I’ve not at all been able to talk to any fellow students. Not helping is the fact I got a single dorm. Well today my family left and all my things are settled, finally giving me the chance to talk to people on my own terms—and what did I do? Nothing. My anxiety-ridden self has barely limped through a library tour, hidden in my room, and just recently I spirited myself away from a dorm hallway meeting out of sheer panic. Basically, my RA said were supposed to meet up in a lounge and then go off for dinner in a dining hall. I didn’t talk to anyone in the lounge because of course I didn’t, and then when we set off, I got kinda lost, grabbed my food, wolfed it down, and ran back to my room before anyone could see me (not that anyone was watching). 

Im so frustrated with myself. I promised myself I would change in college, that I’d be sociable, that I’d finally make friends for the first time in my life, I just needed a new environment to thrive. And yet here I am making the same mistakes. I know what I’m doing wrong. Why can’t I act right? Is this what I’m doomed to do in every environment I’m placed in? I can’t see myself getting better. I need to, and I know it’s early, I’ll get many other changes, but I’m so worried—this is not a great first impression I’m leaving of myself.

(I promise I’m not this melodramatic or whiney usually, this is just how I write frustrated)

3347,wr5px5,Certain_Law_888,"I recently got devorced. My spouse was (and still is) like a child. Sometimes I had to give my full attention. Sometimes ı was completly ignorent. Problems never resolved because i was the only one trying to find/work on a solution. For example, we also went to therapy and couples therapy which yielded no results. I was the only one sharing my feeling and problems. I was giving support, affection. I patiently waitet for more than a year for any change. Finnally i accepted that i was alone in the relationship so i ended it.

Well after getting back home to live with my mother one would expect things to get better, nicer. But nope. Almost ever since my birth what she wants to do, what she needs, what she feels has always been more important than me. She never asked how I am doing after any heated arguments with my dad(i will mention these arguments later). Even today she doesn't bother to ask how i am doing. she just assumes I am fine.

 she yells at everyone just beacause she is annoyed from something that has nothing to do with the person or something doesn't work for her. She yelled at me muntiple times when I was sad or angry or didn't do that one very most maximum important thing as she wanted (Apperantly I had to read her mind with my telepathic abilities). Just like a child she doesn't know how to express and manage her or other person's feelings. 

Here are some funny (to you) occations about cleaning

Me: (Vaccum cleaning the house)

Mom: (yelling) Why are you cleaning the house. This is my house.

\*\*\*

Also mom:  This is your house too. Of course you also have to clean it.

\*\*\*

Also mom: I don't trust your cleaning.

My mother is quite selfish. Money is not a means but a goal for her. she almost always provided for things that she found necessary. Asking for small amouths to pamper myself have been mostly denied. But not before questioning with demeaning expression. I should not be arguing for small amouths since we have never been poor. Yet money is always an issue.

She is also incapable of making any kind of conversation. She cuts my sentences to say a demeaning, pessimistic,sanctified  comment, or opinion. She is obsessed with many small stuff. Examples for annoying ones are cleaning, my driving and how those guys that always do that job are going to the very same job (a gem from today's argument) she is not a supportive mother.

she also tried to manipulate my feelings about my dad. (remember the heated arguments) apperantly i loved him. but she never asked. she lied to her self to run away from hers. And forced me to believe i missed my dad. (more later)

 And i reacently realized and accepted that even her  side of my family is like this. They are not supportive, kind. they don't actually talk to any one. And they are extreamly judgemental. no one in that part of my family truly knows one another. 

this could go some more but will skip those and tell a little about my dad. he is a cruel man that constanty criticise me aboputh how lazy, ill mannered, messy and undisiplined i am. (you raised me so...) Remember the heated arguments. Well the most horrible ones occured after their divorce. my dad showed up unannounced. my mom lets him in. and with in two minutes he manages to start an argument with (very lazy) me who is IN THE MIDDLE OF STUDYING. this kept repeating for four years. he stayed for 2 3 4 months and goes away with another heated argument with me. mom only watched this cruel arguments. that she had sex with him. quite the victory prize for dad.

he has this very importantest (not a mistake) life philosophy that ""In order for a dog and a child to act disiplined, both needs to be afraid from someone from the house"". yes he personally said that to me. and acted according to this philosophy. he moved his practice to a place where he almost never worked when i was a child. earned what he needed. and used my mothers money. he onced asked money from mom in front of my eyes to buy me a gift so it would seem he was the one who bought it.

I was the one who finally kicked him out. he moved to another city. but mom called him back. (Thanks for the support mom. I mean i was the grown up. I saved us from him but still thanks) I kicked him for a second time.

My dad is also a textbook narcissist. 

today is twenty plus years later. I grow up with an emotionally unexisting mother and a horrible father. I was lonely as far as i can rememder. I am psychologically damaged. I don't know how love feels and I have trouble connecting with others. I am socially distant. Right now i am giong trough yet another depression. My ex's behaviour only triggered my inner demons. The only good thing going on in my life is mom still has wealth to support me and my very expensive therapy. 

But i am still afraid i will spent the rest of my life alone. I will not feel the affection of another human being. i won't have someone to hug me out of love. i will not have a child of my own. my body will be discovered five years later after i am dead. I feel like my life is petrified. i am in pain.

I have been alone working hard at my job far away from friends and family. I’ve felt fine although I knew I was fairly lonely.

The date went super well and I had fun but that whole event has ended and now I’m feel almost heartbroken that it can’t work out between us.

I think feeling close to someone and being open with who I am — for only an evening — triggered something inside me that stopped recognizing I was lonely. Now the floodgates are open and I can’t seem to feel like I did before.

3374,wr9l9f,Throwawaymyonly,"Good evening Reddit, I'm not too sure if anyone will read this or be Interested but I figured I would share my story in hopes for others not to make the same mistakes. I'm a 22 caucasian male, I grew up in a decent size city In Canada with two parents and had a pretty normal childhood. I was also pretty shy growing up and never really made friends growing up. Pretty much through my life I only really had two friends that I met during my elementary years. (One in grade two or three and the other in grade 6) I grew up with them and hung out with them almost daily. Nothing too noteworthy happened until around high school were one of my friends ended up attending a different high school so I was mostly stuck hanging out with him. During this time he went on to meet new people and we slowly started to hang out less and less. Since this was happening at the time I was extremely shy and found it hard to talk with new people I most spent of my time alone and did not do much outside of school besides building computers and playing a new game called grand theft auto five. It's important to note that I have always had a slite learning disability which basically meant I was in the easier classes throughout high school. In Grade 10 I ended up moving high schools since my mom at the time had it out with the school after she got a call from the principal saying that typically the kids who are in these easier classes don't go on to do well in life and usaly end up at dead-end jobs. This didn't make any sense since I always showed up on time and always tried to do well. MY grades at the time were not a problem either since I always handed work in on time and never came close to failing any classes. Regardless she had enough and we ended up moving which was for the better since we got a bigger house in a nicer neighborhood. This caused me to switch high schools for grades 11 and 12. When I started in grade 11 at my new school I made some friends but we never really hung out outside of school since most of them lived outside the city due to our school being on the edge of our city. Even though I was at a new school I mostly just kept quiet, showed so did my work, and went home. This continued on throughout grades 11 and 12. It's important to note all throughout high school IK was kind of a nerdy-looking guy who was social aquward so I never really had any luck getting a girlfriend at the time. After graduation just like almost all school friends, we all drifted apart with my only one being the one I met way back in two or three. After high school, I decided to start an apprenticeship through a local union which has been a blessing and a curse. In 2019 after being in the trade for 9 months I started to realize that I was a bit of a loser since I never really made any friends and have never had a girlfriend so I decided since I was making good money for my age to hire an escort from my city. I started seeing her and it was amazing since I never really did anything with women (Holding hands, hugging, Sex Etc) This started to become an addiction since I felt that she aucly liked me for who I was even though she was just doing her job. I started seeing her almost every weekend until the end of the year in 2019. I liked her so much that I even brought her to a Christmas party that the company I was doing work for hosted. It was a nice night and it cost me over $1,000 for the night but It was worth it since It was the first time I had ever gone on a ""Date"" with a girl. I started seeing her less and less over the following year since I felt it was getting expensive considering each visit was $300+ but I never spent money and always saved and Invested since I was 18 so spending some to make me feel happy didn't bother me. I still was trying my luck on all the usual dating apps to try and at least land my first real girlfriend without any luck. Jumping forward to 2021 I started working out of town with only having a week off per month with the rest of my time being spent in remote communities. This was a good thing since working out of town makes you more money but the trade-off is it drags on your mental health. It was around this time was I started to experiment with things such as weed and alcohol along with other substances. I used them as a way to escape m,y problems since I started to feel more and more depressed being away from home along with the feeling of the only thing I have to go home to is somebody who I have to pay in order to give me the time of day and not much else besides my parents. This continued on through the years with the substance abuse getting worse as a way to cope with how I was feeling, I stopped seeing her and I felt even worse than I did before since I now had no one to talk to and felt even worse. Towards the end of 2021, I decided to see her for one last time and after that, I would stop doing all the self-destructive behaviors that lead me to that point. Fast forward to the current date and I was doing fine until about a month ago. I started to feel even more depressed working out of town along with feeling unfulfilled at my job. Every day I'm working under a lot of stress and anxiety which was never there in the last three years. This has caused me to hate my job and my life since I have become miserable every day now. I'm currently on my time off and since I have been home this month I went and saw my girl whom I swore I would never see again. I tried out for our local military as a way out of my current career path since I felt it would be a good option but I failed the aptitude test yesterday and now I feel I will be getting back into my old ways. It may seem obvious that I have everything tougher since I bought a new vehicle two years ago in cash and recently picked up a Plane Jane AP watch along with making other Investments In Stocks, Crypto and Realsate all well still living at home at the age of 22 but It's far from it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure what I should do since I'm now 22, I'm in an Industry I now hate. The only girlfriend I ever had has been an escort whom I still pay when I visit. I don't really have any friends since we have all grown apart and I'm just not sure what I should do. I have been looking for a new Job without any luck so In the meantime well I still looking I will still be working out of town. 

&amp;#x200B;

3375,wr9lwd,sweetnymphrodite,"I (24f) matched with this guy (28m) on okcupid a day ago and was chatting with him - we had like EVERYTHING in common, the same values, wanted the exact same thing. Where it went wrong was when I tried to express my boundaries. On okcupid there’s profile questions that you can answer to increae your match percentage with someone who answers similarly to those question- between him and I ours was at a 99% match- seems like we’d be perfect for each other, right? Well he went though some of the answers and one of them was a sexual question and he said he had a high sex drive and hoped it wasnt a problem, I said no as long as he wasnt sexual with me right away, I have trauma from past relationships and dont feel comfortable getting right into that kind of stuff. I also expressed some insecuity about feeling like I talk too much or not enough so Im bad at having balance with that and to that he replied “thats okay I dont talk much anyway” I jokingly replied “I love a man that knows when to shut up lmao” I expressed to him I was joking, and then said Im generally quiet too. He replied to that by saying “if you want to get me to be quiet you’d have to sit on me” Now with my past experiences, I have never ever heard the term “sit on me” used in a non-sexual phrasing, so I’ll admit I got a little defensive and assumed thats what he meant and proceeded to explain to him if he was going to be sexual with me I did not want to to talk, I just made a boundary and was just trying to clarify it and get some sort of reassurance but instead he turned it around on me and was like “I didn’t mean it in a sexual way” (which, please, tell me HOW you wouldnt think a guy saying to a girl “sit on me” wasnt sexual at first) and that I ruined the conversation and good luck to me.

Thing is Ive been self aware about this thought process for a while, so maybe I really am a POS for not doing anything about it. Or theres some other repressed shit involved.

After all, what I’m really craving is spending time with people and instead I get endless hours alone in lab to come home to an empty apartment.

I thought getting a boyfriend would help me feel less lonely but it’s done the opposite. I don’t want to be co-dependent, or clingy, but it just feels like I hardly get to spend time with him. Weekdays are impossible to plan for to spend together, so I always assume the weekends are for us- except he keeps scheduling other social activities then.

3408,wrdyku,olls_9,"Hi everyone. I just needed to get this out, and hopefully get some advice, as I feel I’m running out of options. 

I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK. I have no friends and life is becoming more and more lonely. I’m loosing hope I’ll ever make even one friend, never mind ever find a partner, and that I’m going to end up living my life alone. With other things I’ve got going on, I just don’t know how to change it.

I just want to start by saying that I know I’m a lot luckier than some people because I have people around me. However, you can still be lonely in a room full of people if you’re nothing alike. 

I’m also transgender. I mention this because it does play a part in all this, but I’ve already made plenty of posts in detail about that. Being transgender plays a part because some people aren’t cool with that and hate the fact people like me even exist. I obviously want to be friends with people that are ok with that, but that already narrows down the amount of potential people to be friends with. It’s always in the back of my mind as to whether people will accept me. I can’t transition yet either, so it’s pretty obvious from when someone first speaks to me, so it’s not like I can keep it to myself and let someone know if I want to. 

I just about get along with my family, but it’s complicated to say the least. I tried to come out to them about three years ago and got no support, so I’ve just hidden my true self away in shame. The family that don’t know I’m trans certainly won’t accept me when they do find out. Even if it’s not in the most obvious way, they do try to control what I do and make choices for me. I’m fed up of it because I’m the one that’s really miserable. So it’s a strange situation of being ok with each other in terms of getting by day to day, but whenever something serious happens, we massively disagree. I have way less patience with them now as I feel like it’s only a matter of time before they try to tell me what to do. But of course, if I try to fight for what I want, I’m the one causing trouble. I moved in with my auntie last year, as she lives a few hours away, for university. It’s been good, because it’s given me some space from my parents, and I finally feel like I’m somewhat in control of my own decisions. It was one of the best decisions I ever made to move because me and my auntie are really alike and get on so well. She’s someone I can talk to, and I know she’ll try to help me, rather than look at me like I’m an idiot and talk down to me. I still don’t know if she’d accept me fore being trans though, and it would mean telling all my other family too. Now this bit sounds horrible, but I hope it makes sense in the context of the post. My auntie is 88 years old so she’s obviously an elderly woman. I know that she isn’t going to be around forever, and I really have no idea what I’d do if something happened. It would be awful not having her around to talk to, but there’s also the fact that I’ll have to go back home, because I won’t have anyone here that I could stay with, or even just have around for company. I hate thinking about that, but I know that if I don’t do anything in the near future to change this, that’s what’s going to happen.

I fight between wanting to go out because I’m sick of the same four walls, to then being too anxious to leave. Then when I do go out, it feels like a kick in the teeth when I see people out with their friends having fun. I’m glad other people are happy and enjoying themselves, but it highlights what I don’t have. If I’ve left the house to try and make myself feel better, I often come back feeling worse. 

Confidence is another key issue for me. This is partly due to being trans, and partly due to thinking no one wants to even associate with me seen as I’ve not had any friends in so long. The longer I’m alone, the more my mind tries to convince me I’m not wanted, no one cares, and I’m not someone anyone wants to be around. I know that’s a dangerous way of thinking but it’s becoming more frequent. I’m lucky in that I live near a city, so there should be plenty of opportunities to meet people, but I’m struggling to find them. I hate when people say just put yourself out there. I know you have to take steps to meet people, but I find it so hard to go somewhere new with so many new people and try and make myself known. I feel like I’m on the edge of society, and the longer this goes on, the more I feel like just giving up and not trying, which I know is definitely not the best idea. I go out and do a lot of things other people do, yet I’m always alone and struggle to find or take opportunities to change this. 

I’ve turned to the internet to try and meet people countless times, but I’m yet to find anybody similar. It doesn’t give me much hope as you have a much wider net of people online too. Everyone I see online seems to have a whole group of friends and I struggle to even make one. I appreciate that people don’t owe you anything when you start a conversation online, but because they have their friends to fall back on, it doesn’t seem as important to them to try to make an effort. 

About a month ago I reached out to a girl on Reddit. She was saying about how lonely she was, and I related to a lot of what she said, so I decided to message her. We hit it off and it’s the most connected I’ve felt to someone in ages. Then the next day, she stopped replying and deleted all the socials that I was following her on, including Reddit. I’m pretty sure she was trying to catfish me, although I don’t know what she was gaining from it, but it left me feeling even more deflated than before. It sounds stupid because I’m trying to form connections with people, but if you’re going to do something like that, I’d rather you not bother in the first place. It’s worse feeling like you’re getting close with someone, only for them to throw it back at you.

So long story short, I have no friends, I’m finding it harder to leave the house, and I’m scared it will be like this forever and I’ll be left alone. I’m sorry this was so long, but I just needed to let my feelings out somewhere. People always say that you’re never alone and there will be someone who can relate, but more and more I think that just isn’t true. For other reasons too, my future doesn’t seem so bright at the minute, but the thought of going through life with no one who understands me or wants to be around me is awful. If anyone is in a similar position, please feel free to comment or dm me. Also, if anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

I have felt every negative emotion possible so many times, replayed it in my mind so many times that i no longer feel anything. I believe there lies a true abyss, within me. also my suicidal tendencies aren't helping either but i don't blame them. I mean a decade of suffering will make anyone like that. In the last decade i have lost people, relations etc. There even was a 3 year period where i had to run for my life because there were people in whose best interests was my death. Everyone ridiculed me all the time, including my own family, parents (they still do), being racially targeted, molested and what not. if i listed everything i had been through then this post will become almost never ending. But thats not my intent.

so being said that i had a pretty event full decade due to which now i am emotionless and suicidal.

I no longer feel any remorse, empathy, sympathy, sadness. it all looks like a statistic.

I this is how it feels to be dead inside.

3413,wreap7,ricardsouzarag,"Lately I\`ve becoming more and more lonely. during college went through some bad experiences regarding being ostracized and shunned by peers that I once considered friends, but as someone that has dealt with mild bullying since I was a kid I took that as 'normal, part of my life' and - sorta - moved on.

So long story short after letting the few acquitances I kept from college drift away I ended with a really small social circle, around 2 friends (one of them a mostly online friend) and a gf - other than my family which isnt big.

so this one friend ghosted me because I couldnt make to a trip we would make (it was a trip to do an exam for a job, he went anyways without me and had no loss, also I told him in advance). At first I felt like reaching for him to try and keep the friendship going but a second later I was like ""nah screw that, I knew that would happen anyways, as it always does"".

So with this other online friend which I met in person twice, despite we being really close and talking everyday for years, I got mad for her taking her new-ish bf side when he came cursing at me on social media, I felt like cursing him back but didnt because I didnt want to upset her. in the end despite admitting he was kind of an asshole to me she still took his side (as expected - still made me disgusted nonetheless).

so now Im a bit conflicted. should I shrug it off and 'continue being friends'? I feel like if I continue being friends it would be just for the sake of showing her and her bf that it didnt affect me, but I would become kinda of a slimy fake friend, not being available for her, talking less and being less friendly, and secretly hoping her projects fail instead of succeeding like I hoped before - to get that sweet schadenfreude feeling of platonic/karmic revenge. fast foward it seems sweet but I dont feel like putting up with her just for the sake of getting that petty reward.

rationally though I want to keep the friend. its my closer friend bar family and gf, I like most things about her, find her funny and endearing, and she likes my humour too (it might sound like that but I dont have a crush on her. shes totally not my type though, although being fairly attractive even to conventional standards. I see her like a sister above anything else). so, maintaining the friendship \*could\* show them Im the better person and also have  her continuing to provide me with support, companionship, admiration, and so on.  I just dont feel like it. I feel like I dont want her anymore.

Maybe Im unsure about whether she really cares about me, at least as much as I care about her (positively or negatively). Or if Im just like \~whatever\~ to her now, and therefore she should be another \~whatever\~ to me as well.

What should I think about in order to help me think about it more clearly? Any thoughts are appreciated thanks.",2022-08-18 08:46:28,lonely,t5_2qjny,1609360610,1,/r/lonely/comments/wreap7/should_i_care_more_or_care_less_about_losing/,,0,2,"Should I care more, or care less about losing friends?"

Everyone tells me to find clubs, activities and groups that might interest me in the area, yet there are none? I've looked everywhere, yet there is nothing. I live in Malmö, Sweden. A pretty big city for Sweden, surerly there must be something? From my little experience I only really get dopamine from alt/rock/emo people, maybe it is because I'm a edgy teenager, I'm not sure. But the point is that there is almost no place where I can go to meet these groups, when I commute or just find myself in the city I usually walk past or see multiple people who look interesting and that I would find enjoyable to be around. But it's weird to walk up to people out of nowhere, atleast for me, I rather go to a place that is designed around meeting people.   


I'm irritated and mad. Every single book, artcitle, website, reddit comment says the same thing, find people who you find interesting. I KNOW what kind of groups I want to be with, but I can't find them. All I can find is the most basic boring groups or some random wine testing group for middle age people.   


I see time to time instagram posts of acquaintances where they meet people like that and so many of them. My main theory is that there aren't many groups/places/things for me to find, since the normal thing for kids my age is to have a friend, and expand their friendlist via that friend's friends. But I have no friend from the beginning, so how can I possibly do that? I'm alone, I feel like I've tried but the world does not want to see me with others. Even if I did find the perfect place, I fear that I'm unlikeable, if I was likeable I wouldn't be in this position in the first place, right?

1. Go to meetups which are about bars. Sometimes people have a goodbye hug.

2. Join a couple dance classes like salsa. They usually provide partners and rotate between different people. So you learn to dance and get to touch someone (I am not talking about a creepy way, just a basic human touch.

Hi guys, new here and i don’t really know what i’m doing but i’m desperate for somewhere to dump it all.
i’m starting yr 12 in a couple weeks and i’ll be honest with you guys, i’m fucking terrified.
i’ve never really had friends or a big social group but in the last couple years at my school i’ve developed two friends whom i adore and can’t live without, but they’ve left.

i understand i barely understand the severity of the loneliness of some of the people on this subreddit have to deal with on a daily basis, but i have to get this off my chest and out into somewhere, so my apologies if this comes across as naive and pathetic but here we are.

two years in a school where i really have nobody. my only real friends have left and i cant see how ill get through the next years. i don’t want to sit alone and have to dissolve into the background like i always fucking seem to do, i’m so jealous of the people who seem to make friends so bloody easily, have massive groups just hanging around them at all times. why cant i just be like them? and how do they make it look so easy?

plus, tonight, while i’m home in my room alone just like i’ve been all fucking summer, my only friends are out having an absolute blast pissing about like real teenagers. something that to me just seems so impossible and unreachable i could never even imagine it. i just wish i could be more social and fucking normal.
i hate being so fucking lonely.

3521,wry8d5,beingrudewonthelp,"I have no other adults IRL except my parents. Who are toxic. My mom's actually not that bad, but she has her own problems. I don't know how I'm supposed to find anyone who wants to be around me. 

I'm only 39, but I've been having health issues that make me feel like I'm 69, not 39. I also have my kids all the time. I can find a babysitter sometimes, but it's not like I have anywhere to go. 

I'm supposed to be applying for disability. Which has been not so easy to accept. I've always worked hard and took care of stuff. But I can't handle it anymore. I won't go into all health problems. I tried reaching out for therapy and it only made me feel worse and have more anxiety when I expected it to help and it didn't. 

I've been betrayed by the one person I had for years. He made sure he destroyed everything I built. Long story, but it's partially my own fault for knowing better and just not wanting to deal with more problems so I let things go. I went through a tough couple of years building everything I had by myself, and got leeched off of by my kids dad. I helped and helped. Lots of broken promises were made to use me. Stolen from. Treated like I was nobody. And other than my kids, that's all I had for years. Having friends just caused problems at home. 

I had a really bad evening and right now I feel sick to my stomach bc of how alone I feel. I was let down again tonight, but not by him. I just can't take feeling like I'm drowning and being broke and not knowing what I'm going to do bc I can't find a job I can handle. 

I wanted life to be more than this. My kids are great. But I'm not. I worked so hard for years to get ahead and have nice things and all it took was one liar to destroy it all. I know I'm stupid. I feel like I need somebody but have nobody. I feel empty inside and like a shell of who I used to be.

3529,wrzfaq,Count_Backwerdz,"Hi there! I'm a 33 M from the Midwest(US). So, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I was a full-time student until recently; I just graduated. I work as a department administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for friendships over the last few years. 



Post-grad I've been in a bit of a slump looking back on things, and also from burn out and just being at a kind of crossroads in deciding what comes next for myself.  I plan on entering a graduate program spring '23 and I'd like to take this time to find and make friends. I've been sober for nearly 5 years and I'm appreciative of how completely different my life is at this time, but in changing things, I've become quite lonely. 



What I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens. 



Some of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.

Random Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) 

Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!

I [17M] am currently in one of the worst parts of my life so far. I have made mistakes and they kill me every day.

I'm not going to ask and beg for a relationship, but all il say is even that area is looking fairly dim right now.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I've came here looking for help. I really don't know what to do anymore. I've thought about ending my life many times in the past few days. I would love new friends that can get me out of my shell.

3564,ws310a,PsalmoftheSad,"This is one of the nights where I miss someone that I haven't talked to in years. Or more specifically, I **try** to remember those feelings I had for her years ago because it's better than getting left on read with the one girl I'm talking to nowadays. Which is worse : Getting to know someone in person that will frequently forget to reply or have a LDR with someone you thought you loved? 


I honestly can't tell anymore. I've gotten so lonely that I actually went to the mall today and bought a stroker. I feel ashamed just writing that out -- imagine how I felt when the cashier was a woman. In a situation like this, I'm faced with a dilemma : I wanna quit porn **so** fuckin bad so I can finally move on with my life, but when I quit I get twice as sad from -- well, I don't even know anymore. Is it loneliness? Is it withdrawals? I don't know and I don't care at this point. If I do this every night I feel my soul die a little but it sands off the edges... What do you do? What *CAN* you do?


I'm left with more questions than answers. I know this generation isn't long for this world so why I'm not trying to clean up my act right now is beyond me. Maybe I'm just a fuckin idiot -- but whatever the case may be I'm gonna have to tell the good Lord about times like these during judgement day, when I can't feel anything so I use adultery to fill the void. I've never had a real relationship before and I went on my first EVER date two months ago despite being 20-something.  


Got to watch everyone else in my life do it, though -- strangers included. Every day I stand at the counter at work I get to see couples holding hands, walking up and down the isles, starting their lives together. The same fuckers that say ""tHeRe'S SoMeOne FOR EVERyonE""

You have a subset of good friends that live in a different state. What is there to complain about? Maybe the constant loneliness that living alone and being in a new state brings you. Forget about living in a new state; even when I lived in my previous state I felt alone. Today, I started tearing up while OVER-indulging in some Chinese food. I know rather embarrassing but I just couldn't hold it in. I work sales for a living; so I have a great set of social and communication skills. Despite that being the case, the undeniably daunting process of finding genuine and authentic connections is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with in my life. I use many dating apps and I actually have a lot of success on them. I go on dates and I have fun. It never seems to last long though; most of the people I was working towards getting serious with realized either 

A. They had to work on themselves before they were ready to be in a relationship 

B. They treated me like I or the situation was completely disposable because of a disagreement or not seeing eye to eye. I'm talking about acts of real childishness amongst the other party.

I know there's two sides of every story but I can genuinely say that a lot of these girls I talked to I found out were going through a lot of stuff mentally. But that's kind of the norm in this day and age with COVID, MonkeyPox, inflation and the rising cost to survive, the constant rat race to become upper class, a loneliness epidemic, mental health declines especially amongst the younger generations, and a whole slew of BS that has everyone seemingly ""down bad"" even if their life is relatively decent. 

I'm struggling to meet new friends in my new state. It's the kind of place where high school friends stick with each other because they all come from small towns and they don't let new people in. I did a career change recently, and even before that I was managing people who were in their 40s. I say this because I know people recommend to make friends at work. These people have families and lives and don't have any spare time whatsoever to dedicate to hanging out with the young jock lol. I'm okay with being alone at times but at this point of my life I just want someone to be around you know. They say your happiness all comes from within but there's too many external factors to make such an argument. We have to rely on people everyday to get our food, make sure our residence is safe, fly us to our destination and most importantly, exchange ideas and have a sense of community; a sense of belonging. 

I hope anybody feeling lonely reads this and realizes they're not alone; and sometimes not even money, a handsome or pretty face, and a good heart and personality will change that.

3587,ws64hp,pandanitemare,"I'm so fucking angry. I have been patient for over a year and I'm still trying to be patient but I'm losing my mind and I'm slowly getting to my last nerve.

I don't know how to have friends and so I don't have a support system. I moved to Australia to be with my husband back in January and I only know his family. 

Now my husband, he's got ADHD, depression, anxiety, and has high stress levels. He's slowly been getting worse but I just got him to see someone about it and has now been medicated but we still have the 2-6 week adjustment period for his body to adjust to it, so not much has changed yet.

I've been diagnosed with a rare disorder, the Dr's don't know why it's happening or what's causing it but there's a chance if I don't change my health lifestyle, I will most definitely go blind. This is something I AM working on but I don't know what my time limit is and it's terrifying and my spouse isn't supporting me at all mentally or emotionally and I've tried reaching out to others already.

Anyways, we're trying to make his space into our space FINALLY after begging for so long but he barely wants to help but he knows how important this is to me. I can't do it by myself even if I wanted to and before the planning he even said he'd help and STILL keeps saying he will but finds almost every excuse under the sun to NOT help.

This is really long so
TLDR; I might go blind despite doing what drs say to do, I want the space I moved into with my husband to be OUR space not just his before going blind possibly happens so I can enjoy it. He knows this is important. Has previously and CONTINUES to say he'll help only to help slightly and then find an excuse not to help any more.

This isn't even the first time we've had problems but I also don't plan on leaving despite that being an obvious choice because he's never been medicated before",2022-08-19 05:58:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1552362925,0,/r/lonely/comments/ws64hp/not_even_the_important_stuff_that_actually_matters/,,0,1,not even the important stuff that actually matters

It’s like being underwater and holding up the top layer of a frozen lake every single day and the tiniest waver threatens to sink all the ice and I will crack. Its fake smiling and laughing when behind my eyes and under my skin I feel disturbance. I am grieving the loss of the love of my life and Every day is a performance. Occasionally the mask slips slightly and if they even notice they do not worry they do not care. That’s fine I don’t need anybody to notice that I am completely suffering. I feel made of cement and I have to force every movement. I’ve been so desperate to make a friend and not even for myself but just to help someone else who feels alone maybe if I can be there and understand them and give them all the attention they need…. Someone will see me too. I feel so alone I have nightmares of being stabbed and I feel the physical pain for hours in my sleep and when I wake up the fear that I experience followed me and my eyes open and I am alone… lying on my bed. I just want someone to understand how weak I am because I’m excellent at remaining composure, being strong and unbothered, but not so deep down, just under my skin I am burning with pain. I want to take care of someone. If I can just take care of them it won’t bother me that nobody will ever take care of me…. If I can be an amazing friend, they will finally see what’s in my heart. That I am a sweet girl…that I care… I feel deeper then I let on.

I 25M,  and friends 24M, 24F and 22F.

We would  hangout and chill quite a lotuntil i noticed one day,  that I'm literally just there to either pic one of my friends up or some shit like that.

I'm always the one initiating the conversation with any of those friends.  If i don't text them,  they won't text me.  And if i try to make plans on our group chat.  I get ignored by everyone. Like wtf.

To make matters worse,  i coincidentally met one of those friends as i was registering in uni, we started talking, and decided to text our other 2 friends and meet up.

I went home,  texted them,  texted that friend.  Got ignored by them all.  Then i saw their stories on social media those 3 hanging out together.  Like wtf?!",2022-08-19 13:42:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1598092229,11,/r/lonely/comments/wsedb4/fake_friends/,,0,10,fake friends &gt;.&lt;
3638,wseim5,Steiny5843,I used to always think I'm just not an attractive person at all. I always thought I was ugly. There wasn't really a reason for that tbh. I've been shown attention all throughout my life but living in this new city really opened my eyes to how good looking I am. This is not a gloating post at all. This is a post to let you all know that now I wish me being ugly was true. It is incredibly hard for me to find someone who is genuinely interested in me vs being into my looks or hearing about my sex life. I never know who is genuine and who is not. With that being said I'm not saying any of you are ugly at all. All I'm saying it it's easier to find genuine people if you aren't that attractive. Yes it can be a blessing but I feel it's more of a curse then anything. Yes I have alot of women after me but at the end of the day I still lay in my bed alone for the simple fact of I don't know if they are genuine or not. It kills me inside cause all I want to do is connect with someone but all I've been shown is how shallow people really are. Only my looks and dick are sought after. Not my heart or my mind. With that being said I was going to take my life the other night because of this. I just couldn't bear with the thought of not knowing who's there for me vs being there for my looks but I stopped by the gas station to grab some cigars so I can go out while I'm stoned but the gas station lady could see the pain in my eyes. She made me stay and talk to her and for some reason I just feel like I can't do it anymore. Something is stopping me. This happened the past few times I was going to attempt to take my life. I end up being saved by people and honestly part of me wishes those people didn't exist so I can finally rest but another part of me thinks if I've been saved this many times then there has to be something special out there for me. Sorry if it's too much of a read but I really needed to vent. I apologize if this upsets anyone.,2022-08-19 13:49:34,lonely,t5_2qjny,1611745025,3,/r/lonely/comments/wseim5/something_i_feel_alot_of_you_should_read/,,0,0,Something I feel alot of you should read.

3642,wsflrf,mypersacc,"I'm having a bad back and stomach pain out of nowhere, it's been two days. I shut myself in my room to wait out the pain thinking it'd go away in a day. And for a couple hours it did, but then it came back. So I'm lying on my back in my father's bed now since he's not home, in excruciating pain. My younger sister was beside me about an hour ago. She didn't know I was having back ache and stomach ache, and actually I don't normally have it it's the first time. So I'm there, writhing and gasping in pain for three hours. She doesn't say a word. I didn't really think much of it, honestly. I didn't need help, and all that. But then as the hour kept going I finally texted my dad about it. And then it hit me. I didn't particularly care or see anything wrong about her saying nothing. But then I realized if it had been her writihing in pain and saying it hurts it hurts for three hours I DEFINITELY would have asked her what's wrong. Not only that, I would have called our dad myself. And then I started to cry, because honestly, and this isn't me being up in my feelings because I'm in pain but I've known this a long time- no one in this family likes me. And then I wondered if I deserved it. I'm irresponsible and I'm scattered, but even with that I still wondered if it meant I deserved not to even be worth being concerned over when I'm in obvious physical pain. There was no one I felt comfortable to talk to about it. I didn't know anyone I trusted enough to be so vulnerable about something like this. So here I am. There's no right or wrong answer I think, the truth is sometimes it is what it is. I don't want to pity myself given how privileged I am in life compared to other people. But it bothered me. I don't feel I have the right to expect empathy from anyone, and it's mostly because I view empathy to be very touch and go. But personally it hurt, to know not many people care about you and to wonder if I deserved it.",2022-08-19 14:36:07,lonely,t5_2qjny,1648108810,2,/r/lonely/comments/wsflrf/im_in_extreme_physical_pain/,,0,5,I'm in extreme physical pain

My only social letout is LinkedIn, e-mail, and random YouTube arguments.

It’s sad. It is crushing.

I love my family to death and back. I love the people to hate me to the furthest star and back. I literally gave a homeless man my shoes off my feet. Yet I am alone.


I wish things were different. If I were better looking I wouldn’t be in this situation. I’d be happier, have more confidence. No, I’m not an incel. I hold no hate for women or anyone. Nor do I think I deserve a hot lady lol.


I just wish I could be happy and have a friend. One friend. I could buy them lunch. Talk about music. Argue about food. Workout with. Even speak to once a week. 

I’m getting plastic surgery to help improve my looks. But I know my problems are deeper than looks.


Getting off track.

I just wish I could have someone. Someone to share myself with. Commit to. Someone to love. Romantically or platonically.

3680,wsm0q0,RogueAngel9,"41y/m ... I know a lot of posters on here are in their teens/20s, but wondering if anyone a bit older has experienced this overwhelming boredom with the conversations/interactions you have at this stage in your life.  I bought a home in suburbia, mostly because it's a much better situation for my kids than our previous, more urban lifestyle.  But my conversations, particularly during the pandemic, with other adults have mostly been with neighbors who constantly bounce between two topics: Real estate/home improvement projects and their kids.  I feel as though even friends I've had for a long time, who were capable of deep and intellectually engaging conversations years ago, lack the capacity to discuss anything meaningful anymore.  Even my wife, who I love, has fallen into this tedium.  

Maybe the problem is me (I have considered it).  My full-time job is remote/from home, so I no longer get much human interaction, but even when I did it was a lot of ""how about that weather?"" type exchanges.

But it's online (not my choice) so it's still electronic, and I find myself increasingly thinking that they'll just sell out and be talking about their next home renovation project in 20 years too.

Without further adieu...

So it's been 12 years since I moved into this city I shall not name, and it's been a pretty lonely time here. I've had a supportive and loving family, with some friends here and there.

I've struggled making friends throughout elementary school, middle and high. It's also been hard after leaving the LDS church. During the lock-down years, things have changed a lot and during that time my mental health has declined. It's really hard making friends in a very religious area, especially after leaving the church and my orientations (pansexual &amp; demisexual furry). Lately I've felt more alone then ever, because I see other fursuiters/furries in videos or other social media with awesome friends, and it makes me feel extremely jealous. I've always wanted to have a furry friend in person that I can hang out with whenever I want and can, but I don't see that happening for a long time. I continue to get more depressed because I see everyone else happy except me.

You might ask ""why watch them if it only makes you sad?"" I don't know. I enjoy watching other furries on YouTube and other social media. I continue to crave some sort of friendship with someone who has similar interests, and is supportive of different orientations and fandoms. My family helps me some of the time, but no matter what they say or do, it will never be the same.

Family love is not the same as friendship love. I want to have friends who can be there and support me. I want to feel mattered by someone who isn't in my family. I don't know what I can do. I have plenty of ""friends"" online, but it isn't the same. It's not like I can physically hug them or anything...",2022-08-19 23:28:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644485324,1,/r/lonely/comments/wss7z8/lonely_in_my_neighborhood/,,0,1,Lonely in my neighborhood.

I've been single for over a year and still heartbroken.
I'm normally content in my loneliness. I do a lot alone and soon will be traveling alone which I'm used to.

But lately I feel that cruel sting in my chest. I recently have been reflect on my life and I think that's triggered me. Seeing online people get engaged and fett their dream jobs and starring families and about 4 hours ago I was huddled under my weighted blanket, hugging my stuffed rabbit and crying while trying to sooth my inner child at 8pm on a Fri night.

I still miss my ex dearly. Even though its been over a year since we broke up. I still miss hanging out, laughing, I miss him.

But yeah I'm normal content with my loneliness, just ignore it but it's been bumming me out lately.

3742,wstt30,[deleted],"For a lot of bad shit in my life, I know how to act on them for the most part (obviously, acting upon the solutions are entirely different story, but it’s not hopeless). However, one thing still bugs me, and that’s my social prospects. For some context, I’m a US military brat (with an immigrant parent to boot); some brats may be able to adapt to making friends quickly, but this never happened for me (and when I do make friends along the way, they eventually drop out of my life because I struggle to maintain contact…commitment issues). But yeah, moving around a lot in my life has definitely screwed some things up in my head. At this point I find it extremely difficult to socialize with my peers with civilian upbringings (I’m still in high school). Fashion sense, music taste, humor, all of it seems to elude me there. My love for blues music doesn’t help me….I also don’t have social media aside from Reddit and YouTube which doesn’t help, but again I’m so out of the loop. On top of that, I currently go to a boarding school and didn’t keep up with any of my acquaintances over the summer, and obviously I don’t know anyone where I currently live (I’ve been nearly devoid of human contact this summer). To be frank, at my boarding school the closest people I have to “friends” are alt type and (often) queer kids. Thing is, I am so different from them it’s ridiculous (often more formal dress, buzz cut, fairly sporty, cis het, etc.) and I 100% stick out. However, they are deviant enough from the popular to be more accepting of me, and it’s one of the few places where I can make any semblance of connection. But I don’t jive with y’all when I say I am one fat ol thumb sticking out with them (again, that’s me with pretty much everyone tho lmao). My biggest problems lie in my utter shit ability to make conversation and my lack of understanding of gen Z humor. At this point I’m wondering if I’m better off isolating myself more and reversing my course of hanging near people I don’t fit in with; feeling lonely in a crowd is more painful than feeling lonely alone, if y’all catch my drift. Or, alternatively, and a big question: will I need to put up a false front for the rest of my life to have a social life? Is it worth sticking to what I genuinely enjoy, or should I adopt tastes I don’t like just so I can fit in? Is fakin it till you make it the norm for everyone with friends, and have I just been blind to this for most of my life? I’m at the crossroads with this….Right now I’m just hoping it becomes easier when I get to college next year :( sorry for the long message y’all",2022-08-20 00:44:08,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/wstt30/ruff_times/,,0,9,Ruff times

3750,wsvb99,Inevitable_Lie1419,"Its hard to come to grips with being alone. The man I have always loved and have given all I can to him loves another and I am still alone. I had a history of dating abusive men. But I've been alone the past 7 years. I feel nervous when I think about committing to another person. Everyone I let in let's me down. Maybe I nag too much or I'm not pretty enough. I just wish instead of being abusive or cheating in the end they would have left. It's hard to trust now and I still feel like it's all always been my fault. Sometimes I cry at night because I've always been so afraid to be alone and I don't want to die this way but I feel like this is how it will happen. No one has had even any remote interest in me in these 7 years. Just people that want to hook up and leave. I've never been into hook up culture so I never went with it. I keep trying to tell myself try and make yourself happy and loneliness will either go away or become more tolerable but it feels like a wall. 


I'm in therapy and group therapy. I'm just to be happy with myself but I've done therapy before, during and after my relationships. Admittedly, many things have gotten better or I've learned to handle things better. But over all, many more things haven't gotten better and I still feel like I'm at the beginning...

I'm just so scared and so tired. I don't want to be alone, but I'm facing the reality I might be. Idk how to accept that or if I even make it more tolerable. I've been trying, for years....my progress is so slow I might be at my end by the time I've learned how to be less disheartened by loneliness. 

I wish, I wish I felt like this life was worth all this heart ache. I don't want to feel this emptiness. I don't care about sex, it's a plus but I just want someone around. Someone to literally just ask me how my day was.

She said she felt comfortable with me and that she could have deep, intimate conversations with me, that she couldn't have with her boyfriend. We ended up going out a couple times, had pizza together and just sat and talked on the bleachers next to my old school for 4 hours. She'd call me late at night sometimes and talk to me until the sun had come up. There is more that happened but I just don't understand, I thought we had a connection and it turned out to be nothing. Once she moved into her college dorm, I barely heard anything from her. No more texts, no more calls. I've recently had to stop talking to her, distancing myself because it hurts me a lot to not hear from her anymore.

3778,wsy876,Illustrious-Side-515,"You won't see me arguing in favor of being social or ""working up on yourself"" or any of that. However I'm very self aware and I like to describe things as I perceive them, it serves as an autobiographical ego stroking too. 

One of the main things I have noticed when comparing myself to friend-having peoples is that I don't have any project or long term plan ever. I don't have any career or academic goals, hell I'm rarely ever sure whether I will go to the office tomorrow or stay home. I never look ahead to anything, ever.

And the past isn't all that great either, I often avoid to look back as much as possible for fear of embarrassement, I have a lot of painfully embarrassing memories.

Thankfully not having many life experiences makes it so you barely remember anything about your past. My mom is mad because I don't remember a single thing about the many vacations we supposedly took when I was a kid. I also don't remember much of what happened between middle school and the end of hs, except for certain important events.

Not having any interest in the future and nothing noteworthy to say about your past makes it even harder to communicate and befriend people. A lack of shared experience and reality makes it a real challenge to befriend new people. 

Let's talk about cultural reality as a friendless person because it is an interesting very recent phenomenon almost no one is talking about. 

I don't have any cultural past since my mother is completely disconnected from our extended family and my father just wasn't a father. 

I also was completely disconnected from cultural reality since I had nothing in common with my more privileged classmates and my mother did her best to keep me apart from what she described as ""ill mannered poor children"". 

I grew up not knowing anything about local customs, slang, music, pop culture or anything really. I would be culturaly illiterate if it wasn't for the internet.

This is the point that is most interesting to me and that nobody talks about: basically I discovered and grew accustomed to a culture that had nothing to do with my physical reality thanks to the internet.

This is one of my favorite topics to talk about because it's such a new phenomenon, in the past if you became secluded you simply didn't know about anything going around you and you either didn't care or had someone tell you.

For example, I wasnt listening to any kind of music my peers would listen when I was 14. My favorite artist was an obscure 30-something texan electronic music producer while the kids were just listening to Eminem and local musicians. I'm not even american but by the time I was 14 I could tell you where to find New Orleans on the map, yet I'm still not sure where a few of the major cities in my country are (I don't travel).

I was reading russian authors as a teen, yet only just recently began reading authors from my country, listening to music in my mother language, and all of this without ever having left the country. 

I learned to speak english almost completely on my own with access to the internet, English eventually replaced my mother language inside my head and eventually became my main mode of communication because all of the few people I ""talked to"" (through text) spoke english.

You can see how that will do irreparable damage to your ability to relate to peers, and to an extent I believe it had a part in my deterioration in ability for verbal communication: I read and wrote more than I spoke, thus the parts of my brain dedicated to speech shrunk and my reading and writing only got better.

Now, I'm seeing my niece , who struggles with socialization and has few friends, talk about Korean music, culture, food and customs almost as if she had seen them and experienced them first hand, but she knows NOTHING (even less than me when I was her age) about even the most basic things of our country.

I recently heard a podcast talk briefly talk about this phenomenon of more and more children becoming completely culturally detached, not just simply becoming ""americanized"" anymore, but also immersing into cultures so far removed from them they realistically have no chance of ever experiencing first hand, and becoming completely alien to the real world in the process.

So... Back on the topic of being firendless, as I said I had nothing in common with most people for years until recently and even then, my life experiences and opinions are so distantly removed that I quickly run out of things to say in small talk, and this is not something I think of as a problem anymore.

One good thing about this though, is that you now have a much different perspective, and thus allows you to catch a glimpse of things that nobody can see. 

Some doors open, and others close. 

I dedicated myself to learning things nobody else was doing, because only a friendless loser would want or have the time to do, and accidentally stumbled myself into the holding positions I would not have been able to if I my upbringing was too influenced by close peers, or a father. 

Every evolutive jump begins through a rare genetic mutation that would be considered abnormal and perhaps even a birth defect, but becomes advantageous in a different environment. 

Another thing I wanted to say is that friendlessness is a feedback loop, where you try to make friends but once they notice you don't have any they think something must be wrong with you or you are weird and they leave. 

This becomes so common that you get used to it and think nothing of it. 

You may be behaving in off putting ways without noticing, simply because no one has ever told you that you are acting weird.

Another thing that happens is for example, you do things on the assumption that nobody wants anything to do with you, thus you eat alone, go to the park alone, live alone and etc. It never crosses your mind to call up someone among your contacts, perhaps have a drink or something of the sort. Nope. This isn't normal, not something we do here. Then again, I have not and no longer have the intention to share the privacy of my personal time with anyone else but it's something that happens.

And on the topic of relationships, particularly with women all I have to say is: 🦗

The last thing is, loneliness, at least in my case is much different from what I think friend-having normals experience.

The feeling of ""melancholy"" that comes from not having anyone to share pains or joys isn't anything like it used to be. It's more like regular melancholy now, the one kind that you can almost enjoy while listening to a good Playlist and watch a video about leaves falling in autumn.

It's the boring apathy that gnaws harder than anything, I often find myself with nothing to do and that's much more harsher. Not wanting to do anything, not feeling like having any fun and unrest. It's shit. It makes me want to make long stupid useless posts like this.

I miss the hugs, the kisses, and the laughter.

The only things that make me feel better for even a moment are baseball and hanging out with my friends but this weekend y’know what I’m doing? I’m taking my ass to dicks sporting goods and I’m getting a new bat cause my wooden bat so old it looks like babe Ruth used it snapped in half. All my friends are busy and Sunday I’m doing jack shit, just staying home probably gonna cry.

But the worst part is, the one friend I know I can tell about this comes directly from Cuba. He doesn’t speak a lick of English so unless I feel like teaching a ESL class I just gotta sit here with it. Some nights it feels so bad I honestly think I’m going insane sometimes like I’m legitimately contemplating drinking till I can’t feel anymore or going to Walmart so I can deep fry every cell in my mouth with some shitty cigar.

3818,wt3b5f,shadowlarvitar,"It's really depressing finding out that your greatest fear is true, I asked in a certain advice thing earlier this week as I was tired of not getting responses on my dating profiles. I know that 'inexperience in women' is something that men find attractive as I've overheard men say this before(I find it attractive myself tbh) but I never hear about love for inexperienced men such as myself.

Everyone was just being rude and complete jerks. ""Nobody wants to date an inexperienced 28 year old, they'll think there's something wrong with you. Why is he still single?"" And crap like that. Maybe it's because I literally told you that I'm shy and was bullied at both home/school so I didn't have much confidence? I honestly didn't care about being single for the past decade, there were a few times where I wanted a girl... but I quickly went back to my daily routine and never 'tried'.

But obviously my asperger's and social anxiety holds me back from approaching random women, especially in this day and age where you could be accused of harassment or somebody might think you're a creep. I don't want to bother women, I just want to find love. So I joined apps as it's always been easier for me to introduce myself and befriend people online... but people don't typically respond to messages you send out and all my matches are bots/Only Fans people. :/

It really feels like people are right and that I'm gonna die alone... I just want to curl up and cry, I want experience but it feels like nobody is willing to give me a chance. And I don't want to pay for experience, I want my first time to be special. My first kiss to not be with an escort...

3826,wt54u6,Rymus_,"Hey, im from germany and 21(m). I have really no idea where to start this, but I can't keep this any longer for myself. (Sorry if I have some typos or grammar mistakes)

I've been Single for around 6 years, and don't really have friends near me for 4 years. It is not because something bad happend, it's just that everyone got busy with their jobs, hobbies or other stuff.

Due to the pandemic, I haven't really seen anyone from my friends (Overseas or same country but just like 10 hours away - those are the only ones I have) for almost 4 whole years now. I want to talk to one. Someone to have close me. 

I do have a family, but I don't want to tell them since I don't want them to make worry about me. I feel like im not worth it for them to worry about. And also, on some strict family members, I fear they wouldn't take me serious either.

If I look back, the last deep or long, serious conversation I had was just 3 years ago when I talked to a buddy over Discord.

I do have free time and I want to learn more people near me. I just don't know how. I feel like i forgot how to make friends. 

My deepest wish is just to get a loving girlfriend. Really don't care how she would look like, but just a caring one, knowing I have someone who is always by my side and loves me as much as I love her.

I even get often to hear ""you're such a nice guy. I don't understand why you don't have a girlfriend"".

Don't get me wrong, I truely don't wanna pity myself here. Im just confused on what to do. I know I can act weird due to my ADHD when I forget to mask or seem unmotivated due to my Depression. Even after my vacation I just had, I felt not really a relief or something relax. My vacation felt more like a task to be more functional on work again.

I do have a job myself, but its homeoffice and don't really go out due to this. I have no idea what to do. I can't say my situation is bad, but I don't really have anyone by now i can talk to when I just feel shit. I also wish i were more needed by others, so I can listen to them. Especially IRL too...

I just have no idea by now. Clubs? I doubt to get good friends from there. I am also not a party guy. More like the ""5 people meeting and drinking"" guy.

3852,wtavum,AchuRaichu42,"Sorry if this post is long as hell.

Back in August 2021, I suffered the worst mental breakdown of my life. In the first week of August, I crushed my hand at work resulting in a visit to the Emergency Room then when I got back, despite being on modified duties, I was put to work. I was doing double the workload and was done for as I couldn't take another day of it. I broke down on the job shouting in my boss's office, ""THIS IS NOT NORMAL"".  The boss told me to take a week off paid to take care of myself. Not willing to telling the news to family, I kept silent until they confronted and demanded to say why I was on paid leave. They assumed I got into a fight with someone. I nearly ended it all in front of them after they wouldn't stop asking. They finally stopped after and let me have space and I had to begin the process of recovering from worst meltdown of my life. As I wanted to gain back some control, I was (still am) active in rock climbing and bouldering and was able to put my mind into work. Another thought I had for the last year was to get back into school. I applied in November and was waitlisted. I considered defeat and just felt disappointed in myself. I was still miserable. December comes along and I got an offer from school and for the first time since, I felt like I achieved something. But I had another wake-up call just two days before the new year. I got to the gym at 6:20AM and saw a Facebook post that a former colleague was going to end his own life after that post. I panicked and felt helpless. I didn't know what to do. An hour into my climb, I got the news anyone could ask for, he survived. He's doing better now and I always tell him if he needs a friend or shoulder to cry on, I'm here. This woke me up and helped me change. Only for another near tragedy to struck me and my family as I still didn't completely learn from it.

2022 comes along and into the new year, the school I applied to offers me a second offer of the program I wanted. I felt like I won the lottery. I quit smoking cigarettes in the second week of January. I also decided that 2022 would be the year where I would transform myself. I suffered from body dysmorphya and low self-esteem for all my life. To add to the climbing, I begun working out and started to appreciate and love myself. However, things will still not great. I still had a sour relationship with my family and was very much isolated from friends. It caught up to me in May with my sour relationship with my parents. This was the worst 24 hours of my life not knowing the fate of my father. I finally got to the hospital and he told me he tried to end it all due to the hostility of home, lack of work and other things. I told him to start all over, he be the father and I be the son. We began rebuilding our relationship and are now father and son again. I was selfish. I traumatized him for 10 years as I was really unstable a teen and busy working on myself yet I didn't account for my family's mental health. We had to work together and help each other out to survive. I quit drinking soon after and am now over two months sober. I dealt with school and tuition and am in the process of transitioning from working full-time to being a full-time student. I got part-time job lined for after and my father is doing really well. He's got work, less stress and me and him are civil around each other. In July, I got a tattoo on my wrist of a semi-colon as a reminder of the shit I gone through in the last twelve months. I don't think about it so often anymore knowing what I have at stake with my future and family. But what brings me down is the loneliness and isolation.

After surviving several breakdowns and bad thoughts in the last year, while I am doing better and transformed, the isolation is bringing me down. I never had a serious relationship and haven't many friends even I was a kid (I'm 24 btw.) My friends are aware of what I gone through yet everyone ignores me when I want to hang out or just talk. Also, my friends are working out of town so I understand that it can be hard to schedule even if they wanted to. But those who are still here in my city who I offer to hang out with ignore me, make up excuses and just don't want me to be around them. Yet I find see posts on social media of them going out with friends and acquaintances I know. They don't want me around. If I fucked up, tell me why, I rather face the music so I can resolve to keep the friendship alive but don't leave me ignored or marked as read. I suppose after what I gone though in the last twelve months, no one wants to be around a downer or someone who is constantly in survival mode. I still have a couple other friends in the city, but only see them once every few months due to scheduling. Other than my family, the most time I ever talk to anyone is at work but it's just small talk or work related. I really hope I can make friends at my new school and my new part-time job and just be outgoing again so I can feel a sense of joy and happiness in the world I endured this living hell. Till then, I'm staying busy to keep myself distracted from the one thing that is eating me alive with being active and other interests. I've gone this far, I don't want to give up what I've done for me and my family but lack of friendships and sense of belonging eats me alive.",2022-08-20 16:14:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1624418769,2,/r/lonely/comments/wtavum/got_my_life_back_on_track_yet_the_isolation_is/,,0,4,"Got My Life Back on Track, Yet the Isolation Is Eating Me Alive.

3879,wtexp1,LostSouluk2021,"Purpose is everything, especially as long term sufferers in life. The problem is we get entangled in the spiders web of endless rejection, seeking validation from others. I don't deal with uncertainty well at all but as a loner uncertainty is inevitable because it feels like there's no escape from this bottomless pit of despair. It feels like we're gonna go through life without having a significant other and that is fuckin soul destroying because it's the only gateway to becoming a parent and having love in life.  


Purpose also relates to wellbeing which is attributed to social status and financial security. The last few weeks I've been pissed about in my career, I failed an interview and then was messed around with a proposed job offer elsewhere. They offered me a job then took weeks to get back to me then I was told to meet them at 2'o clock on Thursday but it happened to be closed. All this shit on top of depression is enough to make you lose the will to live. Those who are pre-disposed to stress in life will suffer the most, as a loner that's almost a given.

I used to have 2 really close friends but looking back even when I was talkative and wasn’t so shy I still had a difficult time maintaining friendships. I don’t think any of the friends I’ve had in my childhood lasted more than maybe a year or so. I would get invited to parties occasionally and get invited to hangout inside of school but that’s it. In middle school I told myself I would start to change and become more social again, but it never happened. Suddenly, my social anxiety got worse and it got to a point where I couldn’t even eat lunch in the cafeteria by myself so I would just go to the library or if the library was closed I’d hide in the bathroom stall for half the lunch period. I’ve noticed that when people find out I’m a loner or don’t really have that many friends they seem to be drawn away from me and start treating me differently and that gives me the signal that it’s probably best not to try becoming friends with them at that point. I haven’t really found anyone in my classes I could connect with, most of my free time spent outside of school is reading, watching videos, scrolling through my phone and feeling sorry for myself. I’m so tired of it at this point. I want to make friends, I want to change, but I don’t know where to start. I can’t find anyone who seems interesting enough to get to know and nobody else seems interested in getting to know me. 

I feel invisible, as if nobody ever notices or even cares about me while at the same time I have this fear that everyone is judging my every action and word that comes out of my mouth. I don’t understand these feelings myself. I want people to notice me I want people to like me but at the same time I don’t want to take risks to put myself out there and go completely out of my comfort zone. I’ve tried joining in or adding to other peoples conversations but that never really goes anywhere. I think in terms of academics things have been going okay for me. I got a 3.8 GPA in my freshman year and now I’m taking some honors classes in hopes that my somewhat good grades will make up for my lack of extracurricular activities I have. I’m not sure tbh. I know that high school will end eventually and that it’s not a huge deal whether or not I have friends in the next few years when everyone graduates, but I was hoping I’d make at least one friend by now. I was hoping I’d get out of my shell and start being outgoing but that’s never really happened. I still lie to my parents about having friends because they will either be overly concerned or angry at me and I can’t deal with either of those things right now. I don’t know what to do. This is all I ever think about, how I’m going to get through high school when I’m socially anxious and haven’t had friends for the past several years, and I just want things to change.",2022-08-20 20:13:20,lonely,t5_2qjny,1622908782,9,/r/lonely/comments/wtgbux/15f_im_in_10th_grade_and_havent_made_any_friends/,,0,7,"(15F) I’m in 10th grade, and haven’t made any friends for the past 5 years.

Last year it was nothing but families, friends, and couples. I don't belong in society and the new therapist isn't helping. She said the same things the others said. It's not negative self-talk if it's only what you know. If you have been called a piece of crap your whole life and you call yourself a piece of crap, it's not negative self-talk. It's reality. I guess there is nowhere to turn. The person who said the only thing I could do is find fulfillment in other areas of life since love is off the table is right. If I had friends I would be there with them having fun. You can hear the music and people have lots of fun but those are normal people, not me. I'm not sick anymore but mentally I'm worse and I had to look forward to some person who thinks I got negative reactions because I put things wrong. That is true because I do struggle to tell people what I think without rambling but that is not what angered people. People will never accept that my only way out is to not exist. I'm not saying I'm going to do that but this festival is a great example of why I have nothing to live for. People can find fulfillment alone and I'm happy for them. I can't, and all my hobbies don't bring me joy anymore. There is no empathy because people think I blame other people instead of myself. There is only hatred. They are telling me, stop existing. You are a problem, stop existing. I wish I had the nerve.

We havent talked since last week, so few hours ago i decided to check up on her to see if everything is okay. As expected, she didnt say much to me. She gave me a short response which is ""im ok"" and thats it. Afterwards i tried asking why she isnt talking much, and she said ""things arent the same now and idk why."" I asked her to elaborate but she said ""no its fine."" Also normally she would also ask me questions too to check up on me, but this time she didnt.

I know for a fact that she's hiding things from me. I found this out when i was using my alt to stalk her social media platforms like her discord server (my main isnt there anymore so she doesnt know im there) and i see her sharing things about her school and personal life with her good friends and even her casual friends. I also know that she recently reconciled with her old friend and have been hanging out with him and his friends. 

I really dont know why she's avoiding me now. I have been looking at our old chats and im sure there wasnt anything i did to her was wrong or annoying. Literally the last convo we had before today was her telling me that im her closest friend. And 1 week before that she told me that she appreciates me a lot and trust me more than any of her friends because i helped her out with all her problems that day and made her feel so much better. Why would she be avoiding me now if she told me all of that last time?

I miss her so much but theres not much i can about it. Im sure this time she isnt interested in me anymore. The fact that she's even talking more to her casual friends than with me already proves this so.

3955,wtncef,cyanidenohappiness," 

For 18 years I have been single and the one girl who I thought genuinely liked me took advantage of me and nearly ruined my life. My current girlfriend is my second as my first girlfriend cheated on me. I was really used to the feeling of loneliness and thought of not having a genuine connection, but my current is very understanding of my situation. She does a lot and makes an effort to see me everyday (we live 5 minutes walking distance). On the days we are busy, I feel completely fine not being with her, but when we have plans but they suddenly get cancelled, it kinda hits me like a truck. I feel lonely and have zero motivation throughout the day, but I don't wanna tell her cause I don't think its fair to her. My friends are usually busy when my gf and I have plans and I am home alone 95% of the time, so I just stay home and tend to my dog. I thought when I got into a stable and healthy relationship, I wouldn't need to feel lonely, but here I am in the dark typing this.

Am I not looking at things properly or is okay to feel like this?",2022-08-21 01:42:01,lonely,t5_2qjny,1541641885,1,/r/lonely/comments/wtncef/is_it_okay_for_me_to_still_feel_lonely_even_with/,,0,3,Is it okay for me to still feel lonely even with a girlfriend?

3996,wtr9cg,anorak92,"Hi I'm a guy in highschool and I was wondering if anyone felt a similar way that I do.

Ever since the pandemic and a quarantine coinciding with a lot of my important social developmental years I've developed a habit at night where I'll lay down a not go to sleep for a while, kind of drifting kind of not. After a while I'll start to cry (not sobbing, just tears will come out) as I hold my pillow and think about someone I like.  It's always a real physical person too. Even if I don't know them all that well, they'll just manage to seep into my mind and almost automatically I'll start manufacturing romantic moments with them.  I feel disgusted with myself when I think about it, as if I'm violating the idea of that person to me, forever tying them to my idyllic fantasies of 'love'. It'll sometimes creep into my days as well, where I'll be in class and see a person and all I can think about is me and them together. There've been full occasions where I'll get so sucked into a fantasy I'll start to believe it. A friend of mine was once called out of class where the teacher was talking to them and I genuinely started to believe that they were out there confessing their love to me in front of the teacher. It made no sense but it didn't matter. I wanted to believe, so I did.

It's a physical fantasy but not a sexual one or at least, not necessarily.  I attach a warmth to it I guess. A person is like a blanket at night and without one I'm just cold and shivering. I have friends, hell I've had girlfriends but I've never not felt this way. I don't even know what I want really, or why I want it. I'm not sure what about another person's touch makes me feel so goddamn ""warm"" or what that even means.

I don't know, maybe this is all normal and I'm just overthinking and over analyzing it. But I really hate this feeling, I have goals and aspirations and a community and this just keeps dragging me down night after night. I'll lay down, cry, think intimately about someone that doesn't like me and then fall asleep.  It doesn't help I feel a lot of shame for it, they didn't ask to be a subject of love in my fantasies but yet they are anyways. It's like committing a crime that implicates everyone, I can't tell anyone because it can apply to everyone.

Is this weird? Am I weird? I don't know.",2022-08-21 05:09:56,lonely,t5_2qjny,1524426977,2,/r/lonely/comments/wtr9cg/prolonged_physical_loneliness/,,0,1,Prolonged physical loneliness?

Every person I’ll ever meet will abandon me eventually and that’s always what will happen regardless of what they say.

That isn’t me anymore. Love doesn’t exist. I know nothing of it nor expect it from anyone. I neither show nor feel anything towards anyone. No hate. No sorrow. No love nor resentment nor obsession nor anger.

4031,wtv27w,Ok_Task_5592,"So I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this, but I figured I'd post it here because it is along the subject of lonliness, and I just need help understanding this. 

I had this friend that I wasn't close with, but we'd check up on each other once every two months or so and it had been that way for a few years. But 2 years ago I decided to tell my friend that I had a crush on them. They said that they felt the same way but that they weren't looking for a relationship. 
So I thought ""okay, so we're going to go back to being distant friends again like before."" 
However they started contacting me a lot more often. 
Sometimes they'd contact me everyday and then would just randomly leave for a week before talking to me again like nothing happened. We'd flirt quite a lot too. 

Anyways they'd stop doing that thing where they'd randomly leave for a week after a few months lol. And we basically ended up being fwb for ages. Honestly, I'm not sure why... But it was messing with my head and still is. Logically speaking I should be fine with it. But I guess because I still liked him (perhaps even more at this point), it just felt weird to do that, flirt with each other and then act like good mates. Maybe it was just confusing to me how all of this happened and we became closer as friends after I expressed my feelings towards him. Makes me feel quite lonely and depressed too. As of recent, our friendship is kind of not as close and trustworthy as it used to be, but the sexual side of it is still very present since we're still attracted to each other. 

I've tried confronting him about these feelings but he doesn't care. I've tried distancing myself, but because both of us have admitted to each other a few times that we are important in each others lives and contact each other the most out of all of our friends, I can't let him go. Which again ties into the whole lonliness thing as well. 

This whole thing just doesn't make sense to me and I don't know why. I'm confused about the fact I'm confused aha. I get why in some friendship groups, ppl talk about things like this to try and make sense of it. Ig that's what this post is.

It’s never a good time to bring up depressing thoughts when you’re not even close with that person. I don’t want to be judged. Plus I have a real problem with not getting past things that have happened to me. It’s like a loop that keeps me inside myself. As im getting older im getting weaker at fighting it, my coping mechanisms are smoking weed and drinking alcohol. I’ve been off work for a few weeks due to mental health.

I have a great gf I've been dating for almost a year, and her friends are all great people, but when I'm with them, especially when they be talking about stuff they lived before they knew me, or their common hobbies, or just random gossiping about whomever, I feel estranged, even though they all like me and think I'm a cool guy.

It scares me a bit because me feeling that way bothers my gf, and I'm a bit worried that one day she'll just run out of patience and leave me because of that. Her and her friends did a lot to make me feel accepted in their group, I can't ask them for more, but i just feel like I don't belong. I'm scared it negatively affects my relationship with my gf and in the long run, other relationships I'll have with people in the future. Started feeling this way when I was 15.

I tried to talk to people about it, but no one seems to understand, not even other guys, which further enhances that feeling.

I’m tired of calling an old friend to catch up on life only to end up in a three hour conversation with a Joe Rogan Bro about how men can’t be men anymore and COVID is a hoax. for one wtf happened to all the logic? Where it be? 
What’s up with the re-normalization of blatant racism and sexism? Why is it then my obligation to explain what has very much already been explained in many ways and contexts?
There’s so much radicalization I can’t seem to have a conversation with someone who isn’t effected. 

I’m tired of family dinner every week being a political debate platform. And I know I can’t be alone in that one.

 “hi” has been replaced with a filibuster of opinionated bullshit and very few people seem to actually be interested in a simple, shared human interaction.  Even fewer consider or care about the long term consequences of perpetuating this radicalization. 

it’s also NOT effective critical thinking. It’s confirmation bias and closed minds across the fucking board. Everyone is an expert in everything (in their eyes) based on media. As a scientist that’s infuriating on a whole other level.

Why are we isolating ourselves with opinions?  No one wants every interaction they have with someone to be an argument or debate. This has been getting worse and worse over the last 10 years and I truly think it is diminishing the ability for humans to connect with one another and move forward with some plan for cultural equality or community.

* Very few friends, never had any close connections
* Reliant on existing friends to introduce people to me
* Always went home kicking myself for being too shy to say 'hi' to someone I thought was cute

A bit about current me:

* Still a big geek/nerd (lol), able to express it proudly - easiest way to meet new friends!
* REALLY like meeting new people (especially girls!), starting conversations is always a fun challenge
* Much larger social circle, several really close friendships
* No longer reliant on existing friends to meet new people

4075,wu1kwk,realshmichael,"Ladies, I can't speak to your side of using Tinder, so I apologize that I can't provide any insight.

MEN! DO NOT GAUGE YOUR SELF-WORTH OFF OF TINDER. I would honestly stop using it altogether and try other apps like Hinge or a paid service, where much more effort is required to make a profile, and your interest in someone can immediately be broadcast.

Here's why Tinder will destroy you, as a man...

1. **At it's best, Tinder is like 75% men and 25% women (3:1). At it's worst, it's more like 90% men and 10% women (9:1). These are their reported numbers, honestly some places are probably 20:1.**

 What this means is that women get a lot more attention on Tinder than men do. Unless you are at the top of the stack when they start swiping (more on this in a bit), it is unlikely they will ever even see your profile because of all the matches they will be getting right away. So you think that nobody likes you 'cause you aren't getting matches, but in actuality they aren't even seeing your profile.

 I was on a Tinder date with a woman who had paid for Tinder and could see all her likes. She showed me, and it was ***multiple thousands*** of men. Basically every time she swiped right, it was a match. So of course after a few matches she is going to stop swiping, and ultimately not get to any of those other men.

--

2. **Tinder uses algorithms, just like YouTube and Google**

 What this means is that there are a relatively few men who have great profiles (handsome, exciting photos, well-written profile) who will be matching with a lot of women, and then most men will once again be too far down in the pile to be seen. The algorithm works by boosting profiles that get more likes and more matches, which again means that women are not swiping deep enough into the stack to even see your profile.

 You might have noticed that you get a bunch of likes (or even matches) very quickly when you make a new account, but then they stop coming in. This is because they put your new profile at the top of the stack so that you get those first few hits and then keep chasing that dopamine hit. They are gamifying it for you.

 If you are lonely or have social anxiety, it probably means you don't have a bunch of group photos, exciting photos, dapper suit photos, whatever. So your profile is already at a disadvantage compared to those other ones. It has nothing to do with you, and just how the app works.

--

3. **There are MANY bots, fake accounts, and women gaming the system**

 Another thing you will come across is accounts that you match with, but then they never talk to you. These are very commonly bots just trying to get you to follow their OF or IG accounts. Or, it's women who know that more matches puts their profile up higher, so they match with everyone that they can just to boost their algorithm score, but never intend on talking with anyone.

 Also, I have heard and read many times that Tinder has fake/bot accounts that will match with you and chat for a little, and then just ghost you. They do this to give you some hope that you'll get more matches, so you stay on their platform longer. These are obviously unsubstantiated, but I wouldn't doubt it.

--

4. **The only way to improve your chances is to pay**

 And they already know this.

 Look, if you absolutely insist on using Tinder but are having bad luck, then you 100% have to pay to the top-tier subscription. What this does is when you swipe right on someone, it puts you higher up in their stack and gives you a fighting chance to be seen before they stop swiping. It used to work really well - like the difference between one match every couple weeks to 10 matches a day - but the last time I tried paying it didn't work nearly as well, so maybe too many guys are paying or they have changed how it works.

 Super Likes don't work. You can use them if you want, but I absolutely would never pay for them. Most women I've talked to find them a little awkward, like ""why is this guy that I've never met so interested in me?""

-----

I'm sure I could talk more about it, but I just wanted to inform some of you who didn't know how Tinder works. I've known MANY men who jump on it for a couple months and ended up deleting it with completely shattered self worth. BUT IT WASN'T THEM! IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT! Tinder sucks, period.

It’s honesty to the point where if I didn’t try and make an effort, I’d be completely forgotten by the world.

It’s so tiring when I see other people just living lives like normal people. Everything falls into place for them. They set a time and a place and just be there.

It also hurts to think people are actually willing to see others without it being some sort of chore. Because with me, I’ve always been the last option or a backup. It’s never just been a spontaneous idea. It’s always been a planned one.

I’ve even had times where people have said “well if this doesn’t work out, I’ll come to you later”. Which basically implies I am everybody’s plan B. Just waiting for them.

There’s literally nothing wrong with me. Apart from the fact I’m not attractive. It’s almost like people are afraid to be seen with me because I’ll bring their aesthetic image down.

4083,wu2qov,lobsteru57,"
I am a 20-year-old girl and I have a big problem: I am obsessed with love to also very unlucky. I am a girl who is considered pretty, I don't see myself as such, but I often attract the attention of men because of it. And I have a strong problem with my physical appearance, because I use it to get other people's love, but I don't succeed in it. I am not a superficial person, on the contrary; yet my physical appearance is obsessing me to the point of blaming it all my love failures, then incurring eating issues such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. I desperately need love; for my age I have known too many men. I happened to count them recently and in these 20 years I've had about 30 romantic affairs, I can't even understand how. it's as if my life was totally centered on that, and that romantic happiness was the only aspect I care about now. I've always been interested in study, particularly literature, writing. I played sports, I played music, I did many things. Now I am reduced to nothing, in the grip of very intense depressive periods and aimless wandering. My question, however, is a different one, because the difficulties I am trying to cope with through psychotherapy, and also by taking antidepressants. My questions are many… Why do men like me, maybe even too much, but no one settles down with me? Why is it that every time a story starts I have to find myself disillusioned, disappointed? Why do I now have no faith in love, and believe for me that it will not come? Why have I not been able to have a stable relationship for five years? Why is it that every time I really like someone disappoints me? Why is it that every time someone loves me I don't really like them? Will I be reduced to accepting a relationship that I don't really want? Will I be miserable? 
I just feel a lot of pain, I would like to be loved and quiet for a while.

I would like to add that from men I have never had any kind of satisfaction. In my family there are no male figures, and my father can be said to have abandoned me.


TLDR: I'm a 20-year-old girl, I have a lot of difficulty finding a stable relationship. I think it is also due to my family history. How can I do this? How can I stop being obsessed with love?",2022-08-21 15:48:12,lonely,t5_2qjny,1654953724,11,/r/lonely/comments/wu2qov/feeling_lonely_everywhere_and_addicted_to_strong/,,0,9,feeling lonely everywhere and addicted to strong feelings

There was a point where I suddenly snapped out of it and realized how I've been removed from the rest of society and floating with the bubble communities. Just these random conversations I would have with people or moments that would snap me out.

And then I realized those communities I was in are people like me. Others who are alone. Mostly made up of the same people everyday. I started noticing all of the posts were by the same 50-100 people. And all of a sudden I realized what I was doing. And the more I started to put myself in other places, the more I realized I had secluded myself with this group of 50-100 people who were also social recluse like me. I had spent 5 years of my life in internet communities. Everyday. Every hour checking online. And I had spent the 5 years of my life with 50-100 people who I don't know if I even like. I had just convinced myself this was the community I was in. I don't know if this makes any sense but I'm having a jarring moment of reality shifting. I feel like I'm in a mental daze.

My entire childhood and teenage years were taken by my illness, and I wasn't able to experience a very healthy childhood experience. I didn't have friends, I couldn't attend school, ect ect. Now im at a place where my medication is stable and I can get on with my life, which im beyond grateful for, I never once thought I could ever get this stable, but this kind of comes with a lot of humiliation for me. I really would love to have friends my age, but at work and at school the only people close to my age are kids in high school or just out of it, and this is because everything that im doing right now, and the current level i am right now experiencing is things i should have been doing at that age. I'm 24, and right now I'm living the life of a highschool graduate. I can't find anyone my age to meet because everyone my age is finished with college, they've moved out and they're out in the world. all my friends i do have, which range for 24-27 are on their own, living independently, have graduated college and are getting married. I still live at home, I've accomplished two semesters of college, and the only relationships I've ever had were over the internet. I just feel like shit all the time, and to be honest my life embarrasses me. I've always had such high expectations for my future, and I worked so hard to get better, and I know for a fact if child me could meet me now, he would be so disappointed in what I've become and how little ive accomplished. I'm not going to give up, and I know i've come a long way and I know I should be proud of how hard I've worked and I'm not going to stop, but that doesn't stop me from being embarrassed and being depressed. I just feel like the most formative years of life were lost to my illness, and then my early 20's were completely lost to covid. I was 21 when the pandemic started and everything was put on hold, I couldn't even go to school if I wanted to or find any work, so 3 years were just sucked away and I'll never get those back.

I've been trying myself to put my self out there so I found this new app called Cizzr which is kinda a mesh of Twitter, Yik Yak, and Tinder all gobbled in to one app with a mental health twist.

It's pretty sick because you can filter posts and people by their location so you can meet and talk to people in your city instead of people only halfway across the world. There's anonymous posting available and you can even include an emotion per post and then filter by other people with the same emotion.

Highly recommend to make new friends near you and you can message directly on the app between different users. Let me know what yall think.

I wish it would all just stop. I miss him so much, he was my only brother, my biggest fan, my best friend and now he’s gone. I’m still shocked about it, him not being around because I’m so used to hearing his voice and him being the funny one.  Now it’s quiet almost all the time and that’s when the thoughts start coming in. I tried a lot to get my thoughts out but they keep coming back and I feel so horrible because I can’t even cry anymore even though I want to. I don’t know why but just knowing I have to continue on without him hurts and I don’t know what to do. I’m just a pathetic person I’m no good to anyone.

There have been a few triggering situations lately and I can’t stop thinking about what I know for sure: I have no friends, nobody gives a duck about me, everybody is more talented, more successful, more worthy of love than me. I refuse to talk to anyone about th es thoughts because rn I’m 100% convinced that they don’t care, don’t understand and also, I can’t talk to female friends right now because the sheer sight of another woman who’s prettier and skinnier than me would be enough to quit our friendship.

Those old colleagues I ran into the other day for the first time in a year when I attended the premiere of their own theater play? Obviously they didn’t want to grab a coffee or continue our friendship or ask me to join their new project. Obviously they asked another actress, although we had promised ach other to come up with something together. Of course they didn’t even tell me and I found out via instagram. I mean, I can’t blame them when I look into the mirror, I ain’t shit, my career is going nowhere. Of course they don’t want anything to do with a disgusting, fat, awkward loser like me. 

The thing is, I know all of this is false. It’s just my brain lacking serotonin and all of this will be over in one or two days. I know better than to believe this shit I make up on my head.

Two years ago I was the guy who would admit he made mistakes and wanted to do better. Now I'm the one who admits he makes mistakes and does better, but doesn't feel like it will be enough.

i am charming. i am friendly. i am personable. i am smart. i am handsome in the face, but fat enough to be approachable.

people gravitate towards me. i’m “magnetic” so they say. i’m “wise” they tell me. i want to believe them.

yet i am completely incapable of staying in contact with anyone unless i’m in love with them. i have also been single since 2012.

i can’t maintain a friendship or even a conversation for more than a few days.

i just… stop… responding. even when i want nothing more than to talk. even when i have something interesting to share. even when people let me know they want to talk i just can’t.

i was forced to be alone my entire childhood. i was not allowed to have friends. i never had a single guest in my home until i was in my 20s and living alone. i was abused in the myriad ways that they write human interest pieces about.

i was homeschooled and went to small fundamentalist christian schools until 8th grade. i never made a friend in any of them.

i watched kids in high school have social lives. i’ve seen friend groups who grew up and went on to build their families together.

i didn’t get any of that, and it’s too late to fix it.

my childhood was stolen from me and the cost has been my entire adult life.

i’m so fucking alone.",2022-08-21 23:55:18,lonely,t5_2qjny,,4,/r/lonely/comments/wue6hi/i_want_nothing_more_in_life_than_to_spend_it_with/,,0,1,"i want nothing more in life than to spend it with other people, but the only thing i want more than that is to be completely alone. i crave connection, but the desperate need for isolation wins every time."

I’m just so tired honestly. Life just seems to get increasingly frustrating. The other day I was so lonely I literally teared up and cried a little. I understand that ppl have their preferences and everything but I’m just so tired of being alone.

I’ve already lost like 35lbs and I’m trying to lose more but it’s so hard when food is like your only coping mechanism lmao. There’s this tik tok trend where ppl use that song ‘Mary on a cross’. In most of the videos they play the second verse with a pic of them and their mom or their partner and the song goes “Your beauty never ever scared me.”

When I see those vids it just makes me sad tho cause it feels like I’m just waiting for the person who’s gonna feel that way about me. Tik tok has been my downfall in general lately because If those videos didn’t make me sad, seeing a poly relationship  get hate def did.

I don’t really care for poly, it’s not for me, but there’s this running gag that poly relationships are usually just 3 unattractive ppl or one decent person with 2 unattractive ppl. This relationship happened to have 2 bigger black girls (I.e me).
So of course that’s all the comments could say. “Bro is winning yet losing” “oh” “the stereotype is true”

Judging by the way they speak, most of those comments are probably minors but it still bothers me. The idea that someone being with someone like me is “losing”.
I’m just really sad man, and so tired of being alone. It would be difficult for me to date anyway for other reasons.

4219,wuiac8,Core_Poration,"So this might be a weird post, skip to the last paragraph to just answer my question.

I'm 19 and was thinking about prefrontal cortex development and stuff and how up until now my brain had no social stuff at all to feed to my prefrontal cortex, and I only have 5 years before it stops developing...

I was thinking that the only close people I had were my parents, and even then it was always kind of hollow and just a matter of ""they're the ones paying for me to stay alive"" to me.

I know they are racists, complotists and stuff like that so it's been a long time since I stopped loving them, but I don't own anything besides what they buy for me and have (never had) no other relationship to turn into.

So that reminded me of something, I remember when being a kid that I was often afraid when my parents left me alone in the car for even 5 minutes to buy breads or whatever.
When she left I was wondering if she would come back for me or if it was all a trick to get rid of me and never come back, or that maybe she would even get murdered in the store...

The problem is that I don't feel like the last time it happened was very long ago, I'd say I was about 12-15 yo and I always assumed it was a common fear for kids and even teenagers.

Now that I think about it, I never heard people talk about that fear, so I tried to search a bit on internet but I mostly find articles about -TODDLERS- crying when their mom leave to go in the next room for 5 minutes...

Doesn't really help me with my feeling of being far far far far far far far behind everyone else... So basically, all this post was mostly to ask you this: Am I the only who got that fear even as a teenager? That my parents might be planning to abandon me along with their car when they leave me alone 5 minutes to go into a store?",2022-08-22 03:08:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1610471539,1,/r/lonely/comments/wuiac8/wondering_how_fcked_up_my_childhoods_development/,,0,0,Wondering how f*cked up my childhood's development has been

4238,wujj6y,juglman,"This might sound dumb, especially since i'm only an 18 year old high school dude with a whole road still ahead of me and whatnot, but I feel so lacking when it comes to a sense of relationships. I have never dated anybody, I haven't ever even held hands with someone. What makes it so lonely though, is how I have been attracted to plenty of girls. I even thought I was in love with a girl we'll call Sarah. She and I hung out together for a whole Summer. She actually owned a car, so she drove us everywhere. We were always alone. We went skating, we went on a picnic, and saw shows, ate out, and even on a ferris wheel. All alone. I felt so close to her on those long drives. When we watched Game of Thrones together at her house, you guessed it, with no one else around, I felt like I was close to her. I even thought we were dating for a long time, even with no verbal agreement coming between us. 
When the Summer ended, she stopped talking to me, and no longer wanted to hang out outside of school. I felt betrayed and alone. But it was also clear how desperate I was, and I felt truly disgusted with myself. Every other girl I've talked to or flirted with has never been interested. One even came up to me, told me that I was cute and after a 20 minute conversation, wanted nothing to do with me. I didn't even know what I did. I wasn't flirting or anything I was trying to keep it cool like a normal conversation. Can I not read a room? Do I not have something?

4256,wuln9q,adamb5555,"I used to be a very social out going person. Got a gf freshman year of high-school, an amazing athlete, I had colleges looking at me my sophomore year. My gf cheated on me after 3 years, it destroyed me. I quit sports, got into drugs and self harm. Lost every opportunity at college i had, got terrible grades. I became the let down of the family because I had the most potential. Everyone, including my family watched me fall apart but never said anything, they were mostly disappointed in what I turned into. After graduating I got a job making 30$ an hour and I started to get better, got off the drugs and starting working on myself. A new co worker came onto my site and offered me adderall. I can feel myself starting to slowly slip again, mainly because I take 3-4 20mg pills a day and I’m not prescribed for any of it. If not I’m either drinking or smoking. Becoming super lonely again but this time I look forward to knowing I will be going to bed with the same lonely feeling as the night before and wishing I could go back to when everything was good. My question is will I always look back to my first three years of highschool and see those as the best times of my life?

ive never really had proper friends so ive always been mostly alone, &amp; i enjoy my own company. but as im getting older it's making me sadder &amp; sadder, i feel trapped. im in the uk so it's summer, people are going out with friends &amp; im alone. i can obviously go out &amp; do things by myself, but it's not the same &amp; makes me feel sad. i used to go to eat, cinema etc. alone but now it just makes me feel pathetic:/",2022-08-22 07:31:39,lonely,t5_2qjny,1615217903,4,/r/lonely/comments/wun0if/is_it_better_to_be_lonely_or_have_fake_friends/,,0,5,is it better to be lonely or have fake friends?

What do you need an want from me? How can I help you? I get bs answers that I don't feel are genuine or the questions go unanswered. I ask are we in a relationship or not. I get beat around the bush answers. It's been very hard to try an think positive or to see a bright side of this situation. But I'm tired of tryin to be the good person and it feels like I have wasted so much time trying to fix whatever could be wrong between him and I. It is very draining and exhausting.

The thing is... I know why I'm alone, I know that being mentally ill sets off alarm bells in people and I know it weighs insanely on the well adjusted or people who have their own problems and just want to live a happy stress free life. I know my mental illness hurts people, and can wound people. No one wants to be overwhelmed with the presence of another, and against my best intentions I can never tell when or if I'm being too much, all I can do is give space to those I care about and hope that the people who care will still speak with me again or think of me from time to time.

I'm soo sad, and people feel it In the air, I'm quiet and that sets people off or I make a blunder and open up too much and answer people's questions about how I am.
 If I'm asked what's going on and how I'm feeling I share as little as possible now because I know if I went further with what really was weighing on me, they'd do what everyone has done... get their peace, their solitude and protect their energy. I was told a lot, even by my therapist... that the people who care will be there no matter what, that in your worst times they will still sit next to you and say hi, or watch that film with you or accept Plans to go out. I know that people can care, but I also know the reality... 
That if you open up too much people will shun you, not because they hate you but because it hurts to see people hurt, because it can take your energy away and lower your happiness. And I don't blame anyone for that. I'm thankful to have what remains of the connections I have left, I just know I need to carry myself harder. 

I think of the friends I've lost, and the love I've lost. And I try to realise that more than anything I need to be whole or I'll be alone. I keep saying I'll be strong, but I know I'll huddle in a corner when I get home, or struggle to hold back tears or a sad face. I guess this is why men stick to the cold compartments of their mind, and are able to shut off completely. I don't want to go back to feeling less, I'd rather grow stronger bearing the weight.
The only thing I can do is smile when I feel sad, the weird thing is it kind of works. I'll do what I have to, and hope that my investment in my own health brings people back to me.

Tw: Su¡c¡de

✨I’m really disoriented right now so if please bare with me. ✨

I’m an international student from a place where people don’t really care ab college apps like that. (For context, someone from my country applied to Stanford, and on their admissions file the ao noted that they never got an applicant from this place before.)

In 2020, I was introduced to college apps n stuff and have since dedicated myself to getting into a good college. And yeah I already know international no aid blah blah blah. 

I graduated last year and well… I’ve been so fucking depressed and I’m embarrassed to admit that it’s over a girl (I’m 18f and bi). I’ve actually made plans to end my life but I rather not get into that. 

I’ve never had many friends and she was my best-friend. Idk how to explain this properly but I still remember the times when she’d shun me at school and cut me off when I’d try to talk about college and stuff to gossip with other people/ she’d barely listen to me. She’d go out of her way to exclude me :/  there’s more but yeah. After we graduated she BARELY made an effort to keep in contact with me. I remember at graduation I was the only person (well one of the only people) with no friends to take pics with and normal stuff.

I remember cutting her off at one point which was incredibly difficult for me. This was last September and I still remember every little tiny detail that she prolly doesn’t even think about. 

This was the same month I got into an A Level Program in my country. The separation fucked me up so badly that I failed almost all my classes and I now have to redo the academic year. (My failing grades will be replaced by the grades I get this upcoming academic yr) 🫤🫤 (btw where I’m from… most schools don’t have 12th-13th grade so you’d have to attend a new school for a 6th form program) 

I was so lonely with no friends that In March (the same month I had finals) I texted her and I got gaslighted _relentlessly_  and she blamed me for leaving her in September when she was literally making me suicidal :/ 

It’s much more but she really meant so much to me but I feel like I was just some stupid high school phase. Not needed anymore. Discardable. This summer was the worst ever with her filled with crying, SH, Su¡cidal ideation. Im at my lowest but I don’t know how to leave. I’ll be seeing a therapist next month hopefully. 


What the fuck does this have to do with applying to college? Well? I’m fucking depressed.. I feel dead I feel like something inside me has died, my eyes are lifeless. My hobbies abandoned. The SAT practice tests I printed? They’re on the shelf gaining dust. My sketch book and painting supplies? Catching dust under my bed. I feel like I’m losing myself and I’m so fucking embarrassed. Fuck I even had a whole binder folder where I stored a bunch of colleges admissions stuff. That’s catching dust as well. The books on my shelf that I loved to read? Catching dust too. The things that I love to do? I haven’t been doing them because I’m burning in my own private hell of loneliness, depression, and abandonment. Nonetheless I still try. 

Redoing the academic year means that I have a chance to replace my failing grades with A’s. I have a chance to get help. I even got an internship this summer (only 25 ppl chosen regionally), I got another internship with an ed tech startup too. Both paid. I’ve been working on a research project with a professor from a Canadian college. 

Mayne I’m fucking trying. Even tho I think about taking my life everyday I’m trying. This might sound dumb to you guys but idk idk what mental illness I have but this shit feels like I’m on fire 24/7 just because my best friend abandoned me when I needed her the most. I sound stupid. Y am I even still friends with someone who makes me feel this way. Idk. Ig I’ll find out in therapy next month. 

But here’s the thing… school starts this FRIDAY. My internship ends on Friday, so I’ll be going on Monday and guess what? We go to the same school. Im worried. What if I fuck Up the year again? What if she does something that hurts me again and makes me spiral? What if…. 

What if I flunk the SAT this year because of depression? What if I don’t get better? This year means a lot to me because it’s the last chance I have to prove to AOs that I’m academically prepared for college. I really need this esp as an intl _needing full aid_ :( 

Sometimes it’s just so fucking hard. I keep trying to remind myself every day why I should keep pushing but christ this is HARD. This is just so hard. I literally have no support system no friends no nothing absolutely nobody and nothing no fucking resources nothing. No there’s no “hotline” or free resources where I’m from. None. Nobody knows about US admissions. I was called crazy for wanting to apply to more than 10 schools as _an international needing full aid_ I’m all alone in this shit. On top of this… my best friend fucking abandoned me lmao. And btw I live in a small place so yeah. Those who get it will get it. 

Ik this was a ramble but ig the point is.. I’m so worried about this school Year. I’m mentally sick and I need to do well to get into college. I can’t make mental illness get in my way again.

Hi I am DreamingOnaStar! I am an addict. I have a very addictive personality. I am addicted to things that make me feel good...One day it was unhealthy substances, unhealthy pleasures or whatever was the vice of the day was. Being an addict isn't always a bad thing, like right now, I'm addicted to self reflection, mindfulness, logical thinking, learning, recovery and more! When I was partaking in unhealthy choices, I WAS MISERABLE! All the shame and the guilt that comes along with being an addict, I had it, I had it with feeling sorry for myself and being a miserable human being. I was lying and hurting the people that I love so much, I was destroying my relationships piece by piece. I knew I wasn't being my best self but I just didn't care... I had to get my next dose of dopamine, I was chasing happiness. living a care free life, I was ready to take on the world so I thought when I was in active addiction. I was just so tired of living life that way and I started to really see how much time using took away from me, from my family, my friends from the world in general. Time is a valuable commodity, it is priceless. I at some point realized what I was doing was numbing a broken heart. Once a heart is shattered, sure you can put the pieces back together but it will never be the same right? It could also make it easier to brake and you keep fixing and repairing it hoping one day you don't have to keep fixing it anymore. That was my problem, I was trying to numb the pain of a broken heart and my heart just kept breaking over and over again even if it was just disappointing me because at this point all I could do was really care about myself, just trying to survive until one day, I just gave up on it. I was tired of trying to fix my broken heart. I became cold and making a lot of unhealthy decisions, I was getting pleasure out of being bad, I had become a real life Villain, someone I always hated. I hated myself dearly, more than anyone in the universe, I hated myself. I wasn't on the good guy team anymore, my hopes of being a superhero was long gone and my dream was crushed. Right there was my rock bottom standing in a wake of my own destruction, this was my life... The next steps to come were crucial in my recovery and it was a long process to get where I am today. Since I was already self absorbed and only looking out for myself. I took the Meyer Briggs personality test, IF you haven't taken this, trust me this was the light bulb that went off in my head. I always thought I was special, who doesn't right? I felt like no one could understand me, so I didn't care what they had to say... They haven't lived a day in my shoes. Right? I thought I knew better. My favorite catch phrases were, I know, I am sorry, and I love you. Like a robot on repeat. I knew what I needed to do but didn't have the faith in myself to do it. Sometimes I would think to myself why should I even give up my unhealthy choices I was only destroying myself, see I was very wrong and in Denial, I thought the unhealthy actions made me a better person, I always felt like a superhero until one day I became a full blown Villain a criminal mastermind Id like to think. I was always planning and plotting on ways to get my next dose of dopamine, that is what became most important to me. Any who, once I took the Meyer Briggs test, there it laid all my feelings that I have been numbing. It gave me a clear look at my strength and weaknesses. Gave me hope that there were other people just like me out there, feeling the same way as me. Like I said it blew my mind. So I decided to make a goal and dream for myself and that was a dream of recovery. During active addictions, I didn't care about dreams or goals, I just cared about getting my next dopamine rush. For those of us in active addiction your goals and your dreams are getting your next fix. That release from a broken heart... So at this point I knew that I had a broken heart, broken hopes and broken dreams. I love fixing things, don't you? That's the way that I thought of it, I was broken instead of how I now think I am not broken, there is room for improvement, nobody's perfect, we all have flaws that we must forgive others for like they forgive us. Then I realized I was so busy focusing on other people, judging them, criticizing them, being jealous of them I had made other people my enemies, even my loved ones. Why did I do this? Why did I believe everyone was out to get me and get me I mean by braking my heart, with something they said or did, I was so scared of a broken heart, I begin being paranoid that people were going to call me out on my bad behavior and they would be right, because I felt like a villain... I wasn't being so super... I wasn't living up to my dream of being a superhero. What's the deal with superhero's you ask? When I was little, the concept of superhero's blew my mind! I did not grow up with the best of role models so thank God for TV, I actually learned what being a good human being was supposed to look like. I was a little kid with a dream of being a superhero, having superhero's as family members, as friends, as people in general, I just wanted to be surrounded by goodness, I guess. I thought it was only a dream to be a superhero, you need superpowers and I didn't have any or so I thought and then I realized Batman didn't have any real superpowers. Sure he was an AWESOME One of a Kind Dude with great tech gadgets. Who doesn't love the bat mobile? I always wanted to be a superhero but my way of thinking was wrong! I was thinking I could only play the villain and or the superhero. I was stuck in black and white thinking. Here's another light bulb moment for me is when I googled ""Growth Mindset"" my mind was blown, I was living in a' ""Fixed Mindset"". Please google this if you haven't already. I am not saying read a bunch just look at some of the images to get an idea of the concept. No-one ever taught me this and I have been in the programs and rehab on occasions, no one ever taught me about logical thinking. This was a new concept for me. You know you here the old timers say things like, ""you have got to get rid of your stinking thinking"", Listen to them they know what they are talking about! I just didn't know how to do it. We are all smarter than we think we are and only use a small percentage of our brains, so I then began to explore psychology and how the mind works. Please take sometime to research this. When I started researching and reading this became my new obsession, each time I learned something that blew my mind, I got that rush of dopamine that I was always chasing, I was going to figure out a plan to achieve my recovery, a natural high, learning who knew and why didn't anyone ever tell me this. Why don't they teach this in grade school? I became angry that I had the key the entire time to my cage of active addiction. I became so mad at myself, and hated myself and all the things that I have done, I was quite embarrassed and ashamed of who I let myself become. I had to learn to reparent myself because I was taught to feel guilty for everything. I had to learn about what things I actually have control of my self. I chanted the serenity prayer over and over again. I learned about the law of karma, how someone treats you is their karma and how you react is yours... I had to learn the difference between respond and react. We all need to respond and react but it is always a choice how you respond or react in any situation and I knew in my heart I wanted to respond and react like a superhero. What I had a hard time understanding was that I never have to be the same person I was yesterday, in fact I don't have to be the same person I was 2 seconds ago. I know right from wrong and MOST people do and MOST people want to be the good guy, MOST people want to be the hero of their story, even if it is just saving yourself. No one is coming to rescue you, you have most likely pushed everyone away because of your addiction, or at least I know I did. We all can recover from active addiction, it is a process not an event. Strive for progress and not perfection. Keep it simple and take it 1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 night, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 365 days and nights, 24 hours, 60 minutes or 60 seconds at a time. Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. Use the time that you spend on your addiction and invest it in yourself! People will start to see a change in your attitude even before you do. Try positive affirmations, I know that sounds corny and feels weird doing it, trust me but its like learning to ride a bike. Google the Law of attraction, that's another thing I think they should teach in schools. That also blew my mind... Enough about me, I want to hear from you!

4360,wv43a5,Lizze_bunny,No matter how hard I try. No matter how many good people I met. I feel so alone because of my inability to connect to just be myself and connect with people on a deep level. I feel like a walking corpse. Just numb and only existing and not living. I feel like an observer of life and not a participant. I want to be a participant! I want to feel like I’ve lived. I want to enjoy each moment to it’s fullest! But there is something that is just holding me back and keeping me from doing so. Keeping me quiet and awkward. Like an outsider looking in. Like a person strapped to a chair forced to watch everyone else have a great time without them and no matter how much I move or try to set myself free… it never works and im just trapped there… forever. Like a person in a movie theater watching everything that’s going on and not actually there. I just want to get past this feeling and into ACTUALLY living life.

4362,wv4c5g,Jurez1313,"I feel like I post about this too often, and I'm sure people are tired of seeing grown men complain about this on reddit, but man I just feel like I need to vent right now...I just have this unnerving sense that I'll never *not* feel lonely. Like, logically I know that I have at least a few positive traits. I'm a great listener, I have a strong sense of empathy and I'm good at putting myself in others' shoes, and I'm fairly punctual.  

But none of that feels like it's enough to attract true friends into my life, let alone a romantic partner. I'm boring - my only interests are super childish and mainstream. I still live with my parents because I'm not financially responsible to live within my means, nor am I disciplined/motivated enough to get a better job. I'm shy but at times tend to talk too much, and just end up making everyone feel uncomfortable because I suck at reading the room or figuring out what to say. I can't relate to people my age because it seems everyone has had many more life experiences than I have. And because I currently have very few friends, it means I'll always be a bit awkward when getting to know me, which is offputting for new acquaintances. Not to mention my physical appearance is so far below par that I probably drag par down with me.  

So like, if I don't even want to be my own friend, and would never date someone like me, why do I expect others to disagree with me and give me a chance anyway? That's just insane. So of course I'm going to be lonely ""forever"" - whatever that actually means. It just feels like, none of that is really ""actionable"" - like besides physical appearance, which is only one very small part of the shit package that is Jurez - there doesn't seem to be much I can do to become more interesting, less shit at social interactions, more motivated or financially stable, etc.  

Idk, it's just becoming really hard to cope with this feeling of being worthless. because I know it's true, and I don't know what to do about it. All I know is that feeling that I really want someone to just give me a hug and actually care about me is so goddamn strong and powerful that it's harder and harder to tune it out lately.",2022-08-22 20:31:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1645556506,1,/r/lonely/comments/wv4c5g/feels_like_ill_never_not_feel_this_way/,,0,2,Feels like I'll never NOT feel this way...
4363,wv4cib,Perfect-Operation-63,"I just need to share this with someone. I’m 23M, never been in a relationship. I don’t have friends anymore. My family feels like strangers. I don’t meet people. I go to college online and there’s no time to talk with coworkers at my job.

I would really like to find a boyfriend or a close friend. But I’m gay so I’m pretty much limited to dating sites. And every guy there just wants to fuck me. Man, I just want to cuddle, play video games together, go camping etc., sex optional - not the most important thing that it all revolves around.

However, I’m afraid of serious relationships. I hate how everyone immediately wants to know everything about you when dating. Man, I don’t want to talk about myself. I basically lost the last 4 years of my life to mental illness and don’t want to talk about it.

Also, everyone always creates these big plans and expectations when a romantic relationship starts and I just don’t want to disappoint or hurt someone.

So it seems my best option is a friend with some benefits. But the problem is that if he does it primarily for sex it will suck. And that’s exactly what’s with 99% chance going to happen if I go to a dating site again. Last time a guy wanted sex right on the second date and didn’t want to talk about or do anything else. 

Forever alone I guess.

4364,wv4iwq,uglysunfish,"Making friends in high school wasn’t too hard for me, but now that I’m at university it’s so difficult for me. My first year was awful bc of covid so I only started making friends in my second year. I made some friends but made the mistake of being closest with an international student who went back to her country. I’m also an international student (w/ no connections to my new country) so all of my high school friends are thousands of miles away. 

I have no idea how to make friends now. I’m entering my third and final year and it feels too late to make friends. I don’t party or go to clubs, which seems to be the main way people my age socialize here. It’s so embarrassing and I almost wish I were back in high school.

Finding absolute true love and making life choices that pulls it out from underneath you is a wicked act of self destruction.

The loss of any person in any context is so sharp and big and achingly lonely.

I've now lost friends because they were cunts, or by suicide or by strong life choices.

I know I'll get back up.
It's just these waves of losing control that really drive it home that anything you do to remain positive is a farce.

Being lonely sucks. It’s hard to connect with people, to find likeminded people. BUT … 

That doesn’t mean it’s all because of you. Some people are hard to get along with. Maybe it was the wrong timing. Just keep trying because when you find your people it’ll be worth it.

All the posts here are definitely a collective of my thoughts and I relate so much. But I feel like I have been in a transition to loneliness. I have been in a relationship for a year and a half but it has started to feel like they're only in it since we've known each other for so long since 2016. I don't think my partner really cares for me, they don't really ask what I do during the day or what I am doing. Its mostly just about them. I think they just like having my company when we facetime or call at the end of the night. For friends I feel like I don't have any either anymore. Majority of my interactions come from organizations I have been apart of. And I am not someone people think of when inviting out. I think people invite me out because I am there. It also sucks when I ask people to hang out that they're mostly busy. I'm 25 years old and I don't even know how to make myself busy anymore. I've stopped painting, writing and generally doing things I used to enjoy. I just entertain myself with tik toks and youtube videos now. Honestly at the end of the day I wish I just had a friend who was loyal and real. I go through friendships and I have connections that fizzled out. Because I've been unhappy I can barely keep a conversation although I've always been somewhat socially anxious but I feel like it just keeps getting worse.

4436,wvch8q,kurtiscobain,"Growing up, I had a decent amount of friends. I wasn't very close with anyone, but I at least usually had people to hang out with. But as time went on, I realized how much they were holding me back from succeeding in school. 

So, as a result, I completely dropped them at 16. I also came out as gay and forced my family to deal with it. I got a college boyfriend that pushed me to improve my grades until I brought my yearly GPA up from a 3.0 to a 4.0. It was a great relationship, but he was basically my only friend. I let it continue like that, though, because he kept pushing me to work harder. 

More extracurriculars, leadership positions, class office, internships, varsity sports, volunteer clubs, founding clubs, etc. I only made friends when they benefited my goals, so they didn't last very long. In November of my senior year of high school, I broke up with my boyfriend. I sort of regret that, but it is what it is. Anyway, I was left with no one. And I continued to prioritize my grades over anything else. Four-point-o. Four-point-o. That was all I could ever think about. 

I quit most of my extracurriculars, and just focused on my grades. I only made time for sex with strangers outside of schoolwork. Now I'm taking summer college classes to improve my chances of successfully transferring from my current college to a better one.

This has all been mostly fine with me until today for some reason. I didn't need other people, I only needed success. I needed to win. I needed to prove myself. But, it just dawned on me that I have no one. My only social life is random hookups. I'm not close with my family because I never have time for them. I make it so that I have time for literally nothing but work. But I can't let go of that, can I? I'm terrified of failing. At this point, I've spent years making my life as optimal as possible. To perform at my very maximum. 

I can't be the loser that I was before I started to try in life. I used to sit around and play video games all day. I stopped doing that two and a half years ago, and now all I do is homework. I barely even post on social media anymore. I don't have time for extracurriculars. I barely talk to anyone. My social skills are collapsing. I feel like the charm I used to possess is dying out.

I don’t feel any desire or ambition to do or pursue anything in life. I’m in my early 30s with a full time job(remote since Covid) I hate, no degree, and no direction.

Basically I just feel like every day is the same shit, different day, and some days are easier to deal with this impending doom/existential crisis feeling than others. Most of the time I am content with this …but other times I wonder if there is a better existence for me out there. Less lonely and with more smiles and laughter? 

Sometimes I get so panicky about what is going to happen in my future/the time I’m just letting slip through my fingers like sand.  It makes me sick/want to cry/scream all at the same time. I just feel hopeless and helpless. 

All that is going on in my head on a daily basis, so the few times I’m out and about in public I feel weird, spacey and unable to interact “normally” with others.

Does anyone else ever get this feeling? I'm pretty introverted, loner-type, very few friends. Pretty meek and slight. Go everywhere alone pretty much. Have earphones in most of the time. I'm pretty aware of what's going on around me, but just off in my own little world or focused on a task.

About a few times a week it feels like someone will make some snide remark or flat out just yell at me for no reason when I'm minding my own business. I notice it at work, people who don't normally talk to me will out of the blue make some offhand comment or talk to me in a way they wouldn't talk to most other people at work. Or when I'm walking through the grocery store or mall with my head on a swivel and someone will just snap at me. Sometimes I feel like these people are joking, but most of these comments you'd only make to friends who know you're joking, not someone you barely know.

Do I just have an invisible ""Kick Me"" sign on my back? Like I give off some aura or smell that draws people to treat me this way, even though I barely know or talk to them?

When I was in middle school I was fat, my hair was too long, I was unbelievably socially awkward and I had no sense of fashion at all.

I had never asked a girl out before and still haven't since.

I have been a loner for past 12 years cuz my face got a little disfigured 12 year ago when I was 15. Currently my age is 27 once  my face got a little disfigured I just lost the ability to make friends.

So overtime I was use to be lonely or just make some frnds online. I made a girlfriend in 2020 but she cheated on me and left me. Around the same time my uncle ( father's brother)  with whom I was very close to also died. That was the hardest moment in my life but I didn't give up some how I was still living my life. By God grace I met this girl through insta and we hit it off we were in a long distance relationship still we were rock solid for 8 months by this time I also made a few  online and offline friends. Things got bad for my gf when we planned a weekned together. Where she lied to her hostel saying she is going home instead she was with me. We even exchanged rings saying we r engaged now. But during the stay  her parents found out she isn't in hostel. Our culture is very conservative. Naturally this caused a huge scene both at her home and in her college. Her parents even got her out of hostel and she had to travel to clg everyday. She told me let's me focus on the upcoming exam and then I will contact you. But after 1 month she texted me saying while I was  away from you I didn't miss you so that means I don't love you so we should break you and after that she blocked me everywhere. Naturally my mentally healthy got really really bad I reached out to the few of my friends to talk to but some either ignored or or some just showed fake sympathy which made me realise I never had any real friend to begin with even though I was always there when my so called friends ever had any problem.

Since I am my parents only child I can't commit sucide otherwise I would have done it already.

I am from a culture where arrange marriage is common so my parents will probably marry me off to some strange girl within 2 year. This is why my life is the shittiest. From planning my life with the girl I love to having a break up getting blocked by her. Finding out none of my friends r real and just living a boring mundane life with a girl I don't love doing a job I hate can't end my life cuz I am the only child.

I don't think i am the victim. I have done a lot of bad things in life so maybe it's the God way of punishing me. Still this punishment is way too hard. When will this punishment end.

Even though I am the worst guy on this earth don't I deserve the chance to be happy in life and to live my life with the girl I love.",2022-08-23 06:08:29,lonely,t5_2qjny,1619095377,2,/r/lonely/comments/wvgxr2/lost_everything_m27_saved_you_the_time_since_most/,,0,12,Lost everything (M27 saved you the time since most of you click on girls post only)

It was nothing but all smiles and laugh. The sun shining down on us and the clear blue skies, everything was just wonderful. We laid on the grass and I rested my head on his stomach staring up at the sky with him and seeing clouds passing by. One was shaped like a heart going right over us. We laughed it off like a coincidence and talked about how beautiful the skies are and how wonderful nature is. He slowly leaned down on me to kiss my forehead and told me that “I was the most beautiful thing next to nature and he never wanted to let me go. As we walked through the meadow staring at all the flowers in site he picked me up a daisy and handed it to me. Accepting it gracefully I smiled as big as the sun shining down on us. Then everything quickly shifted. The skies turned dark and grey clouds were everywhere. It begin to rain, thunder and lighten appeared. Then I was all alone and turned my eye and saw my lover running off with another woman who didn’t look familiar until they disappeared. I was left all alone in the meadow while it stormed. Soak and wet and tears coming down my face. Watching him run off with her and choosing her over me after everything was just a big punch in the face. The flower he gave me died in my hand immediately and everything was just dark until I opened my eyes and woke up to looking around my room. Just a dream. I lay in bed staring up at the tapestry on my wall and it was just another cold morning. The feelings of being abandoned and afraid to love keep resurfacing.

4530,wvrinf,thewaymylifegoes,"BF (22M) of one year dumped me (22F) because he said I'm toxic and he wants to go out clubbing and partying without having a GF nag him for acting single. The truth is he made me crazy with his untrustworthy behavior. For example, going out drinking to a girl's hotel room and landing in an ER for alcohol poisoning. Lying to me about who he was with and where. Hanging out at 2am with a 27F coworker who got fired for snorting cocaine on the shift. All of these events and more have destroyed my trust in him and turned me into somebody I am not. He slowly stopped texting me and stopped saying he loved me. He went drinking til 2-3am multiple times per week and it doesn't fly with me. We broke up. He told me he could marry me and that I'm ""wife material,"" but slow faded me for weeks in the most painful way. He told me how he wants to find a girl who is less attached and lets him go clubbing and drinking late, he called me clingy and dependent and too intense. He said he's ""already over it"" but kept inviting me to hangout the past two weeks because he felt bad and ""worried I am not ok without him."" 

So why is he texting me at all? If he thinks so low of me why did he date me for so long? He told me ""I make men feel trapped and nobody wants to date me when I make them feel trapped, I'm telling you this because I love you."" He makes me feel worthless and hard to love. He makes me feel like the bare minimum is too much to ask for. This feels like emotional abuse. Two nights ago he said ""let's get sushi"" but then took it back because he said he's moved on. It's not fair what he's doing. It feels like instead of choosing to stay and be a man of a relationship with a girl committed to him he chose to go romping around with sex drugs and partying. 

How do I interpret this and process this ending? Will he ever regret leaving me? How do I find peace? He has me feeling like I screwed up and pushed him away when I know deep down the reality is he was never fully committed to me. It hurts so bad. I can't eat or sleep, I gave him everything and I gave this relationship everything I could. I fell off the rails in the past month because his behavior kept degrading. The worst thing he said to me was that he was already moved on. I felt it too. The past 3 months I was slowly losing my best friend. There is no worse feeling than feeling alone in a relationship. The rejection is right there in your face 24/7. 

Please help. I don't know what to do with my days I am so depressed I don't have a job I have no schedule or friends my life is empty and I feel hopeless. He told me maybe in ""six months or a year"" he will miss me and want to try again and he said ""If I keep dating you now I will marry you and I'm not ready for that."" He’s delusional to think that he can just re-approach me in six months or a year or whatever after he does his drugs hookups and party romping around and think he will have some epiphany into becoming the partner I need after that lifestyle. He keeps texting me bread crumbs and every time I receive a message I break down and cry. I made the mistake of entertaining a phone call with him last night while he dumped on me again as if we were still dating. 

TLDR: 22M Dumped 22F said he ""wants to focus on himself"" and that I'm too toxic and dependent. He goes drinking 3-4 nights a week until 2-3am and dumped me because I wouldn't allow him to ""enjoy his 20's."" Keeps breadcrumbing me and I am heartbroken.

4604,ww33r6,fake_friends_please,"There's a cute girl in my class again. She's a math geek, her hair's great, her face is stunning. She has a nice voice, she seems kind, and pretty funny. Bolder than me, which I always appreciate, but is also not a high bar.

But if this is anything like the last times I've had a crush on a classmate (or anyone, really) , it'll turn to an obsession in a couple days, and after that I'll spiral down into depression, powerlessness, lack of motivation, and all that fun stuff, just cuz I can't be with her. I'll feel like I have no life apart from her, and that without her, there's no reason to do anything.

I hope not. I'm actually on Buspirone recently, and it's cut my anxiety a ton. I feel it's a lot easier to do shit, and way fuckin easier to talk to people. I'm even gonna try to be a tutor this year, hopefully. But that could maybe even make it worse. A couple months ago, asking a fellow student anything was impossible, but now I actually initiate conversations sometimes. What if this makes me *actually* talk to her? That would be horrible. I'll just creep her out, and the hit my self esteem would take would surely be the sinking blow.

But on the other hand, can I really afford to not do anything? I'm so fucking angry at just reality all the goddamn time because of how alone I am. Up until now, it was entirely outside my control, there was no chance I could ever have talked to anyone. Now I ... kinda can, I guess. Not well, but I can. It's not entirely outside of my control, now. Still mostly outside of my control, because literally the only limiting factor is someon finding me attractive too. My finding someone attractive is a given because of how desperate I am.

I just have no idea what I'd even say... if it was like mass effect or something and there were dialogue options, I think I'd probably do it. I'd know there's at least a possibility that one of the paths leads to a success. But reality isn't like that, and there's too many words to say and ways to say them to actually consider them all. And there's certainly far, far, FAR more ways to fuck up than there are to succeed. When I think about trying to get with someone, it feels like trying to cut off my finger or punch myself (actually it feels exactly like trying to do a back-lit on a trampoline, if anyone knows that feeling. Where you intend with all your mind to do it but right as you start to, you find your body won't obey) . It feels that destined to failure, and a failure seems that catastrophic to me.

4608,ww417b,Amnezia21170,"I had a really great childhood in a small town in Germany. Life was great, I was a happy little kid playing all day outside with my friends. My worriless youth ended abruptly when I was 17 and I was told my father killed himself and that was where my innocent world got teared to peaces.

That was also the point in life where I got introduced to the concept of depression and that all my father's family had to deal with it and at one point died to this disease.

At first it was hard for me to understand the concept of depression, why should a small little kid like me be worried or sad about a world where my biggest worry so far was that I maybe choosed the wrong starter Pokemon?

Now 10 years later I almost totally wasted my 20's what should have been the prime of my life to grieve and depression. I lost the majority of my friends because I'm bad ad keeping relationships and often just stay for weeks in my bed without responding to anyone. I feel miserable and alone most of the time.

 At first people try to cheer you up and help you but at some point they just give up and I can't even blame them, who wants to be around a miserable sad person?

Sometimes I think I'm addicted to the sadness when I find myself listening to sad songs which remind me of relationships with people that loved me ones but are now just a memory in my sick and sad brain.

How to live with the certainty that depression will always be a part of my life and I will never get rid of it and have to live with it? I just want to be this little kid with so many hopes and dreams again.

4610,ww4wi9,Nolapain,"I used to have a really tight friend group in high school (almost 4 years ago) that I thought I'd be fine when entering college. But my whole 4 years has just been finding friend groups and then losing them over and over again and just ending up painfully alone. 

Another rough part of it is that I am a transwoman. And have only come to terms with accepting it in just the past year. So the struggles of trying to adapt to the new social norms of being female with the added marginalized pressures of being trans has made me almost entirely asocial. It would be a stressful effort even to leave my apartment room let alone hold a conversation with anyone. 

Now I'm coming back to college for my senior year and actually have the confidence to talk to people again. But ig I want to ask, is it worth it to start socializing again? I only have a year left here and kind of don't care but also I really don't see how I could do another year all alone.

Also how do I even socialize? I feel like I have nothing to work with and the added risk to my safety.

I was sitting on my porch watching my dog and the neighbor dude came over, and tried to talk to me. He just said a simple 'Hey, how are you?' And I couldn't talk for a second. I literally just stared like a total weirdo!! I finally blurted out a greeting, that was meant to be a 'Hi, I'm good! You?' But came out more like 'H-hi? How're y-y-ous?' I didn't even answer his question! Before the complete loneliness set in I could speak better I didn't have such a big issue, I used to be shy when I was little then less shy, now I'm like completely shy again..anyway, he just looked at he and said 'Ok..well I gotta go.'

4660,ww9jp5,Traditional-Log-4550,"This is my first ever Reddit post. To be quite honest, I had never seriously considered going to an online discussion forum for help or assistance with any of my personal problems, but here I am.

My ambition in life is completely gone and I'm not sure why. Over the last year, my ability to relate and confide in others has regressed, and expressing my own true emotions has never been more difficult. I just can't quite seem to overcome this depression or whatever is holding me back from my true potential I know I am capable of achieving.

I've tried consulting with friends and family. I've tried therapy. I've tried improving my physical and mental well-being through clean eating, nutritional supplements, and daily exercise. Nothing seems to snap my brain out of this never-ending funk.

I know I wasn't always this way. I once was eager and naive, ready to take on the world. I had dreams and aspirations, but now I can't even get out of my bed in the morning to face what life has thrown my way. I'm only a 20 year old college student, but mentally, I feel 60 years old and ready to retire from a dead end job I haven't even started.

I have found myself entirely alone trying to face this struggle. This isn't by choice. However, one half of me is almost at peace when I'm alone, like I would be content living out the rest of my days on an island somewhere, far away from the ups and downs of our society. I almost don't even feel real anymore.

Because, I have an amazing family that are my friends and people where I work (Regular Customers I see yearly every week) really love me, so I consider them just friends, nothing outside work though. So it's just small friendship. But, it definitely counts and I love seeing them.  


I guess loneliness hit me finally after a long time, because over time, it builds up without me even noticing. I always love the attention when I post on Facebook every other day letting everybody know of my fitness journey and it's been so nice hearing people say how I've inspired them and all the reactions and comments I get, I just love the attention because yeah, I don't have any close friends and haven't been in a relationship in a super long time either.  


Just the thought of having a partner to share my fitness journey with and hearing her praise me and being proud of me and being so loving and caring and supporting, is a very nice thought and warms my heart up. Wish I had something like that!

I’m desperate and trying the little luck I have on Reddit. Maybe someone out there would like to get to know me? I don’t care where you’re from. If we click well I’m willing to give long distance a try. 
Hey, my name is Christian. I’m from Melbourne, Australia. I’m 5’6, tanned skin, curly brown hair and brown eyes. Chubby physique. Been told I have a cute face haha. I work as a concreter. Some of my interests are- gaming. Nature always makes me smile. Watching movies and shows. Marvel, horror. Baking and cooking. Camping and fishing. Collecting merchandise. Reading and writing poems/quotes, and more. If you have made it this far, thank you. I’m a caring, loving, honest, nonjudgmental guy, who is also full of sarcasm, laughs and fun, that just wants the same in return.

4712,wwfrx5,loo_min,"I’m not an older person, so I could be way off, but I watch a lot of older movies (or movies set in older times.  My favorite are WWII movies) because they seem to just reflect a better time socially.  Back in the day, it seems like communities did a lot more and went a lot further for people who were a part of it.  It was also easier to just stumble into a community, too.  Did you move to a new neighborhood?  People introduce themselves, bring pies, and go out of their way to get to know you because ‘it’s the neighborly thing to do’.   By doing this, it actually doesn’t seem so creepy when someone runs up behind you and says “hey, you’re Jenny, right?”and ‘Jenny’ would know them as well because he’s the guy who everyone is talking about who just moved in.  Single?  People will try to introduce you to singles they know.  Married?  Welcome to the mom club or dad club.

“We meet every Saturday at so-and-so’s for activity x and this other person throws a barbecue every Sunday after church.”

It’s just so friendly.  In the Imitation Game, one scene really gets to me.  Everyone hated Bennidict Cumberbach’s character, but they still invited him to lunch just because they were associated.  Imagine being disliked but still invited out.

I’ll say this now.  I don’t know my neighbors.  I introduce myself occasionally to new people who move in, but while they are nice for that first encounter, they seem to only be about themselves or their families so the best I can get is a wave every now and then.  Plus, since I’m the only one doing it, I don’t want to seem like that one creepy girl who puts their noses in everyone else’s business.

Communities like the ones from a long time ago don’t seem to exist anymore because of their obvious flaws (excluding people of different color, gossip, defending bad people), but the communities weren’t replaced with anything.  The only communities that come close to providing some type of anti-loneliness are ones united for or against something (like for their religion or against a prejudice).  If you’re not gay, religious, or political, it’s rough.  I wish I knew how to be part of a community just to be part of one instead of just having to fight for some cause.  Or, if I did fight for a cause, I’d want it to be unambiguous which side is the right side.  When WWII hit the states, there was no question about who was in the wrong for like 99.9 percent of the population, so being super pro American or being part of the military or in a military family was just joining a super friendly club where you were just accepted no matter your age, color, or family status.

The latest movie I watched isn’t old but is called “Only the Brave”.  It’s a very sad movie about fire fighters losing their lives in a wild fire, but like 90 percent of the movie is just relationships being built.  A former drug addict is given a second chance and, even though there is a bit of hazing and bullying, eventually he makes friends with everybody, becomes roommates with the guy who gave him the most problems, and goes to a bunch of parties and social events because he was part of the crew.  He even wins back his family.  It’s a great movie to watch if you’re lonely.

I don’t know.  I know they are just movies, but I guess I get why older people are always talking about how things were better back when they were young.  But, today, when you put in the effort (especially when you put in the effort and get it wrong sometimes), everyone tends to tell you to mind your own business.

I used to meet up with my work friends once every week or two for drinks or dinner. By now, it’s more like I see one of those friends once every few months if I’m lucky, since we all have different jobs and schedules. Some of them have moved far away, some have had mental breakdowns. This is one of those sad truths about being an adult that nobody really tells you about. You’re going to spend more time alone than you’d like.

Over the past two years I’ve been learning and trying to do things that I can comfortably do alone, and learn to love it. Certain “social” activities, like going to concerts, bars, restaurants, escape rooms, etc. feel strange to do by myself. On the other hand, I’ve spend the pandemic doing things like building jigsaw puzzles, streaming TV series, birding and nature photography, making stop motion videos, section hiking the Appalachian Trail.  

None of those things are really a communal experience that you’re expected to do with other people. That’s why I feel ok with it when I’m just sitting in my bed streaming a show on Hulu by myself.

-I am starting to believe that society deserves mass shootings because the shooters are often outcasts who are told by society they are worthless.

I am trying not to let this type of thinking get to me but eventually it will.

These past few days I suddenly started to think about my really unstable mental health issues which made me lose focus on my school work a lot so I tried to ask some of my classmates for emotional support but I was simply too shy to do it. Today I couldn't hold it in any longer so I cried in front of my class and I also had to go outside that time. Sadly only the teacher and this pacific islander girl came outside to comfort me and I just wrote a bunch of sentences about my life which managed to make its way to the social worker and we had a little chat before I continued the last period of thr day. Here I am in bed, thinking about everything that happened in school and writing this post.

4724,wwij4s,GothGeminiGirl,"There's a fuck ton more to what was going on and what I found out with the friend drama. I've been actually randomly posting out it on different accounts (I cycle through some for gaming bc of creeps)





Also, I'm so sorry I'm really bad at messaging people through DMs or holding conversations via reddit, so if you message me I'm so sorry. I dont try to but on reddit I'm a bit of a ghoster cause I never get notifications, I have other thing going on, and then I forgot to respond or my message never went through and then I feel awkward as hell messaging back after it's been a few weeks....





I learned to move past it. Sure I still get sad and depressed, but I needed that kick. I legit, at least once, thought about the kind words and massive support I got on my post.




Thank you guys for helping me continue chugging on through.




Thank you to my IRL friend who drove 16 hours to see me and take me on a vacation back in February.





Thank you to all the other people I met off reddit who game with me, dont judge me, dont say how ""stupid it is to be sad over losing online friends""




Yall showed me so much empathy, and I know you guys meant it. I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of creeps in my DMs trying to prey on me, and glad at the lack of trolls in my inbox.



It made me feel validated. It's easy for me to start over, as much as I hate that.




While I haven't made new ""best friends"" yet, I've made friends with some new great, funny, talented, cheerful and non toxic friends.





I've learned a fuck ton and grew so much.



And a part of that is thanks to this subreddit. Thanks to random kind, altruistic strangers.




None of you needed to do that, none of you randomly slid into my dms.




I know I have a lot to work on, I've been mentally I'll my whole life. But had i unalived myself 8 or 9 months ago, I wouldn't be here with the skills and joy I feel now.




I've gotten back into painting again, people are bidding on my art, strangers in my neighborhood heard I was ""a good artist"" and wanted to buy my art, they even found out I made the wreath on my door and want one for themself.




I've always wanted to get into voice acting. I've been practicing with a group every week and we read visual novels together (I love them!)





I have some real promise, it's been inspiring.




I've gone back to reading and writing.




I know a lot of this sounds like a ""and then everyone clapped"" but it's been 10 months of all this drama, a lot has happened.



My mother, an abuser of mine, finally admitted she fucked up and said sorry.




She wouldn't admit what she did, none of it, and of course continued to blame others for her actions.



But she said sorry. She said sorry for not being a good mother. She said sorry for not providing me with a good childhood. That she was responsible for that and didnt do the right thing. (And then went off from there blaming everyone one else for why it was not her fault)




But...   thats...  something.





I actually called her. I told her how suicidal I felt. That (2 months ago actually) I was so horribly depressed I'd probably be dead in the next 2 to 3 months, be it accidental or on purpose.






She knew I wasn't eating, she picked me up from the er and saw the shape I was in.







I got her half assed apology, because I was alive and breathing to ask.





I know my circumstances are different than most peoples. Some of this was easy, and some of it I had to put grueling work or suffering into.





I know things are only good-ish now, but even so, thank you. I'm literally weeping as I type this post.




But I'm so grateful. I just had to say something.




I got past it. I'm alive. I'm eating again.",2022-08-24 12:40:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1536501689,23,/r/lonely/comments/wwij4s/you_guys_saved_my_life_thank_you/,,0,6,You guys saved my life. Thank you.

4734,wwlvkw,StephaniusSaccus,"For quite some time now, I've been feeling rather lonely. I do have friends, but most of them already have someone significant in their lives and while we do meet every now snd then, I don't wish to disturb them. But I myself am mostly an introvert and it's difficult for me to find new people. What makes this even worse is that just yesterday, I met up with some friends in a nearby town. It was good and I was glad to be among them but as soon as it was over, I once again got that terrible feeling. I am 18, almost 19. I am just approaching my final grade in High school and I'll hopefully go to college. From material perspective, I have everything I need. But there is still that feeling of lonelyness. Few years ago, I still probably would've been ok with this. I had few friends but we met regurarly. Even though my parents are divorced for over 8 years now, I still found it quite easy to feel happy. But for at least 3 years now, it doesn't feel enough for me. I am truly tired of being an introvert and having difficulties with connectiong to people. I want a more active social life. But I don't know how. It's even difficult for me to talk about this. I'd really like to simply open up and talk with someone about this issue. But for some reason, I simply...can't. That's why I am writing this here, to this group. There are people who, I am sure, understand this. I am sorry for making this post so long, but I just needed to get this off me at least somewhere. I feel like I am stuck on a small island in the middle of a massive ocean. To put it simply...actually having friends and some to talk to is more important to me than ever. Everyday I see people of my generation having friends, travelling with them, talking, having fun and sometimes even finding someone whom they may truly love. But me? I don't know what to feel anymore. And I just don't know what to do. Don't take it as me being suicidal. Not really. But sometimes, I truly just wish to cease to exist for at least a while, just so that my problems dissapear at least for a moment. If you read this to this point, thank you.

4736,wwmfue,BurningMasquerade223,"I had a path with someone I loved, a career, and a vision. Somehow, in a manner of just a few years, it all changed, and I found myself as a temp, relationship of 5 years just end out of no where, and currently trying to make ends meet. I was always an avid player of Mario games, and the adventure it always spelled in their worlds, levels, and stories - the one thing I have always held, dreamed rather, is to experience that feeling for myself. To find someone, or friends, who will go on that adventure with me, whatever it may be. Still waiting at 28 years old, but I will hang on, until that day arrives. Until that adventure begins. To say I've sunk into a deeper depression than I ever have, even more than when one of my parents died, is an understatement. That said, I want nothing more than to have someone/people that I would travel all the worlds to find, fight through all the tribulations for. I'm not even sure what I'm doing with this post to be honest, primarily because I don't know what I'm doing in my life in general. But, they say life is short, and I just want my short lived life to be seen and known as one that was worth living. To have others who might join, discuss, and believe with all their hearts, the prospect of adventure, and to have that end credits song play. To have the song play, and know that you are a part of what happens after, that grand mystery and presumptive life lived together after a hardship/trialing challenge/campaign. To be the Mario and Peach that sit at the end of Paper Mario and watch the fireworks. The Superstar Saga end credits that encompasses a return to home. I want to be a part of that. I hope. I dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this post is weird, but I felt compelled to write it - I only hope that you all find your adventure and your end credits, and don't squander the role and become forgotten like I have.

4769,wwrw7k,Popular-Flower,"Hi All. M 22 here. Need advice from the Reddit community.

I'm having a very very hard time admitting to the feeling that I'm lonely, however, I'm not alone. I'm kind of a charismatic guy who's been pretty famous in his high school and senior year. But post 2019, things fell apart. My crush (who played hot n cold throughout) finally admitted that she isn't sure about us. My father lost his manufacturing plant due to a faulty hardware and we had to let go of the entire factory in order to clear the debt of the hardware. My entirely family is surviving on an OKayish salary of my brother. I'm preparing for my entrance in an MBA program at the same time I'm handling the store which my father opened post our hardware loss.

I'm pretty joyful, comic and love to make people laugh, but never ever I've been asked if I'm OK?! I feel real shame to tell people that I'm having a hard time coping up. In order to dodge anxiety and rushing thoughts, I drown myself in studies and practice questions, I'm thoroughly burnt out. My friends and family look up to me for solutions because they know If i can't provide a solution, may be I can provide them laughter. But now I'm getting jittery with the fact that I'm doing all I can and I'm the one who's getting spent in the process. I have growing hatred for those who are doing better than me(I never ever used to be jelous/have hatred for anyone who's doing better). It feels like they all should also suffer the same thing I'm going through. Both the Angel and Demon in my head are rushing from point A to B, I'm mot able to rest.

Any advice would help. Thanks for giving me time. Sorry for the rant.",2022-08-24 19:07:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1580153257,2,/r/lonely/comments/wwrw7k/admission_of_being_human/,,0,1,Admission of Being Human
4770,wws03n,Natural_Election1357,"im 13 and i'm in a process of recovery and doing very well,  except for the fact that im always lonely. im the quiet type and have always struggled socialising with other people. my only friends i have ever had are about 3 people who are the type that are friendly to yes, and we consider each other friends, but you dont hang out with them. and then theres my best friend: our relationship has always been on and off, probably because we're complete opposites. she likes to be around people, is very loud, and is good at making friends - the complete opposite of me. id always be trailing behind her following her around while she ran off to talk to others. i just wanted to be with her. not so  surprisingly, i've recently been shed some light on how obsessed i am with her. i wont get into all the details but its intense. im very attached to her. i still follow her around even when she hurts me. shes not a bad person, she just doesnt know how much it really effects me when she stops talking to me. i give her space though, dont take it the wrong way. i just keep all my feelings to myself. 

she does this thing with friendships where she sticks with one person or group, and everyone else gets nothing really. when its me she sticks with, i feel beyond happy. i feel like ive won the lottery. but when she moves on, i always fall into a depressive episode. this has happened again and again over the years and ive never voiced any of this to her. she knows i get jealous sometimes, but thats about it.  

I've not been at school for almost a year (i go back in 2 weeks) so we haven't talked a lot. in fact we talk maybe once a week and its  always  me who reaches out. if i didn't i don't think we'd speak again. 

i really dont know what to do. is the friendship still salvageable? do i need to let her go completely? i dont think i have the strength to if so.

4774,wws9xd,YoongzJams,"after 4 years of not having friends i found a friend a year ago. we talk, we have fun. a couple months back i even attended their birthday party with 8 people! it went amazing, i socialized pretty successfully. a couple weeks back i hanged out with my friend and their partner, wasn't that bad, since they were high. the day after that me and my friend went to a concert and they've met their friends there. overall my social anxiety and confidence has gotten so much better. i thought i was finally normal, like other people.
so yesterday my friend invited me to play dnd with some people, i only knew them, their partner and someone from the concert, who i exchanged like 2 words with back then. most ppl knew each other, though my friend met 3 of them literally yesterday.
so anyway, there were like 5 strangers, 7-8 people total and we were sitting on the floor in a circle. at first it was alright, not too good, but i thought it could improve. since i was making a character for the dnd i wasn't particularly focusing on the people talking (honestly not really cause of that, rather because i was already feeling left out). so it continues for like an hour of them talking and me just sitting there. and then it starts, i start feeling more and more like an impostor and a viewier. and it was so hilarious to onlook the situation from my perspective. funniest thing ever was when the circle closed on me. god, truly hilarious. when ""we"" started playing dnd, the host told us to get closer to the board and there is it! the punchline! the comedic relief! the cliché! everyone gets closer and im on the sidelines, looking at their backs. funnniest shit ive ever heard. props to my friend though for telling them to make space for me. and even before that i was crying, but that made it even worse. then like maximum 10 mins later we are already playing a scenario, and the host (my friend) asks something like ""why did you want to go to this island"". 2 people answer and my friends tries to asks me the question, but there's a person loudly joking around with another dude and they don't hear it. and when they quiet down i don't even have an answer, all i have to say is ""i don't know"", barely was able to say ""need to think, haha"" as a weird attempt at socialization. and for like 10 minutes i was sitting there crying, while there were literally people in front of me like a meter away from me. fortunately/ unfortunately over years i developed something you could call a ""talent"": the ability to cry without any expressions. the amount of times i have cried in front of people without them seeing is astonishing. anyway, i went to the bathroom and locked myself in there. and im standing there for 20 minutes having an anxiety attack and crying. my whole face and eyes were red, i had snot coming out of my nose. so i clean myself up and put on the best front, after 10 minutes of trying to talk myself into getting out of the bathroom, i finally do (though not to put too much credit on me, i only came out, because someone wanted to go to the toilet, if not that i don't know how much longer i would've stood there). so im packing up and one person asks why am i leaving, i can't find anything to lie about so i just stick with the ""i don't know"", they ask again and i answer the same. so i leave. 
but god, that was awful, just sitting there, being a bystander, genuinely pretty much the same as just watching a youtube video or other people. except you know you are not supposed to be there, you know you don't belong, you don't understand their references of some bizzare meme in your country, you don't understand the slang of your language, you don't know the people they are talking about and you don't even know them. and all you can do is sit there and watch. because they are exactly the people i see in the city, the people i get jealous of and think how i'd die to be them. and even when you are inside the group you'd be jealous of, you still think how much you'd do to be them. to have the privilege of not having to build you connections from the start, just knowing them from your neighborhood, school or from your friends. to just know people. not having to spend your formative early teenage years isolated from any form of communication, except digital. i skipped school from when i was 12 to when i was 14, in that period of time i didn't talk to anybody, i didn't go outside for months, my parents didn't even talk to me, i didn't know what are my peers into or the way the speak. and now i have to build everything from the start. and im tired, im so tired of this cycle repeating, trying to find friends and failing, everytime. i had to spend 4 years to find a single friend and i don't know how much longer can i continue on doing this.
but how awful it was to be crying in the bathroom whilst hearing people laughing and having fun. wishing to be them. why would i ever think that i could get better, that i could fit in, god, i can't even fit in with the people who don't fit in. i felt like such an impostor. and now they are at a concert and i'm crying again. the concert isn't gonna end for 2 more hours. i was supposed to go to it too, i was invited by my friend as well. i just want to have a friend group, i just want to not have to try so hard to get friends, not have to use all of myself to try. to ""just have them"".",2022-08-24 19:23:33,lonely,t5_2qjny,1529605069,2,/r/lonely/comments/wws9xd/worst_day_of_this_year_feeling_like_an_impostor/,,0,5,"worst day of this year, feeling like an impostor for trying to pursue friendships"

I’m 18 just started uni+work but most people around my age in my country and especially my social circle don’t work. I work a lot bc i my parents don’t get as much income as they did bc of covid and if i work it’d help them. I know i don’t get a crazy amount of money but at least it is something and I’m trying my best. So i work a lot I barely get to have free time and hangout with my friends. I’m also doing an internship along rn bc i got this offer and it will be beneficial for my future so this makes me even more busy. Basically i have no holidays bc i work everyday after uni and 10am-10pm on weekends 🙂 

But the reason i have to work hasn’t really been given to my friends( i feel like it’s too personal) and now they don’t understand they feel like i never make time and prioritize them

Yes. I’m exhausted. I talked to my dad he is a very extreme kinda person he never tell me i’m already doing good. He always say i’m not even close together the real point people get exhausted

I talked to my mom. she is also extreme, she always gets too sensitive about things. If i tell her i’m tired. She’d want me to quit everything or she’d get stressed. But i can’t :(

4780,wwt7a1,OkAnnual1631,"Hi! I'm David, I'm from Scotland, I'm 17, and I'm a loner so often it brings me down so quick yet I've felt like this for almost a year now.  I used to enjoy a bunch of friendships online but all of those faded away except one but honestly they're not in person so it doesn't count.  I do have some people in school that I could consider friends, but I wouldn't say they are very good to be honest, they can get mad at me, make me feel uncomfortable, and don't seem to be there for me when I'm feeling down.  I guess what my point is I'm not completely lonely but I'm really far under par compared to the average amount of friendship someone has in my eyes, yeah! There are probably millions of other teens out there who are also lonely and probably have NO friends but I always have to put up with walking into school, walking to a class, or be in a class and just see all of the other friendships around me! People hanging out, probably best friends and do stuff outside school but I feel like I'm always the only one in my class that hasn't got any friends and its the most horrible thing ever! Especially if your doing work in partners and you're the odd one out, it's terrible and brings me down to where I just don't wanna go to school or college anymore :(

I guess I could tell you all some issues I have, I'm pretty anxious around others, I know how mean people can be sometimes and I hate people making fun of me mostly because I have no friends around me! I'm pretty shy sometimes to talk to others, including girls because that's who I prefer to be my friend, and I just don't like being in a group, because most of the time It's either that the other people are best friends with each other, or they just don't include me enough! I prefer a kinda 1 2 1 friendship rather than a group friendship but it's really hard to find a class, or any club or activity where there is other lonely people I can get introduced to.  I guess I just wish there was one day where a lonely person or any kind and friendly person could just see how I feel and would be my friend, I guess on the other hand they would probably have to have similar interests as well! I'm kinda into videogames, game making, and arcade attractions.

I know I should join in on any friendly group I see, but I don't like joining groups, There's no one in my school I can be friends with because they don't match me being a loner which would make the friendship easier to develop, I don't wanna join a club because there's too many friendships already developed so it's too hard to find a perfect opportunity! And I don't wanna join an online group either because like I said I prefer 1 2 1 and I tried it once and still didn't make any friends! Very sad :(

So I'm guessing I'm here to ask, is there any other easier way I can make friends and be able to meet them and hang out with them in person? At least is there a way without me having to put myself out through a scary situation with major chance of rejection or unmatched interests and personality? I am currently in the road to getting a local befriender and a virtual buddy, but both would probably not be considered a true friend! Someone told me once they told the school nurse they were lonely and the nurse paired them with people to be friends with, wonder if something like that was possible, I don't have a nurse though in my school I think and it's my last year there anyway. (Please comment if you know a way or website/app I can use to make a new best friend).",2022-08-24 20:01:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1608314193,1,/r/lonely/comments/wwt7a1/is_there_any_other_way_i_can_make_friends/,,0,1,Is there any other way I can make friends?

I feel horrible most of the time with jer because she just hates me basically, sometimes I’ll just be minding my own business and I’ll annoy her. I suffer from bipolar disorder and she’ll call me psycho/ crazy, I’m overweight so she calls me fat, I’m a loner and laughs at me for having no friends, she sometimes even wishes I was dead. She calls me all these names when she’s mad and it breaks me inside a little more every time and it’s been 20years (since she was born basically lol) but when she’s nice she’s super cool and I forget everything but it never last long.

4794,wwupmt,MontezTheGreat,"Long story short I had 2 best friends. One guy (30M) who I would hangout with all the time and another guy (24M) I would talk to all the time. They both dropped me a year and half ago because my mental health was getting worse and I had no awareness of it. Little did I know at the time that my past was more fucked and traumatic up than I thought bc where I from a lot of shit was normalized in toxic ways. It started to affect the friendships. I have taken full accountability and got therapy. Today I am pretty much aware of everything that goes on in my head and got control. Most of the things I do are all mental improvement and has to be healthy.

The guy who I would hangout all the time with I knew for 5 years but came to find out he was fake asf after he dropped me. We both had the same career paths, both of us are dancers, both are big music lovers, etc. 

The guy (the real one) I used to talk to all the time I knew since we were 16 in high school then after that he went to a university and we pretty much just talked and texted each other throughout his years in college. We knew almost everything about each other since like teen days. 

Today, I'm (25M) feeling the absence of the friendship each day. I no longer have those ppl or that person to talk to. We talk about almost anything. The girls we meet and experiences of just whatever. Lore and fandom such as comics, video games, TV shows, etc. Artistic ideas and projects. All kinds of shit. 

I have plenty of amazing friends. Like I don't have much of blood family where I'm at. So all my friends that has helped me throughout years are my family. But the friends I have right now don't have the same interests. I don't have that same closeness ya know....I love all my close/best friends so dearly. 

But now since the interests are different for a lot I feel so lonely. Like even with my own gf I try to get her into some of the shit I'm into but she's not into a lot of it. I feel like shit for feeling like this. I have all this love around me just from friends but I don't want to feel like they are not enough cuz they are but I feel so lonely.

4829,wwyv6g,Oni_The_Panda,"I’m 16, female, quite introverted. I’ve always suffered from anxiety, depression and generally low mood. I also have issues with social cues. 

I’ve never been great at maintaining friendships, all my friendships, where I see them face to face, end within 3 years of starting. 

During my time during school, I had very few friends, who I consider near and dear. I had no classes with them since I’m an over-achiever due to my Asian/Jewish family on my mother’s side and got higher results in my SATS. I always got better grades than my friends, because I used to revise a lot instead of hanging out with people, not due to any pressure to revise, but because leaving the house felt tiring and I felt too anxious. 

I’ve always tried to text them whenever I can, and I’ve listened to them when they ranted, because I genuinely worry about their safety and mental health. I wanted them to be safe. 

I have finished comp, or middle school/high school for those who don’t understand, and I thought my friends would talk to me. They barely texted me. I’ve always started conversations and it feels like I’m dragging my feet through the mud trying to maintain conversations. 

They always hung out together, always talked over phone without me, have another group chat without me, but that was all fine when we finally hung out, because I thought all these troubles would go if I just pushed myself to try and keep these friends I know I will most likely lose. 

Now, they’ve all ditched me, on the day that our results come in, the day I’ve been dreading for weeks on end. I’m scared. If I don’t do well, I won’t hear the end of it from both sides of the family, but mostly my mother’s side. I’ve told them as such, but now they’re going with other groups of people, not even inviting me. I think it’s because they think I’ll do better. I probably will because I studied but still.

I’m alone. I feel friendless. I feel as if I was a diversity check for their friends group.   

That last day we hung out stings to think about, because I thought we were all good. It’s so hard to talk and exist without my mental health tearing me away from reality. Why did I ever begin to think everything was so good just because a couple of photos of me slightly smiling existed with them by my side? Why do I keep trying to socialise even though I know it’ll end in failure. 

I feel alone. Was I just a bad friend though..? I can’t tell anymore.

For example, I'll sit next to a girl and have a good conversation, but then her other friends will come, she'll talk to them and forget me and I'll just start minding my own business. My first 3 semesters were online because of covid and I like to put the blame on this for my loneliness, but I know there's more to it since this has been a issue for longer than that. It started a few years ago in high school when my group of friends started avoiding me. They were changing, I wasn't, and it just felt like we didn't belong together anymore. I then became a wreck and would talk to nobody. Literally, some girls even made me hang out with them but I'd be silent the whole time... Idk why I did that, anyways we moved to another town but things got worse and the only people I'd talk to became my parents. I felt safe with them, I still do. They bring me love, comfort, humor, everything I can ever desire from anyone. They are my refuge as it seems all interactions I have with other people end up being pointless. Anyways, I've tried to make friends in college. I've introduced myself, I've complimented people, I've tried being funny, I just don't know what I'm doing wrong: I feel like I might just not be enough, and maybe I'm bound to end up a loner. Of course, I've learnt that I'm my best company as I've had a lot of experiences with people in my lonely years, and it just wasn't making me feel good, so I'd go back to being on my own. But now I've grown tired of it but it's like I can't get out of the bad habit of avoiding everyone. Hell, I even went to seek help from the school's psychologist but it ended up unsuccessful. I've been working all summer and I enjoyed having interactions with customers as they were the most I've ever interacted with other people.... Anyways, I just feel like an extrovert stuck an introvert's mind.",2022-08-25 00:03:40,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596930979,3,/r/lonely/comments/wwyzlt/my_parents_are_my_only_friends/,,0,3,my parents are my only friends

I got bullied many times by boys and girls and called by bad names got through a lot. Now I'm 24 I start to have a full clear view about life, tbh I feel lonely like alone and Im stressed,  I got anger issues and full of jealousy when I think about that right now there dudes and girls having the best time of their lives, here Im alone under a roof closed room with no where to go. And no I'm not seeking friends, I never had any actual real ones. I don't want friends cause eventually theyll all end up getting married and walk away. What I want is a girlfriend. It feels sad when I take a look around me and every boy and girl I knew and met and others in the public places be having the best time of their life while I'm just here alone in my room playing video games and watching behind screen wishing to be them knowing that it'll never happen. My biggest nightmare in life is that everyone will eventually marry and live their happy life, and I'm just gonna be suffering till I'm dead. Back when I was below 20 years old I never took relationships too serious I thought it's something that it'll come on its own anyway. But as I got older, it became like a trending thing everyone around is dating or chatting with his lover. Even the ones that I thought they'd never make it they actually successfully made a relationship. I'm shy person when it comes to girls and I don't have anything to talk about in mind, I forgot last time I made full conversation with a girl probably never.

4852,wx1xdm,Discloseragefilled,"Apologies for the melodramatic title but I happened to read this quote and honestly I feel this was an appropriate metaphor for how I feel. I feel like if anyone could even slightly understand how I've been feeling lately it would be here.

I've recently just got out of the hospital after having a mental and emotional breakdown at work. And of course my job decided to softly let me know, that I should find other work so I've been on the job hunt for weeks now and today, I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me.

I am married so you'd think the loneliness would subside or I would have someone to talk too. However, ever since I was hospitalized she doesn't talk to me. She stays on her phone or sleeps regardless of how much I try to do anything with her. If I ask her to do basic favors it's literally a 25-40% chance she does it. If I attempt to inquire to her feelings or what is wrong she simply denies anything is wrong or doesn't say anything. I don't yell, I don't argue and even when I'm most frustrated I just take deep breaths and walk away because if I bring up what's bothering me there's 100x explanations as to why the behavior is acceptable and by the end of the conversation I feel like a jackass even bringing it up. I don't know how I can be more supportive than I am already doing.

There's this space that keeps filling up with all the things we don't talk about and even when I bring that up, it's just ""Okay."" Even I try and push her to say anything she will just fucking stare at me and never address my feelings or even the urgency of my concern. And I can't entertain her sleeping all day because I know it's not good for either of us. But I'm so tired of being tired.

My biological father tried to solicit one of my exes to go to Hawaii with him, shortly after she cheated on me with not one, not two, but several guys from her college while I was overseas. Should I care? No, but I can't stop giving a shit about it. My biological mother is just.. insane. Been homeless 2-3 times due to identity theft. And through all the stuff I had been through I pushed away so many people who were genuinely trying to help me.

I'm in my 30s now just realizing that I'm just filled with unfulfilled ambition, constant regrets and just this crippling loneliness. Dreams that never will be realized. There are times I feel like I'm just fighting in vain against being a statistic. That I'm just supposed to die and my life has had no meaning other than to fight to survive. I have no family or any real friends who I can go to and the lengthiest conversations I have are with myself in my head. And the person who was supposed to be my partner in crime has completely changed from who she was when I met her.

I don't even know what else to say anymore. If it wasn't for the rent I'm paying and the workouts I've adopted overseas, I don't think I'd have it in me anymore. I'm just surviving until the universe just eventually is done with me and tosses me aside.",2022-08-25 02:18:55,lonely,t5_2qjny,,0,/r/lonely/comments/wx1xdm/i_have_no_mouth_but_i_must_scream/,,0,3,I have no mouth but I must scream.

A thief that cherry picks the best parts of you, until you are the barren tree plucked of its leaves by the crisp, harshest winter in a desolate forest that becomes your life’s stage. The thickness of the fog is your judgement personified, the thought of every decision ahead of you growing heavier as you breathe in deep, trying to choke down your self doubt to no avail, hoping to exhale a fraction of the strength you need to focus your eyes, level your head, and try to see light to no avail. You were here before, when you had color. You were here before with someone that showed you color. You can’t recall when the scenery began to change, when your white painted walls began to bleed, when every window began to close, when this violent storm born from your innermost turmoil ripped the doors right from its hinges, exposing you in your most vulnerable state. You expect the eyes to settle on you, you expect hands to aid you, but you’re met with silence, indifference, minds ignorant to your situation, to your circumstances.


It breaks you down and instills the reality that you are but one in a sea of many. You stumbled overboard and the current carried you so far out that you can wave and not be seen, scream and not be heard.

Your pain is the least of anyone’s concern. Your life is the least of anyone’s concern. You are taking your last breaths and it is the least of anyone’s concern.

4879,wx4ewz,a_lingering_silence,"Sometimes a relationship makes you lonelier than ever. Especially when you're competing against someone's memory, and the person you are with is still stuck in reverse. 

I've been in a relationship where the person claims to love me but I feel deep down I'm truly just a rebound. Been through this person's heartbreak over his ex and his brokenness was very telling that he deeply loved her and while we were together it was obvious he had not moved on one bit (even though he claims they only got married for security purposes and not for love). He tried to hide it but I was insecure all the time, paranoid over his sudden bursts of anxiety and spiraling, him denying relapsing again - - all of the classic behaviors he showed during the height of his separation with that woman (who ended up leaving him for another dude) just keep coming up despite him claiming he was over her and that he loved me truly. 


I wish I could just have that kind of exclusive, all-encompassing love though, I'm sick of always having to be just people's second choice. Of people liking me only because I tend to be there, emotionally supportive. Of being just good enough for people to try and move on from someone they actually love more but cannot have. I'm only getting a shadow of the love they have for someone else. 

I wonder how it feels like being someone's one great love - loving you for who you are, all their being just focused on you, all the people from their past nothing more than distant memory that they don't have any emotion left for and would never compare to what they feel for you.

4894,wx6abg,ljacks0264,"Let me preface this by saying that I am in NO way being braggadocios or “full of myself.” 

I pride myself on being the type of person that doesn’t say how good of a person or friend I am. I let my actions do the talking. I prove it each and every day. At age 29, I’ve met a lot of people in my life. And I’ve had far too many come in and out of my life. But I’ve never understood why people end up treating me the way that they do. 

People tell me all the time how I’m an amazing friend and they think it’s awesome having a friend they know they can depend on and trust. Yet, somehow I either get tossed to the side for some asshole that will just use them for whatever they can provide and once they’re bored, they’re on to the next, or a situation is engineered to give the other person an excuse to stop associating with me. I don’t get it. I’m not a bad person. I’m extremely generous. I go out of my way to help others. If you pick up the phone at 3am, I’m there no matter what. I’m the person you can come to with your darkest secrets or deepest fears. I’m the one who will protect your name when you’re not in the room. But almost every “friend” that had entered my life, has crossed me and left me hanging high and dry. It baffles me almost as much as it hurts me. 

I keep telling myself that I’m just going to start being the asshole that doesn’t give a shit about anyone. But, the truth is I don’t have it in me. I’m not built that way. I can’t help it. I am who I am and I can’t change the foundation of my personality and character. And it’s literally the one thing that’s hurting me. What makes it worse is knowing that I don’t deserve it. 

I hate isolation. I’m at my absolute lowest mentally when I’m isolated and don’t associate with anyone. I try so hard to keep from isolating myself because of the feeling I get when I’m alone. I don’t need to go into the specifics because everyone in this subreddit knows what I’m talking about. But it’s looking like I don’t have a choice. Because if I don’t isolate myself, I’m going to keep getting hurt. I just wish someone actually gave a damn about me like I give a damn about them. People say they care, but their actions speak for themselves. This world and this life can be so unfair. So hurtful. Sometimes, I wish I could just go away.

4901,wx7agi,BushKidScopedU,"To anyone out there struggling with lonliness, this is my experience.

Ever since I was a child I was very mature and very introspective. I found myself reading a lot of Nonfiction and even reading lots of psychology to include Laing, Jung, Adler, etc. I played soccer throughout my childhood and high school years. I started self teaching myself Spanish and picked up the guitar and piano and learned classical composition all before high school. During high school I was well known for how I articulated myself and how friendly I was. Behind the scenes I was a care giver for my grandfather with dimentia and dealing with my parents fighting all the time about money and how we were poor. Throw all that out the door. I hit college and realized none of that matters. I worked multiple jobs to put myself through college until I couldn't afford it. 2 years a physics major eventually switching to philosophy on my third year to do undergrad research on ZFC set theory and logic based mathematics. Without the ability to pay for the 4th year, I worked until I could pay it off. I couldn't pay it off. I joined the navy. I've been in 4.5 years and seen two people in my division of 14 people kill themselves and one other that attempted suicide. Everyone in my command knows me for being a very positive person and trustworthy person to confide in. I've been rejected by about 25 to 30 women my entire life with only 1 girlfriend who cheated on me after 3 years. Why does all this even matter? Because the point I'm trying to make is loneliness exists for everyone no matter your life, education, failures, and success. We just have become unfamiliar with it due to social media and the constant overfilling of a cup of culture and society at our very fingertips as we remain connected at all times. We have learned to reflect on our lives through the vision of others which we only percieve through likes, comments, videos, etc. We think people aren't lonely because we assume that the overwhelming approval through social media and even in the rare instances of people hanging out together in daily life which doesn't occur very often due to work schedules and time constraints means that we are lonely more often than others. The key to pushing this lonliness aside in my opinion is to remain positive and be a sense of light to other people even in your most overwhelming moments of negative emotion. I always take a step back, even when about a month ago, a beloved friend of mine and former shipmate killed himself. I said infront of my division, which they know I say every few weeks, ""Everyday is a blessing."" To which someone said, ""Why say that now?"" I said, ""Because it's a blessing to mourn someone so important to us even if it's a better blessing to have them here everyday. It means we found someone that actually mattered to us and made us feel welcome in such a lonely world."" I'm hoping you all one day realize that lonliness is the same as solitude, it just takes a strong will to learn to enjoy your own time with yourself through passions and hobbies. Invest time into yourself and find something that brings you happiness because if you can make yourself smile, laugh, or have any positive emotion, you'll see that solitude strengthens the heart. Sometimes nowadays I will be making an entire song at my apartment for fun and realize 6 to 8 hours later that I've been smiling and enjoying myself almost the entire time. That's how you fight lonliness, get in touch with your own self. I hope you all have a wonderful week and I hope my experience and opinions atleast give you a better outlook on life and dealing with lonliness. I love you all and I do mean that with all my heart.

4915,wx960m,Brit_in_NZ,"I'm getting tired of stepping out into the void in search of my soulmate. I know she's out there, looking for me too, hoping to meet the one who really makes her feel special and worth something to someone.  I guess we all want that, to find a connection with someone and actually matter to them, to not just have flippant comments passed to us, but to find someone who actually gives a damn. Perhaps she's reading this and is feeling the same way...

Over the years I've reached out but always seem to come up empty handed, as if my grip isn't strong enough as I feel them slip through my fingers. A connection becomes a memory, a memory that fades into nothing but a long forgotten name of someone I used to know. Stumbling across an old picture that sparks the memory of a feeling of being content with my world, a fullness if you will.

I know that everything happens for a reason, it's something that I truly believe in. The heartbreak of a failed marriage, a child sobbing and begging me not to leave, but knowing that to stay would result in an environment a child should never have to endure. A relationship, albeit long distance, that meant so much only to have it torn away and feeling like I was kicked to the gutter. More encounters that ultimately end in hurt and pain, rejection.

These are the lessons that life gives us to test our resolve, a journey of self discovery. A way of finding out just how much one can handle, while all along, others seem to sail through life. I'm sure they have their own battles, whether it be money, career, health, family... I read through the comments here and sometimes reach out, but I know I'm not alone.

But, I can't help but feel that at 46, time is running out for me, that perhaps I am destined to live out my days alone. If that's what my future holds, then I'm just about on the verge of acceptance. I'm tired of chasing what is seemingly becoming an impossible dream. Perhaps I'm looking for someone who truly doesn't exist, seeking too much.

People say that perhaps not trying at all would be the best way to move forward, and perhaps they're right. My longing to be with someone has consumed me to the point of despair, but perhaps it's time for me to leave things alone and let fate decide instead of trying to force something that may never happen.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I think that perhaps writing this down has been a kind of release for me, helped things seem a little more real. Perhaps I just needed to finally admit to myself that this for me, may be all there is.",2022-08-25 09:05:22,lonely,t5_2qjny,1614128254,0,/r/lonely/comments/wx960m/getting_used_to_emptiness/,,0,1,Getting Used To Emptiness...

I'm a 41 year old guy,  and all of my friends are coupled up, married or have kids. I spend Monday to Friday completely alone (I work from home), and the knowledge that weekends are no different for me while everyone else is together compounds my isolation further. Sure, I could do things to pass the time: go for a walk, go to a movie, go to dinner, play video games, see a show... but it would all be by myself. Also it is unavoidable to see others at some of these activities - groups of people, families, couples - which makes me feel more lonely despite being there alongside them. 

I had plans with a friend for Friday night, but she's just canceled on me. So now I'm waiting for that familiar depressing feeling to hit me at 5pm, the same one that arrives every Friday and doesn't leave until Monday morning.

But, for some reason, I'm just not quite as happy or content when I'm with others as when I'm by myself.

I wouldn't say I'm depressed by any means, I have just come to understand the world and our society as I see it with my very own eyes.

No matter how hard I try to ""be myself"" in this world, even while living in a society that never fails to condition and shape its inhabitants to live up to an impossible standard that is never-ending and always changing, and frankly, shouldn't even exist in the first place, I find myself constantly ""going along to get along"".

I don't enjoy giving into this, but I find that when I replicate the behavior and mannerisms of those whom people look to set the standards by which one is deemed ""cool"" or ""weird"", I do incredibly well and the benefits can be very clearly seen.

Well, this seems great on the surface, right? Some of the people reading this post so far probably think I'm a conceited asshole.

But, before you make your final judgments, please hear me out.

I have grown to be an adversary of this artificial happiness derived from social pleasures.

Do I enjoy my time alone and traveling because there's less stress and drama? Or is it because I'm not constantly trying to live up to societal standards and do the ""right"" thing to help get me to where I ""should"" be going.

I don't feel like I'm running from anything in my life, but when I travel alone and see what this wonderful country has to offer in terms of just physical beauty and awe, I just feel at peace and completely stress-free.

4999,wxq4js,Strike_OW,"Hey there folks.

I am still lost for words and need to write all of this down or I think I will spiral at some point. My girlfriend (f25) broke up with me (m24) three months ago. 

We were together for 8 years and experienced all the highs and lows you can imagine. There was love, death, care, grief, fights, laughs, just everything. We lived together in three different apartments and had our life planned into late adulthood.
I had her for 1/3 of my entire life and she influenced the person I am today pretty heavily.

The reason for the breakup is a loss of feelings. I can't understand how this even happens. But I know I have to accept the fact that this is end.

She is the perfect woman in every way imaginable. She made me a better man and I always tried my best to match her qualities. 

I want to hate her for all the pain she is causing me. But I can't do that. It's not her fault. She even wants to stay in contact and remain friends but I dont think I can do that. I will always think there is hope. 

The worst thing is that we still live together. The circumstances and money have made it impossible for her or me to move out until now. But she will be gone in two weeks.
When that happens I will instantly start NC. 

I know, I know I should do it for healing and self improvement primarly but I still hope she will reach out soon enough and realise that she made a mistake. Because love is just one crazy hell of a drug, isnt it?

I tried my best to keep in contact with her during the summer but it seemed like she along with the others in the friend group didn’t seem to care about me any longer. I asked for advice on here in a different sub Reddit and many people said to just remove them from social media and focus on myself. I did exactly that and the girl that I was super close with ended up finding out and came back to basically talk shit to me. She posted on her story how much of a shitty friend I was and how she was literally just using me. im so confused and hurt. That was only half of the stuff she said to me. The other stuff was in my private messages and it was way worse that I’m not even sure if I can share it here.

5004,wxr4ur,Sickofchildren,"I’m turning 17 next week. I’ve always been the weird nerdy kid and never found socialising easy or enjoyable. I’m not athletic or introverted. Most people think I’m strange and I don’t know why. All of the friendships I have are very shallow. I think this is because I’ve had a difficult childhood that they can’t relate to because they are in well off families in nice areas. I always feel like the idiot of the friend group because I’m not the type to study 6 hours a day and I’m considered to be very “eccentric”. I swear and use Yorkshire slang a lot as well and I must come off as being a dullard to them. 

My childhood and life has been hard and I’ve spent most of it on the poverty line in abusive households. My friends from advanced classes cannot relate to this and I don’t feel like I can talk about my life with them because it comes off as too intense. Let’s just say I know how to take a beating and I’m not scared to give one back so to my friends I seem like some kind of nutcase. 

The people who could relate to my life think I’m too nerdy. I’m left in limbo. I’m an introvert so trying to socialise is hard.

I’m not lonely in the sense that I don’t have friends/ family, or in the sense that people don’t like me, or that I have nothing to do. I’m lonely in a weird way. It’s like, despite having friends, going on dates, spending time with family every week, and being genuinely happy to be doing the things that I love in life during my free time (traveling, painting, film etc)….. I still feel like I have absolutely no connection with anyone, that no one truly gets me, and that my soul is unseen. I know that I am loved.. but I never feel a warm halo of love. I know if I explain myself enough, people get what I’m saying. But I never feel like they truly feel it and understand it on the same level as me. I’ve had connections with people throughout my life, but I’ve never felt really connected, I’ve never felt understood, or truly in a moment with another human. It’s like there is a deeper layer I feel is supposed to happen, where you’re in the moment with someone and just connected… I’ve never felt that with another person. It’s so hard to explain. I’m 25, I’ve had the same best friend my entire life, she knows everything about me, likes and dislikes, and have gone through all my losses with me and vacations and everything. But I feel still like she has no idea who I am. Same with family. Ex boyfriends. I can spend so much time with everyone and still feel completely alone, not understood, vacant, with no connections with another person. Even though I have stuff in common with everyone, my soul feels absolutely alone, and so lonely, constantly. Hungry for a connection. How can this be, and what can I do to fix it?

5012,wxsekl,ila_____,"Hey there! 

I'm an introverted person so I've always had few friends, I would get sad sometimes because of it but at the end of the day it wasn't a big deal. I finished high school a little over two years ago and after that I lost several friendships that I used to have, mostly because we simply grew apart and stopped making an effort to keep in touch. I'm in college, so during the school year I'm busy all day and that means that I don't really notice how lonely I am, but I'm still on summer break now and it's getting so hard to get through my days. I do everything by myself, because the very few friends that I have are all on vacation with their own friends and I'm not gonna lie, I feel very pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I love and need my alone time, but it has become too much even for me. The latest trigger was one of my best friends telling me that she just met a guy and they're in the talking stage, I am happy for her, I really am, but that doesn't mean that I don't feel even worse for myself (of course I would never tell her that). I know it's selfish and I feel guilty about it, but I can't help it. 

Another problem is that I'm starting to feel even more out of place when I'm around people, I've always felt like I was different and didn't really fit in but again, it has become so much worse lately : I could be surrounded by my two best friends and a few other people and I'd still feel lonely, like my body is there but my mind is elsewhere, all alone. (keep in mind that I often go through depressive episodes, so this might explain some things). 

Anyway, I'm writing all of this here because I have no one to tell, I feel uncomfortable opening up to my family or my closest friends. Maybe let me know if some of you are in a similar situation please? I'd love to read someone else's experience, if you feel like sharing it xx",2022-08-25 23:04:32,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596830326,25,/r/lonely/comments/wxsekl/struggling_mentally_but_i_cant_tell_anyone/,,0,9,Struggling mentally but I can't tell anyone

5020,wxtbzo,__Suspect__,"Hi, I have been struggling with this recently and I have  some ideas on where to start, but I'd like some more opinions. I'm a 20 year old fat guy, approximately 120 Kg (260~ pounds), I have a serious case of neckbeard that I constantly tell myself to shave but I never do it because I'm really lazy, my skin is really bad, I have these welts that are only there because I keep poking at acne or other weird stuff that shows up on my face but i just poke them because I dont really know what to do and I'm not really sure why they show up since I don't really have a problem with hygiene in general (except the shaving part), I have a natural scowl all the time but it just makes me look weird and creepy, I have serious issues with my self image but by the time I was willing to do something about it I just didn't have the time (still want to go to a gym when I have the time but right now I don't), I guess my facial features aren't half bad but fat makes me look really bad, my hair is not bad but I don't cut it regularly and dont use a brush so its really unruly but it ends up looking fine, I usually dress in mostly black or gray clothing, a hoodie when I can wear it without melting (Im from Brazil it gets really hot in here) and a heavy metal band t-shirt almost all the time, usually on top of the hoodie, and jeans in either grey, black or regular blue. For physical appearance, which, at least to me, is what is mostly holding me back, that's it. As for myself as a person, I procrastinate a lot, but I have been fixing that and made huge progress on it, so much so that I basically have no time to procrastinate or do anything else this last year, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I am going to therapy regularly and taking some meds, I am really awkward when first talking to people but when I feel like I can actually trust/talk to them I rarely shut up if I can find what to talk about without feeling like an idiot, and even then I end up saying stupid shit just for attention, I am a huge fan of heavy metal, Iron Maiden in particular, I really like playing video games and I like reading a lot, but nowadays I've only been reading fantasy or sci fi stuff, I am easily manipulated into thinking something else by someone with stronger conviction than me, as mentioned above I'm really insecure in about my body so I have a easier time talking over voice chat on discord where people can't see me, since I've always played video games, I never really been into other forms of media beacuse I find them boring other than reading, so I don't have a lot in common with most people, I don't like/use/watch/read etc: anime, manga, tv series, movies, social media in general outside of reddit and discord, music that's not metal or some variation of it with a few exceptions (I don't think my taste is better, I just don't find anything else enjoyable and I don't think less of someone for liking something else or not liking metal), I'm a virgin and have never even hugged, kissed, held hands or formed any sort of romantic relationship with anyone, I'm not 100% sure on my sexuality but I can't really find the masculine form attractive in any way no matter how much people say that someone is beautiful I just can't see it if they are masculine in appearance, I really don't know what more I can write and I'm not even sure if someone is going to read this,  but feel free to ask anything that I may have missed.

5040,wxwd1h,AccomplishedWasabi42,"Let me clarify what I mean by “like” by telling you a little bit about my situation. 

I’m a rising senior in college and my semester doesn’t start for three weeks. I don’t have a job at the moment, or anything academic or financially pressing going on, although it is finals week of the summer semester, and students are completing exams, projects, and what not. I’m not as I went on study abroad to France for the summer, which was great! To not go so much into it, while in France, I made friends, learned more about my chosen academic field (English Literature + Creative Writing), and never felt—you know lonely or alone for most of it, (we were in close proximity to each other most of the time, all living in France essentially on our own, went to school land did many outside social activities with each other because our main friend groups weren’t there, etc.) although lonely and alone I feel are two separate things. 

Like when you’re alone, it’s something you typically choose and you’re spending a certain amount of time with just yourself. Being lonely is something you don’t choose, or at least consciously choose. It could be also enforced by external factors. The way I perceive loneliness (and I can be completely wrong here, I’m not a psychologist or therapist…) is a number of different psychological factors including past traumas have imprinted on your behavior along with certain external behavior and/or criteria to unknowingly lead you into this condition. 

Like for me, I have trouble trusting people because I have trauma from past friendships were I felt manipulated and/or betrayed by friends. And in my college, where the semesters go by fast, and education is all about preparing you for the rat race (job market), it can hard to create and maintain friends when you’re worried about your GPA or getting large quantities of homework on time. Still though people do, and since coming back from France, I haven’t had a real desire to hang out with anyone socially. 

In a way, I like being alone because I’m the only one in my life I trust, maybe besides my parents or therapist. Having conversations with them for the most part feels safe. I don’t have to be on guard for anything and I don’t have to worry about what they think of me behind my back, what they may be planning, what might change. As you can see, I’m a very self-conscious person, and my therapist and parents do do the things I stated above. But that doesn’t change things for me. I’m happy with my books and writing and all my other interests. I rain checked going out clubbing with a friend because I had this idea in my head she was hanging out with me out of pity, for the sad man I am. I somehow got it into my head that she didn’t want to hang out with me, that I’d be a nuisance in her life, despite when running into her a week earlier she wanted to hangout sometime. But inside, I was thinking maybe I should cancel for the sake of her grades or something. I know that’s pretty sad, but she talks about her grades and the honor college and all this academic gobbledygook all the time and sometimes so do I, mind you in a slightly different way, and I guess my mind rationalized this irrational move as being a good move. And I don’t mind spending my Saturday reading and writing and what not, even though I really liked clubbing in France. I guess I’m content when I’m lonely in a way where I don’t have to think about other people and it gives me more freedom too, but not more freedom to be myself. This whole rant could be exaggeration and abstraction anyway. It’s the dog days of the summer, people will finish and exams and be free to hang out soon.",2022-08-26 02:01:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1596301702,1,/r/lonely/comments/wxwd1h/does_anyone_actually_like_being_lonely/,,0,1,Does anyone actually “like” being lonely?
5041,wxwjyh,Lonely_Monody,"I had a group of 6 friends during my sophomore and junior year. Some things happened and I realized they didn’t care about me the same way I cared about them, so I left our group chat and no one bothered to contact me at all. That was fine. It’s what I wanted. 

Then I went to a writing camp. I somehow became friends with everyone there and I felt like I actually belonged. The thing is, the friends I made there live hours away, so it’s extremely hard for us to meet up. 

School started again. It’s my senior year and the friends I previously had, haven’t said a word to me. In fact, no one besides teachers have talked to me. 

The second I wake up I start thinking. There are no distractions so I can’t stop thinking. My head isn’t the best company either. I’m severely depressed and my anxiety is worse than ever. The week already began and I already had to leave early so that I don’t get a panic attack. Simply being in school gives me anxiety, pair that with depression, and oh– I relapsed. A lot.

5054,wxy1qz,[deleted],"Another depressing night laying on my couch doing nothing. Try to play a video game, lose interest; try to watch something, can't keep my attention on it; end up just listening to sad music and drinking which only makes this endless feeling spiral worse. The feeling of depression is getting worse nightly because not only are all my friends out on dates and spending time with their significant others while I'm completely alone, but August and September was the time last year my first girlfriend broke up with me so those feelings of hopelessness are resurfacing. 

I truly crave a relationship, someone to spend time with and devote my all to. I want to watch movies with someone, I want to play video games and fall asleep on call with someone again. I feel so hollow and empty and the only reason I haven't ended my own life is because of the fear of being dead as well as my cats. I crave affection and its all I want to live for. Some people want a fulfilling job, wealth or a career, for me my desire is to have someone to care for and love endlessly.

 I feel like at 27 my time span is truly running out. I've only ever had one ""real"" relationship in person, a few online relationships that ended poorly and I have so much I want to experience with someone at my side. I have no interest in experiencing new things alone.. I'm not sure if that makes sense to anyone but I just feel like without someone to share new things with I don't have motivation to actually get out of my depression and soon it will devour me whole.

5064,wxz6vl,Wr005user,"I am having this problem of being upset with myself for not being myself around people. As a result I choose to be by myself physically and emotionally whenever possible. 

I take great interest, as a habit, in listening to people with the utmost care and respect when interacting with them, but deny expressing myself or being genuine for fear of being vulnerable in any sort of way and also I kinda tend to make space in the conversation for the issues that the person talking to me is concerned with rather than prioritising mine, however overwhelmed I am with them. It has happened so often that I have been think that is my nature, never questioning it in any way. I should probably address that, but for now, as a first step, how do I get out of this cycle of:

1. Trying to be around people, 
2. Not being myself, 
3. Hating myself for it, 
4. Being alone for a while because some or most of the people I met with aren't worth the trouble, 
5. Repeat step1 because I am alone and should be capable of interacting with the outside world.

Now that I am a little bit conscious of this aspect of myself I try to be genuine in little ways, like not agreeing with every single comment and giving my own take on it, like, I never used to give my opinion when a higher up talks about stuff to me but now I try to do so in casual settings and I tried to reduce how I tend to hide aspects or details of myself intentionally for fear of being vulnerable etc., Now I try to see what the other person says so I can learn about how sound my choice about something is... Like, Either I agree or disagree with their comment and I am capable of deciding whether I want it to remain my choice or to learn from the comment.


Problem is... These are all little stuff, when something bigger or stressful comes up I go back to my cycle... More often than not I am in my cycle rn even though I am conscious of it.

I'm not the most outgoing person and I can be really socially awkward at times, but I guess I do have some charisma and a good sense of humor so talking to people and making friends isn't hard for me and I'm fairly well liked by the people around me. Regardless I still consider myself insanely lucky to have the friends I have. They are the fucking coolest, kindest, genuine, most selfless people Ie know who do nothing but give back and I love them like family. Amd it's not like I have trouble opening up. I've had some of the deepest conversations of my life with them and they've helped me realize things about myself that I didn't even realize and sometimes it catches me off guard how well they know me, and I like to think I know them at least somewhat well too. 

I don't get it. We hang out like almost every day, and I always enjoy it, but at the end of the day I go home and it gets late and I just feel so fucking lonely and distanced and separated from everyone, like nobody actually understands me, which is stupid to think because like what more could I fucking ask from them.  A while ago for like a 2 week period one of my friends would have me sneak out to his place every night and he'd smoke me out cus I was severely depressed and at high risk of relapsing on self harm and he knew it and he wanted to make sure I was safe.

I don't feel lonely in terms of friends, I can make friends easily.

I have just over 5 years for that to happen, otherwise I will embrace being single and lonely for the rest of my life. All my friends as well are getting into relationships, and doing couple shit, so it means we can't do as much as a group anymore, because they'll say they are busy with their gf's. Another group I'm friends with, only one of them has a gf, but the other 2 will get a gf sometime in the future.

5114,wy6y78,HauntedPlayer,"Idk if this will be a coherent text or not. Also I don't know where to post this, maybe a depression or releationship reddit is a better place, but lonely is what I feel the most rn.

For backround, I'm a 22 yo finnish guy and I haven't had a single irl friend since primary school. Everyone I know is from online, and even then I've lost most of them over time. I'm severly depressed and anxious and have BPD, so it's not like I'm a pleasant person to be with anyway.

I wish I had someone to be close to, someone to hang out with, literally anyone. The only people I know are family members and that's it. I've never gone to hang out with anyone, and I haven't managed to make any friends at my current school which just makes me wanna drop out again. I'm jealous of everyone who have people to do things with.

I've also had bad experiences with people in the past and got my heart broken a few times. I got pretty bad trust issues because of that which makes it even harder to make friends.

Anyway, today a thing happened and I have nowhere else to talk about it and I honestly can't handle it completely alone.

Today I woke up and got told by the love of my life that they are in a releationship now. I've been in love with this person for two years, probably a day hasn't ever gone by without thinking about them. He knew I had feelings for him, he was open to it too, but I took too long because of my anxiety and now I lost him.

I know for some it will sound dumb to be that much in love for a person you only know online, but it doesn't change my feelings. I have never been in love with anyone else this hard.

I've spent most of the day crying extremely hard and just breaking down so bad, asking for help from my very few mutuals but haven't gotten any so far. I've never felt this bad and alone in my life. I had to delete all my poetry about him too because I couldn't handle it.

I know people will say things like time heals and I might find someone else etc.

But right now, my world is burning down so fast. It wasn't a good world to begin with, but he made it bearable. Now I'm really alone. I wish I had even a friend to confide in, but Im left alone crying and no one will hold me through it.",2022-08-26 11:41:17,lonely,t5_2qjny,1404734351,5,/r/lonely/comments/wy6y78/heartbroken_and_dealing_with_it_alone/,,0,3,Heartbroken and dealing with it alone

5134,wyc090,CocoZombie,"Okay, I have some lady friends but we aren't that close and a lot of it is superficial.

""Hey how are you?"" ""I'm well you?""

There is no dumb banter like I experience when I'm with guy friends. Or sometimes when I'm with my male friends we just chat it up and talk about what's going on in our lives. 

Almost every woman I talk to it just doesn't break the surface.

I've been around guys all my life so maybe that has something to do with that? But it seems that women can be extremely fairweathered. 

I had recently made friends with this girl who i worked with. Everything was great but when I stopped working at the store, we continued to talk, but it was ALL about her. 
I opened up about this budding relationship I have with a guy, and how I shared my first kiss with him. She didn't even acknowledge that and talked about her anxiety and depression while she was out with friends to which she didn't even invite me. Sad to say but I just distanced myself from her. 

This happens too much to me. That it makes me feel like I'm just boring around women. 

No matter how hard I try to make friends with women, I struggle. I don't know if it's because I lack being a woman myself? Maybe I don't relate well to them?

I don't know. Every woman needs to have a close set of gal pals to be around right? I'm not minimizing the friendships I have with my guy friends because they fill in the role that I need in a friend regardless of gender. 

In my mind, what the hell is the difference between men and women friendships? I don't treat them any differently and I just am how I am, but I won't lie and say I get a little anxious around women because all I do is want to be friends and relate to them.

Does anyone else feel this way? What can I do?",2022-08-26 15:23:46,lonely,t5_2qjny,1425398899,6,/r/lonely/comments/wyc090/i_f30_wish_i_had_lady_friends_long/,,0,3,I (F30) wish I had lady friends [long]

5141,wyem55,Mindless-Balance-498,"Posts like this are rampant on this page right now. They completely ignore the facts that 

1. MANY people on here, myself included, are women living sad, solitary lives just like you. 

And 

2. If you live pretty much anywhere except Russia or China, your local population is almost definitely pretty close to 50/50 men and women, so your base odds are just as good as anyone else’s.

There are like twenty or thirty men to every ONE woman on the average dating app (and most of those women are probably inactive). It’s not that you aren’t matching with anyone, it’s that there’s no one to match with. Dating apps suck and men are creepy like 75% of the time.

So if you think you’re going to be able to acquire sex or intimacy like you would take-out food, I’m sorry to tell you it’s almost definitely NOT going to happen that way.

You feel lonely because the society we live in has been stripped of every single avenue for us to feel human closeness. We’re literally herd animals, but instead of living and thriving communally, we’re forced to live in tiny boxes we can barely afford and compete with each other for basic survival. You think “women” (as some unified force?) are denying you intimacy, but it’s actually every single social system we’ve built as a species in the last 400 years that’s denying us the closeness we require as humans to cope with reality.

Here’s my advice, from one very lonely 21st century asshole to another: find a hobby/passion/cause that forces you to interact with other human beings in a non-sexual, non-romantic way. Then, go do that thing WITH NO SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC GOALS. Grow as a person, get to know yourself, stop basing your self worth in other people and their approval or acceptance.

^ this is Y E A R S of work, potentially a lifetime’s worth. If you think you’ve tried this and haven’t seen results, give it another ten years.

Will that guarantee you a relationship, sex or companionship? Nope, sorry. We’re promised nothing but sunburn and death in this life 🤷🏽‍♀️ But it’ll make you less lonely, more fulfilled, and less dependent on others. You’ll probably make some friends, friends who can also hug you and love on you - friends you should value just as much as any romantic fling because that’s actually what being human is about. I guarantee you’ll have some flings along the way, it’s truly inevitable as a human with a sexual appetite who is out in the world, purely living life.

And if you’re LUCKY, you’ll find “the one”. Because most people don’t, and that’s just another hard pill that more people need to swallow and move on about. MOST of us are going to die alone, so just make friend and make it count along the way.

The only people I know who live happy, healthy, fulfilling lives, live this way. Every old and in love couple I’ve ever known, lives this way even decades into marriage. I know PLENTY of older, single, HAPPY people, and they all live this way.

BECOME YOUR OWN PERSON. The rest (whatever that’s going to look like for you), WILL follow, and its best to just accept it.",2022-08-26 17:09:44,lonely,t5_2qjny,1612572194,286,/r/lonely/comments/wyem55/guess_ill_be_a_virgin_forever_since_all_women/,,3,105,“Guess I’ll be a virgin forever since all women find me unattractive ☹️”

 But ive been way worse this past days and all i want is to talk to him bc im alone and he's literally the only person that listens to me.

But at the same time, i only have 12 days till school starts, and only 5 days until i can see him again so im thinking that i should not bother him on the little time he has left of summer.

But i have to study bc in 5 days i have exams and if i don't pass he wont be my teacher but im so tired and dissociated and depressed and i just want to self harm but i cant bc of summer. And i cant study and talking to him would make me feel less lonely and better

5161,wyi225,somestreamerguy1,"I met this girl a few months ago at a hardware store, said friend was with me and he convinced me to get her number. I did, we went out that same night, everything was going great. A couple weeks in I would call us a couple, we did normal things, kiss, sex, etc, but something always felt off to me. Every time we would have an intimate moment, she would get distant few a few days, and say she just wanted to be friends. It always confused me, but I just said ok and moved on. One night me, the girl, and said friend went on a hike up a local mountain, its about a mile, and at the end there's a big opening in the trees to watch the sunset, I drove the girl there, after the drive she said nothing to me. It was all about said friend, she was riding on his back, they were flirting with each other etc, I brought her with me so I could spend time with her, I didn't want to become the third wheel. When we got back down to the bottom of the mountain I watched them exchange numbers, really made me feel sick, I took her home, and asked what it was all about, she said they were just becoming good friends, she tried to kiss me goodbye and I pushed her away and told her to get out of my car. She got out and ran inside, I went home. That night she called me crying and said she had slit her wrists with a razor, obviously playing the victim card, I got her to calm down, and she stopped the bleeding. The next morning she told me I was out of line by being upset with her. She repeatedly manipulated me this way. Fast forward a few weeks later, she is being very distant, what she has always done, I decided to end it. That night I got a call from friends brother, telling me that he had just left to go to her house. I confronted him about it, and he said it was none of my business. Over the month or so that we had been together, he would constantly make fun of me for dating her, but as soon as I was out of the picture he got very defensive, and told me how great she was, and that I had obviously just been mistreating her. Apparently they had been talking and hanging out the entire time I knew her behind my back, it all spiraled out of control, and I no longer have a girlfriend, or my only friend. When I met her I thought I was actually going to be happy, I quit drinking, stopped using nicotine, but that didn't last. The night I split up with her, and found out my friend was going out with my now ex, I got blackout drunk and started smoking again. Nothing in my life ever goes well, I get a small taste of happiness, then I come crashing down again, into an even deeper and darker low than before.

5178,wykxaf,realshmichael,"I've commented this to a few people, so I thought I'd make a post about it.

In the book ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do"" by Amy Morin, she writes the following scenario:

&gt;Imagine a man who feels nervous about social situations. To minimize his anxiety, he avoids starting conversations with his coworkers. The less he speaks with his coworkers, the less they initiate conversation with him. When he enters the break room and passes people in the hallway without anyone speaking to him, he thinks, *I must be socially awkward*. The more he thinks about how awkward he is, the more nervous he feels about starting conversations. As his anxiety increases, his desire to avoid his coworkers also increases. This results in a self-perpetuating cycle.

If you find that you are being excluded from things, there is a very likely chance that you've set the stage previously for it - whether you're aware or not, or think you have or not.

In the case of the guy who didn't get invited for lunch, if *everybody* is going, then it's almost a certainty that they just assume you don't want to do. If you DO want to go, then speak up and ask if you can join along. If it's a large group, they'll almost definitely be agreeable and happy to have you! If it's a small private group, it could just be that they are a tight-knit group at work. By all means, ask them if you DO want to join them, but you might be putting them in an awkward spot if they were wanting it to just be them.

An easy way to start to show people around you that you want to be included is to **be the one that initiates the plans**. Ask them if they want to join you for lunch, come over for a dinner, do an out-of-work activity. Waiting around to be invited might mean it never happens, if you have come to be known as the person who typically doesn't do stuff.

I want to share how I feel (or, maybe, how I *don’t feel*)

I just don’t have feelings anymore, it is just a grey plain status mood all the time.
This make me think that my mind and body just act like this to “prevent any further damage”, like a defense mechanism. 

Let me explain better: years ago (it was early teen years if I recall correctly) I used to  feel every emotion that a normal human being should feel (happiness, sadness, joy, terror etc.) 
Now it is just… plain.

A plain dark void full of *nothing*.

I’m in my early 20s but I feel like it is over for me.. 
There are hundreds and hundreds of reasons that could led me to this status of nothingness, just too many to make them fit to a single post.

Even before we went out on the first date we started texting on what seemed to be a daily basis... It was looking pretty hopeful honestly. After a while the texting became an every other day occurrence, which is now down to every two days.

And I thought I had it ... I thought I was finally living that dream I had so long ago as a innocent child...

I used to think that I still had  self worth n that I'm worth something to someone...



 Then after 3 failed relationships and 2 attempts at trying to find someone else n them all dumping and leaving me or just not wanting to be with me but still using me for whatever ...killed that lil bit of self worth I still had for myself... losing that dream girl I thought I'd have forever...

I thought maybe something will finally work, finally someone will love me again...

5251,wyss9d,Bubbles_Green,"Warning wall of text incoming. 

So let’s start with the basics I’m a 35 year old guy with Cerebral Palsy and spend most of my time confined in a wheelchair.

I’ve dealt with various medical issues on top of the Cerebral Palsy, two different bouts of uncontrolled migraines, both ended up having different solutions that took way too long to get to.

I suffer from Anxiety and depression, some of which is the typical chemical imbalance and some of which is situational.

Due to lack of movement I’m out of shape and I’m really ashamed of it, but my disability prevents me from doing more than basic movement, I have essentially no use of my legs.

Here’s the thing, before the age of 11 I was still disabled BUT I had much more freedom, I used a walker and even competed in the Special Olympics. 

So what changed you ask? Well a quack doctor said she could “make me walk without the need for assistive devices” in reality she made me worse. She took away the mobility I did have. Now some of you might wonder why there wasn’t a lawsuit. Well I was 11 and my mom regrets not filling one but what’s done is done.

Now for the NSFW part of this post, I haven’t been in a relationship (if you could call it that) since I was 15, so about 20 years ago. I’m still a virgin and I fear (among other things) that will never change.  I’ve been incredibly lonely for years now, the few friends I do have IRL don’t come around much (even before Covid) I understand that they have lives but it’s been 4 years since I saw any of them in person.

I just needed to vent, if anyone read this whole thing I appreciate it.

P.S. I originally thought about making a throwaway for this but I figured what the hell it’s my real life and I just needed to be me.

Also I don’t expect (nor do I want) any pity, my life is what it is.",2022-08-27 03:50:42,lonely,t5_2qjny,1373190139,91,/r/lonely/comments/wyss9d/im_tired_of_acting_like_im_okay/,,1,19,I’m tired of acting like I’m okay

5253,wyt58w,wizard1234591d,"Like honestly I could say I'm in a privileged position. I'm young (22M), I have cool hobbies I enjoy (or I think they are really cool lol), I'm fit, I'm good looking, I have a really cool 6 figure job, I graduated from a prestigious college and I'm smart (not socially lmao). 

But, I'm by myself. Like, I have bad social skills (probably out of the scope of this post, but feel free to ask in the comments). I've had friends throughout my life but they all came in unique circumstances and I never had a group of friends (just individual friends). But now that, I'm done with college, I just don't know how to make friends anymore. I moved to a new area recently for my new job where I don""t know anyone and don't have any family here and I just have no idea how I'm suposed to make any friends. 

Like, I said I have cool hobbies I love, but everytime I'm doing that, I'm just by myself even though there are lots of other people there, I sometimes have small conversations with them but nothing meaningful that could lead to a friendship or even hanging out. 

Ideally, I'd like a relationship so I can have someone to love. But, I'm like asexual (heteroromantic) and even though I'd be fine having sex to please someone I care about, everytime I tried sex just ended up terribly (I can't force my body to want sex) and in the past I've had girls that I really liked but they obviously lost interest in me because of sex which hurted me. So those experiences kinda destroyed my confidence when it comes to girls and relationships  and realistically it's really hard to find someone who'd like a relationship with me because of sex.

Anyway, I enjoy the things I do with my life but I have like no one to spend time with which is kinda depressing and I don't know what to do because I'm like always active doing fun stuff but can't seem to find anyone who'd like to do anything with me other than a brief conversation.

I suffer with Depression, and with that comes a bit of anxiety. I think both really affect my ability to make friends. I feel like I’m destined to be alone, I’m “controversial” I guess, my humour is very weird, I am quite clearly unstable, at my university my reputation was disappearing into my room for several months and randomly reappearing once in a while at 4am looking like a corpse. 
I feel like there’s no point in trying to make friends because they’ll end up hating me eventually anyway. I dismiss others because I know if i invest my emotions into them I’ll end up getting hurt. 
But, even when I think I’m compatible with someone, I end up ghosting them. What is wrong with me? I can’t put effort into friendships - even low maintenance ones exhaust me, yet I feel so lonely. I have no right to feel that way when it’s my fault I’m alone.

5257,wytdk5,Lopsided-Opposite230,"Today marks the first entry in my new journal that will help me cope with my loneliness and my emotions. I've been meaning to do this for a while, but I never found the motivating drive actually to write something down in a notebook. Roughly two years ago, I experienced some nights of severe ""depression."" I would say that these nights of ""depression"" are split into two phases. From Aug 2020 - Sept 2021, most of my depressive nights would come from the fact that I'd never been in a relationship before, and I was sure I would never be in a relationship. From Sept 2021 - Jan 2022, I met a girl, went on a couple of dates, and we officially became a couple in Nov of 2021. However, she broke up with me no less than two weeks into the new year. Honestly, I'm pretty sure I have thought about our relationship in one way or another almost every day; I don't even think I can count the amount of 24-hour periods that I've gone through without thinking about the relationship on a single finger. In a sense, I tried to be the Superman/Perfect boyfriend, and I believe I fulfilled that role successfully, but that only left me alone and filled with disappointment. It kind of sucks when someone tells you, ""I never really felt like someone's girlfriend,"" when you put 95% of the effort into trying to build a meaningful relationship.

 My second stage of loneliness spans from April 2022 - Present Day. I generally believe I'm unattractive, don't have great social skills, and feel like something is always grasping me that bars me from engaging in social conversations, even though I want to be more social. I have nights when I feel the absolute worst because I'm lonely, my friends have had intimate experiences with girlfriends or flings, but I've had none. I've been single since my breakup and yearn to have someone who will genuinely like/love me. I'm nearing graduating from University, and I'm unsure if I will ever have a relationship after graduating. For now, I'll try to write in my journal about my highlights and lowlights through my ownership of the book; I'll probably talk about how my day went, too, so that my book isn't only filled with depressive thoughts. And also, thank you to whoever took the time out of their day to read my post; it really means a lot me :)",2022-08-27 04:21:43,lonely,t5_2qjny,1593471294,7,/r/lonely/comments/wytdk5/im_trying_to_commit_to_writing_in_a_journal_to/,,0,2,I'm trying to commit to writing in a journal to cope with loneliness.

The Velveteen Rabbit-Margery Williams

You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby.

But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.

Margery Williams

It chronicles the story of a stuffed rabbit's desire to become real through the love of his owner. The book was first published in 1922

A stuffed rabbit sewn from velveteen is given as a Christmas present to a small boy. The boy plays with his other new presents and forgets the velveteen rabbit for a time. These presents are modern and mechanical, and they snub the old-fashioned velveteen rabbit. The wisest and oldest toy in the nursery, the Skin Horse, which was owned by the boy's uncle, tells the rabbit about toys magically becoming real due to love from children. The rabbit is awed by this idea; however, his chances of achieving this wish are slight.

One night, the boy's nanny gives the rabbit to the boy to sleep with, in place of a lost toy. The rabbit becomes the boy's favourite toy, enjoying picnics with him in the spring, and the boy regards the rabbit as real. Time passes and the rabbit becomes shabbier, but happy. It meets some real rabbits in the summer, and they learn that the velveteen rabbit cannot hop as they do, and they say that he is not a real rabbit.

One day, the boy comes down with scarlet fever, and the rabbit sits with him as he recovers. The doctor orders that the boy should be taken to the seaside and that his room should be disinfected — all his books and toys burnt, including the velveteen rabbit. The rabbit is bundled into a sack and left out in the garden overnight, where he reflects sadly on his life with his boy.

The toy rabbit cries, a real tear drops onto the ground, and a marvellous flower appears. A fairy steps out of the flower and comforts the velveteen rabbit, introducing herself as the Nursery Magic Fairy. She says that, because he has become real to the boy who truly loves him, she will take him away with her and ""turn him into Real"" to everyone.

The fairy takes the rabbit to the forest, where she meets the other rabbits and gives the velveteen rabbit a kiss.

The velveteen rabbit changes into a real rabbit and joins the other rabbits in the forest. The next spring, the rabbit returns to look at the boy, and the boy sees a resemblance to his old velveteen rabbit.🐇🐇

The boy ends up enjoying seeing the rabbit out in the wild.

“The Velveteen Rabbit shows us that hardships are a normal part of life, and that eventually they will pass 🐰🐇”

5273,wyvc5b,Clol1l1l1,"They always have made fun of me for not being social but they don't know how hard it is. I'm able to talk to people. I'm funny. I'm nice. I don't know why people just don't like me as much as other people. They don't ask me to hang out with them. In college it's way harder than middle and high school. No one even talks during class. There's not really any clubs for me to join. The people at work are either underage or boring. (Yes I'm able to have preferences even though I have no friends.) The few friends I had always disappeared or never asked to hang out. The friends that did hang out with me were so mean. Then I have to go home and get asked by my mom if I made any friends. She'll ask if I want to invite any friends to my birthday party even though I never have wanted to. I feel like she takes pity on me and coddles me because of it. I see her give me these weird smiles that she doesn't give anyone else. My sisters and brother will use me having no friends to make fun of me. They'll say it just to hurt my feeling or shut me down. My older sister once told me that I'm socially inept and I need to go back to school to socialize all because I said no to going to her friends house. My younger sister loves shoving it in my face while she brags about being popular in school. I said I didn't notice something outside, and she laughed and said it's because I don't socialize. My little brother is always mean so it doesn't matter, but he'll say I'll never have friends. Whenever I tell people I don't have friends they'll act like I'm an alien or something. They don't think I'm trying. They probably think I act too weird to make friends. It's just so annoying how much criticism I get just for not having friends. I feel they would treat me completely different if I brought invited a friend over. I'm so sick of feeling like I'm just horrible for not having friends. It will never end.

Turns out they've blocked me in as many ways as they could on every platform. So much for a friend who said they'd never block me, and always ""cared"".

I bet now they probably would enjoy forgetting I ever existed. And they get to tell themselves they ""cared"", though now they probably don't care if I continue to exist or not. Assuming they even want me to exist at all.


I just wish I was someone else, not some nerdy, awkward, depressed,  needy and unwanted guy that people abandon and discard. Now, I think the friends who abandoned me basically would want me to not exist at all (as long as they can find a way to detach themselves from any guilt). Plus, if someone doesn't want me to exist, they're probably protected more as a result than my welfare is.

5322,wz3ftu,AverageReditor13,"First post... wooh 

Today is a Saturday from where I live. School week just ended and today is when I met up with friends and just hung out. It's been two years since the pandemic separated us and our friends and it's been a long time since we met.

So, back on Monday, I was so scared coming back to face to face classes. I was almost panicking as I approached the school gates and towards our classroom. Until I met this girl in our class, a long time friend of mine since elementary. She and I were new students in a new school, we knew no one except ourselves, and she was also scared like me, so like all friends do, we eased each other's fear. Throughout my teenage years I've never been dead set in relationships and things... up until now. 

During the day at school, we only talked with each other, considering we only knew ourselves. I can't explain in words, but all of my anxiety faded with her, everything around us was a blur during our conversations and she said that she was happy to meet me again. I got the ""butterflies in your stomach"" feeling, and it was good. I really felt like I wanted to he with her, she was amazing, and undoubtedly pretty. All of a sudden I was eager to go to school and I couldn't stop thinking about her for a while. For the first time, I fell in love.

So passed forward this morning, we had a friend's outing. These said friends were once my classmates but have moved to different schools, fortunately we had the time to meet again after a long time and the girl  I had been talking about was with us... then everything went downhill after that. So apparently she was already in a relationship, a relationship among our group of friends. Yeah... sucks. 

We started at around 10 AM and I watched them hold hands, smile, laugh and cling together, I was already begging to go home. Another thing was that the majority of my friends were already in their own relationships... so I felt a lot of loneliness during that time. It's like adding salt to an open wound. I'm not jealous, in fact I am happy for them, and I'm not holding a grudge against the guy, he is still a friend of mine and we constantly chat and play online together. (Or maybe I am jealous, I don't know.)

I know I'll get over it eventually, but it just hurts that I get to see her everyday throughout this school year without being able to get a chance with her, playing my part as a good friend and not trying to intervene or win her over. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this here because I just felt really down after what happened today and it has been filling me to the brim all throughout...

I got my first serious relationship in my last year of uni, everything started like a dream, kinda out of a romance book but then went down the hill. I’ve been single for 4 and half years now after being ugly cheated on and a psychological abusive relationship.

and the feeling of being absolutely unnoticed and unimportant to this world is so painful.

thing is, ""the world"" DOESNT care for you AT ALL. friends you had in school, they dont care for you anymore at age 35. because they all founded their own haven and work that out. and its your parents job to give you enough confidence and love in yourself, and if they failed at that and damaged you, well, good luck.

we, to whatever circumstances in our past, are stuck. not only decide some of us to stay at this stuck level because ""its safe"", but also, the lot of us me included have no IDEA about how to turn this around.

confidence and selftrust is a horrible issue for the lot of us here, i guess. but thats whats necessary to charge forward on into a good life. and again, if youve been hurt in your childhood....it can be very game over.

5335,wz6zhc,rosemilkteababy,"19f, I just recently started my first year of college. I still haven’t made any friends and everyday after classes I just cry myself to sleep, buried in stuffed animals, hoodies, and blankets pretending I have somebody. I took a gap year to focus on my mental health, I’ve been struggling with this feeling of loneliness for as long as I can remember. You see I grew up in a small suburban town as one of the only Asian kids, and the only mixed race Asian kid. I tried to make friends all throughout childhood but was perpetually denied. I’m not sure what was wrong with me but so many girls would run from me and saw my eagerness for friendship as weird. Even when I did make close friends, my eagerness for conversation or play dates was made fun of and I always felt like a burden. My friend’s parents didn’t like me because of my race and I just I’ve always felt so lonely. Things got worse very quickly. Before I even hit puberty I became severely ill with an auto immune disease. I was pulled out of school and spent majority of my coming of age era in and out of hospitals. The friends I did have quickly forgot about me. No one would check up on me and throughout the years I never had a single visitor at the hospital. I was only talked about when it was to make fun of my appearance because of the health condition. I was subject to a lot of rumors and ridicule and it hurt. The loneliness didn’t bother me too much during this time, I had bigger fish to fry. But still it hurt. When I did finally get better and return to school I managed to make a few friends. My old friends; and anyone I’ve ever known before would refuse to talk to me and basically pretend I was invisible. Kids can be so cruel, I don’t know why people didn’t care. 

Although I did end up making close friends with other Asian girls, in all my friendships I’ve felt the same loneliness. Even when I started going to parties it didn’t matter how many people surrounded me I felt so alone. Like no one was truly there for me or could see me because they didn’t know the living hell I was battling. Every day was difficult because of the trauma I carried, but no one could see. This feeling wasn’t too overpowering, I was able to manage but once the pandemic started it unleashed a can of worms. School stopping, not leaving the house because of my immune system, etc. it was all so reminiscent of when I first fell ill. Because me and my family are immunocompromised, believe it or not I actually didn’t leave my home for two years. I wasn’t allowed to open windows or go on walks. It killed me, really. The pandemic began when I was 16, and I finally left home when I was 18. Once again I felt so behind compared to my peers. I didn’t learn to drive I never toured colleges I just I knew nothing. I’ve always had poor mental health but during this I became suicidal and developed ocd, and experienced manic episodes and psychosis. During all of this, I also lost a very precious family member while going through the most painful breakup. No one reached out, no one checked up on me. Nobody. I knew I needed help I’d reach out to friends and tell them I wanted to end up my life but no one cared or understood even remotely what I was feeling. They’d tell me to do what makes me happy and say reductive things like referring to my chronic illness and active disability as an eating disorder. It’s not that I didn’t want connection, I always have and always will, I’ve just learned from experience that true connection is a myth. It’s fantasy, or maybe someone like me doesn’t deserve it. 

I just feel so lonely. I’ve only been in one relationship that’s been on and off again, currently off again. It just frustrated me so much that I felt so alone in this relationship. No matter what I shared or expressed I never received the empathy and understanding I craved. I just want to be seen. The thought of forming connections or making friends terrifies me because how am I supposed to maintain a happy go lucky relationship after everything I’ve been through. My problems don’t relate to others very well. I’ve tried joining support groups but it ends up just being religious propaganda. I’m not the most religious but I’ll admit when I’ve had no one I’ve always turned to god… it’s just I’m so sick of having to turn to god. Since I was little the only thing I could talk to was the wall of my ceiling fan, hoping god was somewhere in there listening. I’m so sick of talking to the air. Crying every night to the sound of my breath. I feel so isolated and at the risk of sounding too edgy, no one understands me. I’m sick of acting like everything is okay because it isn’t. No one deserves to live like this. Just once in my life I want to feel wanted, and cherished. I know feeling lonely at the start of college is normal but I’ve felt this way for so long. My whole life really. I just keep crying and I can’t stop. No one will listen to me, no one will inquire after me or offer to be there. My support system is limited to my family but lord knows I’ve already burdened them enough. I feel pathetic I have nobody outside of family and I can’t remember the last time I felt truly seen. I don’t know what to do. There’s so much judgment in the world and even if I could make friends I wouldn’t trust it. I’ve had so many bad experiences with both girls and boys. Everyone gossips and judges things they don’t understand and I’m sick of being the subject of ridicule. I want to be free to feel as sick as I’ve been, and be as angry as I should be. It’s not fair. If god was to subject me to such painful circumstances, he could have at least made me loved in the process.",2022-08-27 16:25:54,lonely,t5_2qjny,1621649145,3,/r/lonely/comments/wz6zhc/i_feel_so_alone_its_impossible_to_form_connection/,,0,2,"I feel so alone, it’s impossible to form connection when I’m so different."

I always get picked on for being “dumb” and not understanding it. I don’t tell anyone that I work hard and have an amazing work ethic . I believe the only reason I have a good work ethic is Becuase I’ve been alone for so many years why not do something with my life. My parents are worried I’ll be alone for the rest of my life and that I have zero friends which is true. I don’t hang out with anybody or go anywhere. They are always asking if I have a girlfriend or if I have any friends I want to bring around. I always avoid or beat around the bush with those questions Becuase it is torture for me to talk to them about it . They are worried I won’t go to homecoming and that’s true and that I don’t have anybody to take which is also true. I hate my life Becuase I have nobody to talk to and nobody to do anything with.

5398,wzfy5p,Someonewhowantstotry,"I feel isolated and somewhat guilty. I'm 18 and living with my parents. My family moved from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States in hopes of finding the dream retirement home. Because at the time the housing market was crazy and had a lot of inventory we moved to into a rental so we can quickly move into the retirement house. We arrive at the rental before our stuff got there and within the first day water started to pour from the ceiling. So we scrambled to find a new rental that could fit all our stuff. We found one that could fit our stuff so we moved there. The house is okay but we're on a very busy and dangerous road without sidewalks. I don't have a driver's license so I can't leave without asking someone to drive me somewhere. I was homeschooled and have since graduated but I have no plans or idea how I could get to college. My family and I have taken the pandemic really seriously and I don't know anybody nearby. My parents when I was young warned me on internet safety and to be honest I feel anxious typing in a discord group of people I don't know. So I don't really have online friends. I messed up my hands and I think I might have hypertension or arthritis so if I do game I can't do it for long. We've been in this rental for almost a year and haven't found a house. My mom has been searching really hard for a house but since we moved the housing market has dried up. I haven't had a lot of social interaction with people outside my immediate family. I don't think I'm bad at social interaction but I do feel drained later. It might sound sad but I think I have supplemented social interaction by watching YouTube/Twitch creators instead of looking for interpersonal friendships. I'm not crazy enough to think they're my friends but spending hundreds+ of hours listening to these creators has suppressed me from thinking I need real interaction. In the last couple of days I've been trying to ween myself off of YouTube and have been really emotional thinking about where I'm at. I think the catalyst for me making this post is that my family is only a couple days from having to re-signing the lease for this rental and so I might have to live here for another 6 months unless I figure out how to get to college. The kind of houses where we live now that are on the market aren't the value my parents want so they're now looking in other East Coast states where it's cheaper. An addendum to why I may have made this post is that my Dad is going to be moving to a far away state to make a lot of money from a high-powered job. This job has been in the making for a couple of months; so if I did use my parents current healthcare to talk to a therapist I'd have to start all over again with a new one. I realize that this is an excuse because my family did offer to pay for them even if the insurance didn't cover it but I think I was engrossed in watching YouTube that I thought I was happy. I want to now explain why I feel guilty. My family are really loving people and I'm in a financial situation where I don't have to worry about anything. Which makes me feel like I have first world problems (which I do) and I (Mentally and very rarely physically) beat myself up about it. I have expressed a fair amount of how I feel about this to my parents but I haven't said everything because I don't want them to give up on their dream for me because they've done enough.

 I hope whoever reads this has a good day and doesn't feel too bad from reading this. I'm trying to better myself but I guess today wasn't the best day for me.

I have also moved to a new city and was hoping that my friend who is already here would be someone i would hang out with and catch up with, but this friend has made new friends and seems to be enjoying a lot with them. I asked that we should meet but every time there is a reason to not meet. I am not high maintenance, trust me, but I do feel like a very low priority in all of their lives.

5412,wzhh6v,hallucinogenicaa,"I am lost. My only sibling is dead. We used to speak our own language. It was like I always knew where he was, always had a second sense, and suddenly it went quiet and vanished. I feel like half of me has been severed. I suddenly jolted awake at the time he would have died, I went back to sleep, I woke up, and I found him there. There's been no cause found for months and months now and he was just about to turn 18. I am always stuck inside of that moment. Finding him. Seeing him. The bruising. The color. Every detail of that room. It looked like costume makeup.

 My parents have drifted away completely. We live in the same house and no longer really speak. My dad has COPD and refuses to take care of it, I am watching him die on front of me and there's nothing I can do. He just wants to be alone. My mom is mentally absent, somewhere else. The only time we speak is to argue or start empty conversation. I have no friends as they won't let me outside because of COVID and monkeypox. My dad's paranoia has spun out of control. He shuts the blinds and keeps it as dark and silent as possible in case somebody could ""peer in"". He thinks anyone will come inside the house at any moment and kill everyone. I can't argue anymore. I just shake my head. I have broken so many things now. I punched a hole in my mirror and the shards have been on my floor for weeks. I feel nothing but anger. Everything is based on anger.

Occasionally I talk to a guy who used to like me. I have a feeling he doesn't like me anymore. I'm aware he lies to me, but I can't care. I just need to talk. Ill give him whatever he wants and do whatever he wants. I know I am just breasts and hair and soft skin. I am a body that tells him things he wants to hear. Every compliment sounds foreign out of his brain. It always leads to something else. Internally I hate him. I hate very single thing he says but he is the only one who will just fucking say something to me. 

I spend most of my time on the floor. I try to move as little as possible and just pretend I'm dead. I usually end up falling asleep. I don't know how I'm alive. It's that or I play music. Music puts me somewhere else. Its the closest thing I can get to drugs without having to spend money. If there's a solution, I'm too exhausted to find it. I am in hibernation.

5424,wzimv6,Made_to_browse_anime,"I(m19) have lost all my friends in the last 2 years. 

2 years ago i fell in love for the 1st time in my life. Soon after that I told her what i felt, but she didn't feel the same way about me. And my life just spiralled out of control. I was just sad and crying for months. 

When i finally woke up for this spiral, i was doing something i enjoyed, i was playing PoE. I played 300 hours of that shit in what, a month? I don't even know. What i know is that half a year had gone by.

Suddenly, there was no one else. Summer was starting and i had failed maths, and lost everyone. All my friends were enjoying the fact that they were 18 and we're going out. And i was just, you know, there. Alone.

I spent the last year finishing maths. I did it. I almost failed again. I made no new friends. Nothing. No one.
Summer began. Again. And here I am. Alone. Again. And in 2 months I'm gonna go to college. Not because I want it. Not because i will ever need to work ever. Just because that is what my entire family expects of me. No one can know i will never have to work ever outside of my core family. 

In my country, going to college is mostly free, but because i enrolled in the science course, i have to go to a science based area. And despite me being a very above average student, even without touching a book and failing maths, i couldn't give less of a shit about these topics. I just love history, linguistics, politics and geography. I know a whole lot about these topics, because I've been self teaching myself for the last 5 years about them.

Either way, i am going to college. I don't want to. But everyone wants me to. So i will. I just want to go and learn Japanese. But i MUST go to college.

I fear that i won't be interested enough about the topics to make learning fun. I fear that i won't find friends, nor God forbid love. I fear college. I know i won't fit there. I've never fit anywhere. I feel like a kid trapped in this body. 

Most of the people that go to college are girls, especially to scientific areas. I'm unable to deal with them. I can deal with other guys. But not with woman. I don't know if i will be able to befriend them. I never did.

I'm afraid that i will keep on being alone. These days, i barely feel alone anymore. I've uninstalled Instagram long ago, so FOMO is no more.

5425,wzin9t,Tommokia1,"So, I was pondering this today. I realized that I really only have a couple of friends (they don't live near me since I recently moved), but there are people I occasionally talk to as well.  And I thought to myself what makes me actually consider people friends? And then when I found that answer out, perhaps we need to make different categories for people in different status of ""friends"".  


1. Close friends = friend for a long time. Or a friend you can share anything with at any time.  For me a close friend calls up on me and asks what's going on.  Only have one like that, and he's way older than me.  But, I'm used to making friends who 10 years older than I am, than my own age. Hang out and everything.  Basically they're someone who's like you and maybe more.  And have that feeling of connection with.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Friend = Someone you say hi too and have good times with.  You don't necessarily feel a connection, but generally like their company.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Acquaintance friend = Someone you occassionally see and do a head nod too.  And have a short sweet conversation about the weather (doesn't have that) but very surface topics. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Internet friends = Someone who's their online for you to chat.  Maybe play games online with too or FaceTime.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought if we could break down the different types of friends and their meanings, maybe we all wouldn't be so alone?  Instead of it strictly just being a close friend, even though that brings great comfort to the soul...

She told me a few months later she isn’t ready to commit to anything which completely broke my heart and I’m still nowhere near better. I found out from an old coworker she’s in a relationship with a 29 year old which all bias aside I don’t think is right because she’s still a teenager like me. I told her that I couldn’t even try to be just friends with her anymore because I didn’t ever see her as just a friend and I said for her to make sure she gets treated right and told her goodbye. I think it wouldn’t bother me as much if the person was around our age but the fact he’s a fully grown man and she’s only just finished college (from the UK so college ends at 18) doesn’t sit right at all. But I know it’s none of my business anymore and in the least arrogant way I know that it’s her loss because I genuinely cared and wanted the best for her. I finally deleted all the texts and her number as well as all of her social media. Even songs from my spotify that remind me of her. I guess I’m kinda proud of myself for finally having the strength to get rid of everything despite it leaving me with no one to talk to.

i’m in grad school now. but i went through 4 years of college and never made a close friend who stayed. 

i just have given up on trying to make friends. i have social anxiety. depression. a rare hearing disorder that makes everything seem too loud—i’m the designated weird girl with earplugs. so i just don’t bother leaving my place unless i have to for class etc. 

i know i should try to get out more and interact with people, but i’m not interesting enough. no one really reacts when i say something. i know if i keep trying i might meet someone who clicks with me, but damn i’m tired of trying. 

i have 2 close friends. one i’ve had since 9th grade, the other for nearly a year. but they’re long distance friends so i never see them really. i’m thankful they’re in my life, but it’s purely virtual. 

it just stings to see other girls with their friend groups. i don’t need a big friend group or even a small circle, just having 1-2 people irl would be nice.

People that are lucky enough to not know what it's like to wake up every morning not feeling purpose will ask questions about this... ""Lifestyle,"" and will probably even word it just like that, too. Why wouldn't they? If you have someone that actually **wants** to talk to you every day and spend time with you, there's a good chance you're only on this subreddit to lurk. I've found this community to kinda be like /r/foreveralone but way more welcoming. Anyway...


Loneliness is as uniquely arbitrary as it is ever-present. You can feel it in a roomful of people or by yourself entirely. You can feel it even when you're **married**, although if we're being cynical here you'll get less sympathy from me if you're in a relationship just because I'm an envious bastard. Loneliness can make you desperate enough to stay in an abusive relationship till they use you up like an empty tube of toothpaste. Parasites pray on that. Loneliness can even make you, dare I say, buy a fleshlight because you're so desperate for **some** kind of intimacy that you spent 50 bucks thinking a silicone sleeve would fix all your fuckin problems. But enough about me 



Loneliness is what makes you stay caught up on someone you haven't even talked to for four years because you miss having someone in your life that gave a shit if you stopped breathing overnight. It's a social repellant, almost as if people can **sense** it on you and it pushes them away even more. It's line a *STINK*... Which is ironic when you think about it. Someone that actively wants to meet other people and climb out of this abyss in their life is lonely, which is the same driving force to keep people away from them. It's like saying ""sorry we only hire people with experience for our entry positions"" to a kid that's never had a job before. 


Loneliness is something you can get high off of because you'd rather feel sad than nothing at all. Something to remind you that you're not desensitized to life in general.

There is no fucking bright side. It's not about being incapable of spending time alone, I've done enough of that. It's about how being alone gets boring. Humans are social creatures after all. Hearing stories from co-workers about how them and their friends are planning a trip to Japan is so fucking depressing. Even seeing people get notifications on messenger is depressing LOL. And I'm talking about having no friends and no partner. I feel like when people have no friends they usually have a partner. Having neither is just a horrible ordeal.

I’ve always been alone. I’ve never felt seen or heard or special. I was conditioned to be a people pleaser veryyyy early on( played a huge role in my future) I’ve like never ever ever had any lasting friendships. 9-10 year old me discovered I could make Friends and stuff online and that’s opened a can a worms still showing up in my life and I’m 22 now. I’ve always been soooooooo desperate for connection to feel seen to be heard To be understood and wanted. I’ve been in only abusive relationships so far. I still have no friends. I have soo much anxiety 24-7. I try to make friends and chit chat with co workers but I know they’re co workers so I try then I pull back to not
Overstep or set myself up then I try again it’s a mess so I just stay to myself most the time. Until recently I’ve only met people
Online. All my ex’s I met on bumble. I  don’t really have  any experience meeting anyone in person besides grade school years and work. I’m in therapy and she suggests I learn to be alone and happy alone and that should Make the desperation subside a little. She thinks I also need to get out to do things I’m interested in and possibly meet someone who’s also interested and forming organic mutual interests with people but if not just enjoy my own company and still count it as a win. She said not be hard on myself because this is how I coped and stayed breathing multiple times.

I like pretty normal stuff I would say. I collect snowglobes. I like shopping, mini golf,nature centers, movies, seasonal events for Christmas, anything Halloween related, traveling. I would say I’m nice little old
Ladies tend to like me and we chit chat.

I’m very socially awkward at times and I’m already soft spoken  so it makes me seem super weird probably idk I just want to find my people already. But it’s best if I get really

But my cousin has been trying to buy a car and every time I ask how’s that going I get gaslighted into giving her money just because I “have it”. I gave her about 2,500 dollars and I know I’m never going to get it back. Every time someone asked me for money or something related to money I get so emotional. And I’m the selfish one? I just give it away but I feel guilty and I have so much self hatred that I wanna cut myself and make myself suffer because I couldn’t say no. And I needed that money for bills but my empathy and sympathy is always causing me problems. At least for me. I haven’t worked all year because I had major foot surgery last December. I found out my foot was broken for five years and I just got a fixed last year. I’m in pain all the time but I can’t say anything about it because everybody else is in pain so I should just shut up. And I had to drop out of college because of the surgery and stress. And the embarrassment from dropping out is killing me. I’ve been through two suicide attempts this year. But I can’t leave because I have people to take care of. Involuntarily and voluntarily. I take care of two seniors that do nothing. It’s driving me insane. But all I need to do is shut up. Thankfully I have a therapist to talk to occasionally but sometimes it’s not enough. My dog died this year and I had to get a new dog because of the loneliness.

My relationship with my parents also isn’t the best, not that I want to have it. My relationship with my mum is fine, but with my dad it’s quite terrible. I hate him. And I don’t think I’m blamed here because I think it’s deserved for him after some things he’s done. I still cannot forgive it.

5499,wzqhen,thesadboiyears,"Right now, im really not happy with my life. I am filled with this strong envy and despise for myself and my own life when I am alone, with my own thoughts. I feel this anger bubbling inside of me, feeling trapped in this completely stagnant, lonely and crippling life. Everywhere I look, I see people living a life that I wish to have, one surrounded with people, just friends, regular friends - people to make memories with. 

I really have none of that and I never have and doubt I ever will. The closest I have ever gotten to any of that is through using my body for attention…yeah that’s shit is low, I know. Anyone who has ever ‘cared’ for me, has expected me to give them my body as part of that package because of the means in which we established a friendship or connection. The moment that factor is taken away, everything comes crumbling down. The sad fact is, I only know how to gain and maintain interest is through sex. That’s not what I want, not any more. I want better for myself.

No matter where I look I’m seeing others live out the life I am so deprived of. I cannot use any social media as it drives me insane just seeing other hanging out and doing things with eachother, when I have none of that. Honestly it fills me with the painful level of envy and spite, emotions which I don’t want to feel but I cannot help. 

I have so much love in my heart. I am not a hateful person, so i repress these emotions, however I have repressed them for so long and feel so hopeless that it pushes me to this place of wanting to kill myself. I am exhausted of feeling this way. The only way I see out of it is by ending my existence so I no longer have to suffer in a space where I feel I don’t belong or have purpose. Making friends as a 23 years old is just impossible. It truly does feel that one of the greatest forms of suffering is to live a life of loneliness.

5507,wzrbey,kn8_,"I'm 21, and I've been ""lonely"" for almost all my life. I'm very grateful that I have a loving family, and my mom is probably the closest that comes to a best friend. But I literally don't have one other person to call my friend. I'm often told I'm nice and kind (they're patronising/pitying I guess) and stuff like that. I'm ""friends"" with everyone I meet, as in I get along with them well, I make them laugh and I pretend to be so casual with them. I always have a personality suited for everyone in need of a friend. I make sure no one around me feels lonely, so I'm always the friend of any quiet/weird kid in a class. That's how it has been with all my classmates and what nots. ""You're so fun to talk to"", ""I feel so comfortable talking with you"" are things I get to hear. Yet I've never found someone who has sticked with me or considered me seriously as a friend of them. I've always been the low-maintenance background friend for so many people. They rant to me, I know secrets that their partners and best friends don't know, I know whatever happens in their life and all their minor inconveniences. But why is it that I can never find someone like that? I put way too much effort (sometimes for the wrong people), expecting nothing. But I guess I was subconsciously expecting some sort of reciprocation in the form of acknowledgement atleast. I thought I was content in being alone and not being listened to, or even offered an ear to listen. It never bothered me, and it's mostly my fault. I always let them make me a background friend by being too nice and never demanding anything. But lately it's occuring to me how lonely I am. I'm so lonely that I don't know what to talk about myself even if someone asked. I'm so used to being a listener that I lost my own identity in the process. I don't have a single person to hangout with unless if it's for a cause for them. Will this be my fate? Will I have to keep living my life never being able to open up or atleast realise what my true self is like? Will I never be able to let anyone understand me? Does helping people come with the cost of losing yourself?

This is probably the deepest shit I've ever spouted out about myself and I hope no one reads this. Ranting is so off character for me, feels really weird. I guess places like these are good opportunities for people like me to release a bit of their burden to continue surving and not give up. I never thought I'd type all this, not even re reading what I typed out of embarassment. But no regrets either I guess, I got nothing to lose here. Thank you blank screen for holding all this for me.

5513,wzse5g,spoodydoo,"I sit in bed and think about this basically everyday now. 
I mean, I have my parents which I guess is lucky since some people don’t have that, but it’s different when the person meets you as a total stranger and falls for every part of you. It’s different when it’s a new friend that you notice you have so much in common with that it makes you giddy. It’s different when the person doesn’t feel obligated to love you or care for you, yet they do anyway. 

My friends have been hanging out without me despite multiple attempts to let them know I’d be interested in hanging out. They don’t talk to me anymore unless I reach out first; the last time any of them reached out and put their energy into conversation was over a month ago. They just went on a 2-day trip, all of them, but never told me about it, and it looks like they have plenty of fun without me. We used to be so close, yet I bet I ruined it as always. 

The last girl I had feelings for found someone else just two weeks after I told her I’d like to “take things slow”. She wasn’t willing to wait I guess, and now she’s happily partnered. 

Love is a sham. Friendship is a sham. I don’t know what more I have to do to please these people. I give gifts, I listen, I do this and that, yet I only got out three times this entire summer and had to spend most of it in the house or working at my overnight job while my “friends” and people I admired were off bonding with their loved ones and making memories. 

I have multiple dating apps and have tried as hard as I can (as a shy, more introverted person) to meet new people for the past year. Yet here I am, my final year in uni with no significant new friends and zero dating experience. I feel hollow most of the time. Empty, trying to mask my feelings the best I can, through humor and casual conversation. Now, I try to keep conversations with strangers short as to not waste their time. 

I feel like, just as “everything happens for a reason”, I guess some people are just meant to be outcast. Some people are meant to be lonely. I don’t know what about me there is that makes me so inadequate, but obviously it’s gotta be something that is wrong with me as the pattern continues. I feel as though this might be where I slowly taper off. I’ll slowly stop being active on social media; make it seem like everything is fine before I disappear completely. I’m thinking if this loneliness doesn’t improve then I might just call it quits next year when I’m out of school. 

I don’t know. I don’t know what to do anymore except just do my own thing and forget about forging relationships, as I’m obviously not meant for them. I’m just so tired of being played with.

I feel really embarrassed; at my age I should be having fun and having a normal high school experience but instead I’m sitting at home depressed having a hard time even getting up out of bed. I haven’t had a real friend in years, i recently just dropped my last “friend” because they were extremely abusive towards me constantly making fun of my social anxiety, made fun of my depression, and would just always make rude jokes where I was the butt of them. 

So I stopped hanging out with them but in exchange now I feel even more lonely and isolated than before. I used to at least also talk to a therapist to help but my mom stopped paying for therapy just because she was angry I was talking with my therapist about going on meds ?? I don’t know what to do anymore

Even going to school feels impossible to do now, just for reference for how horribly draining it is to have to deal with severe mental illness untreated for extended periods of time ill try to do one assignment for school (it won’t even be particularly hard to do) but I’ll be extremely warn out and tired from that because I have little to no energy every day. 

I’ve been called every word from lazy to selfish. And I’ve also had people tell me I’m a pussy for not being able to toughen up ? To the people that say that genuinely fuck you, the only reason why I’m going through this right now is because I’ve had to deal with extremely hard shit that has now probably permanently altered the way my brain works and now have to deal with the repercussions. 

I wish I could have real friends, I’ve made some friends on social media but they aren’t the same as irl friends. I literally don’t talk to anyone constantly but my mom, and my mom and I don’t get along at all. She’s often the one that makes disparaging comments about how lazy I am and blatantly doesn’t care to get me help for my mental health. 

She doesn’t care about me at all, she constantly gas lights me into thinking I’m crazy and don’t know what I’m talking about in order to get her way. She will even try to victimize herself to make me look like the Villain. I’m so tired of it, I’ve been thinking about getting myself admitted into a psyche ward so that I can have access to the medicine I need to survive. I have suicidal thoughts everyday and I have a plan for how I would try to do it too, I’ve lied to all of my therapists previously because Its really stupid but I was scared I thought I would be judged for it.

But it’s happened and I’ve also attempted suicide before, I was almost put into a psyche ward once after I had attempted suicide but Im really good at just faking that I’m ok so I was able to lie my way out of being admitted that one time but now I think that’s the only way I can leave my toxic home environment in order to get the help I need before I put my life at risk.",2022-08-28 18:01:14,lonely,t5_2qjny,1634060712,7,/r/lonely/comments/x01p0b/the_only_contact_i_have_in_my_phone_is_my_mom/,,0,0,The only contact I have in my phone is my mom

I am a pretty shy and lonely person, I have like three close friends since high school, friends that I like spending time with, but I generally dislike going out. I hate partying or clubbing or anything similar. I have sex drive and I'm attracted to girls, but I just don't wanna get involved with dating someone.

I work as a programmer, I enjoy working out, traveling, watching movies, studying and playing piano. My schedule is pretty busy and I wouldn't be able to integrate a relationship even if I wanted, besides the fact I can't possibly imagine any circumstance in which I meet someone now.

I've tried dating in the past probably because of social pressure and the curiosity to have sex. It didn't work out, I never got past a few dates with someone, so I'm a virgin. I'm not able to make a move, kiss a girl or hold hands, I'm too scared and generally my mind goes blank when talking to a girl, although I can manage it somehow. But even when I tried, I didn't feel great, it always seemed unnatural to me, like I'm trying too hard. I just can't imagine myself being in a relationship, being romantic with someone. Even the texting I did with some girls was too tiring for me.

I don't know if it's just anxiety, but I also don't feel like I want to share my life with someone. I feel lonely a lot, but also at the same time I kinda like being alone.

I really don't know what to do. I've told my parents in the past, but they don't seem to understand me. They just think I'll meet someone by chance in the future and that I'm just talking nonsense now. I might be, but that's how I feel now.

&amp;#x200B;

Big mistake. Virtually everyone there went with other people. I was the only one there (other than another guy) that seemed to be alone. People were chatting with each other before they opened the doors to the hall. I was alone and looking at my phone in my get-up. My heart starts racing. I see someone else in my class with her boyfriend and felt even more alone.

&amp;#x200B;

The music was amazing, the songs they chose really fit the theme. It was all well arranged, from what I recall. It's a shame I didn't remember much, because the longer I was there the more I felt like crying, my head pounding screaming that I shouldn't be there and should just stay in my room like I belonged. When they had their intermission, I rushed to the toilet pretending to look at my phone, while grabbing a handful of tissues to staunch my tears and gasps before anyone could see me. I went back into the hall after the show still feeling like crap, and as soon as the show was over and they brightened the hall, left to go back to my dorms as fast as possible. I cried myself to sleep that night, dreading to wake up to tomorrow.

I felt that I should've never gone, I felt that I didn't deserve to go to something like that where other people were so happy with their friends and I was alone. I don't know how I can do better, and it's been a while since this happened and the feelings still come back to haunt me at night making me feel worthless. I don't know why I feel this way either. Is it the loneliness that gets to me? Is it my low sense of worth getting in the way, preventing me from being happy?

5600,x08w40,zanystorm,"This will probably be long but it has me so upset and I just need to rant about it.

I’m 20F, junior in college and have no friends. Not one. I had a few people I could talk to in class in highschool but never hang out outside of school, and after graduating we lost all touch. I have online friends I’ve known for a few years but due to being so insecure I rarely showed them my face/voice. And we met because of a mutual interest but as time went on we started talking more and more about our personal lives, which made me isolate myself from them because while they are all talking about their friends and going out and boyfriends, I have NOTHING going on in my life. Nothing.

Freshman year we had covid so I didn’t even have a roommate or go to class. We had 4 designated people on our floor we were told to only hang out with them for a few weeks to prevent spreading covid. However after the second time meeting them and realizing that I just followed them around most of the time barely being able to talk, I got insecure that they thought I was weird or didn’t like me and stopped hanging out with them. The spring semester I stayed home.

Sophomore year I thought I could make friends. Wrong. I had a studio apartment like 20 minutes from my school and was alone probably 90% of my time. I’m not even kidding. People rarely even talked in class. I joined an exercise club and was in a group of 6 other girls to do weekly exercises but our conversations were limited to that time and that time only. I ended up skipping most of the sessions at the end.

Now, I am taking half-time student status and online classes at home. Today, I dropped my sister off at her college to start her freshman year and I’ve never been so sad. She’s on the lacrosse team so she already knew her roommate and all the upperclassmen on her team. They came over to say hi to her, invite her to dinner, she has a whole athletic center where they can workout and study and hangout and she kept saying how she won’t have to take the bus because she can just get a friend to drive her. 

She’s getting a fake id and already has some sports party she is going too next week. Yet here I am sitting in my room doing online classes while my parents are at work with not one person to talk to or call a friend. 

I’ve never been to a party. I haven’t gone over someones’s house to hang out since seventh grade. That’s 8 years ago. I can’t even remember what it feels like to have a friend or what to talk about. I just feel like I’m wasting my youth. And every year I say it will be better but it never is. I’m feeling hopeless and I don’t even know what step to take to make friends. I can’t make them out here at hime be ause there are no activities to do. But even when I go back to school, I’m not aure the advice of “join a club” will even work since I already tried it.

5617,x0a13s,MyNamesIsMarc,"Idk what to say really. I haven't posted anything like this before, but reading through it seems that most people just get ignored, so hey ho maybe I will too.

I'm a 25 year old male and ever since I left school I've never really fit in anywhere. I've always been awkward socially, I don't have a very exciting life, never go out anywhere and still live with my parents. I have over £30k saved up in the bank and have no idea if that's enough to move out or not. I don't wanna move out because then I'll truly be on my own, at least living with my parents I still have them.

My akwardness has caused me to develop a stutter which makes talking to new people difficult because of nerves. I'm a good texter though because I have the time to think about and articulate what I'm gonna say. I tried dating last year by downloading tinder. I got one match and after texting for a few weeks we agreed to meet, I was excited. But then the nerves kicked in and 20mins into the date she asked me to take her home, since then I've gone into a shell that Ive no intention of coming out of.

But yeah, idk what I wrote all that. If you read it then thanks for taking the time. I know people have it worse than me and a lot have it better than me but that's life. Someone's always better off and someone's always worse off. 

This'll probably be ignored, but I just wrote this to vent. I don't have anyone to vent to so I'll just tell a load of strangers on the internet",2022-08-29 00:00:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,,17,/r/lonely/comments/x0a13s/just_another_post_to_be_ignored/,,0,4,Just another post to be ignored..

5619,x0a820,MeraxesGigas,"To put them in context, very recently it was my birthday. I am a calm person, I like a barbecue with friends more than a club, but this time I wanted to do something different. I rented a room, with music, drinks, invited many friends from different groups and even told them they could bring their friends. In short, I had a great time. After they had to close the salon, we went to continue drinking in other parts of my city. One of the girls I had invited was one of my best friends from elementary school and we have a history of liking each other in high school, and we had nice times together. Today we even talk a little during the morning. But after that, something changed. An extreme feeling of loneliness invaded me. I had nothing to do. no one to go out with, i didn´t even want to go out. I didn't even feel like playing on my computer, which I do regularly. I just went to bed and wandered through instagram. I didn't want to talk to anyone either, since I didn't want to seem lazy or really lonely, but all day long, I couldn't help but wonder if I'm actually a lonely person. It's not like I don't have friends, I do and I love them, but for the first time in my life, I truly felt like there was nothing, at least for today, that would bring me a glimmer of happiness.

5625,x0ajor,Federal-Law-5282,"I (23F) can’t make friends anymore. I have friends from my small hometown, and I maintain those relationships good. I would actually describe myself as one of the popular girls from high school etc. The problem is making new friends that are not people from my hometown. I really don’t know how to do it. I have lived in 3 different cities, and I have made some friends, but not something that lasted. I feel that I don’t know how to talk to people I don’t know, or know of, I can’t find things to talk about, I get awkward, and feel so clueless. I have always hated meeting people for the first time because I get awkward and don’t know how to introduce myself. Now I live in a city where I don’t really have anyone but my boyfriend. I do have one friend but I think she is getting tired of me being in love and awkward with new people. When I’m in a new enviornment I feel invisible. One time I was at a small gathering of people I studied with for about a year at this point, and one girl had to describe every person in the room (drinking game). She could describe every person but me. I actually got hurt by it, didn’t show it tho, cause that did confirm my feeling of being invisible and weird. 

Im starting to think I’m high functioning autistic, since I also struggle with regulering my emotions and anxiety (of anything that could kill me and sometimes anxiety attacks), and have since I was little. This has also made me believe I have bpd. I’ve also had some other mental problems as well like ptsd for about a year, really bad anxiety and delusions that put me on sick leave from work, and depressive episodes regularly. I dont think other people would describe me as austistic, but maybe just shy and a little socially awkward. I can stutter a little or say a totally other word than I was supposed to.

i don’t wanna hear “you’ll find a real friend in time” “all the boys must being lining up to talk” “you’re just so unique” “maybe once your mental health improves”

5658,x0e2om,AncientLamborghini,"I’m ashamed that I’m going on my vacation to New York City with my dad at the age of 26 because I have no friends, never had a girlfriend and still live with my parents. It’s pathetic. At my age I should be going on vacation with a girlfriend or fiancé. Instead I’m just a basement dwelling NEET loser who never moved out or had a life. 

I’ve done everything together with my dad. Vacations, concerts, sporting events. Because I’ve never really had friends or a social life. I’ve only been to one concert without him, and that was my cousin’s boyfriend. My dad is my only friend. I love him. But I feel pathetic that he’s my only friend. 

Meanwhile, all my peers have surpassed me. They all go on vacation almost exclusively with their romantic partners. Many of them are engaged or married, almost all have their own place out of state, and many make over six figures. Meanwhile I only have retail experience and have been out of work for almost three years. I’m the quintessential ~~quintuplets~~ loser.

I should have just went to Paris (my original plan) but didn’t because my cousin (who has been living there for years and has an apartment) would be working most days and I wouldn’t see him much, leaving me by myself. But my parents talked me out of it. I should have been an adult and just went, fuck what they think. 

I think it’s kinda pathetic to go on vacation with your parents in your 20s and beyond, particularly when you’re single. 

I love my dad, but I feel like a child. At this point I should have my shit together like most 26 year olds, but I clearly don’t.

5660,x0e93h,benjits22,"Dreams of mine are soothing, it resembles the safety you feel as a child in the presence of your mother. I Enjoy drifting into a deep dream, It is a huge break from reality. And it is the best part of my life at the moment. Unfortunately, every dream I awaken from is met with the insidious nightmare of my life. The same days are on repeat. Every single day. Every one. Alone, in my desolate room. Decaying on my bed. Overeating. Miserable. Lonely. A child that sees no purpose or meaning in his life. Do I hate or pity myself? Is it me who ruined my life? Does it matter anymore? I have no feelings for anyone. It puts me to shame to even say it, But I do not even care about my family anymore. They’re mere, additional, irritating sounds that feed the parasite in my mind. The same goes for my friends; Over the past three years, I have lost all sorts of connections with them all. We have all gone our separate ways. Some have gone to do great things with their lives, some are successful in money or in academia, Some have a girlfriend and some even get to travel the world with their new friends. Then, There is me. I do not leave the house. Well, occasionally I do go for a walk in the park. But that is only a walk that serves the purpose of extending how long I can stay inside my room without losing my sanity. Regardless, the more I think about it, The more I notice how devastating my life is. I remember the peak of my life clearly, I was twelve going on thirteen. I was a popular kid and had a ton of friends. Everyone knew me, I was loud, energetic, funny and got along with everyone. But now, I am the polar opposite, I am more socially anxious and weird. I often think about how my younger self would perceive who I am now. I know the answer- He would be disappointed. Because back then I had aspirations. I wanted to be a Footballer, I wanted to live a successful life being an Athlete of some sort. But in the end, I let myself down. I betrayed my own dreams. It is all my fault. Only mine. All mine. Is mine. Everything is a consequence of my own stupidity. From the friends I have lost to the family I dislike, It is all myself. I push people away from me deliberately, then when they leave me I run back after them, and get abandoned. Why should I feel sad for myself? That is what I initially wanted. But eventually, my actions catch up with me, and in retrospect, I realise what path a chose. And where it has gotten me. But there is more. Moreover, no girls are interested in me at all. None whatsoever. I don’t know what it is But they don’t even look me in the eyes. Am I a monster? Do I look wretched and hideous? Do I have the eye of a psychopath etched into the featureless curves ingrained into my skull, serving it for eyes? Or is it my personality, I’m sure the fact that I am miserable and moody contributes to my loneliness in that regard. But, I always just wanted someone to come up to me. Just one person. Since I was sixteen, for the past three years, my biggest hope was to have a girl come into my life. That was all I needed. Unfortunately now, I concluded that I no longer wanted my friends anymore, I don’t like them. I just wanted a girlfriend whom I could spend all my time with. But that too is unrealistic, Because I doubt any girl would want to be seen with a boy as ugly as me, so that was merely a dream tied to ignorance. I’m a walking disaster. My parents think there is something wrong with me. I know there is. My teachers think there is something wrong with me. I don’t even want help. I don’t even want to die. I just want to be happy. I want to forget thinking about all of this. I miss the days when I was younger when I and my friends would go to the park for hours upon hours, Playing manhunt in the forest. Nothing else mattered in the world. I mean, the world outside the park didn’t exist to us. We used to go just the three of us when we were eleven, Then our group expanded to about six people until we were sixteen. Then we never went again. We never knew the last time we went to the park, But we just stopped altogether. The way I reminisce about my past happiness is as if a part of me has died. Now I am nineteen, I dropped out of university because I made no friends, And all I do is stay at home. Alone. I have met up with people maybe five times this summer. That is it. And each time it felt awkward, I just sit there silently. My few friends can sense that something is off about me. Everyone can. But I don’t care, I wish I could restart everything. In a new body, or a new country, Or a new family, Or a new school. ANYTHING. I just want SOMETHING in my life to change. I went to college because I thought that would bring new change into my life, But that was also a disaster. Whatever I do fails. I just want to run away, far away. And leave everything behind. I simply can’t be bothered by this boring mundane life of mine. It is so depressing and sad for me. I want to leave the country and live in the wilderness. On a farm alone. I want to be self-sufficient so I don’t have to see anyone ever again. I just want to go forever until I die alone in peace. In peace where I can’t hear the news of this cruel world or see how disgusting social media is. I think that is my new dream- Severing my ties with everyone and leaving to a place nobody will ever know of me.",2022-08-29 03:24:37,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/x0e93h/im_fed_up_i_guess/,,0,0,im fed up i guess

5688,x0hesz,Equivalent-Stable-75,"I (20M) have no friends except for my brother (22M). Growing up our parents always made sure to treat us equally since we were around the same age and they didn't want us to hate each other. Now my brother and I are pretty close and we have been living together for as long as I can remember. Me and my brother bonded over our shared interests growing up, but there has always been a slight difference in us because of age. 

During high school he reluctantly joined cross-country due to our parents insistence, but he ended up making friends from it and ever since then he has been a more enthusiastic person. This is where things changed. Because it worked so well for my brother, my parents decided to force me into cross country as well in the hopes that I would also make friends. I didn't. I quit cross country shortly after that and continued to watch as my brother made more and more friends. 

Eventually he went off to college and lived in the dorms while I was left to live alone with our parents for 2 years. When it was finally my turn I told my parents that I wasn't comfortable living in the dorms with a stranger and so they decided to move me into a small college house with my brother and my cousin. 

It was great at first because we still bonded over our shared interests, but it became clear that he had become more confident in himself while I was gone and he doesn't see me as his best friend anymore. He talks about his interests with such enthusiasm when he's around me because he feels comfortable around me. However, When I try to talk about my interests he will make fun of me or just show a general lack of interest. 

It sucks because we both watch anime and read manga and he will always tell me about the newest anime/manga he's into and then I will think that it's a good segue into talking about the anime/manga that I'm into, but then he just shrugs it off and goes back to what he was talking about or he just leaves. When he was watching Naruto, I was watching One Piece. When he was watching Vinland saga, I was watching Jujutsu Kaisen. Now he's reading Vagabond and I'm watching Bleach. 

Eventually, I started watching whatever he was watching just so we could have really nice conversations about SOMETHING. Anytime I try to talk about  my interests with him now I keep it short and sweet and don't tell anymore than I need to because I just don't have the energy. Due to all of this our relationship has become very one-sided and it really hurts. I am an outlet for him, but he isn't an outlet for me. 

Right now we both live together and he has been talking about how excited he is to finally be living on his own and start a new chapter of his life. I am also curious to live on my own just because I feel like I need to figure out who I am without him, but at the same time I desperately don't want to be alone. Those 2 years without him were some of the worst years of my life and I don't want to go back to that. 

I feel so helpless because I'm clinging to someone that is trying to let me go. I know it's all for the best and we all have to grow up and move on, but that has never been something that I have felt that I have been able to do. I have always been there for my brother so I want him to always be there for me even if he doesn't show much interest in me or what I like.

This next part may sound a little conceited, but I attribute a lot of my brothers social success to me. He gets to talk about his ""less socially acceptable"" topics with me and therefore can withstand talking about stuff he doesn't care as much about with other people if that makes sense. 

I realize I sound kind of spoiled here and that I should just make my own friends, but my confidence has been so depleted ever since high school that I just don't think I can put myself out there.

I would like to end this by saying I don't think my brother is a bad person. In fact, I think he is actually a really nice and sweet person and I don't think he deserves any hate. This is all just stuff that I noticed happening within the past year. Sorry for the long post and if you made it this far thank you for reading.

But because they were typically older I didnt have to worry about them flirting with me. Some people might call me lucky, I should be grateful or whatever. but it just feels like they dont want to be my FRIENDS. like im just there to be flirted with or see who makes me fold first like a game.

5741,x0rotp,[deleted],"So this is my first time on Reddit so I suppose this could be considered a burner account? I doubt this will gain any traction either, but hey - I thought I’d give it a go.

I (M30), have increasingly become lonelier as I get older. In every respect really. I have a small group of friends who I absolutely love, however I find it so difficult to meet new people. Particularly at an age where many of my peers are either in long term relationships and settling down, and/or moved away. I work full-time in private education and it’s not really where I wanted to be (it so rarely is for a lot of us). There seems to be so much societal expectation of where someone should be at this age, and I’m truly feeling it of late.

To give a little context, I don’t have a lot of family. Not really for any particular reason. Only child to a single parent. A lot of my relatives are now deceased. I’ve also grappled with depression and anxiety intermittently since young adolescence, so that has definitely impacted relationships, opportunities etc.

I’ll keep this post concise and succinct. Simply, I’m incredibly lonely (not specifically romantically). In such a large world, with so many people, where we are all now so connected (digitally), being alone is the most isolating feeling. I’m aware that I need to make a change. Despite not knowing what that change is.

For anyone who’s feeling similar, or would like to make a new friend (not necessarily me) feel free to comment. Hopefully this can bring some people together.

I’m open to constructive criticism and happy to answer questions/give further context. All I ask is that you be kind! Kindness costs nothing.

(The title of this post is rhetorical and a bit redundant really, when knowingly posting it in r/lonely).

I am not really friends with my younger bro and more close to my mom, or So i thought.

i have been without friends for last 4-5 yrs as they are married and busy in their life, so don't talk to them as well. i don't really have anyone to open my thoughts and heart out. Thus lately i have been feeling so lonely like i don't really exist. 

I do have some sibling rivalry with my younger brother. 
I am trying to get married for last 2-3 yrs and feel ashamed of being unmarried till now whereas everyone else is married. I feel depressed also due to rejections by girls almost 10 plus. Some even after engagement. I can't take that i am losing the game. Which i am losing it tho. This is actually the first time i am venting out. I always tried to solve but i don't know what goes wrong when trying to get married. 

I have tried to open up to my mother about my feelings of feeling ashamed and left out but she never seems to understand and thus validate my feelings. This is making me feeling lonely and invalidated. i feel i don't really belong and she cares more for my brother whereas i feel like iam the one who is viewed like some kind of elder furniture just for safekeeping and running house bills. 

I deeply want her acknowledgement and for her to say it's ok.
But i never hear it. She keeps mum after hearing my crib. This has happened 2-3 times. 
I feel like i am wrong or cursed maybe. This also makes me feel i am being laughed at behind my back. I am so lonely and depressed at this. 

I am really started to losing it. These thoughts are recurring 3-4 times a day. I don't even make future plans anymore as i feel more lonely making plans alone.

I (F37) found my person, just like all the romantic, self empowerment, love as equals quotes &amp; memes you've ever seen.
And then it was over and now I have to figure it all out again.

You know this story. You've gone through it, watched family &amp; friends do it.
And then the recovery.
""You'll find someone, your real persons out there""

Is everyone around me so damn hooked on finding a partner?
I don't care anymore.
I can't even talk civily on other apps about shared interests without the male sending overly flirtatious crap with a friend request immediately after.
F*CK off.
Thirsty people everywhere.

So. The plan is to dedicate myself to myself. And any female archetype I get drawn to.

When I feel nervous, anxious, jittery without coffee &amp; confused, all I have to talk to is me, and so I talk.

Thanks to my previous 8 months in therapy, I got a hang of constructive conversation &amp; applying it to myself.

I don't need sex. Not any more. Thanks to a life of low libido, it's so enticing &amp; comforting to slip into the cowl of celibacy, just existing for myself &amp; my community of choosing.

I'm getting better at keeping a hawk eye on my unmedicated ADHD while working 3 jobs.

I'm managing to eat healthy foods.

I'm homeless but have a semi permanent agreement which works for everyone involved, so I am very lucky.

Sometimes I get sad being alone, travelling alone, that I could die at any moment and no one would know for a while.

I think I'm going to write my details on my dashboard so that whoever finds me has an easier time.
I don't mean that in a suicidal way, like a car crash/freak accident way.
I have 2 cats &amp; this annoying drive to not die by my own hand, like I have more to do soon, so no leaving yet.

Being by myself doesn't have to be lonely, I forgot that.

It still hurts &amp; I still feel ill thinking about my past, but I have to remember, what's the past going to do all the way back there in the trash, yelling at me?

I'm so grateful for being here, I tell myself.
I allow the deep sadness to show it face &amp; I try to hug it instead of collapsing with it.

I'm almost 40 &amp; I have to do this, I've made it this far.
I have to do this, I'm going to do this.

Oh look, this is much longer than planned &amp; I'm rambling.

I have no friends, either because I cut ties with them for my own reasons, or because they flat out just stop responding for reasons I'll never know. My family is always too busy to really talk and I just share very little, if anything at all, in common with them. My entire life has been anything but normal. I have severe trust issues among plenty of others and no one seems to really understand or care all that much. I literally can't talk to anyone and not look, sound, or act depressed. I cannot mentally or emotionally afford to trust people anymore, it's that bad. I can't be intimate with a woman. I can't relate to people. I can't. Have. Shit. My company just feels like a goddamn burden to everyone I meet because I'm always the one taking the initiative putting any real effort into a relationship. I always to text first. I always respond in a timely manner, even when I'm busy I don't forget. I understand people have their own lives and I respect that. As such, I also understand that I can't be the center of someone's attention all the time, nor would I EVER want that. But jesus fucking christ I cannot find any chemistry with anyone that will stick around and be an active part of my life.

5826,x140jd,PieceOfPOS,"Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate the new values instilled in me as a male Zoomer. I’m grateful that I’ve been taught that being sad doesn’t make you less of a man by a more progressive education system. I have ADHD and would probably wind up dead or in prison if I was born in a previous generation, as most men with ADHD in previous generations got swept up into organized crime. 

The problem with this mostly positive development is that dating culture hasn’t caught up with it. As heterosexual men, we still have to be some robotic alpha male without any capacity for feelings if we want to have any chance at going on dates with women. We still need to have no fear or anxiety at all, approach tons of women, get rejected hundreds if not thousands of times before a woman finally agrees to go on a date with us over all the other men pursuing her, then do everything in our power to preserve that relationship while crossing our fingers that a better man doesn’t come along and uproot us, ruining all our progress.

This is only really meant for men without feelings. In previous generations, men would just say “Pfft. She was a bitch anyway. I don’t care what women think about me” and approach the next woman. Mustering up the courage to approach a woman only to be told that your life has 0 value whatsoever over and over and over again results in a level of mental trauma that simply is not sustainable.

If the breakdown of gender roles also extended to dating, this wouldn’t be an issue. In a perfect world, women would approach men as well, so that men could actually feel like their lives mattered and wouldn’t be depressed all the time. Our culture, however, isn’t designed for men with feelings.

Does anyone want to know why male suicide rate is skyrocketing?

Whenever I approach women in person and try to befriend them, I usually am told to go away or they’re just not interested in talking. Online dating is not going any better.

The closest I’ve come to finding a partner was meeting a few women on pen pal websites whom I ended up catching feelings for. Of course, all these interactions end with me getting hurt. Back in 2019, I met a Russian-American woman studying in Europe. I ended up getting attached to her and she tells me she loves and cares about me and that I’m the best thing that has ever happened to her. Then, she ghosts me for another man and marries him. When I confronted her, she said that her husband had the money to fly her back to the US and I didn’t and she turned everything around on me and said it was my fault for getting attached. I fucking hate her and I hope she burns in Hell forever.

A few months ago, I met a girl in South Africa and I developed feelings for her too. I don’t get to talk to her very much and haven’t heard from her in nearly a month. I’ve been dealing with a bad depressive spell for the past few months and she said she would be there for me. Apparently, that was a load of BS too.

I came to get things off my chest because I can’t tell this to anyone else. But I'm going to be completely honest. I hate my fucking genetics and I've always have ever since I could remember like it so fucked up. It's the number one reason I never plan to have kids and just adopt. When I straight up told my mom this she got offended and said “what is there not to like about your genetic.You’re a good looking boy”which any mom would say to their son. But this is where my rant is really about to begin. I've haven't been called cute or attractive anything of that nature by a girl my whole life unless it was by mom or one of aunts. Literally every beauty standard that a man is (especially a black man which is what i am) I'm not. For one I'm 5’7( shortest in my family, even my grandma on mom side is taller than me which is sad and all my cousins are taller 6’0 feet and up)  which is short especially in the dating world because most women I ran into say they like men over 6ft and I'm never going to be that. Also the thing that I hate the most is I know eventually I'm going to lose my big curly hair ( the only feature I love about myself) because baldness runs on my dad side( my dad is literally the only guy to be bald in his family by my luck) and mom side(her father went bald in his 60s). I could go on and on about other things I hate about myself but this post is getting long enough. Point is I hate the way I look and sometimes I'm envious of other guys because I've seen them look better( Im not gay at all but I can tell when a guy is a good looking guy and looks better than me) and are taller than me and just get girl way easier than me. I've been getting rejected by every girl I like my whole life and sometimes I just feel like the biggest genetic loser and Im just forced to accept shit I just don't want to be. It seems the only way I'm going to get a beautiful women is if I become successful which just sounds so depressing but it is what it is.",2022-08-30 04:52:53,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653971934,5,/r/lonely/comments/x1a2f4/i_came_here_to_rant_19_year_old_male/,,0,2,I came here to rant 19 year old male

instead, i see everyone else live my dreams just by existing, they're just happy and perfect...i wanna be like them, i tried my best, i wanna find someone who'd like me and...made me feel special

why am i not good enough? maybe i'll never be...but who is? none of us are, and at the same time, we all are...then why does it never work for me?

i guess i've been always looking for someone...instead its always been me, and to be honest, i hated every second of it

the only time life felt right was when i found him, and he liked me, he made me feel understood and loved and cared about, he made me feel like there was a place in this world where i fit in...and in the end, he never even liked me...lying prick

no matter what i do, i'll never be like everyone else

i think, sometimes, i still want someone to come and save me...just with a hug, some cuddles...he'd made me feel like life its not so bad when you're not by yourself...he'd made me feel like im enough...like im actually worth it

why couldnt someone come...

all those years it was always me...why couldnt it have been me and someone else?, why did it have to be me?

and just when i thought my life was going to finally get better and do a 180° turn, the entire world goes to shit and i end up in a worse depression than before...does the entire universe hate me or something?

i wish i had someone to hug and cuddle...someone who'd care about my day and even if im still alive or not...someone to sing with and go discover new places, someone to watch movies with at sleepovers, someone to play videogames with, someone that loves me and understands me...someone to plan a future with

This is probably going to be a very long post so apologies in advance if you still end up reading it all. (Keep in mind Im not in a very good state right now and have a lack of sleep so this so this won’t be typed out very well.) I am mentally exhausted from life in general. Currently jobless been out of work for only 5 days (worked as an electrician for a year but got let go) these days have been very draining I am very low on money so there is not much I can do. I have only left the house to go to the gym down the road from me. The gym was the only thing I’ve looked forward to but it seems like I can’t get much enjoyment doing anything anymore. Recently broke up with 2 year long relationship with gf about a month ago I saw she was texting other guys and I told her to leave and we haven’t talked or texted each other since that day. These last few days have made me feel so exhausted despite not doing much. I’d have outbursts of rage and/or sadness. I’ve realized that thinking back through my life (currently 20 male) it’s been terrible I have so many bad memories (not to say my life is so much worse than anyone else it could always be worse than it is now) having to deal with parents splitting up, fighting sometimes physically, growing up watching my dad getting arrested, fighting with other girlfriends etc. it wasn’t and still isn’t very involved in my life. Last time I saw him about a year ago I went to see him the weekend after his birthday and asked instead of hanging out with me he asked me to babysit his new girlfriends kid while they went to the bar I ended up doing it but don’t have much of a desire to see him after that day. 
I used to look up to him when I was a kid but now I see how much of a loser he is with a lack of caring. There were often times when my mom would drop me off at his house for the weekend I had to sleep in the car with me during the winter due to the fights he would get into with a roommate or gf of his. 
I didn’t realize until recently that while I was in a car I was on the phone with my grandpa i realized on that day he was on the phone with me for so long because he was distracting me from my dad being arrested which is why he also picked me up. My grandpa was more of a father figure for me which pains me more thinking about him dying, watching his rib cage  break from being given cpr is so painful of a memory to look back too. I also think during middle school when I had terrible acne and was also very scrawny and shy which wasn’t a very fun time. Going into highschool I got a little of a glow up from being forced by my cousin to go to his wrestling practices and working out with him, I changed as a person very quickly. But it was brutal during the school year I would get beat after wrestling practices. I finished out my year but didn’t sign up for another one much of my family was disappointed but I couldn’t handle more of it so I went for swimming sophomore year which I enjoyed but had to stop and work my junior year so I could buy a car to drive and pay for insurance. It kinda bummed me out not doing Athletics but I still got to workout in my spare time which I enjoyed it was one of the few things I looked forward too. Shortly before I graduated I met a girl I thought I was going to spent the rest of my life with I loved her and her family, they were so generous and close as a family it made me jealous and wish my family was like that. During her graduation she had a big party for it, I thought in the bad of my head that I wish I could have a party with this many people that care for me. Our relationship begin to sour after the first time I saw her texting guys so we argued, made up and got back together but our relationship was never the same, she said about once a month she would lose feelings for me but they would come back later. I’m not sure if that’s normal but it was difficult to go through I tried so hard to hold on with her despite her being hateful to me, I loved her so much, but it didn’t work. I realized I’ve never really got to go on many trips the farthest I’ve went is Dallas which is 4 hours from me for a funeral. I had a fishing guide planned with a friend in lake texoma it was 400 and we planned to split, he canceled on me a few days before (yes I paid a direct deposit in case that happened) so I just sat at my house feeling sorry for myself on my birthday weekend. I don’t really get to do much most weekends. I don’t have very many friends I got better at being more social but not at a point to where I stood out. I could keep going on and on about how sad I am about my life. 
I haven’t eaten anything today due to how low on food I am, I went to the gym today but didn’t enjoy it. I had a job lined up for next week but I don’t know if I want to do it anymore. I hate my life, it’s miserable, I hate my fucking life, I don’t like anything anymore, i don’t sleep, i have no actual friends, no social life and I’m fucking miserable. At this point I’m highly considering scrapping all the money I have left to go to a beach so I do something I’ve wanted to do with my life then shoot myself.",2022-08-30 09:21:19,lonely,t5_2qjny,1630637413,4,/r/lonely/comments/x1ee1z/sorry/,,0,1,Sorry

5924,x1em79,AverageReditor13,"Second post... what the hell am I even doing? God this school year won't be good.

So like the title says, I'm trying to move on, I want to, but the girl I want to move on from is making it difficult. A quick recap of [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/wz3ftu/i_felt_love_and_pain_in_one_week/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) from a couple days ago, I felt love and pain in one week. Classes just started, scared as shit, met a girl, a long time friend of mine and I fell in love for the first time. It wasn't 'til Saturday when things went downhill when I found out she was already taken. It hurt... a lot.

So it was the following week and I said to myself during the weekend that I'm not going to fall for her, I'm moving on. Boy was I wrong...

""You look nice today."" (She said as I walked in the room)

""Brought some snacks for you and me."" (During recess.)

""Come with me at 7- Eleven."" (During lunch. She didn't ask, literally just wanted me to come with her.)

""You okay? You look tired."" (I accumulated a cold during the day.)

""I'm waiting on you, silly."" (During dismissal. She asked if I'd walk out the school grounds with her.)

I don't know why but the things she said to me during the day stuck with me. I know it's only friendly things to do these things given how long we've been friends and how we know each others' likes and dislikes. Now, I'm not saying I want her to stop nor do I want to cut her off for a while, I kinda like how she's always enthusiastic and generous, it really gets me going. But it's just making my process of moving on that much harder.

I was feeling a cycle of happiness and despair every time I talked, laughed and ate with her. I'm only playing the role of a friend and it hurts forcing myself to not take it further, I gotta respect her and relationship with another, I have to. She's just giving me those feel good moments and I wanted it to last, but like I said, she's already taken. I don't want to look like a douche bag if I avoid her and I don't want to look like I'm hitting on her if I don't keep my urge to do so. I want to move on, really I want to, but it's just so hard when I constantly see her everyday.

Funny, I'm already feeling like absolute shit and it isn't even Wednesday yet. I don't know why I'm like this. I didn't have anywhere else to say how my day went so I returned here, to let out my fucking pain...

Where have you gone, my darling one?
Are you on your own?
Are you having fun?
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?
Does a day go by like a memory?
Do you ever try to remember me
In an automobile or a crowded bar?
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio
I just want you to know you were always my only choice
And where ever you go then I still love you so,
if you're still within the sound of my voice.
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?
And if you are still within the sound of my voice
watching this video, I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near
There's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice.
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress 
but only you can send a lifeline out to me.
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong 
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will
Are you still within the sound of my voice
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries

i always pictured if i got my first apartment my cat would be there and if i ever got a house i coud build a fence and give him a comfortable home. every time i walk through my house it reminds me of my cat. he used to be sitting on the top railing whenever i walked up the stairs and he would jump on my shoulders or meow and ask for attention. whenever i opened the front door he was there meowing and asking for food and to cuddle. my backyard which i remember walking around the grass with my cat running by me and following me around is now empty it's just me back there. my cat i would cuddle when i needed comfort and had nowhere to go and that's gone too. 
 
he refuses to come inside in the summer he runs out the door jumps out windows and whines so i left him outside because no matter what i did he just wouldn't stay inside. i haven't seen him in around 10 days and somehow my mom found out in the street late at night trying to come home. he was doing okay just starting to eat and lick his fur and i thought everything was okay but after a couple hours my mom comes to my door and tells me hes dying and i see him laying on the floor barely moving his head and breathing. i went to try and comfort him and he was slowly dying and his body just moved really fast and freaked out and it looked like he had a seizure and died. i went to sit up and i looked at his face and i just saw his dead eyes looking blank and i knew it was over. it felt like a knife in the chest seeing that just not knowing what to do.

All my classmates are 1 seat apart from me as i ""scare"" them. The teacher always does their best to have me last or completely forgets me during attendance.

Though i have a mug garden and picked up music and writing, i've still been socially isolated in my home past day 1 of quarantine. I can thank it for initially for letting me have time to discover myself, i can also hate it for being the last place i could go to.

I struggle to sleep at night, to a point that i cry from generating heat against  a pillow i hold close to me. Even simple ideas of reassurance makes me want to muffle the sobbing stream of tears i drench the pillows in.

This all, being wrapped up with a bow of parents being emotionally distant and focusing more on my future than if i ever will be alive by then, hurting me for questioning them; them and them never being remorseful for any of what they do to me.

Every close chance at friends i have gets shut down by them, because ""family and christianity"" first.

I have no one and nothing to live for, i truly don't have a good side to look at with this being the same cycle since i was 9, only far more amplified.

I've made peace with loneliness in the worst way, that its the last thing i truly have to talk to.

I want to kill myself but i won't, i wan't to hurt myself but i can't.

I know its impossible for all of it to stop, but i wish.",2022-08-30 13:28:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,,7,/r/lonely/comments/x1j5p0/worst_case_scenario/,,0,4,Worst Case Scenario

5946,x1k939,Giorgio_Bn,"Hi everyone, this is my first post ever on reddit. I usually don't like to talk about myself, but i thought that maybe here I can share my story without feeling like I'm being judged.
I (22 m) always struggled with people, that because of several family tragedies in my childhood (which was not the happiest. I had no friends, almost never went out and play with other kids, the only thing that kept me entertained was my ps2, it was pretty lonely). I always felt like i was out of place and that no one liked me. Over the years I slowly built my life: I learned how to talk to people (I usually make jokes and being most of the time friendly with others), made friends and even had a couple of girlfriends (which it was a great suprise to me because I'm not capable to talk to girls that I like without sounding weird or embarrassing).
I had a relationship that lasted 3 years with a girl that I deeply loved, but things didn't turned out the way I hoped and I broke up with her in december (usually when I'm in a dying relationship I turn hostile and it always ends up with me hurting their feelings, that thing makes me hate myself because I always feel remorse after, I never talked to both of my exes after the breakup). I tried to take control of my life and I actually did for a couple of months (I've lost a lot of weight and started exercising at home, i changed clothing style and even got earrings), I learned how to have fun with my friends and I've had a new crush in university that I really liked, I tried to invite her on a date several times, but as I said I'm not the best with women so she said no each time, and that really hurt me, but that's the way it is sometimes and I'm aware of that. Things went horribly in the first months after the breakup (i just felt empty), then they went way better, but now, with all this time that had passed since december, i just realized that I'm feeling empty again, I noticed that I've gotten way worse with women (it's not a problem with all girls, just the ones that i find attractive), and i struggle to get attached to anyone (I tried to talk to many girls but I've never felt invested, same thing with most of my friends, both in the city where my university is and in my hometown). I love and respect my friends, but it hurts me seeing how they're way more capable than me in social interaction (both with girls or other guys), while I feel like I'm still in the same situation for a while now. I just don't feel like I want to go out anymore, I don't enjoy being with others as much as I used to. I guess I'm feeling lonely again and I'm pushing towards loneliness. I hoped that there was a solution, that maybe with enough persistence and control I could change my attitude both with friends or girls that i like, but I just can't. It's not all bad, I learned new social skills, but I feel like that they're not enough.
Thank you for reading my story, i just wanted to tell someone.

you’re only posting that shit on ur story to try and gain sympathy from more unsuspecting girls. 

you find the broken girls who give everything to help you, then you leave as soon as you find the next. breaking us even more. i lived only for you and you knew that, used it to your advantage. then you threw me away.

the worst part is i can’t even tell you. i cant scream that i hate you, because the truth is i still miss you. no i miss what we could’ve been, what you threw away. you kept going down that path that i got us both off of. i’m sober and alone, but you’re still just the same. 

you’re not unique either, you’re all the same. you’re whole group thinks it’s funny, that i did something to deserve this.

All I could think about when my little brother was having these outbursts is don’t hurt him man he having a hard time so I let him take all his anger out on me. Fast forward to the present my little brother has gotta so much better and he also try to be nice to me more often and he would bring up what happened with our past and he would feel so sorry for me but not once did I  ever think to hit my little brother and he tells me he wants to change because of the horrible things he did to me,he’s my only friend.",2022-08-30 20:24:36,lonely,t5_2qjny,,1,/r/lonely/comments/x1tg3j/be_nice/,,0,0,Be nice

I really don't wanna sound like ""I'm not like the other people"", but I can't be close with anyone and everyone around me is so different... not better, not worse, just different. I'm a white-aspergers-boy living stereotype (despite being a girl lol): problems with communication, problems with understanding social rules, literal thinking, being extremely slow and low reaction time, needing a lot of alone time, sensory sensitivities, getting easily overwhelmed, strong autistic meltdowns, obsessive interests in narrow topics, executive dysfunction, inappropriate expression ... you understand. I want to have normal friends, but I can't - most people treat me like a thrash, or like a child, or like air, or in the best cases they are friendly, but really distanced. Some people also got obsessed about me and it was sick and overwhelming. I have a girlfriend, but I probably can't handle a romantic relationship, we're really distanced as well. Friendships with other autistics are usually easier (f. e. I really love talking with my autistic neighbour, who has a special interest in bees and beekeeping), but autistic people often have the same problem with being distanced and we end up twice as distanced as with an allistic person, even if our contact is more pleasant (my gf is also autistic, and we are also in long-distanced relationship). The lack of normal, natural, comfortable relationships in my life is hard for me. I love Tim Burton's movies, because he is a genius in writing natural and relatable obviously autistic characters - like Edward Scissorhands, Victor from Frankenweenie and more. Because of relating to them I feel a little less alone. Also biographies of real-life autistics help me a lot - like a films Copying Beethoven or Loving Vincent, but it's hard to treat films and books like a friends' substitute. But I can't have normal human relations, no matter how hard I'm trying and how much I'm reading about ""normal"" people's psychology to understand them better. Even if I'm not that bad at masking, it's hard to meet potential close ones while trying to be someone else.

6031,x1zpm9,Own_Discipline2351,"Went to my sons prek orientation, and happened to see someone I had class with in HS, she was there with her son and husband (with a little bun in the oven) I’ve been a single mom off and on for the better part of 5 years and today it just stung me to my heart. Even when me and my sons dad were together  I was the default person to initiate everything. The only time he took over was when I found out he cheated on me… 3 times before moving in together. And really all he did was buy me a balloon and an ugly plant. So I mean.. I guess that helped? Jk.. My self esteem hasn’t always been the greatest due to my moms drug addiction and her beating it into my head that no one would want me unless I looked a certain way. The summer before 7th grade she made it clear that no one would want to be with the fat girl. I’ve had a distorted image of myself every since. So it kinda leaves me open to assholes. For a long time I thought I was lucky if someone wanted to be with me..  because I was told that no one ever would. My sons dad is probably one of the most toxic situations I’ve ever been in.  4 months ago I left him, took my kid and started Over at my dads house. I’m hating life right now but I knew I would.. so I’m sticking it out until I get some kind of
Miracle. 

I guess I’m having problems with how lonely this journey is. I mean don’t get me wrong I felt alone for 4 years of the relationship but now I’m like ALONE ALONE. I feel like if I scream no one would hear me. I spend all day disassociating.. I’ve considered suicide but no one would ever care for my child the way I do.. so I can’t really go down that road. I’m with my son 24/7 so I have no social life outside of him. I’ll sometimes sneak away just to drive around the block so I have a few minutes of “me time”. I was fired from my job shortly after moving here so I’m still working on getting that sorted out on top of running a business. 

I feel like I’m trapped in some shitty cycle.. and I can see the light but I’m stuck running in place. 

Anyway.. if you got this far

6033,x2075e,cyanidenohappiness,"Maybe it’s my fault for dating her knowing she’s going away so soon, but we gave each other our best summer by far. Since summer started until she leaves, we have seen each other everyday. Some days it was less than an hour, others was for the entire day. We went out 1-3 times a week. We took each other to so many new places and experiences. I got to experience downtown with the person I love. I went out 3 times with my ex in a 6 month relationship.

She gave me everything I wanted and needed. She helped me get over my much worse ex and be more in touch with my emotions. She was the first person to hold me in her arms while I cried. I helped her get over her trauma. I helped her with breakdowns and any problems she once had. We helped each other grow as a person. It’s very hard to imagine a summer without her, especially since I moved far away from my friends. 

Im gonna miss her so much. Going from seeing her everyday to seeing her every other month. From constant love and affection to a time difference. From waking up at 9AM to walk to her house to waking up at 1PM and doing nothing. We are both going to uni so we will both be busy. 

Who knows, maybe we break up after a couple of months, or we adjust and make it through, only time can tell. Maybe she was just a summer fling, I sure hope not. The only thing i can say for sure is that, I will never forget her and the impact she left.

I will be unbelievably lonely, the loneliest I will ever be in my life. I'm 22 and my life has no direction, cause I have a lot of mental health problems (BPD/Depression/Anxiety).

I've never really cried over shit in my life but this def hits diff. Not even playing video games can get my mind of it.

I’ve never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. I’ve come really close when I was I school, but I was “in love”, being the big virgin I was. But they only wanted me for sex and I wouldn’t give it to them, so they cast me aside like I was nothing. Happened twice, and it broke me. Because of that and other circumstances (death of a close friend, family troubles), I failed out of school. I know I could’ve done better, but life was just so hard at that time. It’s been 5 years since then.

I’ve tried moving on from my troubles. I’ve tried making new friends and meeting girls. But I have no experience. I scare them away because im so awkward. Most people I’ve known consider me intelligent, kind and friendly, but the girls I’m into never see that side of me. I’m told that I’m good looking, down to earth and likeable but I have no confidence in myself. I never really have. I feel unlovable. There’s a woman at work I really like, she’s so kind and friendly, and women my age just aren’t like her. I want to talk to her but she just paralyzes me. And this exact situation has happened before. Not that it matters, I couldn’t “pull” her anyway, that’s what the assholes at work say because they know I’m an awkward dork loser virgin. 

I wish I wasn’t me. I’m so lonely it hurts. I don’t want to be alive anymore, I can’t take this pain. I want my friend back, I miss him so much. I just don’t get why it had to be my friend.

6044,x212vv,Katieonlyy,"I’ve just recently been letting this really get to me. Im a 15 y/o f and the last couple years have been really hard for me. My mom got custody of me August of 2021. I’ve always lived with my grandma and she herself was never much of an affectionate person but my mom was. My mom was a drug addict so she’s had a lot of struggles but she met a my step dad and they had my brother and my mom is a stay at home mom now. She’s loves my brother a lot and has never really been separated from him (he is 6 now). When I lived with my grandma she had got clean and my step dad had a job offer 6 hours away so they lived there for a while and my mom came every other weekend. I wanted to be with her so bad and I finally got that. I was a little troubled but not too much just an average teenager type. Btw I have really no contact with my dad and me and my step dad don’t really talk I’m not sure why he just never really spoke to me much at all or been close with me. I got pregnant when I was 13 and had my baby at 14 while living with my mom. I believe she is currently using meth But she denies it. She has ups and downs but she’s always with my little brother. She even keeps him out of school so she can be with him more. I try and sit to talk with her when I get lonely but she always is either sleeping, sick, doing something, or just not wanting to talk. It really upsets me because my boyfriend is usually always working and at school. I really miss my mom but she’s always so cold to me. I know I disappointed her and I’m deeply sorry for it but I still want my mom. She is often very passive aggressive towards me and never really wants to spend one on one time together unless it’s with my step dad or little brother. I’m really lonely and it’s been getting to me a lot. Sometimes when she is feeling good she will let me go with her to shop but it’s not usual or as often. Everyday is mostly the same. It’s really affecting my mental health I just want my mom. It seems like most of the time my step dad and little brother are what matter to her most.

I've been thinking about it a lot, and that incident taught me a few things... One of which I guess is nobody gives a shit if I tell them what happened. Well, except my coworkers, which I'm sure at this point would be happy to hear it happened. 


Another thing I learned was that even if you do everything right, even if you follow every little procedure to a T and do everything by the book -- things can **still** fuck up. After all I work around machines all day. The experience got me to thinking, a lot... Maybe I'm still just processing the whole fuckin thing. Last night I stayed up for a few hours talking to the girl I went on a few dates with. I just needed to talk to her again because yesterday could've been my last day on earth. So many regrets... 


How do you put a lifetime of sloth and lust, hatred and envy to words? You can, but will there ever be enough words but in *just* the right way to do it justice? I... haven't lived a good life. I've done my fair share of working on myself to become a ""better person"" but it seems each effort I made took me a step in the wrong direction. Every time I thought I was doing something better -- something else would crop up and negate the good things. Shit, if I died yesterday I would've been remembered as -- 



No actually.. I wouldn't be remembered at all. After my folks pass away that's it. I'd be nothing more than a passing ""well, shit"" that someone would utter if they heard about the stupid fuckin way I died. Maybe someone would find my reddit account and follow up with ""man he had a problem with porn."" 


But most of all? 


To people that know me (all one of them) I'd be the guy that's carried a torch for a girl that he hasn't talked to in four years. I'd be the one that loved her so fucking much, for so fuckin long, that he's **STILL** writing about her. He **STILL** has her picture saved on his phone. He **STILL** thinks about conversations he could've had with her and how different things could've been... And the worst part of it all ? She'll never know a damn word of everything I'd love nothing more than to articulate to her in person. 



.. But I can't. Instead I nearly got domed by some copper jacketed bullet.

6090,x25lri,Bunnips7,"I'm used to either not celebrating it or doing so alone, but this year hits different. I have friends now, and I'm the only one excited about it ;; It's because we're all overseas. To be honest, I didn't talk to them a lot this year compared to previous ones, so it makes sense, everyone's working now and I'm still in uni. It still hurts though. Just getting a happy birthday text kinda really sucks. 

I guess it's just that people are busy and don't have time. I'm also not typically affectionate, and find it hard to accept and give it, so I must not have formed that sort of connection with people... even though these are really close friends of mine. I live alone and have spent the last 3 years alone due to covid, and lost my best friend to covid last year too. She passed away painfully in ICU at 22 years old, like a month after she turned 22. It was 10 days before my 21st birthday and honestly I'm really blocking that out. 

Maybe I shouldn't be though. I'm so used to celebrating it alone and I really don't usually mind, but not having people in my corner really hurts right now. Especially having lost the one peer level person I felt I could be totally honest and loving with. Loneliness is a unique pain because the cause of it is completely out of your own control. 

But if my younger self had anything right, it's not about the people, really. It's about how secure I feel right now, and how much I value my own love. I am in pain because I feel like I lost a lot of good loving people by not being good enough for them. If that's true, the only thing I can do now is try to be kinder, more honest, less defensive, more thoughtful, try to reach out more when it counts, but also, to learn how to love and enjoy my own time more. 

If my widowed mother and losing my best friend, as well as growing up with few close connections have taught me anything, it's that your time alone is super meaningful. Maybe I'm lying to myself, but I want to try to be okay with me, cause I mean. I'm alright. It's just that people aren't paying attention, which makes sense, because I'm not their priority in their own lives. They're honestly not my priority either. (since wanting ""a relationship"" and wanting ""a relationship with *you*"" is different, platonic). Okay that's my essay. I was so insecure about having a problem that I had to try and solve it myself. go me.",2022-08-31 05:48:11,lonely,t5_2qjny,1579726880,4,/r/lonely/comments/x25lri/22nb_birthday_tw_grief/,,0,0,22NB Birthday (TW grief)

It's just a flood of memories of you, dancing along with Bruce Sprinsteen. I can also hear dad's agonizing scream to the sky calling for you. As much as it hurts, I definitely felt his pain. We just miss you. 

I wish you were here to see how much good I've done. I know you're watching over, but I wish I could hear you voice tell me how proud you are. I also wish you were the one to be here helping me figure out adult hood. I think I would've been a different person if that were true.

6092,x263hz,penguini_dave,"I have a lot going on and a lot to get off my chest so sorry if this feels a little incoherent. 
I hate that most people think depression is just like a one time thing that you can just get over. It's not, it's a constant mental struggle that increasingly gets harder and harder everyday I wake up and see no one laying next to me ready to comfort me and let me know that everything's going to be okay.
The worst offenders are my family who think I'm just being over dramatic and keep saying to just get over it. I feel genuinely alone, not just relationship-wise but in general, as if there's no one around who really gets me. And I feel afraid, it's hard to explain,  but I always have this pit in my stomach like somethings eating me from the inside out.
Having autism makes it hard to connect to people and even harder to form meaningful relationships. Everyone always says 'don't give up on love' or 'I'm sure there's someone out there for you, you just have to keep looking'.
Well then, where is she? Where's Maddison? Where's the only person I can say I loved and mean it?
I'm so fucking sick of this? I'm truly afraid that I might not be able to hold out much longer and I feel like my minds burning down and the walls are closing in.
Is this the only place where I can put my feelings out there for anyone to notice, if any one notices at all. I just want someone to say 'I see you and I love you' is that too much to ask? What enrages me more is that there are so many other users just faking it for clout or pussy. It's sickening to see these people hoping to to take advantage of people just like you and me, heartbroken and lonely individuals who only have one place to go and can only rely on each other. And since when has advertising yourself on r/lonely for pussy or dick every actually worked? As temping as it is, one time hookups and sexting are not the solutions to our problems, trust me, it only makes it hurt more.
All I want in life is someone who loves me as much as I love them. Someone who would walk to the ends of the earth for me as long as I was right there with them. Someone like Maddison. I gave her my heart on a silver platter and she gave me hers, or so I thought she did. First chance she got she took my heart and dropped it on the cold, hard floor. Since then I've been so afraid of getting hurt like that again, I completely cut myself off from others and put up a barrier I can't get through. I'm so sick and tired of these half-assed, surface level attempts at comfort from everyone else, I just need one person to say 'I get it, I understand what you're going through.' And mean it. 
Please, someone, anyone reading this, please just let me know I'm going to be okay. Please just look at me and see the pain and exhaustion in my eyes, and say 'I love you'.",2022-08-31 06:18:24,lonely,t5_2qjny,1653401192,1,/r/lonely/comments/x263hz/the_battle_never_really_ends_does_it/,,0,0,"The Battle Never Really Ends, Does It?"

6108,x286wc,LaminarEntropy,"Wtf happened? I used to be less miserable. I was mostly sad and thoughtful about myself and my state and after my whole private ordeal with this friend of mine that I knew since I was 10 years old, I competely derailed. Like I was depressed but I had no idea how much worse I was capable of getting.

What I'm going through might barely count as heartbreak. I OBSESS over this person constantly. When I'm at work, home, or anywhere. This isn't something recent either. It's been well over a year now and my last contact was 4 months ago. I have contacted so much of my family and vented. I sort of pushed people way. I enabled the worst and most unhealthy parts of friends and family. The only thing I do is **drain** the life out of people around me.

All because someone told me no. I can't take a fucking no. I spend so much time thinking about what if. What if what if what if. What if she's listening to me? What if she is talking bad about me behind my back? I've had so much denial and unhealthy thoughts that I keep enabling. When will she come back? She'll come back right? RIGHT??? It's JUST around the corner. She'll be there.

I do nothing now but what is essential to keep me alive. Food, water, air, shelter. I go to work then I eat then I sleep then I repeat. Then before I knew it it was 4 months later and nothing changed. I'm a shell of a human. I'm this entity that just exists experiencing pure unfiltered suffering.",2022-08-31 08:30:57,lonely,t5_2qjny,1649977595,5,/r/lonely/comments/x286wc/what_the_hell_happened_to_me/,,0,6,What the hell happened to me?

I hear from others that gaming is a good way to find new people to talk with and possibly make new friends, honestly I find that hardly the truth because if you aren't being shouted at by children or adults your being constantly berated by slurs or someone who's had sexual relations with my mother. What I'm trying to get at is even though game quite abit it's just hard trying to find new people to hang out with, it wasn't always this way tbh I used to be with my friends or younger brother quite frequently but even then that's beginning to dwindle. I understand they have a life aswell and don't want to spend their free time with a dropout loser and tbh I don't blame them and as for my younger brother I try not to bug him as much because I think at times I'm just not at all interesting to talk with and when he does talk with me I tend to bring up less than desirable topics usually in the dark and depressing means. Idk maybe I'm just not an interesting person to talk with or maybe I'm just to depressing of a person to be around and conversate with hell possibly both.

We went on first date. To my surprise, she agreed to the second one after that.

Later we went on second date which also went well.

She was kind of busy/stressed with work, so we only met once a week. She was bit reserved too so there was no hand holding or kissing either.

Our 3rd date got cancelled because she got sick. Later that week, we were talking and she mentioned that she is too stressed with her life at this moment and is not ready for a relationship. That's how the one month of my life went with ending back to square one.

I think I was too demanding that I overwhelmed her. She wanted to meet once a week but I tried to push her to twice a week. I just wanted us to spend quality time together. That's all I wanted.

6137,x2dgr2,Livid_Bottle3364,"I'm very interested in the topic of ***Loneliness in Men.*** I'm a young male myself, English isn't my native language so please excuse me for any mistakes. Let me start off by saying I'm incredibly grateful for what I have, this is not a cry for help. However, I have noticed genuine surprise when I tell people that I feel lonely quite often. They always follow up with something along the lines of '*but you have a gf, friends, a successful career, and family in near proximity, how can you feel lonely!?*'.

You don't have to be alone to feel lonely. I think that the loneliness of an average man is often hugely underestimated in society, by women, but also by other men who may think it is just them that feel that way. Men rarely talk about stuff like this to even their best friends, so they often have no idea what their friends are going through.

*You don't know what true loneliness is until you have something that you want to talk about but there is no one to share it with*. This is something I feel a lot of men suffer from. Most men rarely receive any positive attention, no DM's, no compliments, and no one asking them how their day at work was. In my opinion, this is also the reason why men will remember a compliment they received for years because it's such a rare occurrence. Most women get so many compliments, that they often forget them a few days later. I feel like in modern society it is rare for guys to give another guy a compliment, and it is rare for girls to give men a compliment since they are afraid it will be taken as flirting.

Please understand that I'm not **at all** trying to blame anyone for anything, and this is not a rant. I'm just extremely interested in this topic as I feel there is a lot that could be improved.

Sure I get excited for a Friday at first, but as soon as I’m free from work I can’t understand what I was so looking forward to. Other than drinking. The things I enjoy, almost feel like commitments I have to make to myself just to survive. Why am I doing this then? I keep telling myself I will end this if it doesn’t get better. I’m scared to commit to death because I’m afraid I’ll botch it. I’m angry about going on because absolutely everything feels like a chore or a means to survival.

I feel so impossibly alone. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I’m so tired of feeling so alone. I just want to feel loved but I don’t remember ever feeling that. 

I‘m so scared I’m going to mess it up if I try to end this. I could just make things worse, imagine that. Nothing feels good enough or is relieving enough to make going on like this worth it. I don’t want to do this anymore. I just wish I didn’t feel so alone. 

I’m trying so hard not to drink, it’s not even noon here yet. I started drinking after lunch during work yesterday. I’m afraid I will do the same thing today. Of course alcohol is such a brief relief, I’ll have to drink a whole case at least if I’m going to drink that early and keep it up til I can sleep. 

I can’t stand myself. I’m what’s wrong in my life. No matter what, I just can’t feel connected or close to anyone. No matter what they say, it feels so insincere. I talk to people in relationships, friendships, I see how people talk about their SOs or their friend group, and it seems like they feel genuinely connected to those people. They feel love and comfort and can see future plans with them. I can’t. I am so jealous of this.  Is this because I want to die, or is it something else, I don’t know. 

I‘m also incredibly jealous of people who have even a barely functioning relationship with their family or parents, or a parent. I wonder what it’s like to feel someone cares about you. Someone checks on you. Someone worries about you. Someone wants the best for you. Someone goes out of their way to do things for you, and expects nothing in return but to know that you’re ok. 

Every day gets worse. 

I just want to feel at home somewhere. I would love to feel at home with someone too. I’m pretty sure I feel love for some. There are people I care about, who I want to see do well and be as happy as possible. I just have never felt loved, myself.

They come to me to play, eat, sleep, bathe- the banality of having a child, except I never had these children. I feel as though I don’t give them enough love or attention that they need, I’m depressed and in my own head, dejected and confused. I’ve been dictated parenthood when I can’t bare it, I’m too depressed to bare. I feel horrible and as though I’m causing them harm. I try my best, but my best isn’t enough. I have to be strong all the time, strong and happy, that’s the opposite of who I am. I feel as I’d I’m too angry or too emotional or not happy enough for them, i don’t want to tear their jovial innocence from them. I can’t give them what they need but I’m the only one who they can get it off. I feel guilty and horrible and selfish for being suicidal, when I’m the only person they have. I can’t bare life but I’m the only person they have. I just want them to be happy and loved and cared for and all that I wasn’t. I have to protect them from the psychological and  physical harm from my mother, doing this is making me so tired, every time i hear the slightest noise I have to run to make sure nothing is happening.

I finally got a job. But it feels like a job when I get home too. My mom stresses me out. My older brother is always criticizing me. These two people are the only family members that I have. But right now, all they feel like strangers. 

I told my mom about wanting to be perfect. I cried in front of her, but all she told me was that I stress her out, she said that I make her sad. She told me that I have no right to be sad, because I have everything. 

And she's right. We're poor. We can't do anything except survive. But that's a lot more than others can say. So I'm lucky. And have no right to be sad/depressed.

Then I told my best friend how I felt. He gets mad at me if I'm sad. He'll yell at me and tell me to just leave and not come back.

Yesterday he said ""you really like to be unlikable don't you""

6186,x2ot0w,Musingsandstuff,"This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit... I’ve never been the type to seek sympathy from others in a crisis unless it got to the point where my spiralling became uncontrollable. Usually I’d turn to people-pleasing and looking out for everyone else in hopes that they’d see me and want to be around. 

I’ve learnt my lesson when it comes to buying love and have changed so much that the therapists would be proud. Yet my investment in self-love has only made me feel more alone. Before, there was always something going on: a romantic distraction, studying, family issues, friends, parties, work… I could always escape in the mess and forget that I felt lonely. Now, it bangs at my door every hour on the hour, ready to leave me in tears. 

Life is difficult, there are ups and downs, but it feels like the more I’ve tried to do the right thing and the more I’ve tried to lean into love, the more my life has deteriorated until this point right now where I find myself. No friends and nobody really making an effort to build a friendship, despite my efforts; no job because my health has deteriorated rapidly over the last few years; no career aspirations or certainty because of my health but also because I’ve been pulled here, there and everywhere and don’t have the energy to even think about what I could do that would make me feel fulfilled. No money to run away to another country like I’ve been fortunate enough to do before.

Everything is just stale, lifeless. 

I fought for so long to make things better in my life and did the work. Trust me, I have done everything - including looking at where I’ve been the problem - yet nothing helps. It’s heartbreaking. I’ve only ever wanted to have loving relationships with people and live with meaning and I know I could, I have the potential.

6194,x2pm9g,Resident5563,"I need a space to vent, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to do so.

I’ve never been good at socialising or fitting in, and i haven’t had a healthy self image for as long as I can remember. I’m incredibly sensitive and prone to mood swings. Starting 2021 I used a lot of alcohol to cope with my issues.

In high school I was always weird and shunned, and I was too cowardly and insecure to try and change that. Only recently have I begun to make changes and try to become “normal”. 

I grew up in a household with an alcoholic and abusive father, except he was never abusive towards me rather he targeted my mother and once my brother was old enough, him as well. He was very silly and playful with me. I never had a father figure until I was 9 in the form of my stepfather when my parents got divorced, however I didn’t stop seeing and being influenced by my dad until I was around 14. 

I feel like I never learnt how to mature properly and I feel like I missed out on so much during high school, friendship wise.

Recently I have taken steps to improve my confidence, I learned to play the piano to grade 8, I started socialising more and during 2020 I made some really good friends (who looking back most are probably damaged in some way like me), until we started experimenting with different substances and since then the relationships have slowly faded, some due to alcohol and drug use, some due to normal life stuff (studying etc). 

For the whole of 2021 I was in a relationship with my now ex girlfriend. She, again, was probably damaged in some way like me as well, she needed loads of attention and in September of 2021 when we moved to separate universities things started to get fairly nasty. She demanded I see her every two weeks, which I did. She was, imo, incredibly pessimistic and coped with her issues by blaming everyone else. Couldn’t figure out how to make friends? “Well they’re just petite blonde girls who wouldn’t even want to hang out with me if I tried.” Etc… I tried to make her more positive and help her but it came too much for me. She always wanted to know where I was and occasionally accused me of lying to her about being with other girls, which I never did.

So I withdrew from making friends and communicating in general and in someways I hate myself for not being able to make things work. But we broke up. She told me I abused her and made her hate everything about herself. I know deep down that she’s just saying that, but it still hurts me. 

Since then I’ve cut contact, she’s made a few attempts at contacting me however and even going as far to accuse me of sexually harassing a 16 year old, with 0 evidence (mainly because I’ve never done anything like that). 

Now my day to day consists of sitting at my pc and and going to the gym. 

Tbf I’ve made a lot of progress since we broke up (April 2022), I drink less, managed to hang out with a few friends, got a job and made some money as well as a some friends. 

But overall I still feel really lonely, not even lonely, just pointless.

I’ve gone on holiday and had a mini meltdown in private because I can’t distract myself with my pc and home comforts like usual. I’m still struggling with feelings that I’m a shit person, that I’m an abuser, that I’ve damaged my ex even though deep down I know that while I may have been distant and may have not opened up I still came and visited her, I still tried to make her feel loved but she suffocated me and I can’t put it any other way. 

I feel unlovable, like I’m going to become like my father, that I’m toxic and manipulative, that no one wants to be around me, that I’m too self pitiful. While it has gotten better, every day is such a fucking struggle for me internally, battling guilt, anxiety, desire to drink, loneliness and lack of connection. It’s so draining and I’m sick of putting up with it. 

I start uni again in about three weeks and I’m hoping to get a fresh start. I’m planning on learning Japanese with a small tuition group that’s paid for by the uni, and joining the mountaineering society so I can have a social hobby.

(repost because I accidentally deleted it)

Hi my name is Faith (17Female) and I’m honestly just tired and drained. I come from a black-African household. I have 3 younger sisters: Blessing 16F, Divine 14F, and Grace 12F. My parents have always done their best to provide for me and my little sisters and I will always appreciate and be grateful for that!

Now here’s the real story: Growing up, I never really had a good school life. I’ve been bullied since the age 4/5 years old. However the bullying got bad as soon as I reached secondary school. I was mercilessly bullied by what you’d call the ‘popular group’. I was picked on &amp; verbally attacked every single day by certain people in the popular group (2 girls and 3 boys in particular). They would make me cry everyday &amp; they are the reason why I have such low self esteem and no confidence in myself.

The bullying went on throughout our 5 years of being in this school. What’s worse is that my teachers would do absolutely nothing about it. No matter how many times, my parents angrily approached the school headteacher. The headteacher herself was a useless POS, I couldn’t stand her. I never understood why almost everyone in our year idolised these horrible people. Because in my eyes, they were the most evil people on earth; all they did was verbally attack people (including teachers) and they would just talk down on others for no reason whatsoever. 

I’ve been through so much in school and at home. My parents were always arguing and I’d always sit in my room with my sisters and I would cover my youngest sister’s ears because she was always scared. I sometimes cry myself to sleep, thinking about what I went through.
 
I loved my parents dearly, however, my dad used to be really aggressive and would sometimes throw things. Honestly, my dad was a really good dad and he was always protective of me and my siblings, however, he was just extremely aggressive when he got angry. He would also drink heavily whenever he was depressed. Now my dad has recently been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. He’s only 54 and currently isn’t living with us as he’s incapable of looking after us now. So now it’s just me, my mum &amp; my 3 siblings. My mum has played both parts and she has a heavy weight on her shoulders; takes care of all of us, alone. While my dad is living in a care home. 

Me and my mum visit him a few times a week to bring him food and just to see how he’s doing. The place he stays at is quite far so I take 2 buses to go and see him. I missed the old version of my dad. The dad who always took my and my sisters shopping when he could, the dad who was always willing to go out of his way to provide for our family. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep when thinking about him and the good times.
 
I’ve also not had the best experience with friends. Most of my ‘friends’ have turned their backs on me. I’ve been backstabbed, used, lied to, taken for granted etc. Almost every single friend I’ve had in my life was fake, they have let me down and have always had something negative to say about me, whereas me, I would take time out of my day to be by their side, just for them not to do the same. 

The sad thing is that I always kept my peace and never confronted them because I choose to stay out of trouble. The thing about me is that when I’m nice to someone, it’s truly genuine and I just want a solid friendship group, whereas most people are only nice to me or only tend to keep me around when I’m useful to them. I’ve noticed this. I get sad when I think about this, because the more I think about it, I realise it’s true and that I’m lonely and I just come to terms with it. Nowadays, even at school, most of my friends only hang out with me when they have no one else, &amp; I’ve noticed this also. So I mostly hang out by myself now and I enjoy my own company. 
I have found it extremely hard to trust people, to make friends or to socialise and I tend to get anxious in large social settings. 
I have also become more vigilant and cautious &amp; I consistently remind myself to always choose my friends wisely.

After school, I either go on long walks in different places or get on any bus and go on 2hr long bus rides to random places &amp; I just sit and listen to music while staring out the windows, just thinking about life. I do this everyday after school. This helps me in a way lol. I’ve been wanting to go to therapy, but it’s quite pricey. I just want somebody to talk to, someone other than my mum. The thing is no matter how much pain I’m in, I always try my best to not show it to my family. Especially my siblings. I put on a huge smile and try to make them laugh &amp; to just stay positive and to not let them see me sad.
 
There were times where I thought of just ending it. I just sit and ask myself what’s even here for me? There is nothing keeping me here anymore so why stay? Me being bullied and tormented has completely ruined my confidence and self esteem. I just can’t take it anymore. But then again, I think about family. Especially my younger siblings. Imagining how they’d feel if their older sister wasn’t here anymore. I know it would break their heart, especially my youngest sister’s heart. 

I would talk to my mum but she wouldn’t understand.

I’m still a teen. I don't know what to do anymore.",2022-08-31 22:06:13,lonely,t5_2qjny,,7,/r/lonely/comments/x2q3rl/im_slowly_giving_up_with_life_and_idk_what_to_do/,,0,12,"I’m slowly giving up with life, and Idk what to do…"
6202,x2q76f,Quagmire1912,"I just can't wrap my head around it. I'm reading all these things, like go out and talk to people, find online friends, try dating apps, etc. but I just can't imagine doing any of that. Socializing feels alien to me. It's just something I can't do. Not anymore at least.

I've tried chatting with people online but I just.. don't know what to do. I freeze up. I read the message and I'm like, now what? It's easier for me to abandon the convo instead of coming up with an answer. I just can't imagine building a connection.

Same goes for real life. I've been on my current school for 3 years, about to go into 4th, and I have not made a single friend. I can't even remember the names of my classmates even though there is like 10 of us. I could've talked to them at any point, but I got no idea how to do that. I'm too scared to do that.

I'm great at closing myself down and preventing anyone from getting to know me. I've completely emotionally deteoriated over the last couple of years and I can't see myself recovering. I'm too comfortable pushing people away and keeping everything to myself. 

Maybe I just don't care enough to make a connection. I'm just hoping everyday that someone just falls from the sky and becomes my friend, but that's not going to happen. I'm the only thing preventing myself from being happy, and I don't know what to do.

I know nothing is going to change. I'm not going to change. I guess I'm just not built to love and I just got to accept that.

I know that even after writing this I'm still going to be exactly the same. I'll do the exact same thing I do everyday. I'm putting all these thoughts out, I'm admiting to myself what the problem is, but I know I'll never do anything about it.

she may even be more lonely than you, woman are only valuable if shes fuckable. so please before you comment, think. this isn’t a competition to see whose the loneliness, its a place to vent, seek advice etc

can we move on from sexism (either side of it) and just try to make friends :(

6206,x2qqdo,fake_friends_please,"So, my chem professor this semester has random partners for lab.  I was scared about it, but it didn't go too bad. I got a fine choice, a girl who apparently has been in my other 2 chem classes (upon hearing it, I kinda remember her. She's pretty tall, prolly 6 ' or close to it, and I remember there being a pretty tall girl in those classes) . But yeah, good partner. Careful, attentive, patient, nice.

&amp;#x200B;

But I somehow feel lonelier having done the lab with her, though. Like, things went well, we talked. It should feel fine. But I guess it's just how fast it was over that has me down. Like, if I was worth the time to her, she could've asked for help on the lab r something. Idk, it's just weird for me. To spend 3 hours getting to know someone more intimately than I'd like, and then it's all just gone. Like, what did I even try for? Did it matter?

&amp;#x200B;

If i's like this every time, I'm in for quite a rough ride, I think. Right know, it feels like a rejection, kinda. Like she tacitly said I'm not worth her continuing to get to know. Having that feeling every week is gonna suck.

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, I did think she was cute (I really like tall girls especially) , but I was able to just see her as a normal person instead of a potential partner like my desperation normally makes me.  Which is great, cuz I'm ridiculously flustered around people I see as potential partners. Same thing happened with another girl I had a crush on last semester (that died down with space + the knowledge that she has a boyfriend, so maybe that explains this particular case) . Idk, maybe the new drug I got isn't just curbing social anxiety, but also desperation? It's weird to not constantly be wondering what every woman I look at thinks of me, there's so much more space in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

And on another another note, my temp lab partner mentioned she's 19. Which hurt, cuz I'm 23. I'm a pretty late bloomer. Like, I should have shit figured out, but nah, this person 4 years younger than me is already a better person than me. It reminded me that it's not ok for me to be what I am as old as I am, and that no one who's close to me in age would want to have to deal with my 17-year-old-ish problems. She wouldn't have at 19, and how much less a 23 year old. It feels isolating,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh. I don't like feeling these things. I shouldn't have to. I was fine as a kid, and then I got fucked over by religion and bad luck as a teen. Now I'm too far behind to ever catch up, I fear. All I would need is one goddamn relationship, but they don't exactly sit on a silver platter waiting for you to take them. It's not up to me whether I get one or not; I like (or at least can convince myself that I like) damn near anyone, so the way I feel about someone doesn't fucking matter. I just need someone who likes me. But there's complete dickall to like, apparently. I mean, if there was something likable about me, or if I was attractive in some way in other words, I would've attracted someone by now.

I had a dream. I walked into a room, and I said hello to everyone. It felt like I was missing something. I turned around, and I saw you. We waved to each other and our hands were a little too close. You grabbed mine, our fingers interlocked. And then we let go.


I thought I saw something in me, that day. When I was alone, before I was lonely, before I stumbled, tripped, fell, lost my footing as the way to you became unclear. I thought I saw something until you made it so clear.

Either way, i’m in my last year of college and I’ve really been struggling with loneliness and depression, and it’s only exacerbated by seeing everybody else enjoying life. 

I see a lot of guys on here wanting female attention and a girlfriend which is completely understandable. Personally I really want a boyfriend but that seems almost impossible. I just feel kind of intimidated by everyone, and I don’t know how to approach people even if it’s just for a friendship.

making friends with women as a guy, I can’t shake the feeling that they are only acting nice towards me because they are scared of me/trying to placate me. 

It is a common sentiment I see expressed by women that they are afraid of men hurting them. so often if a man is making them uncomfortable, they will just endure negative behaviour out of fear of escalation. 

I understand why women would feel like this. but it makes platonic relationships with women difficult for me because I just feel the impulse to leave them alone no matter how friendly or enthusiastic they might be. I can’t take it at face value. often I will really like someone as a friend, but lose contact because I feel like they see me as inherently threatening because im a man.

I’m not complaining, but I would just like to know from any gender, if this is something that I could ask a friend about if I am unsure ? like ‘I feel like you are scared of me ?’ or should I just leave it up to them to tell me if I make them uncomfortable ?",2022-08-31 23:54:35,lonely,t5_2qjny,1644461565,1,/r/lonely/comments/x2skmg/question_about_mf_friendships_24m/,,0,0,question about m/f friendships (24m)
